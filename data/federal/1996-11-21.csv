2,Mr WILLIAMS,INTERNA TIONAL TRANSFER OF,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill provides a framework for Australia to participate in the international transfer of prisoners. The purpose of the bill is to enable Australians imprisoned overseas and foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to be returned to their home countries to complete the serving of their sentences. Increases in international air travel and criminal activity have resulted in a rise in the number of persons serving terms of imprisonment in foreign countries. Participation in international prisonAustralia's er transfers is important for Australia for both domestic and international reasons. There are sound humanitarian and rehabilitative grounds for international prisoner transfers. In addition, such transfers may result in practical benefits in terms of prison administration, as well as relieving some of the pressure on the consular services of Australian missions overseas. It is possible that Australian participation in international prisoner transfers may also result in financial savings for some participating states and territories if there is a net outflow of prisoners. From the international perspective, a large number of countries are very supportive of prisoner transfer schemes. In recent years, there has been growing pressure for Australia to participate, and Australia has been approached by various countries about this matter. Accordingly, participation in prisoner transfers will enhance and supplement Australia's relations with other countries. Apart from providing a framework for general transfer of prisoners, the bill will also enable persons who have been convicted by certain international war crimes tribunals to be transferred to Australia to serve their sentences. As honourable members will be aware, two international war crimes tribunals were established in 1993 and 1994 by the United Nations Security Council to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995 enables Australia to assist and comply with requests from the tribunals, including the arrest and surrender of accused persons to the tribunals, and other assistance such as the taking of evidence in Australia for tribunal purposes. Persons convicted by the tribunals are to serve their sentences in countries designated by the tribunals from a list of countries which have indicated to the Security Council their willingness to accept such prisoners. A number of countries have already agreed to accept tribunal prisoners, and the President of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal has sought advice as to Australia's willingness to do so. acceptance of tribunal prisoners will be subject to the qualification that the prisoners have a connection with Australia. The provisions in the bill enabling transfers from the tribunals will complement the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995. State-Territory cooperation Clearly, there has been a need to consult closely with the states and territories in the development of this bill. These consultations have taken place through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. As there are no federal prisons, incoming prisoners will need to be housed by prisons controlled by those states and territories which are going to participate in the transfer scheme. Many of the prisoners who will seek to take advantage of the proposed scheme to leave Australia will be serving sentences for state or territory offences. The participating states and territories will need to enact complementary legislation. Accordingly, the successful participation of Australia in international prisoner transfers will depend to a large measure on cooperation with the state and territory authorities. The states and territories are generally supportive of the scheme. At a recent Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meeting, the participating states and territories endorsed draft Commonwealth and model state-territory legislation. Details of bill As to the detailed content of the bill, it contains separate provisions for the two different types of prisoners. Parts 3 and 4 deal with general prisoner transfers between Australia and other countries. Part 5 deals with transfers to Australia of tribunal prisoners. Parts I, 2, 6 and 7 contain general provisions relating to both types of prisoners. The bill provides for all transfers to be considered on a case-by-case basis. General prisoner transfers I now mention some of the important features of the provisions dealing with general prisoner transfers between Australia and other countries. The bill is drafted in such a way that the transfer scheme is able to apply to all offences without exception. It covers persons who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty, and includes persons confined in connection with criminal conduct by reason of mental disorder and persons who have been released on parole. A significant requirement is that all transfers must be consensual, requiring the consent of the person to be transferred, the Australian government-Commonwealth and stateterritory where relevant-and the government of the other country. The bill contains certain prerequisites which must be satisfied before transfers can take place. These include: imprisonment under a final order, whereby neither the sentence of imprisonment nor the relevant conviction is subject to appeal; for transfers to Australia, the person is an Australian citizen or is permitted to travel to enter and remain in Australia indefinitely pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 and has community ties with a state or territory; dual criminality, whereby the acts or omissions constituting the relevant offence would, if the acts or omissions had occurred in Australia or the other country as appropriate, have constituted an offence in that country; and at least six months of the sentence is remaining to be served. In relation to these last two conditions, the Attorney-General has been given a discretion to waive these requirements in appropriate cases. Transfers of Tribunal prisoners I now tum to the provisions dealing with transfers of prisoners from the international war crimes tribunals. There are some differences from the general prisoner transfer scheme. These differences take account of the different nature and objectives of the transfer of tribunal prisoners. The intention is that a tribunal prisoner would not be transferred to Australia unless he or she has some connection with Australia and the Australian government has consented to the transfer. The main differences in relation to tribunal prisoners are that consent from the tribunal prisoner is not a mandatory requirement, and there are no explicit citizenship or migration requirements. On this point, I wish to draw to honourable members' attention that the bill provides that no decision affecting a person who is not an Australian citizen can be made unless the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs consents. Sentence enforcement A central issue in international prisoner transfers is the question as to how sentences imposed in other countries or the tribunals will be enforced in Australia following transfer. Part 6 of the bill addresses this matter. The bill sets out two different methods for enforcement in Australia of a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner or tribunal prisoner by a court or tribunal of a transfer country or by a tribunal. These methods are consistent with those set out in the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The bill provides that the Attorney-General may direct that the sentence of imprisonment be enforced on the transfer of the prisoner to Australia under the act: without any adaptation or with only such adaptation as is considered necessary to ensure consistency with Australian law-this is referred to as the continued enforcement method---or by substituting a different sentence, and this is referred as the converted enforcement method. While the bill provides for a choice between two different forms of sentence enforcement, the method actually adopted in a particular case will depend on the agreement with the country or the tribunal. For example, if a bilateral treaty with a particular country provides for only one method of sentence enforcement, that method would be used in relation to transfers from that country. Subject to any agreement to the contrary, I would envisage that Australia would generally use the continued enforcement method. This would involve being bound, so far as possible, by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the other country, such that a prisoner would bring with him, or her, the sentence from the sending country, minus any time served or remissions earned in the sending country, up to the date of the transfer. The bill contains a discretion for the Attorney-General to make any necessary adaptations to the sentence, although this is subject to the limitation that the sentence to be enforced under either method must not be harsher than the sentence originally imposed. From the date of transfer, the sentence would be generally subject to Australia's law concerning the enforcement of sentences. The approach adopted in the bill is to treat all incoming prisoners as federal prisoners for administrative convenience and sentence enforcement purposes. It is important to remember that this is not intended to affect the agreed financial obligations as between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The agreement reached in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is that the states and territories will pay the cost of maintaining incoming prisoners in prisonunless the prisoners have community ties with territories for which the Commonwealth is responsible. Application of the legislation and treaty negotiation This legislation alone will not be sufficient to enable prisoners to be transferred to and from Australia. As I have already mentioned, to complementary legislation will need to be enacted by the participating states and territories. In addition, a number of administrative steps will need to be taken-for example, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has agreed that it may be appropriate to have arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, defining the relationship between, and the responsibilities of, the Commonwealth and the states and territories in administering the scheme. The bill contains a provision enabling such arrangements to be made. A further requirement is for transfer arrangements to be entered into with other countries. The basis of the bill is that prisoners---other than tribunal prisoners-can only be transferred between Australia and 'transfer countries'. The bill contains a mechanism by which the act is to be applied to transfer countries. This involves the making of regulations, which may be based on treaty or nontreaty arrangements with other countries. A number of countries have already concluded bilateral prisoner transfer treaties. I am advised that some 27 countries are parties to the Council of Europe Convention and that there are also six countries participating in the Commonwealth scheme for the transfer of convicted offenders. Due to cost-effectiveness and scope, it is intended that Australia seek to become party to and implement existing multilateral arrangements such as the Council of Europe Convention and the Commonwealth scheme, and that bilateral treaties be negotiated only with countries which are not parties to a multilateral arrangement to which Australia becomes party, and/or whose preference is for a bilateral treaty or arrangement. Financial impact The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue in the short term. Expenses in relation to transfers to Australia will generally be borne by the participating states and territories. In addition, the bill contains a clause enabling the recovery of the costs and expenses incurred in transferring prisoners. Under the agreement reached in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Commonwealth's costs in relation to general prisoner transfers will include costs of negotiating participation in any appropriate multilateral schemes, bilateral treaties or other transfer arrangements, and the administration of receiving and making requests to other countries. The costs for the states and territories will include sending escort officers, returning prisoners-including airfares-and the cost of maintaining prisoners during the terms of sentences in Australia. The cost arrangements will be different in relation to transfers of tribunal prisoners, since that responsibility arises from international relations and Australia's membership of the United Nations. The Commonwealth will be responsible for the costs associated with transfers from the tribunals. The cost implications are however not expected to be significant in relation to tribunal prisoners. In relation to general prisoner transfers, there may be significant cost savings to the states and territories if there is a net outflow of prisoners. It is difficult to predict the number of prisoners likely to be moved in and out of Australia once the scheme is operating and, of course, any financial savings will depend upon the actual number of transfers. The cost implications are therefore unable to be precisely quantified at this stage, but will be examined as part of the agreed evaluation strategy. This will entail a review of the legislation after the scheme has been in place for a period of 12 months to determine the extent to which it has been utilised and to assess the resource implications. The bill is based on strong humanitarian and social considerations, and is the outcome of a cooperative, lengthy and detailed consultation process with the states and territories. I believe the bill will bring significant advantages at both the domestic and international levels. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. Reference to Committee Motion (by Mr Williams) agreed to: That: (1) the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996 be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration and an advisory report to the House by 3 March 1997; and (2) the terms of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with standing and sessional orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders.

3,Mr MILES,FINANCIAL LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.47 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 forms part of a package of two bills which are being introduced today to make amendments to insurance, banking and superannuation legislation. General The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 is an omnibus bill that amends 13 separate acts, and repeals one act. The most significant features of this bill are the provisions that enable the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to adopt 'international best practice' in relation to the information sharing provisions of the legislation they administer, thereby improving the prudential supervision of banks, superannuation funds and insurers. The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes a number of technical amendments to insurance and banking legislation, some of which I will outline below. Enhanced information sharing The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 will liberalise the information sharing provisions of legislation administered by the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The amendments will improve protection of bank depositors and insurance policyholders by enabling the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to move quickly to exchange information to prevent and/or manage a crisis situation arising in a financial conglomerate in Australia. This will enable more effective supervision of conglomerates whose constituent institutions are supervised by different agencies-for example, bank, life office, public offer superannuation fund operating under a single corporate banner. Currently, around 70 per cent of financial system assets are controlled by the 25 largest conglomerates. Rapid exchange of information between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, Reserve Bank of Australia and overseas financial sector supervisory-regulatory authorities is a key prudential tool in an increasingly globalised financial sector. The proposed information sharing amendments are consistent with international 'best practice' in extension. financial regulation. Both the heads of government of the G7 countries and the Joint - orum on Financial Conglomerates-an International body comprising representatives of bank, insurance and securities supervisors-stress the importance of information sharing between supervisors of the various entities that make up transnational financial conglomerates. Administrative arrangements will ensure commercial-in-confidence information is suitably protected by way of agreements with dome-tic and overseas supervisory-regulatory agenCIes. In line with government policy, som- of the provisions relating to information sharIng are subject to a five-year sunset clause. Technical amendments to insurance and banking legislation The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes a number of amendments to insurance and banking legislation. This bill - akes amendments to the Financial CorporatIOns (Transfer of Liabilities) Act 1993 to extend by two years the deadline by which foreign bank subsidiaries or money market corporations can apply for, and convert to, branch banking status and qualify for the concessional taxation and other treatment provided for under the act. The amendment is necessary because the government decided that it is not reasonable to expect foreign banks to make long-term strategic decisions about whether to convert to branch status whilst the Wallis inquiry into the financial system is in progress, and before its outcomes and changes flowing from it are known. This bill also makes amendments to the Insurance Act 1973 that will improve the supervision of insurance companies through the introduction of a new part IVA into the act that improves the approval process for related body assets. These amendments, which are strongly supported by the industry, enable the prudential controls of the Insurance Act 1973 to be extended to companies related to an insurer where the related company and the insurer seek the approval of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner for such an This will enable insurers to include a larger range of investments as assets for the purposes of meeting the solvency test under the Insurance Act 1973, without compromising the integrity of the supervisory regime. This - ew approval process will operate prospectIvely so that existing approvals will be unaffected by the new regime. It is expected that the extension of supervisory controls to related body assets will only be used on a case-by-case basis where necessary, and they do not apply to assets in prudentially supervised institutions such as banks, life offices, building societies and credit unions. In addition, the amendments will enhance the security of insurance policyholder interests by removing certain regulatory decisions from review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AA T. This will prevent insolvent or near insolvent companies from using the AAT appeal process to defer the application of regulatory directions designed to protect the interests of existing policyholders, such as orders to freeze assets or cease trading. This exemption from AA T review is consistent with similar exemptions contained in prudential legislation covering the superannuation sector. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission's regulatory powers in this regard will be checked by the need for the commissioner to obtain ministerial consent for decisions that are non-reviewable by the AA T. In addition, exemption from AA T review will be subject to a five-year sunset clause. The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes minor adjustments to the balance of the respective interests of consumers and insurers under insurance contracts, removes drafting errors and technical difficulties in existing legislation and provides legislative backing to the industry based code of practice for the general insurance industry, and an industry based code of practice for insurance brokers. This bill also includes a number of technical amendments to existing legislation to make the wording of particular provisions more gender-neutral, updates provisions that create offences in line with the current practice and criminal law policy of the Attorney General's Department, deletes obsolete references to Papua New Guinea, and updates definitions by reference to the Corporations Law. I commend the Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned.

4,Mr MILES,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.55 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1996 forms part of a package of two bills which are being introduced today to make amendments to insurance, banking and superannuation legislation. This bill will increase the statutory upper limit of the annual supervisory levy paid by Australia's 166 general insurers. The statutory upper limit is the maximum level at which the general insurance supervisory levy can be set. It is distinct from the actual levy, which is set by regulation taking into account the actual costs incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in prudential supervision. The statutory upper limit is indexed in line with the consumer price index. The levy is designed to recover costs incurred in the prudential supervision of the general insurance industry. The levy is applied uniformly, except for seven small insurers, small cooperatives writing specific cover for their members, who pay a significantly reduced levy--currently $2,500-in recognition of the lower costs involved in their supervision. The determination of the actual levy in the past has not reflected full cost recovery; it has been based, to a greater degree, on the direct cost of supervision and has not included the full attribution of overheads. The increase in the statutory upper limit of the levy will enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to more fully recover costs incurred in the supervision and prudential regulation of the general insurance industry. Changes in the actual levy are implemented by regulation and can be disallowed by the parliament. I commend the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1996 to the House and present an explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned.

Principal Act means the Workplace Relations Act. special consent provisions has the meaning given by item 42A. termination time, in relation to special consent provisions, means the end of the period that is specified in the award under section 147 of the Principal Act. 42 Exercise of Commission's powers under this Part In exercising its powers under this Part, the Commission is to have regard to the desirability of assisting parties to awards to agree on appropriate variations to their awards, rather than have parts of awards cease to have effect under item 44 at the end of the interim period. 42A Special consent provisions For the purposes of this Part, special consent provisions are provisions of an award that give effect to a decision of the Commission that is expressed to be made in accordance with one or more of the following principles: (a) the Enterprise Bargaining Principle adopted by the Commission in the National Wage Case decision of October 1991 (Dec 1150/91, Print K0300); (b) the Enterprise Awards Principle adopted by the Commission in its Review of the Wage Fixing Principles decision of October 1993 (Dec 1300/93, Print K9700); (c) Principle 2.2 (Consent Award or Award Variation to Give Effect to an Enterprise Agreement), adopted by the Commission in its Review of the Wage Fixing Principles decision of August 1994 (Dec 1408/94, Print L4700) and incorporated without amendment in wages principles established by the Commission in its Safety Net Adjustment & Section 150A Review decision of October 1995 (Dec 2120/95, Print M5600). 43 Variation of awards during the interim period (l) If one or more of the parties to an award apply to the Commission for a variation of the award under this item, the Commission may, during the interim period, vary the award so that it only deals with allowable award matters. (lA) For the purposes of this item, an exceptional matters order is taken to relate wholly to allowable award matters. (1B) Special consent provisions cannot be varied under this item before the termination time for those provisions. (2) The Commission may only deal with the application by arbitration if it is satisfied that the applicant or applicants have made reasonable attempts to reach agreement with the other parties to the award about how the award should be varied and the treatment of matters that are not allowable award matters. (3) If: (a) the award provides for rates of pay that, in the opinion of the Commission: (i) are not operating as minimum rates; or (ii) were made on the basis that they were not intended to operate as minimum rates; and (b) the application under this item seeks to have such rates of pay varied so that they are expressed as minimum rates of pay; the Commission may vary the award so that it provides for minimum rates of pay consistent with sections 88A and 88B of the Principal Act and the limitation on the Commission's power in subsection 89A(3) of that Act. (4) If the Commission varies the award under subitem (3), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation, unless the Commission considers that it would be in the public interest not to include such provisions. (5) The Commission must, if it considers it appropriate, review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria: (a) it does not include matters of detail or process that are more appropriately dealt with by agreement at the workplace or enterprise level; (b) it does not prescribe work practices or procedures that restrict or hinder the efficient performance of work; (c) it does not contain provisions that have the effect of restricting or hindering productivity, having regard to fairness to employees. (6) The Commission must also review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria: (a) where appropriate, it contains facilitative provisions that allow agreement at the workplace or enterprise level, between employers and employees (including individual employees), on how the award provisions are to apply; (aa) where appropriate, it contains provisions enabling the employment of regular part-time employees; (b) it is expressed in plain English and is easy to understand in both structure and content; (c) it does not contain provisions that are obsolete or that need updating; (d) where appropriate, it provides support to training arrangements through appropriate trainee wages and a supported wage system for people with disabilities; (e) it does not contain provisions that discriminate against an employee because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. (7) If the Commission determines that the award does not meet the criteria set out in subitem (5) or (6), the Commission may take whatever steps it considers appropriate to facilitate the variation of the award so that it does meet those criteria. 44 Parts of awards cease to have effect at the end of the interim period (1) At the end of the interim period, each award ceases to have effect to the extent that it provides for matters other than allowable award matters. (2) For the purposes of this item, an exceptional matters order is taken to relate wholly to allowable award matters. (3) For the purposes of this item, an award that is made under subsection 170MX(3) of the Principal Act is taken to provide wholly for allowable award matters. (4) If the termination time for special consent provisions is after the end of the interim period, then this item and item 45 apply to the special consent provisions as if a reference to the end of the interim period were instead a reference to the termination time. 45 Variation of awards after the end of the interim period (l) As soon as practicable after the end of the interim period, the Commission must review each award: (a) that is in force; and (b) that the Commission is satisfied has been affected by item 44. (2) The Commission must vary the award to remove provisions that ceased to have effect under item 44. (3) When varying the award under subitem (2), the Commission may also vary the award so that, in relation to an allowable award matter, the award is expressed in a way that reasonably represents the entitlements of employees in respect of that matter as provided in the award as in force immediately before the end of the interim period. (4) If, immediately before the end of the interim period, the award provided for rates of pay that, in the opinion of the Commission: (a) were not operating as minimum rates of pay; or (b) were made on the basis that they were not intended to operate as minimum rates; the Commission may vary the award so that it provides for minimum rates of pay consistent with sections 88A and 88B of the Principal Act and the limitation on the Commission's power in subsection 89A(3) of that Act. (5) If the Commission varies the award under subitem (4), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation, unless the Commission considers that it would be in the public interest not to include such provisions. (6) The Commission must, if it considers it appropriate, review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria: (a) it does not include matters of detail or process that are more appropriately dealt with by agreement at the workplace or enterprise level; (b) it does not prescribe work practices or procedures that restrict or hinder the efficient performance of work; (c) it does not contain provisions that have the effect of restricting or hindering productivity, having regard to fairness to employees. (7) The Commission must also review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria: (a) where appropriate, it contains facilitative provisions that allow agreement at the workplace or enterprise level, between employers and employees (including individual employees), on how the award provisions are to apply; (aa) where appropriate, it contains provisions enabling the employment of regular part-time employees; (b) it is expressed in plain English and is easy to understand in both structure and content; (c) it does not contain provisions that are obsolete or that need updating; (d) where appropriate, it provides support to training arrangements through appropriate trainee wages and a supported wage system for people with disabilities; (e) it does not contain provisions that discriminate against an employee because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. (8) If the Commission determines that the award does not meet the criteria set out in subitem (6) or (7), the Commission may take whatever steps it considers appropriate to facilitate the variation of the award so that it does meet those criteria. 45A Corporations not bound by State awards (I) If: (a) a constitutional corporation is bound by an award in respect of an employee; and (b) the award is varied under subitem 43(1) or wholly or partly ceases to have effect because of item 44; and (c) as a result of the award being varied, or ceasing to have effect, as mentioned in paragraph (b), the corporation would (apart from this item) become bound by a State award in respect of the employee; then the corporation is not bound by the State award in relation to the employee unless it becomes bound as a result of an application by the corporation to the relevant State industrial authority. (2) Subitem (I) does not operate so that a State award, or part of a State award, prevails over an award of the Commission. 46 Matters to be dealt with by Full Bench (1) After the commencement of this Part, a Full Bench may establish principles about varying awards under this Part. (2) After such principles (if any) have been established, the power of the Commission to vary an award under this Part is exercisable only by a Full Bench unless the contents of the award: (a) give effect to determinations of a Full Bench under this Part; or (b) are consistent with principles established by a Full Bench under this item. 47 Certain provisions not discriminatory (1) A provision of an award does not discriminate against an employee for the purposes of paragraph 43(6)(e) or 45(7)(e) merely because: (a) it provides for a junior rate of pay; or (b) it discriminates, in respect of particular employment, on the basis of the inherent requirements of that employment; or (c) it discriminates, in respect of employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the teachings or beliefs of a particular religion or creed: (i) on the basis of those teachings or beliefs; and (ii) in good faith. (2) Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to a decision or determination made by the Commission under this Part more than 3 years after 22 June 1997, except where the Commission decides, on a case-by-case basis, that the paragraph should apply. Decisions by the Commission as to whether the paragraph should apply must be made by the Commission in accordance with principles established by a Full Bench. 48 Transitional-repeal of subsection 111(1A) The repeal of subsection 111(1A) of the Principal Act does not apply to any proceedings before the Commission that commenced before the commencement of the repeal.

Note: The Supported Wage System was endorsed by the Commission in the Full Bench decision dated 10 October 1994 (print L5723). 170XC Special cas-mployee undertaking approved traineeship (1) If an agreement provides for the payment of wages to an employee undertaking an approved traineeship at a rate that is not less than the appropriate percentage of the rate (benchmark rate) that would be applicable to the employee under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be) if: (a) that award applied to him or her; and (b) he or she were not undertaking the traineeship; the approval or certification of the agreement is not to be taken to result in a reduction of the employee's wages. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the appropriate percentage of the benchmark rate is such percentage of that rate as is determined in writing by the approving authority having regard to the reduction in the productive time of an employee undertaking the approved traineeship due to time spent in training. (3) If the agreement adopts, as the qualification for a wage level, a criterion determined by the approving authority instead of the criterion applying under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be), that award is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have effect as if the criterion determined by the approving authority were substituted for the lastmentioned criterion. 170XD Special cas-mployee undertaking approved apprenticeship (1) This section applies if: (a) an agreement provides for the payment of wages to an employee undertaking an approved apprenticeship in a particular trade, occupation or kind of work; and (b) there is a relevant award or designated award regulating the payment of wages to employees undertaking an apprenticeship (benchmark apprenticeship) in the same trade, occupation or kind of work. (2) The approval or certification of the agreement is to be taken to result in a reduction of the employee's wages only if the agreement provides for the payment of wages to employees undertaking the approved apprenticeship at a rate that is less than the rate applicable under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be) to employees undertaking the benchmark apprenticeship adjusted (if necessary) as provided in subsection (3). (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the rate that is applicable to an employee undertaking the benchmark apprenticeship is to be adjusted to take into account the proportionate difference, as detennined by the approving authority, between the productive time of an employee under the approved apprenticeship and the productive time of an employee under the benchmark apprenticeship. (4) If the agreement adopts, as the qualification for a wage level, a criterion determined by the approving authority instead of the criterion applying under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be), that award is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have effect as if the criterion determined by the approving authority were substituted for the lastmentioned criterion. 170XE Determination of designated award or awards for the purposes of an AWA (1) If: (a) an employer proposes to make an AW A with a person; and (b) there is no relevant award in relation to the person; the employer must apply in writing to the Employment Advocate for the making of a determination under subsection (2). (2) Upon application, the Employment Advocate must determine, and inform the employer in writing, that an award or awards (being an award or awards under this Act regulating terms or conditions of employment of employees engaged in the same kind of work as that of the person under the AW A) are appropriate for the purpose of deciding whether the agreement passes the no-disadvantage test. 170XF Determination of designated award or awards for the purposes of a certified agreement (1) If: (a) an employer or organisation of employees proposes to make a certified agreement; and (b) there is no relevant award in relation to some or all of the persons to whom the agreement will apply; the employer or organisation may apply in writing to the Commission for the making of a determination under subsection (2). (2) Upon application, the Commission must determine, and inform the employer or organisation in writing, that an award or awards (being an award or awards under this Act regulating terms or conditions of employment of persons engaged in the same kind of work as that of those persons under the agreement) are appropriate for the purpose of deciding whether the agreement passes the no-disadvantage test. 2 At the end of paragraphs 359(2)(a) to (e) Add ""and"". 3 After paragraph 359(2)(1) Insert: (fa) the delegation, by an approving authority that is a State or Territory training authority, of any of its functions and powers under Part VIE; and (147) Schedule 14, item 5, page 177 (after line 20), after subsection (2), insert: (2A) The Commission must hear and determine an application for an order under this section as quickly as practicable.

5,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill fulfils the promises made by the coalition in its election policy statement, Better Pay for Better Work. Before the 1993 election, the Australian Labor Party disguised its policy intentions and, after the election, betrayed the confidences of the Australian people. They legislated the most pro-union laws ever introduced into Australia. They did so at the insistence of the ACTU. The contrast with the coalition's legislation could not be more stark. The pre-election guarantee we gave workers was that we would keep awards and the Industrial Relations Commission and if you entered an agreement you would not be worse off than under the award. Today we make our guarantee the law and present a balanced system not dictated by some special interest group but a system fair for both employers and employees. Our new act is built on: commitments to a more direct relationship between employers and employees with a much reduced role for third party intervention; a fair go for all so that the system is appropriately balanced and delivers benefits for both employees and employers; genuine freedom of association and greater choice of union representation; a more accessible system; and a stronger sense of the rights and responsibilities of parties in the industrial relations system. The government remains committed to these principles. The bill, as amended, implements them. The task is now for employees and employers to use the opportunities the bill offers them. Under the legislation we have delivered what we said we would deliver. We have delivered an award system which will provide a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions with benefits beyond it generally being a matter for agreement at the enterprise or workplace level. We have delivered a system in which there will be more effective flexibility for parties in reaching agreements, a genuine choice of agreements, formal and informal, union and non-union, individual and collective. That is, we have put in place enabling legislation-legislation which is designed purposefully to avoid prescription and to enable employers and employees to find a home in the system which suits their particular needs. We do not favour one agreement stream over another. We do not want to corral employers and employees into one end of the system and boast that as a government we have achieved some remarkable success. We simply want to give them the general flexibility of the jurisdiction established by the legislation so that they can get what they want from the system. We have also formally introduced into the federal industrial relations system an individual agreement stream. This is a long overdue but profoundly significant change in emphasis in the jurisdiction. Not so long ago this would have seemed an inconceivable proposition at the Commonwealth level. It is an initiative that, for political reasons only, has been resisted by those on the other side of the House and by the trade union movement, but the needs of the modem workplace for simplicity, flexibility and closer direct relations between workers and their employers have won out. It is a new agreement stream which minimises third party intervention. It is designed, subject to a safety net, to get workers into jobs without delay, without conflict between award parties and without costly litigation. For many employers and employees Australian workplace agreements will symbolise that it is now safe to come back into the industrial relations system again. As a new option, Australian workplace agreements will change the character of the federal system. The system is no longer exclusively about registered organisations and collective bargaining; it is now about workers and employers and their particular and local needs. The bill's objects reinforce this, along with other amendments to the certified agreement and award streams which seek to emphasise the views of employers and their employees rather than those of tribunals and third parties. We have also delivered genuine freedom of association founded on effective protection against coercion or discrimination based on an individual's membership or non-membership of a union. Mr Speaker, I am delighted to say that today we abolished compulsory unionism. We have also delivered changes which will increase choice and accountability in relation to registered organisations. In making these changes, we invited regist-red organisations into the world of competihon and improved service delivery for their - embers. Legislated privilege and monopoly nghts have a dwindling relevance to modernity. Employers and employees will always have representational needs, and the bill embraces this concept firmly. But, equally, employers and employees deserve a quality return on the financial and personal trust that they place in organisations. For all their declining membership base, the government has given unions their last best chance to square themselves with workers. The bill is not anti-union, despite what some union leaders say. The bill provides unions with a shot at building their status as responsible organisations which provide a professional service geared to the contemporary workplace and the contemporary work force. We have delivered legislation which will ensure that appropriate standards of industrial conduct are observed. There will be a more effective regime to ensure that agreements are honoured. The commission's powers to curtail unlawful industrial action have been strengthened and secondary boycott provisions have been restored. (Extension of time granted) We have recognised the right to take industrial action. We have also ensured that both parties in the industrial system have proper regard for their responsibilities to one another and the wider community. We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous Brereton system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. This was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it. Under this government, harmonisation of federal and state systems of industrial relations is being pursued through complementary legislation and through a cooperative approach to administrative arrangements and service delivery. Again, the government is conscious of the need to gear industrial relations systems at all levels to the needs of the users. Industrial relations systems should not be characterised by institutionalisation of bureaucracy and undue process. Consistent with the forces affecting all areas of government at all levels, the system as a whole should be about delivering services to its users, ensuring their ease of access and providing quick and effective responses. This approach has affected many aspects of the bill, and it is an important force for future change. But it has had a more recent impact as well. This week the Victorian government moved legislatively to refer its powers over industrial relations to the Commonwealth. This sends a powerful message about the leadership of the Victorian government. It does, too, provide a vote of confidence in this government's vision of the workplace as embedded in this legislation. It is also an eminently practical decision which will ensure that businesses in Victoria will be able to consolidate their industrial relations strategies under the federal system and boost their efficiency as a result. Small and medium-sized businesses will be able to use federal arrangements for Australian workplace agreements or for collective agreements without the need for an award if that is their wish, and without the need to become embroiled in the jurisdictional and constitutional complexities which have dogged their quest for flexibility and productivity. This symbolises the capacity of governments to make real and substantial improvements in the way in which users interface with the industrial relations system. Similarly, the bill provides that employees and employers should have the right to choose whether they wish to be covered by an award or agreement in the state or the federal jurisdiction. The amendments to the provisions dealing with federal-state coverage maintain this principle. They continue to allow choice between federal awards and state employment agreements provided that the relevant state legislation contains certain protections for employees. In opening new options in the agreement stream in the changes to the role of organisations under the bill, in the harmonisation initiatives being undertaken by the government, in wearing down the borders between state and Commonwealth industrial relations jurisdictions, the government is demonstrating that the wider system can genuinely work for the benefit of its users-that is, that this industrial relations system can and should work in the context of modem standards of service delivery and best practice. The government also believes that the workplace relations system which its legislation establishes is appropriately balanced and delivers benefits for both employers and employees. We have had lengthy discussions with the Australian Democrats about the concerns they had in relation to some of the arrangements proposed by the government in its original bill. In these discussions there was a common respect for principle and a common commitment to making the legislation work for all Australians. I congratulate the Democrats on the cooperative and positive approach that they brought to this task, and thank them for the manner in which our discussions and negotiations were conducted. It is important to rebut the misrepresentation that the government's industrial relations policy is a low wage policy. The aim of the reforms is not to cut wages and conditions, but to promote higher productivity and a more flexible labour market and so provide the opportunity for higher wages and better conditions for workers. This, after all, was where the government staked its ground in its election policy statement, Better Pay for Better Work, which was so resoundingly affirmed by the Australian people on 2 March. The pressing need for genuine labour market reform to which this bill gives strong support is highlighted by Australia's dismal productivity performance over the last decade and a half. According to the OECD, between 1979 and 1995 Australia's annual rate of growth in labour productivity averaged a meagre 1.4 per cent. This was below the OECD average and far behind rates of productivity growth recorded in some of the dynamic economies to our north. These years of dismal productivity growth largely coincided with the era of centralised wage fixation. The pick-up in our productivity performance to the extent that we have had it in recent years with the introduction of enterprise bargaining, even on Labor's flawed model, goes to show the enormous potential gains which will flow from a genuine program of labour market reform such as ours. Only through genuine reform can we secure the productivity improvement that is necessary to underpin continued employment growth and a sustainable rise in living standards for all Australians. (E'Kfcnsion of time granted) In view of this, the award system will operate as a safety net of minimum wages and conditions. The detailed mechanism for its adjustment is being left within the jurisdiction of the commission. There arc a number of factors which the commissinn will he required to have regard to when it is adjusting the s;lfety net. These include a range ot economic considerations: productivity, inflation and unemployment. It will have to consider the needs of the low paid, equal pay and the need to prevent discriminatillO. The commission will also need to ensure that anv alteratiuns to v.:af!e relativities tween ;wards arc hascd llIl - kill, responsibility and the conditions under which work is performed. This requirement recognises the importance of rclati vi tics between awards for the viability or the award wage system in ensuring its capacity hoth to maintain the stability and equity of the system and to provide ongoing net protection. The government's kgislatilln does not extend, however, to internal relativities within awards. Indeed, the emphasis which we are proposing, and in particular the focus on the low paid and minimum safety net, may involve some compression of internal relativities. Such compression has occurred in the past when the commission has awarded flat dollar increases in award rates. In addition, while stahle relativities between awards arc important for the workability of the system and for their safety net role, the government anticipates that, over time, there will he increasing diversity in actual pay relationships as a result of the emphasis of the system on agreement making. Wages and conditions need to increasingly reflect local needs and circumstances. Similarly, in future, When maintaining the safety net, regard must be had hy the commission when altering wage relativities between awards to the skill, responsihility and the conditions under which work is perrormed. That is, the bill consigns to the deeper past still the notions of automatIC wage f1ow""oI1 between awards and comparative wage justice. The focusing of the award system on the provision of minimum terms and conditions of employment will apply to all awards, regardless of their customary status as either minimum rates or paid rates. All awards will be simplified. The same allowable matters and the same process and timing will apply. There will not be new paid rates awards. Over time, and following consultation between the parties, it is expected that existing paid rates structures will be phased out and translated into minimum rates arrangements under the supervision of the commission. Transitional provisions in the bill work to ensure that overall pay entitlements are not reduced as part of such conversion process. be- Wages and conditions beyond the minimum safety net will be a matter for the parties themselves to settle through enterprise and workplace agreements. In exceptional circumstances, there is provision for special case arbitration in certain critical dispute situations and in situations where paid rates awards have customarily applied. However, this is only where all efforts to reach an agreement have been exhausted and the exceptional nature of any fixed term arbitration undertaken in these circumstances is reflected in the conditions that apply, including consideration by a full bench of the public interest, how productivity might be improved and the conduct of the negotiating parties. In addition, any resultant award will not generally be able to be varied or to form part of the benchmark for the no disadvantage test for any subsequent bargaining. Strong incentives are maintained in the workplace relations framework generally to focus the system on agreement making rather than recourse to the commission. Even then, conciliation must be exhausted so that any arbitration other than general adjustments to the safety net will be a last resort confined to special and isolated cases. The expectation is that most parties who have been on paid rates awards will be covered by agreements. This is not new, as employees covered by paid rates awards have generally made the transition to enterprise bargaining so that their actual terms and conditions are now determined by agreements, rather than awards. Amendments to the bill also provide that award minima will act as the benchmark for the tests which are to apply to formalised agreements. In order to be formalised, all agreements will now be required to satisfy a modified version of the existing no disadvantage test. In the light of the move to the vetting of AW As provided for in the amendments agreed with the Democrats and against the background of the award simplification process, the government believes that the new no disadvantage test provides a practical way of delivering the government's commitments while affording considerable t1exibility to the parties. In this context, the legislation makes it clear that the no disadvantage test is a global one. That is, the test is whether an agreement would result in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employees to be covered. The government's intention is that, apart from this overall assessment, t1exibility not be constrained. Subject only to the global test, employers and employees are now at liberty to strike genuinely innovative agreements without any contrivances or artificial restrictions. It would be up to the Employment Advocate or the commission to weigh up the respective elements of the different components of a proposed agreement in deciding whether there was any disadvantage to employees in their overall terms and conditions of employment. Different sorts of considerations might be relevant in different contexts. As such, any term or condition of employment may be negotiated and dealt with by agreement, provided it is consistent with the act. The government's approach to the reform of workplace relations in Australia retains an important role for the commission, whose status and involvement will continue to be integral to the effective working of our system of workplace relations. (Extension of time granted) The commission's role will be different in a number of important respects under the new legislation as employers and employees increasingly take responsibility for their own industrial relations and agreement making and awards become a safety net of minimum wages and conditions. The commission will have a particular role in ensuring the establishment and maintenance of the award safety net, encouraging the making of certified agreements, overseeing the conduct of workplace bargaining for certified agreements and ensuring that the parties to such agreements and awards comply with their industrial responsibilities and obligations. It will have responsibility for managing the simplification for the award safety net and for encouraging the spread of and improved access to part-time work with pro rata conditions and reasonable predictability of working hours. The amendments to the bill do broaden the commission's role in several respects, but we have focused the commission's role, particularly and importantly for the benefit of the low paid. The government's submission to the commission, foreshadowed last weekend by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), is yet again evidence of our concern for the low paid, both in respect of the wages which they receive and their prospects of both retaining the jobs they have and for the unemployed securing a job in the future. Where the commission has a role in intervening beyond the minimum safety net of allowable award matters, the legislation ensures that this is appropriately circumscribed so that the focus of the system on agreement making at the enterprise and workplace levels is maintained. There are a number of criteria that will have to be met before the commission can make such orders. These are intended to ensure that the jurisdiction is confined to exceptional matters and that there is no reasonable prospect of their being settled by agreement. The exceptional matters orders include a requirement that they relate to a single matter and apply to only a single business unless the commission is satisfied that an application is appropriate. Such acceptable matters provisions cannot undermine the award simplification process, or the strong emphasis of the legislation on the role of awards as setting minimum wages and conditions overall, while actual wage determination is principally managed through formal or informal agreements made at the workplace level. I have often referred to the consultative process which began before the election last March and has led to the legislation which will be concluded today. It was a process which included employers, employer organisations, unions, the ACTU, governments-state and territory-women' s organisations and churches, and ethnic community and welfare groups. We have henefited considerably from their comments and suggestions-we have taken many on board-and the government is grateful for their effort and involvement. At the same time, some individual organisations and pcople who took part in that process do stand out in terms of the depth, consistency and strength of their ongoing contribution to the development of the hill. It is appropriate today that their names go on the record. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the contributions of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Bryan Noakes and Reg Hamilton provided very constructive and important support throughout the process. The ACTU were very involved through the committee on industrial legislation. I particularly acknowledge the work done by Tim Pallas and John Cairns in that respect. Our thanks go to the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Australian Retailers Association, the National Farmers Federation and the Labour Council of New South Wales, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Western Australian Chamher of Commerce and Industry, Mr Brendan Macarthy, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Michael Angwin, Professor Charles Mulvey, Paul Houlihan and Dr Chris Jessup QC. I am also grateful to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for continuing to provide us with consistently high quality legislative drafting against very short deadlines. I also thank the Department of Industrial Relations, which has throughout the process demonstrated its professionalism, capacity for auth?ritative technical advice and openness to l-novative approaches to policy and institutIonal reforms and for, ahove all, its singular ability to provide a quality service to the government of the day. I also particularly want to acknowledge the work done by my ministerial staff in the process prior to the election and throughout a very long eight months. To Peter Richards, my chief of staff; to Jonathan Hamberger, who worked for me once before as an adviser on industrial relations and who is a specialist par excellence in this field, and to Nick Hordern, who worked with me both as a policy adviser and as a media adviser all through the process-my special and grateful thanks. Thanks also go to my other ministerial staff who provided great support and worked many hours to see the successful conclusion of this bill. The task for the reformist is not over. The policy debate must go on. For business and for employers and employees the pressing task is to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the new laws. The government, in its role as an employer, needs to address its own human resources strategy. We also need to encourage better practices in key industries like the waterfront, construction and meat processing industries and other industries. I place on record my thanks to the Prime Minister and to my colleagues for the support that they have given me in this process. Lastly, I thank the Australian people for the confidence with which they trusted us to present this bill and to see its successful carriage today.",57
6,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I would like to commence in the tone that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) concluded-it might be the only thing about which we agree-and to thank some people for their contribution to the debate which led to us dealing with these amendments today. I particularly thank Senator Sherry and the Labor senators for their excellent and diligent work throughout a very complex process of dealing with these and many other amendments which were not successful in the Senate. I thank the clerks in the House and the Senate for their great assistance to the opposition in a very complex task of drafting, which they did very effectively and conscientiously. On behalf of all my Labor colleagues here and in the Senate, I thank David Fredericks for the work he did in assisting us in the drafting of these amendments and in the processing and management of them. The opposition recognises what is, for it, unpleasant political reality that these amenddisputes. ments mean that this flawed and unfair bill has been passed by the Senate with many of its worse features intact and its original critieven cisms still valid. Our original very lengthy. I made a half-hour speech, we moved 300 amendments and many of our ised colleagues spoke, so I will not repeat all that. But our concerns came down to three core principles. Our concerns were that this bill undermined the Industrial Relations CommisIndustrial sion, it undermined the award system and it undermined the rights of workers to organise. All these three concerns continue, slightly modified in some instances. But, even after these amendments, those concerns are still conditions. valid. The Industrial Relations Commission, example, has lost its general jurisdiction arbitrate to settle industrial disputes. The significance of that change to industrial relations in Australia and many aspects of economy and society in future is a remarkable thing which I think most Australians are not aware of. That has gone, despite the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the Industrial Relations Commission would keep its powers. For every worker working in Australia now, the award system, which has underpinned and been the vehicle for advancement of workers' wages and conditions for generations, has played some, if not the total, role in determinunder ing wages and working conditions. They are now stripped back as a result of these amendminister ments to 20 allowable matters rather than merely 18-but the balance still disappears 18 months. The clock has started ticking so many fundamental award conditions for Australian workers, despite the Minister's guarantee that no worker would lose their award conditions. The right to organise is still at risk, most particularly due to, simply summarised, the massive increases in penalties and punishwith ments and the easier access to these sanctions rather than the use of the conciliation and arbitration process to which Australians have become accustomed and which has been part of the cooperative process leading to, in an recent years, a record low level of industrial This is, unfortunately, already showing signs of increasing under the industrial relations management of this government, before we run into the problems that this criticisms were bill might generate. Of course, the strongest and the best organworkers will win their lost conditions back. Some already have a guarantee to that effect. But for others-those who need the award protections most, those who need the Relations Commission most, those who need the support of the collective organisations that represent them most-these provisions will be gone forever. Many workers, many workplaces, will be back to 20 basic Think of the circumstances in which the for workers find themselves when trying to to negotiate to win these conditions back. The person with whom they are negotiating knows that if no agreement is reached the conditions our disappear. There is no imperative on the employer to agree at all. Many reasonable employers will. But the point of it is that the fundamental protections that these awards provide are against the activities of unreasonable employers, and they are the ones who are empowered by this bill. So much for the rock solid guarantee that no worker would be worse off. Not that that should be a surprise, of course, because we have already established quite clearly that the government's submission to the Industrial Relations Commission, to which the referred in his speech, low paid workers will be $1,000 a year worse off than in they would have been under the proposals of for the previous Labor government. So much for the fact that no worker would be worse off. Prime (Extension of time granted) Where does that leave us after the passage of the workplace relations bill? It still leaves us with a fundamentally flawed bill. It still leaves us with an unfair bill. It still leaves us a bill that undermines the three pillars of Australian industrial relations which have protected Australian workers. It leaves us with the Prime Minister's promises to workers during the election campaign lying in a crumpled heap, just next to those from the budget and the other broken promises. Looking forward, where do we go to from here? Strenuous as our opposition to this bill continues to be, it will become the law quite soon. Despite our continuing opposition, that will occur. How are we to look forward to measure the success or failure of this bill? We have found people running away very hard from the idea of what criteria should be set to measure the success of this bill. We have had a few comments about what should not be used. Let me make some suggestions of criteria, apart from the Prime Minister's two promises that no worker would be worse off and no worker would lose their award conditions. What are other broader social and economic criteria? Will there be fewer industrial disputes over this three-year term under this regime than there were in the last three years under the old regime? Each time. I raise this, the media likes to interpret it as some sort of forecast industrial war. I am not predicting industrial Armageddon. The signs at the moment are not encouraging about what is going to happen in terms of the number of industrial disputes in Australia, but there is still time--even under this bill-for the government to adopt a cooperative approach that would not lead to a major increase in industrial disputes. The signs are not very optimistic, either about the current trends or about this bill, but let us wait and see and measure this bill against that criterion first. Perhaps more importantly, will there be more jobs created in this parliamentary term under this regime than there were in the last term of the parliament? Particularly, will there be more jobs created in small business? On the social criterion of fairness, will the distribution of wage outcomes and benefits be fairer after this bill than it was before it? Will the gap between high and low incomes narrow or widen? Will the gap between male and female incomes narrow or widen? The sign are not good, but let us see. We have had great emphasis on how this will boost productivity. Will labour productivity increase faster after this bill than the current trend rate of 1.75 per cent per annum? I think that is unlikely, but let us see. As to the broader economic objectives with regard to continuing growth, will the overall wage outcomes be more consistent with the low inflation, low interest rate environment than the outcomes under the present system? It may be that over time other criteria will be set. But it seems to me that is not a bad starting point against which to measure the success of this proposed new industrial relations regime. At least these criteria of success look for positive outcomes. I note that the minister has recently raised some criteria that are essentially negative-criteria that he will not use. For example, he said he would not be measuring the success of the legislation by simply counting the number of employees covered by AWAs. That is a bit of an irony, because we remember the same person constantly saying that enterprise flexibility agreements were clearly a failure because they had not been used in any significant numbers. It of is interesting to ask why the minister is retreating from applying the same standard to his new Australian workplace agreement stream, and we will look to see how many people take up these proposals. I also asked the minister previously in the parliament to give us an assurance, because of the great job benefits he sees in this bill, that the government will create more than 500,000 jobs in small business in this term. He has not yet given that assurance. We continue to seek it. We will monitor with interest the outcomes in that regard. I think it is highly unlikely that it is a goal that can be achieved; nevertheless, it is a very significant criterion for every Australian family, for every Australian unemployed worker, for all those in employment who are concerned about their employment security. (Extension of time granted) The principle concern is, at its core, even after these inadequate, unsatisfactory amendments, this is a bill which fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the labour market. It continues to be predicated on the assumption of equality of bargaining power in the workplace between employers and employees. That assumption is so fundamentally flawed-so obviously flawed to anyone who has been on a workplace floor for more than five minutes, or spoken to workers rather than spoken at them, who has listened to workers-that it is hard to believe that you could build an edifice on such a flawed structure. It is the fundamental flaws of that structure that permeate every element of this bill. It is what inevitably means, however one measures the intentions of those who initiated the bill or those who negotiated the amendments, that the outcome of this process must be fundamentally flawed and can be only an unfair outcome because of the absolute failure to recognise that aspect of the labour market and the need for elements of this legislation to cope with the consequences of that fundamental difference in bargaining power in the workplace. It is those problems and that circumstance that pervades this bill and means that it has the regressive social consequences about which we are so apprehensive without having the capacity to deliver the economic benefits which the government seeks. Secondly, looking prospectively, going beyond the immediate concerns, this bill absolutely fails to address, and by its inactivithe ty will exacerbate, the biggest issue in workplaces today. It is none of the things the minister has spoken about. When you go into workplaces and talk to workers, when you look at the surveys that the Department of Industrial Relations itself does-and I suspect when you look at the market research the Liberal Party does-the biggest issue for Australian workers today is the increased stress and insecurity in their workplaces. Workers say they are having to work harder, having to work longer and are feeling less secure because circumstances continue to change under their feet every day. They find themselves negotiating away conditions that they value to preserve living standards that they need. They feel that they cannot see in the future the security to which they have aspired. There is a significant emergence of bargaining fatigue. Even those who have done very well under enterprise bargaining-and that is not all-are flagging under the pressure of being called upon to do it again and again. Under this bill, they are called upon to enter into an extra round of enterprise bargaining merely to win back conditions that are currently guaranteed to them under their award. I can assure the House-particularly the government members-that I have not found a worker who is looking forward to a round of enterprise bargaining to win back their award conditions that the government has arbitrarily taken away from them by this legislation. The Democrats have conspired in having taken those away from them, with only the most meagre-but welcome-modifications. This bill fails to address the most profound issue affecting workers in their workplaces today-the issue of stress and insecurity. By its inadvertence and by its increased emphasis on the nature of the negotiations at the workplace, the increased need for enterprise bargaining and workplace bargaining, that insecurity and that stress will be increased. All the evidence from Victoria and Western Australia, where there has been increased emphasis in this way on individual contracts and on the nature of bargaining fundamentally underpinning Australian workplace agreements, has been that the stress, the insecurity, pressure and the working hours for workers under those agreements have gone up. That leads me to the third point about the future. This bill fundamentally ignores the emerging issue of working hours and the fair distribution of work in our society. With the changes being made, we are finding that working hours for those in work are going up while more and more Australians are either seeking work or seeking increased hours of work. (Extension of time granted) As with the minister, I will make sure this is my last extension. I thank the House for its agreement. As we are debating the amendments that the government has moved and the bill as a consequence, I might continue to talk about that. It might cause you concern but I might do so. There is a very serious issue emerging which all governments should be addressing and which people with social concern need to give consideration to and which the Labor Party in opposition will be developing policies about as a response and to put to the people. It i:; this issue of the fair distribution of work. the fact that those in work are working [(Inger hours while more and more Australian, arc either sccking work or seeking more homs or work. It is a profound issue, it is an impultunt issue. While this bill does nothing about it, all the trends measured in the response to individual workplace agreements of the type reflected in this legislation lead to increased working hours. The Western Australian experience makes thut clear. The Victorian experience makes thaI ,'!ce!1.

You would huve to say there is one achievement out of these amendments. They have enhanced the relative status of the Minister for Industrial Relations vis-a-vis the Treasurer and anything that sets back the Treasurer's political career has to have something going for it. Clearly, you can see the advantage to Mr Reith within the Liberal Party. It might have been smart politics but it is very bad industrial relations. That, I remind the minister, is actually his joh. I know his principle preoccupation is his position within the government ?ut his joh is to improve industrial relations III Australia and with this bill, even after these a-endmel1t- which do marginally improve the bIll that WCllt through the House, he still failed to de Ii vcr on that.

You W?uld have thought a rock solid guarantee might have heen a corc promise but, obviously, it was a non-core promise. You would have thought the commitment that no worker would lose their award conditions might have been a core promise but, obviously, it was a non-core promise. The opposition does not support accepting these amendments. While we recognise that they make the bill better than that which passed the House of Representatives, they do not go anywhere near far enough to improve this bill to make it an acceptable package for us. They leave us with a bill that is socially regressive, industrially disruptive and economically irrelevant. For those reasons, we will not be supporting the motion to accept these amendments and my colleagues will be seeking to support me in expressing the depth of our opposition to the bill which is emerging as a result of the Senate's amendments. Allotment of Time",62
7,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That the time allotted for the consideration of the Senate's amendments be until 11.15 a.m. this day. I have moved this motion because we have been unable to reach an agreement with the opposition about the handling of this bill. My proposition to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) was that we could accommodate some speakers, but we were not prepared to have the eight speakers a side that he wanted. This bill was talked out on the second reading in the House when we had 15 hours and 52 minutes. Dr Lawrence interjecting",66
8,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The member interjects 'no committee stage debate'. In fact, we had two hours and 32 minutes, including 17 speakers, which did not exclude the minister. In the Senate, the opposition parties ran a filibuster to gi ve us the second longest debate in the Senate in the history of parliamentary debate in the Senate. On top of that, we had a Senate committee process that went all around the country taking submissions. On top of that, when I put it to him that it was quite reasonable for people to make a contribution, but that we were not going to have a lengthy debate, his response was that he would like a gag. That means that all he wants to do is have another division to prevent his own people speaking. Whilst I know my few words will only provoke another outburst from him, it will demonstrate again that we try to have some sensible arrangement for the management of the House business and the opposition, sadly, I must say, takes a feral attitude to it. Mr Crean-What about Tuesday night?",66
9,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I do keep saying to the opposition that we were never as feral as this when we were in opposition to which they say, 'No, nothing's changed. We're just as bad an opposition as you were.' Actually, there is a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure report on the conduct of divisions, which takes out some very interesting figures on the number of divisions. In paragraph 4, it says: The number of divisions has also increased from an average of 2 per sitting over the period to 3.7 per sitting in 1996. So there is the evidence proof positive that they have virtually doubled the number of divisions this year. Going back to the figures which are inclusive to 1987, the opposition parties are now the all-time record holders. They are the all-time callers of divisions. They hold the all-time record. They hold the record for the sittings at which five or more divisions occurred over that period. They are nudging the record of sittings at which at least one division occurred as well. In terms of the number of divisions, those opposite have already got the record-that is, 177 as at the printing of this report. I will not say any more. I have taken only two or three minutes to make the point. Quite frankly, it is absolutely ridiculous that the opposition's tactics are simply denying its own people the opportunity to speak. We were quite happy, and as evidence we have set this for 11.15. We would have been happy to agree with you, which would have obviated the necessity for divisions. But, simply because you want to parade yourself as a potential leader-how aggressive you are in opposition and what a g:-at job you are doing as Manager of OppoSItIOn Business-for these infantile reasons, we are about to have a strong and forceful speech from the Manager of Opposition Business, who will announce to the world that democracy today has been trampled upon, that freedom of speech has been limited and that the government has been totally unreasonable.  down here asking the Manager of Opposition Business why it is his tactics are denying the member for Chifley the opportunity to speak. Well might the backbenchers on the opposition side ask such questions. That is the reason I have moved the motion. It will also provide, subject to the harassment tactics we now get from you, the opportunity for the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) to speak, who is the chairman of the government industrial relations committee. I just want to put now on the public record my thanks to the member for La Trobe. He has been a stalwart in the industrial relations debate in Australia for a long time. My time 1989-95 has now expired. (Time expired)",67
10,Mr CREAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Just very briefly, the only reason the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has got up today is he is posturing with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the chair. We have half the front-bench missing in action today. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is away. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) is away. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is buying a new pair of fish-nets. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is away. Who do we have at the table? The person who cannot ever help himself talking about leadership because it is what he aspires to. In the meantime, he wants the Minister for Foreign Affairs's position. He thinks he has solved industrial relations and wants the foreign affairs post. I suggested that to him and he said to me, 'You should be able to get some decent questions up against the foreign minister today,' and I said, 'Why don't you keep him in the House?' Let us have a bit of a discussion about private comment, leader of government business. We are not going to divide on this motion, but let me say this: the fact of the matter is that, for all of the bluster that the leader goes on with about the amount of time in this debate, he refuses to allow the detail to be debated in this House. He gagged through the committee stage when this hill was last in the House and he is now gagging the amendments coming back from the Senate. The reality is the devil is in the detail of this biil and he will avoid at any cost a consideration of the detail. That is why he is moving the gag. That is why he wants to stop members on this side of the House exposing that detail. That is why we believe this is just another example of the way in which this government is trying to hide the detail from the Australian public, to develop the means by which the hattlers of Australia get further repressed under their provisions. It is for that reason that, whilst we will not oppose it. we resist and demonstrate our opposition most strongly to the tactics that they have been implementing in this House. I now want the opportunity for more speakers on our side to get the measly half hour that he has allowed in terms of all of the debate that went on in the Senate-hours and hours of debate. He had 50 hours of negotiation with the picnic hamper and Cheryl Kernot, and he is allowing one half hour in this House. It is a disgrace and we oppose it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Consideration of Senate Message",67
11,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I want to'thank the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) for agreeing to the gag. This is absolutely unprecedented and delightful. Well done. Thank you, Simon. This is indeed an historic occasion. It has b.een some 10 years, perhaps 12 altogether, Sll1ce the initial divide in the industrial tions debate in this country. Members will recall that, for decade after decade, largely both sides of politics supported the centralised command driven model of industrial relations. Both sides of politics supported national wage cases. Both sides of politics supported a system where employers and employees were kept apart from each other in negotiations - bout their conditions of employment and mdeed about their wages. . It Was in 1984 that my side of politics fmally started to set a divide in the political debate in Australia. In setting that divide, increasingly, my side of politics has seen a need to move to a more modem and open system, to devolve industrial relations back to the parties where it really matters-that is, the parties at the individual work circumstance that happens to exist. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill we are discussing today goes a long way towards achieving that objective. It is another step in the train of devolution of responsibility from central arbitral bodies back to the central players, the real players-that is, the work force and the management in all the businesses around Australia. One of the things I noticed today as I looked at the Notice Paper is that it is 21 November 1996. I recall that it was on 21 April 1993 that the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, went to an Institute of Company Directors meeting in Melbourne and made two basic propositions. He said, firstly, that the award system was too complex, that it was too full of minutiae and that the awards ought to be simplified. He said that the awards should be brought down to basic core conditions as a safety net for conditions of employment in Australia. He did not say anything about having a single national minimum wage, like the United States. What he said was that awards should be simplified and brought back to core conditions. I have to say that this legislation now accomplishes what the then Prime Minister on 21 April 1993 said should happen. The second major point that Paul Keating relamade in that address to the Institute of Company Directors was that, where workplaces were largely non-unionised-and I have to say that is the bulk of workplaces in our country; certainly 75 per cent, and perhaps more, of the private sector workplaces in Australia are non-unionised-there should be an opportunity for those employees and their employers to negotiate agreements outside the formalised industrial relations system, leaving aside the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and leaving aside the formal arbitral process. But he also said that there should be some minimum standard set of conditions described by the award to underpin that. Literally, this legislation brings to fruition what the then Prime Minister, the then leader of the Labor Party-the party which now sits in opposition-wanted to accomplish. It seems to me an unbelievable dichotomy that the Labor Party sits there and argues hour after hour, point after point, against these basic propositions that its then leader, its Prime Minister, proposed to the nation. I recall that the present member for Kingsford-Smith, Laurie Brereton, wanted to implement what Paul Keating said should happen but Laurie Brereton was prevented by the union leaders from continuing down that path. We have picked up the option based on our policy differential, which we started in 1984 and which has continued since that day, to try to change the system, to make a more cooperati ve workplace culture, to make Australia more productive, to make our industry more efficient and to make more jobs for Australians. (Time expired)",68
12,Dr LAWRENCE,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I want to speak briefly this morning on a matter which I think has received far too little attention from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and indeed from the Democrats. I was most disappointed to see the Democrats in the Senate agreeing to conditions which will see the position of women in our society deteriorate. I know the minister blusters about this, because it is a point of great sensitivity, but there is now an enormous amount of evidence showing that women under many circumstances, even of enterprise bargaining, are the losers. They lose wages and they lose flexibility and hours. It is a matter that requires very considerable attention from the community because what is proposed in this legislation, and what will now be enacted, is a set of circumstances which makes the difficulties that women already face pale into insignificance. The government is fond of talking about their valuing of families. They have made much of the fact that in their view this legislation assists those people, mainly women, who have dual responsibilities-that is, not only in the workplace but at home. They talk about family friendly arrangements, but the evidence to date suggests that the opposite is occurring in this country and elsewhere. In New Zealand, for example, it is very clear that under these workplace agreements, which resemble what has been agreed with the Democrats here, women are the ones most likely to trade off hours, which makes it more difficult for them to meet family responsibilities. Unlike men in that community, it was found that women do not get any increased wage, so they are actually losing the flexibility and losing the hours. Mr Reith-This is not New Zealand.",69
13,Dr LAWRENCE,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Because of concerns about the trends that were evident in New Zealand and concerns amongst women here on our side of politics-including our minister of the day-that there might be some deterioration in women's positions under enterprise bargaining, and certainly under workplace agreements, a flexible working hours and women's project was undertaken under the Sex Discrimination Act. The work that was done there shows very clearly what has been shown elsewhere. In investigating the range of changes made to working time arrangements in enterprise agreements, the effects on women's lives of demands for increasing flexibility and hours were very clear. Women even now have been trading off hours and conditions in a way that is not true of men. That has a lot to do with the way women's work is constructed. They are more likely to be in non-unionised areas of work, they are more likely to work in isolation and they are less likely to have the protection of awards. In other words, they are already subject to the winds that you would now have blow over the entire Australian community. They find it very difficult in many cases to negotiate and to get the sorts of improvements that are supposed to flow from these individual agreements. For example, in Western Australia, where you have had workplace agreements now for some time, there has been some improvement in men's wages: they have traded them off against hours and other flexibility. But, in the case of women, they have traded off the hours, they have reduced flexibility and there is more shift work and weekend workwithout increases in pay. Women's wages in Western Australia are now well below the national average whereas men's wages are above it. In other words, the dispersion and the difference are growing under the sort of system that has now been embraced by the government and, I must say to my great disappointment, by the Democrats. The Democrats would have us believe that they are very sympathetic to women in our community. They make much of the fact that theirs is a largely female party, both in its representation and in its membership. Yet they have, by negotiation with the government, clearly delivered to the women of Australia a significant deterioration in working conditions. It is very clear that not only the work undertaken under the flexible working hours and women's project but also the 1995 report of the Industrial Relations Commission on enterprise bargaining, which was recently released after a long delay, show a large amount of information that confirms what I have been saying. Unfortunately, this report will now come out once every two yearsthat is a compromise, I suppose-instead of the three years that was proposed. What you see in these agreements is that women's hours of work are discussed-some 65 per cent of agreements and 74 per cent of private agreements in particular. And what are they doing? They are trading off flexibility. When you ask women what they want in the workplace they say that they would prefer predictability: they would prefer to work Monday to Friday, nine to five. Yet what is happening here is that they are being forced to work less predictable hours in areas where they are asked to work increasing hours, and they are not getting the wage increases right now. What is happeningMr Reith-You casualised them.",69

15,Mr TUCKEY,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (10.55 a.m.)Isn't it amazing to see the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) crying crocodile tears about women's issues. Women to her mean advancement of her political career. She has never had a serious and definite commitment to their welfare. What is more, considering her background, she wouldn't know, she wouldn't understand; she has never been in contact with the genuine working women of Australia. She comes in here and runs this sort of stuff after she has had a talk to a couple of her female mates, possibly in academia somewhere. I stand here as someone who, up until my entry to this parliament and still-through association with my children, who run our family businesses-actually delivers jobs to women, actually gives them the opportunity to bring their kids to work. You can go to one of these places and have a look at that tomorrow. We know what they want. They want the opportunity to get a job where they can set some hours flexibly, which is what this legislation will provide. That is what they want, and that is why they have deserted you. You did not learn the lesson in Lindsay. You went out there and ran your fear campaign-everyone would be working for $3 a day-and the people out there rejected you, because they saw that it was absolutely necessary for their convenience, for their interests and for the future of their children that our labour arrangements in Australia change. You heard President Clinton here yesterday. He came to us with a simple message: Australia is no island, and Australia cannot operate in the international labour markets by giving pay increases just because we want them. Whether we like it or not, that is stealing from our children. You kid yourselves that you can legislate wage increases when in fact the marketplace says, 'We'll pick up our capital goods. We'll go to another country.' You will leave the children of this great nation with nowhere to go. That is are already what you are talking about. You stand up here and talk about wages in they, other countries, and I know that they are extremely low. I also know that those people are extremely unproductive. It would take a lot for those on $3 a day to deliver the same outcome that some Australian worker will deliver on twelve bucks an hour. That is the reality. We can be competitive. But, unless that $12 has a direct relationship to productivity, nobody in Australia will be able to afford to pay it, because nobody will buy their goods at the end cost. We are past that point. If you read the papers today, there is our party trying to be a little more conservative on our international trade dealings in terms of protection, and the academics are out saying, 'Don't. Go for it.' You people did a wonderful thing for the working class. You are the ones-first under Whitlam, then under Keating-who chopped the hell out of protection and then told Australian employers to stick with the regulated labour market. What did they do? They said, 'Thank very much, we're leaving.' Unfortunately, you didn't have the law to nail their feet to the antiquated work practices and workshops-that is what you didn't haveand they left. Pick up your shirt. What has it got written on the back? 'Speedo. Made in China.' A great Australian name. That is what you have done. The purpose of this legislation is to re-establish the rights of Australian working people to be well paid for good work. If we do not do it, the world is going to laugh us out of existence. You can go on living in fairyland but, if you have some commitment to the children, any wage increase that is not tied to productivity is like your $80 billion borrowing: it is stealing from your kids. If workers get wage increases that cannot be justified by productivity, they are just further disadvantaging their own childrenand I think a very large number of the workers now know it. That is why the people in Lindsay told you to go bowl your hoop. If you do not wake up to that and to a few of the other fundamental issues, the present 40 members are going to be 20-we will not mind that. But, to tell you the truth, I would like your numbers to be closer to ours. I do not mind a decent fight. I am getting a bit fed up with beating you blokes by so many votes. Mr Martin-No, you are not.",70
16,Mr TUCKEY,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I waited a long time for it, Stephen. But the reality is that that is the message for you: wake up to yourselves; go out and sell what is common sense and in the interests of their children.",71
17,Mr MCCLELLAND,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"There is some inconsistency that appears in the government ranks. On the one hand, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is saying in question time that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will be the source of pay rises and higher living standards for Australian workers. On the other hand, the previous speaker, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), has been stressing the need for suppressing wages. He certainly stressed a very conservative approach to the consideration of wage rises. In any event, the reality is that since the 1980s every pay rise that a worker has obtained has been based on productivity. Indeed, a lot of the blue-collar assault on the Labor Party was their perception that every time they wanted a wage increase they had to sweat blood for it. The $8 pay increase that the government are talking about flowing on to some classes of wage earners would go to areas where the workers have not been able to achieve pay rises, mainly because the recessed state of the industry has not enabled them to bargain in the context of productivity improvements. It is, by and large, in those industries that have been substantially non-unionised where of productivity improvements have not occurred. In all other sectors a pay rise has to be based on specific productivity increases. I have been involved in countless numbers of cases where it has been very difficult to convince the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the required percentage of productivity improvements have occurred. It is quite wrong to say that wage rates today do not reflect productivity increases. The other area I want to focus on is the misnomer to suggest-as has been suggested in answer to questions-that unemployment will be solved because of stricter and tighter unfair dismissal provisions contained in the legislation. That just will not occur. The reality is that, as the annual report of the Industrial Relations Court indicates, fewer than two per cent of involuntary terminations come before the court as unfair dismissal cases. In terms of the impact that that safety net has-and this is a real safety net because it enables workers who have been unfairly dismissed to preserve not only their own interests but also those of their family-30 per cent of those unfairly dismissed and who have brought cases are over the age of 40. We know how increasingly difficult it is for them to obtain employment. Of the unfair dismissals, 42 per cent come from those whose wages fall between $20,000 and $35,000 a year. This is the classic battler wage group. They are going to be disadvantaged by not having access to the provisions. Also, 56 per cent of those workers are without post-school qualifications. The unfair dismissal provisions have been the actual safety net for the battlers, for those who have been downtrodden. The irony of this bill is that the tighter restrictions will probably mean that the unionised work force will have better unfair dismissal provisions because they will be able to rely on the general industrial dispute provisions, as has been demonstrated in the Vista Paper Products case, the Ranger Uranium case and the Boyne Smelter case. Where workplaces are unionised, they will be able to create industrial disputes-albeit they will have to escalate that to the stage of a 'critical dispute' under these provisions. But, ironically, it is those unionised work forces that will have access to better unfair dismissal provisions. It is the poor old non-unionised battler-to use the now cliched expression of the government-who will really be prejudiced by the removal of the unfair dismissal provisions. (Time expired)",71
18,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"l am delighted to participate in this very historic debate here today, even though it is only for a short while. However, it goes back to 1986 when the minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), the Hon. Neil Brown and I developed the embryo of the current industrial relations policy. I also acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith). He also participated in those early debates to develop a freer and more flexible industrial relations system. It is 10 years almost to the day that those original and very thoughtful ideas were put forward. I also pay tribute to the minister at the table for his contribution during that 10-year period when we argued with the then government. The proof of the success of our particular propositions in opposition is that the Labor government agreed with a more flexible enterprise agreement but, unfortunately, they could not get away from the shackles of the union movement. I also put on the public record the excellent work that the minister at the table did during the election campaign, where the Labor government did everything in their power to misrepresent what the opposition at that time were proposing. The minister got through the campaign, faithfully put our proposition and then has converted that to a legislative program that is here before the House on this very historic occasion. We see the situation where the enterprise agreements are now true enterprise agreements between the employer and the employee under the normal contractual arrangement, not by a third party, the Industrial Relations Commission, interfering with that sensitive and personal relationship between management and the work force. The minister has done an outstanding job in preparing the detailed schedule. I also put on the record the cooperation of the Australian Democrats in allowing the government to get a main plank of their election platform through the Senate. It has now returned to the House on this very historic occasion. We see the situation where the unfair dismissals law has been chucked out. Most members on the other side of the parliament would understand what a good thing that is. They understood it was not working and was causing them considerable difficulty. The Employment Advocate will make sure that those employees who want some assistance can get it. They will be able to use the services of the Employment Advocate to ensure that any agreement they reach with their employer is correct and reflects their aspirations in the workplace, and make sure that any employer does not victimise employees, as has been the allegation of the opposition at this stage. The 45D secondary boycott provision is another aspect that was removed by the Labor government in the hope that the industrial thuggery of the union movement could be used from time to time. Mr Martin-Tum it up. You don't believe that.",72
19,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"That is true, as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) would understand, even in his own electorate. I certainly understand it. I had a particular in the electorate of Robertson when the wool scourers were stood over by the union movement because of a demarcation dispute. This was an indictment of the union movement and industrial relations in Australia in the 1990s. That was an example we had in the last six months. It is no good the member for Cunningham suggesting that was not the case. I conclude by saying this is a very historic occasion for this parliament. We had the American President here yesterday and today we have the return of these amendments from the Senate. They will be passed by this House and they were passed by the Senate. This industrial relations legislation will be enshrined as a tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who put a great amount of effort into developing the general philosophy, assisted by the minister at the table and a number of us who supported both the Prime Minister and the minister in developing that framework. We have a very good legislative package which reflects that philosophical position. I am sure all workers in Australia and all managements will be much better off. The prosperity that will emanate from this Over the next 100 years will ensure that this historic piece of legislation forms an important part of the Howard government-(Time expired)",73
20,Ms MACKLIN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga) (11.11 a.m.)There is no question that the workplace relations act, when it is finally brought into play, will make the work environment much harder for women. The smirk from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) just makes it clear that he knows that, too. It is going to mean the expansion of individual contracts which will make things a lot harder for people in very disadvantaged positions. What it is going to mean is increased difficulty in accessing federal awards, despite our Victorian Premier's much publicised handover of his industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth. This legislation actually makes it much harder for workers in the private sector to access federal awards. I would say that this is particularly the case for women workers employed in small business, the place where case this government thinks this legislation is going to have such a great impact. It certainly will not have a great impact on the conditions of women working in those places where there is no award protection. For hairdressers and waitresses, and in all those places where women are working, there is going to be much less emphasis on award protection generally. Of course, in those places where we already have poor award protection it is only going to get a lot worse. The whole point of an award and safety net structure is to protect the vulnerable. We have heard a lot about that from the government talking about protecting the vulnerable. What this legislation does to the vulnerable is make their protection a lot less widespread. It is going to make the protection for women much more difficult. It is obviously going to reduce their safety net protection. We are going to have a lot more of the most vulnerable people hurt as a result of this legislation because it makes accessing award structures a lot more difficult. The safety net structures that previously existed for the low paid and semiskilled workers have been their only protection. That is going to be a lot worse now. We are seeing the continuing restructure of work and, as a result of this legislation, there will be more of an increase in the numbers of people working casually and part time. I would argue that this legislation simply lays Gambaro, T. the groundwork for increased exploitation of Georgiou, P. these workers. What this government says is Hanson, P. L. that it wants to increase the level of flexibility Hockey, J. B. for part-time workers, something that for Johnston, R. many women is very important. But what is Katter, R. C. going to happen as a result of this legislation Kelly, 1. M. is that flexibility will be entirely employer Lieberman, L. S. driven. It will be up to the employer to say Lloyd, 1.

NA (VICTORIA) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, on behalf of Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",74
23,Mr MILES,PAYMENT OF TAX RECEIPTS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.27 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will give legislative effect to an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth government with the state of Victoria to return windfall tax associated with the announced settlement of a long running dispute between the Victorian gas utilities, Gascor and Genvic and their gas suppliers, Esso and BHP. The dispute concerned the ability of the producers to pass on to the Victorian utilities the impact of the Commonwealth's petroleum resource rent tax, PRRT. The Commonwealth has long supported a negotiated settlement to the dispute as being in the best interest of both parties. The ment reached between the parties involves, among other issues, the Victorian government making a payment to the producers of just over $1 billion to resolve the dispute. A key element underpinning the agreement between the producers and the Victorian government was the understanding that windfall tax arising from the $1 billion would be paid to Victoria through a payment to Gascor. The settlement would not go ahead without this arrangement being put in place. The Australian Taxation Office has determined that the settlement payment made to the producers is subject to both company tax and PRRT. This will involve a payment to the Commonwealth of an amount of tax of around $625 million. The Commonwealth has determined that approximately $555 million of that amount reflects windfall tax. That is, approximately $70 million, representing tax payable on amounts previously unpaid by the gas utilities, but not relating to PRRT, will be tained by the Commonwealth and applied to the budget deficit. The genesis of this dispute dates back to the extension of the petroleum resource rent tax regime to the Bass Strait, through the enactment of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. The act provided that PRRT was to apply on profits recovered from the Bass Strait permit area on or after 1 July 1990, replacing the existing excise and royalty regime. It was expected that the change in taxation arrangements to one based on taxable profits from a petroleum project rather than on production levels would encourage increased activity in the area. This in fact proved to be the case. It was recognised at the time that the transition to a new taxation regime could cause changes to Victorian gas prices, with possible disruptive consequences for industry and domestic consumers. The then government provided the Victorian government with a special grant of $30 million for each of the first two years of application of the PRRT to minimise these transitional pressures. However, what was not known by the Commonwealth at the time was that clauses in long-term gas supply agreements between agreethe Victorian gas utilities and Esso-BHP would give rise to a dispute about the ability of the producers to pass on the impact of the PRRT to the utilities. This dispute has been the subject of arbitration over a number of years. It should be recognised that it has always been the intention that the PRRT should be a tax on above normal profits-that is, profits over and above project expenditure and a threshold rate of return-associated with offshore projects and should not necessarily flow through to gas prices. Given the unintended nature of the pass-on dispute, and in order to facilitate its settlement, the Commonwealth has indicated that it should not seek to benefit financially from this settlement. Hence this bill is intended to provide a mechanism to return the windfall tax flowing from the settlement. This should be seen as a fair and reasonable outcome for all parties. The short time frame for consideration of rethis issue by the parliament is unavoidable, given the sensitive nature of the complex negotiations. The settlement has been structured so that a simultaneous exchange of cheques between Gascor, Esso-BHP and Commonwealth will be made on the payment day. However, if the payment to Victoria is not able to be made on the contracted day, the Commonwealth has agreed to pay to Victoria an additional amount reflecting interest accruing up to the actual payment date. The agreement also puts in place a mechanism ensure that, should future events mean that the assessed tax payable on the settlement amount is changed, this will be reflected in a corresponding flow of funds between the parties. It is designed to ensure the Commonlong-term wealth would be no better or worse off under these circumstances. The resolution of this dispute in a manner acceptable to all parties is to be welcomed. Passage of this special appropriation bill will facilitate the settlement process. It is also expected that the resolution of this dispute regime? will facilitate the opening up of gas markets in Victoria to the benefit of gas consumers. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains an explanation of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.",75
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAYMENT OF TAX RECEIPTS,Is leave granted to continue the debate? Leave granted.,76
25,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAYMENT OF TAX RECEIPTS,"The opposition is prepared to cooperate with the government in ensuring the speedy passage of the Payment of Tax Receipts (Victoria) Bill which is, as has been said in the passed government's second reading speech, necesor not. sary to enable formal settlement to take place next week of the long-running dispute over the impact of the petroleum resource rent tax between the Victorian Bass Strait gas producaround ers, Esso-BHP and the Victorian gas utilities. As Minister for Resources and Energy when the old concept of RRT was first mooted, have to confess to a certain nostalgia about the kinds of issues that we are now dealing with today. When PRRT was applied to gas by the final Labor government in 1990, replacing the final existing excise and royalty regime, it was anticipated that a profit rather tion based tax would be a significant encourthe ager of new exploration and production activity, and such has proved to be the case. It was a very sensible policy initiative, manifestly. It was all very much to the advantage of Victorian consumers, both domestic and industrial, in particular the petrochemical industries which are crucial to the states and, to indeed, the national economy. Trouble, nonetheless, was lurking, we discovered rather swiftly, with the introduction of this regime in the form of a dispute over the meaning of certain clauses in the contracts which had existed between the producers and the utilities. The issue, as has been said, was whether producers could pass on to the utilities the impact of the PRRT: who had to bear the cost of the liability for the difference between the old royalty regime and the new resource rent tax It was always intended, as the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has just said-and I note that it is the parliamentary secretary and not the Treasurer (Mr Costello) here, but I understand he has he would need to have a pretty good excuse for not being here on a piece of legislation as important as this-that the PRRT be imposed in effect on abnormal and not borne by consumers. So the question has been where-not in the consumption end ,of the process-in the production and distribution chain the obligation to pay the tax actually lay, whether it could be on from the producers to the utilities That issue has now been effectively resolved by agreement of the Victorian government to pay on behalf of the utilities a sum of $1 billion to the producers to cover both past and future PRRT liability. While this only amounts to about a third of the I claim that has been made by the producers, which amounts to closer to $3 billion, the settlement clearly reflects the commercial judgment of both sides as to where the risk of outcome actually lay if the issue went to arbitration and litigation. Certainly the opposition does not seek to second-guess that than a producparticular judgment. The effect of BHP-Esso now receiving a $1 billion settlement from Victoria is to expose this amount to tax liability in RRT and company tax so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. An estimated $555 million of this has been agreed, as has been said, to be a windfall gain by the Commonwealth in the sense that this amount would not have been paid by anyone had it not been for this particular settlement. It certainly would not be payable at this time. The former Labor government, when in office, had anticipated in discussions with Victoria that such a windfall gain might accrue. We had agreed, in order specifically to encourage a settlement of this kind being reached, that any such windfall gain be in fact paid back to Victoria, subject, of course, to detailed assessment as to the amount of it, in order to again facilitate, encourage and enable the settlement. That situation that was anticipated when we were in government has now come about and it is manifestly in everyone's interests that this formal settlement now proceed. If settlement of the matter in dispute had not occurred, it is clear that there would be potentially very long further delays as the matter was fought out between the producers and the utilities. I notice that the Victorian Treasurer has said that the dispute may have been protracted for as many as another 10 years. Manifestly, that was in nobody's interest, in particular because a key impact of that, a key result of it, would have been to delay by that duration the very considerably overdue gas reform process-in particular, in the Victorian context, the removal of Gascor's monopoly of distribution rights. That gas reform process was of course very strongly supported by the Labor government. It is a process which we believe can and will result in lower gas prices and certainly will have a very positive impact upon industry as a result. The gas reform process of course involves much more than simply Victorian participation in now more open supply arrangements. What we are talking about is the establishment of a national gas market as part, in fact, of the national competition policy reform process that was initiated by the former Labor government. In 1994, it will be recalled, the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, agreed to the principle of free and fair trade in gas between the states. This will allow greater competition between producers and lower prices, as I have already said, for domestic and business consumers of gas; it will enable third parties to access pipelines and compete for the right to sell gas to consumers; and it will allow greater use of gas in electricity generation, which will produce both economic and environmental benefits. The press release by the Treasurer indicates properly that the market for gas in Victoria will now be substantially liberalised. However, this is a note of caution that I just want to introduce at this point: it is acknowledged in that release that a number of residual anti-competitive elements will remain in the revised arrangements between Gascor and the producers. We are told that these anticompetitive elements will be provided with a so-called section 51 (l) exception by the Victorian government. We are concerned, I have to say, that very little information has been provided, so far anyway, to justify the use of that section 51 (l) provision. The Treasurer's press release states that the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and the National Competition Council were briefed on the residual anti-competitive effects of the revised arrangements. However, we have no information on how the competition bodies view the arrangements and whether they believe that these residual arrangements are in fact justified. They may be justified in all the circumstances, but they may not be. We simply do not have the information available to make a considered judgment on this issue. I hope that some early opportunity will be taken by the government-perhaps in reply if the parliamentary secretary is in a position to do so-to indicate what precisely the state of play is in that respect. The final point I wish to make is this: the second reading speech makes clear that, in addition to the Commonwealth's windfall gain directly related to the RRT issue, the settlement has also resulted in another windfall gain of some $70 million representing tax payable on amounts previously unpaid by the gas utilities, but not in fact relating to PRRT. That $70 million, we are told, the Commonwealth is going to keep and apply to general deficit reduction. The government will not be surprised to know that we in opposition have a great many suggestions as to how that windfall $70 million which the government is going to keep and not give back to Victoria might in fact be very usefully spent. Today in the Senate. we are intending to request a number of amendments to Appropriation Bill (No. I) and (No.2) which spell out, in loving and elaborate detail in fact, many of the areas in which some of that $70 million might be spent very usefully indeed. I conclude by making the suggestion, in all good faith to the government, that it could do no better than to spend at least $55 million of that windfall $70 million on extending, for at least another year, the Commonwealth dental program, which is, I hope the government will finally come to acknowledge, the most indefensible, the most literally shocking, of rather ugly budget decisions to cut expenditure, particularly in welfare delivery areas, that are contained in this year's budget. If you are sitting on another $70 million as a result of this overdue exercise, this very welcome exercise by the Victorian government, the utilities and the producers, I hope that something useful will be done with the additional windfall gain you have thus received. Having said all that, this is a very good thing that this settlement has been finally achieved. The consequences of it go much beyond the mere settlement of this particular outstanding issue that will now open up the scope for the rapid implementation, we all hope, of the national gas market, a new competitive situation applying in Victoria, New South Wales and elsewhere, much to the benefit of consumers and much to the benefit in particular of energy dependent industry. It is something that will be to the great advantage accordingly not only to the Victorian government but to the whole national economy. On that basis, I indicate the opposition's support for this bill.",76
26,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PAYMENT OF TAX RECEIPTS,"In responding to the comments of the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), it is worth noting that he mentioned the Commonwealth dental program. That program was an initiative that was announced by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in the 1993 election campaign. It was initially planned to reduce the waiting lists that were existing in the state dental schemes. For 93 years Australia had not had a Commonwealth dental scheme. In fact, for 10 years of the previous Labor government there was no Commonwealth involvement in the dental area. The Payment of Tax Receipts (Victoria) Bill is formalising for the Commonwealth what has been a very elegant solution in solving a dispute which has lasted for five years and which relates back to contracts that were determined in the late 1960s. It involves a simultaneous exchange of cheques between three different entities. Gascor, the utility for gas in Victoria, has resolved its long standing dispute with Esso and BHP. As a result of that, it will be making to BHP and Esso a all the lump sum settlement payment of $1.022 billion, which will be assessable for rent tax and company tax. BHP and Esso, which will be assessed for that tax, will pay $625 million in tax to the Commonwealth. Most of that will be windfall tax we were not expecting, but the $70 million which is not part of the windfall will be used to reduce the budget deficit. The Commonwealth will be paying $555 million to Victoria, passing on the windfall tax it has received from Esso and BHP. The contracts, established for production in Bass Strait, were between Esso and BHP and the Victorian state utilities, the then SEC and the Gas and Fuel Corporation but the now Generation Victoria and Gascor respectively. Those contracts said that Esso and BHP were required to sell to only the Victorian state utilities and that no other suppliers could provide gas to Gascor and Generation Victoria. These were just two restrictions that resulted from the contracts established in the late 1960s. That has led to a large surplus of gas in the Bass Strait area. BHP and Esso estimate they could produce something like three times more gas than they currently are, but there has never been any incentive because all they were doing was producing for Victoria. Those contracts had a life of 35 years, and they were established in 1969. At that time, Victoria and the producers, Esso and BHP, decided that indirect taxes levied on supply and production could be passed on to the buyers: the utilities of Victoria. The monopoly that has existed with Gascor, the entity ously known as the Gas and Fuel Corporation, and Esso and BHP has really given them little incentive to develop the gas fields in Bass Strait, because they could supply gas to only Victoria-and Victoria is a mature market. The prices in those contracts were established prior to the two oil shocks of the 1970s. They were established in 1969 and fixed for 35 years. As the member for Holt mentioned, in 1990 the previous Labor government decided to abolish the complex excise and royalty regimes that had existed in the area of gas production and to substitute them with a petrol resource rent tax, which taxed profits on offshore oil and gas production at about 40 per cent. Since 1990, BHP and Esso have been paying that tax, although the contract did mention the contract initially signed so that they could pass it on to the state government utilities. They have been sending the bills to Victoria, and this is what the dispute has been all about. The settlement is, at just over $1 billion, roughly the size of the bills unpaid for reSource rent tax. When we take into account the difference between the lump sum payment and the amount the Commonwealth will appropriate to Victoria through this bill, the settlement will cost Victoria about $425 million. But it removes what the Auditor General of Victoria has estimated as a $3 billion future exposure for the lifetime of contract, based on their requirements under the initial contracts. Alan Stockdale, the Treasurer of Victoria, has said that the settlement of this dispute will not affect current prices because Gascor and Generation Victoria will be increasing their buyings rather than passing the $425 million on to consumers. Net liabilities of those utilities will increase from $600 million to approximately $1 billion. The reason for the great difference between the contract price, which was 27c per gigajoule, and the market price, which was $4.14 per gigajoule, is that the contract price was established in contracts set up prior to the energy crises of the 1970s. The Victorian government has pocketed the difference. The previ- new contracts to be drawn up between BHP and Esso and the state government of Victoria will run from 2001 to 2009. They will be changed a lot more often; there will not be any 35-year contracts in the future. Also, those contracts will be market based. An article in today's Financial Review headed 'What a Gas! Everyone Wins!' describes this as a 'breakthrough' for thousands of Australian businesses being crippled by high energy costs. This solution has removed the last major obstruction to the creation of just one gas market in south-eastern Australia What it will do is decrease the gas prices paid by consumers and by businesses in New South Wales. It will also be able to create new investment. For example, BHP has proposed building a pipeline from Longford to Sydney. Previously, the situation with the intrastate monopolies has meant that was not viable. It will now be viable. Another proposal that has been floated is one linking the Victorian and New South Wales grids with a pipeline between Albury and Wagga Wagga. The solution will allow the Victorian government to move the gas industry to a more competitive structure. For the Commonwealth government, there are benefits as well. The restrictions that this removes will open up the gas fields and will lead to an increase in resource rent tax over the next 10 years. In fact, it has been estimated that this could bring in an additional $300 this million in income per year from the resource rent tax, just due to the expansion that is possible in the Bass Strait oilfields. As I said before, South Australia, New gas South Wales and Victoria have all been regulated, intrastate monopolies. The Santosled group has been supplying Cooper Basin gas to South Australia and New South Wales, and BHP and Esso have been supplying gas to Victoria. The solution will enable Victoria to meet its commitments, agreed to at the COAG meeting, to establish a competitive national gas market. Those commitments have been dependent upon Victoria achieving a resolution to this dispute. The contracts which were established in the late 1960s will now be reformed and will remove the restrictions on Esso-BHP selling gas to end consumers in Victoria. They will also remove the obligation on Gascor to take gas exclusively from Esso-BHP to supply all of Victoria which is connected with the Longford pipeline. They also remove restrictions on Esso-BHP to build pipelines in Victoria and also to market gas in the other states. While initially this will not see a great change-I imagine that Esso-BHP will still largely be supplying gas to Victoria, and the Cooper Basin group will still supply gas to New South Wales and South Australia-in the long term we will see a more competitive situation which will allow an expansion of gas production in Australia and in the long term this solution should lead to lower gas prices for consumers and businesses. I commend this bill to the House.",78
27,Mr MILES,PAYMENT OF TAX RECEIPTS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.55 a.m.)-in reply-I would like to thank the opposition for its cooperation in regard to the Payment of Tax Receipts (Victoria) Bill 1996. It is unusual for legislation to be brought in, the second reading to be debated immediately and for it then to be passed through the House. So we appreciate that cooperation. I think everybody recognises that this is in the best interests of Australian business and, of course, intergovernmental relationships. The opposition spokesperson on Treasury matters, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), mentioned section 51C as being anti-competitive. The government is satisfied that it is pro-competitive and, in broader scheme of things concerning 51 C, he was really referring to a legal technicality. The revised arrangements which this will put in place, we believe, are certainly much better than what was in place under the previous circumstances. Without any further comment, I close the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Miles) read a third time. NA (F AMIL Y TAX INITIATIVE) BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.",80
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"On behalf of the Speaker, it is my duty to make a short statement to the House concerning the Senate's proposals with respect to this bill: Senate amendment No. 2 appears to have the effect of making a reduction in the number of taxpayers who will obtain the benefit of the increase in the tax-free threshold which is central to the family tax assistance initiative. If enacted, it would therefore leave the effect of not decreasing in some instances the taxable income of some taxpayers to the extent provided for in the bill as introduced. Senate amendment No. 1 appears to be consequential to amendment No.2. There is significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment. This is because of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution which provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The overriding consideration, in my view, is the matter of principle and respect for and the regard to the terms of the constitution. I acknowledge that in the circumstances it will be difficult for the House to reach a concIusive understanding of this matter. I note, however, that both houses now have the benefit of committee reports concerning the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. It will also be difficult for any satisfactory dialogue to take place between the houses on the specific matter of the purported amendments to this bill. Nevertheless, I understand that the propodecency sals to which I have referred were originally drafted as requests for amendments. I would ask that ministers in the Senate, when providwhen ed with advice from those who drafted the legislation that the appropriate course follow is by way of request for amendment, satisfy themselves as to the adherence to constitutional principles before deviating this course. I believe that it is my duty to draw these matters to the attention of members before any further consideration is given to the Senate's proposals. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order in relation to the information you have just provided the House. Is it within our standing orders to now make a request upon a request, which seems to have been the tenet of your remarks?",80
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,It is up to the important House as to how we proceed with this mosignificant tion. (Quorum formed),81
30,Mr MILES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (12.05 p.m.)-I move: That(1) the House endorses the statement of the Deputy Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by message No. 93 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996; (2) the House, having regard to the fact that public interest demands the early legislation, refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights in respect of Senate message No. 93; and (3) the amendments be considered forthwith. We support the position which the Speaker has adopted. We do not believe that this is time for a debate about constitutional matters. We want to move on to a debate about the mentary amendments, so the government supports the Speaker's comments.",81
31,Mr LATHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I think what the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) wants to do is sweep the constitutional provisions under the carpet without telling the opposition beforehand, without giving the opposition the and the courtesy of notice of this constitutional question. The first I had heard of it, as shadow minister taking the bill, was the Deputy Speaker read out a short statement. Then one of the clerks handed me to the relevant motion that the parliamentary secretary then stood up and moved I do not think it is sufficient for the parliafrom mentary secretary to stand up and say, 'We support the words and judgment of the Speaker in this matter, but we think there is a public interest consideration which is so pressing that the House now needs to deal with the bill as a matter of urgency, forgetting all about the constitutional questions.' If the parliamentary secretary supports the statement of the Speaker, does he support the sentence that was read out: 'There is significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'? I would have thought it would be very for the parliament to deal with a doubt that has been raised by the Speaker and not just say in part 2 of the motion, now moved by the parliamentary secretary, that there is some public interest demand for the early enactment of the legislation. It is not the view of the opposition that there is a public interest demand for the early enactment of the legislation; the view of the opposition is there should be proper regard for process. The proper regard for process would be to have a parliamentary debate about the the provisions of paragraph 3 of section 53 of the enactment of the constitution. The member for Banks (Mr Melham), who fortunately is at the table, chaired a parliamentary inquiry and delivered an outstanding report on the provisions of paragraph 3 of section 53. Why was he not notified of the the terms of this debate now before the parliament and the motion moved by the parliasecretary? I believe it is the height of indecency and it is the height of parliamentary malpractice to not give the opposition notification of something as important as this. Time after time on these tax matters it is the parliamentary secretary who is wheeled into read out notes provided to him by public servants. We have never once seen the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Costello) deal with a taxation bill. We never see Mr Costello in this House on taxation legislation. This is the same government which said they would make the powers of the parliament supreme over the executive. If the parliament is supreme over the executive, why do we not see the executive minister who has responsibility for taxation instead of the parliamentary secretary? He is not the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer; he is the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister. As such, he has no direct responsibility for taxation matters. The opposition wishes to record that objection. It should be the Treasurer handling this matter, not a parliamentary secretary divorced totally from any responsibility on taxation matters. It should also be recorded that the government should have had the decency and the courtesy to notify the opposition of this major issue concerning paragraph 3 of section 53 of the Australian constitution. Government members, most of all a minister, should not scoff at the idea that the constitution is important. This is the side of parliament that is always lecturing Australians about the importance of upholding the constitution-constitutional tradition. The constitutional tradition on paragraph 3 of section 53 is that it is an important part of our legal framework and something that should not be swept under the carpet in the motion that has now been put by the parliamentary secretary. The opposition, as I understand it, is not in a position to divide on a matter like this because we understand the weight of government numbers. We also understand that the government would have far better cooperation on these matters if it displayed base courtesy in letting the opposition know that an opinion had been provided to the Speaker which cast 'significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'. I am very disappointed that the government is not displaying any courtesy or seeking any cooperation from the opposition on this particular matter. I am also very disappointed that we did not have the Speaker himself in the chamber. Where is the Speaker? He should be in that chair providing his opinion on paragraph 3 of section 53 rather than handing a note to a Deputy Speaker who is on roster and who is obliged to read out the opinion of the Speaker. Mr Bruce Scott-Are you reflecting on the Speaker?",81
32,Mr LATHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am reflecting on the Speaker and the discharge of his responsibilities. If he has a statement to make to this House, if it is a statement headed on the written document 'Statement by Speaker' and if it is a statement that relates to an unresolved part of the constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia-paragraph 3 of section 53-the Speaker should discharge his responsibilities by coming into this House and giving us the statement that stands in his name. He should also be available for questioning by members about the legal advice that has been made available to him. It is not sufficient for a government which said it would be boosting the powers in respect of this parliament to treat us in such a shabby way. The Speaker should be in that chair, the Treasurer should be in that chair and we should have the right-indeed, we do have the right-to question the Speaker about the legal opinion that has been made available to him, especially when so recently, just last year, the member for Banks chaired an extensive parliamentary inquiry into the terms and conditions of paragraph 3 of section 53 of the constitution. I note again the 'significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'. It is suggested here the motion be moved by a minister. It has not been moved by a minister; it has been moved by a parliamentary secretary with no responsibility for the matter now before the House. I doubt very much whether there is public interest demand for the early enactment of the legislation. I was going to mention in the substance of the Senate amendments a whole range of concerns the opposition has about the administrative efficiency, or rather inefficiency, of the way in which the government is now handling the so-called family tax initiative. A whole raft of matters need to be sorted out in the administration of that particular bill-the compliance costs to employers, the availability of information for the family tax initiative coming into force on I January, the confusion as to the arrangements of families where the parents have separated but still have dependent children. If the truth be known, on the family tax initiative the government have created for themselves a legislative and administrative nightmare. They have now realised that. They have got some advice from the public servants, who know it is a nightmare, who know that this is the worse possible way to administer a family tax benefit. They have tried to get it up as fast as they could through the Senate, a questionable amendment moved by the Senate, knowing full well that there would be an important constitutional doubt cast over that process when it came back to this House. It is pretty shabby stuff all round, shabby in the type of people who are here in the House to handle the matter: we do not have the Treasurer-we have a parliamentary secretary; we did not have the Speaker reading out his own statement-we had a Deputy Speaker who was obliged to read it out on his behalf. We do not have access to ask questions to the Speaker. We do not have access to the legal advice upon which the Speaker has made this statement. We do not have an explanation from the government as to why, knowing these things, knowing the doubt about paragraph 3 of section 53 of the constitution, they still persisted with moving Senate amendments. Why doesn't the government follow due process and recommit the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill before the House of Representatives so that the amendments can be moved here first and foremost? This is just one symbol and one sign of the way in which the government has created an administrative nightmare for itself in the handling of this family tax initiative. The proper procedure is not, as the Speaker said, to cast 'significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'. The proper procedure is to recommit the bill to the House of Representatives. If the government did that, there would be no question whatsoever about the terms and conditions of the third paragraph of section 53. This is a serious matter. The House should note with due gravity that we are now considering an amendment by the Senate that we are going to deal with in return by way of a request-when the Speaker himself has cast doubt on whether it is available to the House to do those things. This really is a terrible moment in terms of process and a terrible moment for a government which promised the people of Australia that it would uphold the powers-indeed, boost the powers-of the House of Representatives ahead of an executive government. Executive government has made the mistake, Parliamentary Secretary Miles. You probably do not have an awareness of these things because the Treasurer is not here. Executive government has made the mistake in the drafting of the bill. It has made the mistake in the way in which it is to be administered. It has had to scramble up to the Senate, knowing full well that these provisions really should not have been placed before the Senate but should have been recommitted to the House of Representatives. Now the government is calling on the opposition to just sit here smiling as they bodgie up the process. They are bodgying up the process with a statement read out casting significant doubt on the process. And they expect the opposition to regard their motionwhich said there is some public demand for the early enactment of the legislation-as accurate. There is no public demand for the early enactment of the legislation. There is public demand for due process. There is public demand for treating the House of Representatives with proper respect. And there is public demand for getting the administrative terms of the family tax initiative correct, not having to do it through some bodgied up process knowing full weIl that it would be doubtful as to how the House of Representatives could deal with any Senate amendment. This is a terrible moment for the House. I again record the opposition's concern that it has been asked to deal with these matters without consultation, without prior notice and without the proper tenets of due process.",82
33,Mr MELHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, I rise to support the statement you made on behalf of the Speaker in relation to the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996. I had the honour and the privilege in the last parliament of chairing a committee of the House of Representatives, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. That committee considered the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. I suppose what is disappointing to us on the opposition benches is that in the last parliament that committee produced a unanimous report. On the committee at that time was the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the father of the House, and the current Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr WiIliams). We produced a unanimous report. This is not an issue of government and opposition, as far as the House of Representatives is concerned. It is an issue of the powers of the House and the powers of the Senate. ",84
34,Mr MELHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"And the constitution. We on both sides of the House wish to respect the constitution, so that committee produced a unanimous report. I suppose that is why we in the opposition are a little disappointed. In relation to the Speaker's statement, we endorse it. In relation to the motion moved by the parliamentary secretary, we endorse it. The first paragraph of the parliamentary secretary's motion said: The House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by message No. 93 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 ... Let us be under no illusion. There is crossparty support for that aspect of the motion. What the government needs to understand is that they need to observe the protocols. I think that is what our objection is at this stage. We cannot derogate from our powers as a House, especially when we are attempting, as a result of the reports that were tabled in the last parliament, to reach a compact with the Senate. That is why I am rising to speak. I am rising to say, 'Look, we support that aspect. We support the Speaker's statement.' The Speaker's statement said: There is significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment. This is because of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution which provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The overriding consideration in my view is the matter of principle and respect for and regard to the terms of the constitution. That is why we support the Speaker's statement. But it is disappointing when we on this side did not get, as I understand it, notice in relation to this statement. It just allows the Senate to attempt to divide and rule in this instance, because this is something that is about the powers of the House and the Senate. I endorse further down in the statement the comments which said: Nevertheless, I understand that the proposals to which I have referred were originally drafted as requests for amendments. I would ask that ministers in the Senate, when provided with advice from those who drafted the legislation that the appropriate course to follow is by way of request for amendment, satisfy themselves as to the adherence to constitutional principles before deviating from this course. That is why we on this side endorse the Speaker's statement. That is why the government should understand that they need to, and should, give us notice in terms of the protocols. They need to do that so that we as one can assert the powers of the House, and so that those in the other place can be under no illusions that there is no division on either side of the House. We regard this as the people's House. We do have the benefit of a comprehensive report. I think there is a possibility of reaching a compact so that we can have an understanding as to how we should proceed. I implore the government to give us notice in future. I applaud you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the Speaker for bringing this to the attention of the House. It is important. I don't think that what has happened today should derogate from the fact that we are at one with the government in relation to your statement. That is why I have risen to speak on this matter. It was an honour and a privilege to be the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the last parliament. The secretariat was excellent-and still is. The then opposition members-now in government-signed off on that report. Mr Deputy Speaker, I applaud you for the statement you made on behalf of the Speaker. I say again to the government: there is no need to have proceeded down this path at this stage-that is, in not giving us notice. (Quorum formed)  indebted to the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), and I thank him for his courtesy. Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, it gives me some sense of satisfaction that you should have been involved in such an important message from the Speaker about the powers of the House in respect of money bills but, like the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)-without wishing to reflect on you-it would have been nice if the Speaker was in the chamber for such an important message. When we are talking about the respective powers of the Senate and the House, I am a little embarrassed that I have perhaps previously considered some of the Senate's powers as too much and, as a government backbench member, very frustrating. In opposition you learn to understand some of the benefits the Senate has in consideration of legislation-its ability to actually extract the detail behind legislation. I would in no way wish to reflect on the powers of the Senate. However, I do believe the message from the Speaker is a very important one. As both shadow ministers on the opposition side have stated, there is no disagreement on either side of the House on the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. It is pleasing that that should be the case. The Senate doesn't have the power to affect the tax burden on ordinary people, yet your message alerts us to the fact that the schedule of amendments made by the Senate has this very direct consequence. The parliamentary secretary has been very courteous to me-and I am grateful-in allowing me to make a small contribution. Again, I make the point that, if this House is to function and the prerogatives of the House are to be maintained, it is really important that courtesy be extended to the opposition, particularly to the shadow minister, in foreshadowing that this bill would be coming up and the likelihood of the Speaker making such an important statement. It is unfortunate that on these bills we, as a House, do not have a proper opportunity to address the constitutional issue that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have placed before us in the statement you read out on behalf of the Speaker. I sincerely hope-this being a sitting Thursday in the last week of a parliamentary sitting-that at some future date the government may consider that the issue is of sufficient importance and gravity for there to be an appropriate parliamentary debate about section 53 of the constitution. Members on both sides of the House are very concerned at all times to ensure that the constitution is followed. Indeed, the government has a track record of insisting on this, more so than perhaps us. By way of summary, it is a pity that proper courtesies were not extended to the opposition on this matter and that the Speaker himself was not able to be present in the chamber, given the importance of the Speaker's message that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, read out. Last but not least, I hope there will be a future opportunity where the support of all honourable members about the constitution in this instance can be brought to a head and debated and an appropriate message sent to the Senate. I thank the House.",84
35,Mr MILES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (12.31 p.m.)-in reply-I would just like to sum up this very brief debate which we have had. I understand the comments from one or two people in the opposition on the way in which this matter has been dealt with by the government. First of all, can I make it very clear that we are following exactly the same procedure as the former government followed with us in regard to this matter. So, in getting again. the forewarning, we are dealing with the Speaker's statement in the same way this matter was dealt with previously. I suggest to the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that, if he wants further information on the legal basis for this, he might refer to the speeches by his current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the then Assistant Treasurer, the former member for Canning, Mr Gear, so that he might be more acquainted with the way in which the previous government dealt with it. I am just saying that this government is following precedent. There is nothing unusual about it. There is quite a bit of fuss being made by the member for Werriwa about this. I just want to put it on the record that we are following the same sort of procedure. The member for Werriwa also made the comment that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was not in here and was not having carriage of the matter. Neither is the shadow Treasurer in here taking carriage of it. That is okay. All I am saying is that I have responsibility for carriage of this bill through the House. In regard to the public interest, I would think that the Australian people out there who have been told that they are going to get some tax cuts would have a great deal of interest in family taxation cuts of $1 billion. There is certainly public interest amongst families right throughout this country looking for a $1 billion cut, looking for $1 billion back in their pockets on 1 January. They know this is coming. The government is honouring its promise to the Australian people within a year of coming into government. They are getting family cuts. Mr Martin-This is about the sovereignty of the two Houses-the House of Representatives, the sovereign parliament.",85
36,Mr MILES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"That is okay. The member for Werriwa was saying in regard to the second point of this motion that there was no public demand. Well, there is. I just want to make the point that a lot of Australian families out there are keen to see the tax cuts. Mr Martin-Never mind the substance. This is about the Senate trying to railroad us",86
37,Mr MILES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"-All right, let me come to that in a moment. There is no doubt of the interest out there by families right around this country. Turning to some of the other comments made by one or two members of the opposition, yes, we do agree on the way in which we should handle this with respect to the way in which the Senate is dealing with the constitutional question. It has been pointed out that a report, which is a bipartisan report, has been done. It came down late last year and is being reflected on. Obviously, that bipartisan approach by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is a relevant report to this debate. We take that on board. We understand the comments that the Senate is trying to play here with the House of Representatives. No doubt the report will be dealt with as time proceeds.",86
38,Mr MELHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,In a cross-party way.,86
39,Mr MILES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"-Yes. We would like to put on the record in this discussion that we recognise that bipartisanship which occurred in regard to that report. I would suggest that this motion now be put. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the parliamentary secretary was claiming that he was closing the debate, but it was in fact his first speech in the debate. I just point out to the government that there are other members who wish to make a contribution on this. Given that the parliamentary secretary has just made his first speech, I would ask the Deputy Speaker to giveMr Costello--On a point of orderMr Latham-Hang on, he can't interrupt on my point of order. I can finish my point of order. Mr Costello--This is not a point of order. Mr Latham-It is a point of order.",86
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I will rule when I have heard the honourable member for Werriwa. Have you finished? Mr Latham-No, I have not. Mr Costello-I do make a point of order on the point of order: this is not a point of order. The member should resume his seat.",87
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I will listen to the honourable member for Werriwa. Then I will make a decision on his point of order. Mr Latham-I was making the simple point that the government had not given the opposition notice of this particular motion. Members had not been aware that the important provisions of 53(3) would be debated before the House. The parliamentary secretary has made his first speech, not his second.",87
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Order! I have heard the member. I do not believe there is any point of order. Question resolved in the affirmative. Senate's amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (after line 8), after the definition of spouse, insert: taxable income, in relation to a beneficiary of a trust estate, includes (except in section 201) any amount that would have been included in the beneficiary's assessable income under section 100 of the Assessment Act if paragraph 100(l)(b), and the words ""or of each of the trust estates"" in paragraphs 100(l)(c) and (d), of that Act were omitted. (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 13 (after line 11), at the end of section 201, add: (2) For the purpose of determining whether section 20C or 20D applies, or would apart from section 20E apply, to the beneficiary, the beneficiary's taxable income is taken be the beneficiary's share of the net of the trust estate in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed and to pay tax under section 98 of the Assessment Act. (3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 21 (line 26), omit ""at the end of', substitute ""after"". (4) Schedule 1, item 2, page 27 (after line 19), after section 20U, insert: 20V Quotation of spouse's tax file number (1) A taxpayer's spouse may tell the taxpayer the spouse's tax file number for the purposes of this Division. (2) A taxpayer may, but is not obliged to, quote the spouse's tax file number for the purposes of this Division.",87
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Is it the wish of the House to consider the amendments together? Mr Latham-No, it is not the wish of the House to consider them together.",87
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,It is not agreed to consider them together.,87
45,Mr MILES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (12.38 p.m.)-In that case, I move: That amendment No. 1 be agreed to. This amendment will include the income of a taxpayer's spouse in the family income where the spouse is under a legal disability and the spouse's only income is a share of income from the trust. The change is necessary to ensure that the FfA income tests work properly. The payment of tax by trustees on behalf of legally disabled beneficiaries should not result in that income being excluded from the FfA income. Normally, a beneficiary in this category should be treated as having no taxable income and the income is taxed in the hands of the trustee. I commend the amendment to the House.",87
46,Mr LATHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (12.39 p.m.)The opposition understands the situation to be one where the government has maladministered its own legislation and is now seeking the Senate to bail it out by way of amendment, an amendment that many people in this House believe the Senate does not have the right to move, let alone to seek to impose upon the House of Representatives. The proper way of handling this matter would to have been either for the government to recomincome mit the bill to the House of Representatives or for the Senate to make a request and nothing more than a request; not for the Senate to exercise powers that many in the House believe are beyond its jurisdiction and charter, constitutionally and morally. It is very important for the House to recognise those points. The opposition is very concerned that the government is using incorrect practice, using false powers of the Senate, to try to tidy up the administrative nightmare of its own legislation. We all know that this family tax initiative was not framed by reasoned, diligent and rational policy makers; it was framed by a Liberal Party focus group which was told, 'John Howard will give you a big fistful of dollars in this election campaign. How would you like it paid to you?' That focus group said, 'We do not really regard ourselves as welfare recipients, so we do not want it in terms of a Social Security cheque that might arrive every month, like the basic family payment.' They said, 'Why don't you pay it through the tax system?' So the person organising the focus group, with Andrew Robb taking notes on the other side of the one-way glass, said, 'What if we do it through a change to the tax free threshold instead of a rebate which would be the most efficient way to pay the benefit-a rebate at the end of the financial year?' The taxpayers said, 'We like the idea of getting the benefit on an ongoing basis through PAYE deductions rather than an end of year rebate.' So that is how the Liberal Party devised its family tax initiative. It was poll driven; it was focus group driven; it was research driven. But something happened to this policy on the way to the forum. They handed it over to the bureaucrats in the federal Public Service who said that it may well be research driven but it is not administratively sound. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order with regard to relevance on a debate like this. This is a very specific amendment. I ask you to draw the attention of the speaker back to the debate.",87
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I will take note of what is said and I will listen very carefully to I warn him to stay within standing orders.,88
48,Mr LATHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Sure. What the amendment is trying to do is explained in the words of Senator Kemp when he presented this pr?vision yesterday morning in the Senate. He said: The first amendment will include the income of a taxpayer's spouse and the family income where the spouse is under a legal disability and the spouse's only income is the share of income from a trust. That is the most inefficient way to administer this provision. This amendment would not be necessary if the government had paid this family tax initiative by way of an end of year tax rebate or if the government had decided to pay this tax initiative by a weighted adjustment to the basic family payments. So there is no doubt that the government has got itself into trouble on the amendment now before the House. It is in trouble because it did not follow good public policy principles, it did not follow sound administrative practice; it followed the findings of a focus group. It followed the findings of a survey group, conducted and paid for by the Liberal Party, to find the most electorally popular way to present a fistful of dollars at the 1996 election and gain public support. That is why the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is in so much trouble. I would ask him to explain the meaning of the amendment presented by Senator Kemp. In particular, what is the meaning of 'legal disability' that the government brings to this matter? This is a way the opposition can scrutinise your provisions. The House is not even aware of what you mean by 'legal disability' and 'the spouse's only income is the share of income from a trust'. So not even the parliamentary secretary is able to explain the provisions now before the House. They have got themselves into a terrible mess in the administration of this matter. That is why I move: That all words after that be deleted with a view to substituting the following words: the amendments be referred to a conference between the House of Representatives and the Senate where they can address the problems with amendment No. 1 and all the other administrative inefficiencies of the speaker. the family tax initiative.",88
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I believe the amendment is out of order. It has to be relevant to amendment No.1.,88
50,Mr LATHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,It is.,88
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,It has to be wider; that is my ruling.,88
52,Mr LA TRAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"On a point of order to your ruling: the House has been told in a ruling by the Speaker that there is constitutional doubt about the capacity of the Senate to move these amendments. It has been said by the Speaker that he expects Senate ministers to take it as a request when it finally goes back to the Senate. I would have thought, despite the ruling of the Deputy Cierk, that given the extraordinary circumstances it is within the province of the House-and given the lenience it is displaying with regard to the Senate-to move an amendment that calls for a conference between the two houses. This is an extraordinary circumstance. The House is exercising goodwill, contrary to the wishes of the SenateMr Miles-It's out of order.",89
53,Mr LA TRAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Your whole provision is out of order in the eyes of many in this House. The way in which you are treating this matter is out of order. So I put that to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The clerk who has given you that advice should recognise the extraordinary circumstances of this debate.",89
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Order! I have ruled on the point of order. I have ruled that the point of order is out of order.  point of order: is it not in order for the shadow minister to move that an amendment be referred for a conference? I cannot see how that can be ruled out of order.,89
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Order! I will get some advice on this. By moving that the amendment is out of order, it goes beyond amendment No. 1 that we are speaking about.",89
56,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am not wanting to take issue on the technicalities; I am wanting to make the point that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has an obsession with the mechanism by which this matter has been brought forward.  Speaker, but could you assist me. If an amendment were moved to refer amendment No. 1 to a conference of the House and the Senate, would that also be ruled out of order? Mr Latham-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I think I have been misheard in terms of the amendment I was moving. I was moving that this amendment be referred to a conference between the two houses. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, what the honourable member moved previously was a much longer amendment than he is now giving to the House. It was much more extensive; it went beyond the actual amendment No. 1 and covered virtually all the four amendments.",89
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Order! I have ruled on the amendment moved by the member for Werriwa, as I understood it, and I have ruled it out of order. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept your ruling.",89
58,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I do not want to prolong the debate, but I do want to contend what the member for Werriwa says. Despite the paranoia that he exhibits towards the Lyons Forum-I assume that is whom he is referring to-the fact is that the delivery of this $1 billion package of tax relief for Australian families was absolutely central to the government's pre-election strategy and the legislation which delivers it is widely applauded. The fact is that an amendment has been brought forward which, in its context, is not of any great consequence except that my understanding of it-without having seen all of the background-is that it would deal with the targeting of that assistance to the people that it is intended to reach. For the member for Werriwa to stand here and try to make something Speaker: I am reluctant to draw the honourable member's attention to standing orders but, as the parliamentary secretary took a point of order on relevance, we are dealing with amendment No.1, which refers to trusts-the beneficiaries of trusts and the beneficiaries of deceased estate trusts. I say with great respect that the honourable member is transgressing the limitation of the subject matter covered under amendment No.1. And I am not the first to take this point of order.",89
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I ask the honourable member to be relevant to the amendment that is before the House.,90
60,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Thank you for that, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I can actually do nothing else. The only piece of paper I have in front of me here is amendment No. I, and I am pointing specifically to my understanding of it, as I read it here, because I am not subject or privy to what went on behind the scenes. It is dealing with a minor technical correction within the overall legislation that would deal with the matter of income which is coming to a spouse as a result of a particular financial arrangement that is entered into",90
61,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"By trusts, okay-by a family. My understanding of this would be that it would simply be a matter of correcting what otherwise would be a situation of eligibility for that family tax provision that ought not apply because the provision is carefully targeted. It is targeted to families in need and the fact is that this initiative, this bill, deliver to Australian families $1 billion of benefits. The member for Werriwa is just standing up here in his usual fashion, being obstructive, being difficuIt",90
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member should address the motion before the chair.,90
63,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am sorry. The member for Werriwa is simply coming into this place, as he does time after time, and jumping up and down with some mock indignation about some relatively minor matter. He - nows, as is clear to me from this bit of paper III front of me, that this is a technical correc-ion to legislation which overall is extremely Important. I just do not accept that he has a serious point to make in this matter: If he did, then I am sure the parliament would take him seriously. But he is just here to obstruct and b- difficult. We just do not accept that way of proceeding. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I would move that amendment No. I be laid aside pursuant to standing order 245, as the House does not believe that the Senate has the power to make an amendment in such a manner.",90
64,Mr CADMAN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,That has been ruled out of order. ,90
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The bill has to be laid asideMr Latham-That's ridiculous. There is no bill before the House, so that provision does not apply. Mr Miles- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",90

70,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.12 p.m.)-I move: That amendment No.2 be agreed to. This amendment will provide for the trustee who pays' tax on behalf of a beneficiary who is under a legal disability to calculate the beneficiary's entitlement to the FfA on the basis of the beneficiary's share of trust income alone. The trustee will not be required to take any other source of income into account in determining the beneficiary's entitlement to FfA. The change is consistent with the existing law in that the trustee has to pay tax only on the beneficiary'S income from the trust and not on the beneficiary's other income. We have been willing to accommodate the opposition in having a sensible debate in this area, so we will proceed with each of these amendments independently. NOES Mr LATHAM (Werriwa) (1.12 p.m.)There is no better explanation of the provisions of Senate amendment No. 2 than that provided to the House by Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield earlier on in his statement on the powers of the House in respect of money bills. The Deputy Speaker said: Senate amendment No.2 appears to have the effect of making a reduction in the number of taxpayers who will obtain the benefit of the increase in the tax free threshold which is central to the family tax assistance initiative. If enacted, it would therefore leave the effect of not decreasing in some instances the taxable income of some taxpayers to the extent provided for in the bill as introduced. The Deputy Speaker went on to say: There is significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment. PAIRS The Australian Laber Party joins with the Deputy Speaker in e pressing concern about the Senate's capacity to move amendments. Mr Martin-It's a -:lisgrace.",92
71,Mr LA TRAM,AYES,"As the member for Cunningham points out, it is a disgrace that the government is bodgying up the provisions and amendments of the Senate to try to bail itself out of the administrative inefficiency of the family tax initiative. It also begs the question: why is the government taking away eligibility for the family tax initiative? Why is the government at this late stage of the debate taking away from a group of Australians eligibility for the family tax initiative? It is doing these things unexpectedly and incorrectly through the powers of the Senate for one reason and one reason alone: they have a lemon of a policy. They have a lemon of a policy when they take what the focus group said before the election and try to tum it into administrative inefficiency, which is what the Taxation Office now faces. The family tax initiative is a lemon. The family tax initiative increases substantiallyMr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order: we are discussing very detailed amendments to a bill. I am not sure how many times we have heard these comments from the member for Werriwa, and I ask that you draw him back to discussing the topic under consideration.",92
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,The matter before the chair is Senate amendment No.2. I ask the honourable member to speak to that amendment.,93
73,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"I have been speaking to the statement that the Speaker gave the House on Senate amendment No.2, which is now before the House. It appears to have the effect of making a reduction in the number of taxpayers who will obtain the benefit of the increase in the tax free threshold which is central to the family tax assistance initiatives. I was asking the question: why is the government at this late stage taking away its much touted and much vaunted family tax initiative from a body of Australians? The answer as to why the government has had to use the false powers of the Senate to carry an amendment now before the House is that there are a whole range of administrative inefficiencies concerning the family tax initiative of which this amendment is but one. The amendment, for instance, is related to the fact that employers now have to notify the Tax Office of a change in the PA YE deductions for each employee. Therefore, there is a huge increase in compliance costs in Australia. It also raises the question: how will people know? How will people know of their eligibility for the family tax initiative by 1 January if the government is not telling them? Most people expect these things to be paid as a rebate at the end of the financial year. There is a problem in the spread of information. There will be a group of Australians who just will not know of their eligibility on 1 January. There is another problem. What happens if both parents claim simultaneously for the family tax initiative? This is the problem with a tax system based on individuals, yet the benefit is being paid to families. There will have to be a huge data matching exercise within the Tax Office to try to deal with the problem of double dipping. This particular set of amendments illustrates the problem the government has in the prevention of double dipping. There is a further problem. What happens where the benefit is being paid even though the parents are living apart? Apparently, parents will have to keep a logbook. We will have the extraordinary circumstance of parents keeping a logbook on the amount of time that they have care of and are paying for dependants vis-a-vis the amount of time the dependants spend with the former partner. There is a range of inefficiencies that is adding to compliance costs for employers. Those inefficiencies are causing distress in the community. They will lead to the absurd situation of parents having to keep a logbook on the amount of custody that they have for one of their children if the parents are separated. This is worse than the Australia Card. The Tax Office-(Time expired) (Quorum formed)  Deputy SpeakerMotion (by Mr Miles) put: That the question be now put. A division having been called and the bells having been rung Mr Martin- Mr Deputy Speaker, we no longer require a division. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to move that the motion be withdrawn. Motion-by leave-withdrawn.  want to take up too much time of the House. I just wanted to make a couple of comments about this amendment before it was closed off. The point that I wanted to make again was that I think .constitutionally the better way of handling these requested amendments, as they are in a sense technical adjustments of the original bill, was for the government to have reintroduced the bill in the House of Representatives and then again forwarded it on to the Senate. That was the better constitutional way to handle these matters to facilitate these amendments. In a sense, I had to respond to the challenge of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) when he said, The breadth of these amendments actually touches the families of Australia.' In effect, the amendment that we are dealing with deals with the taxable income that spouses receive from a trust estate or from the trust of a deceased estate. I freely confess to this House that I am completely unaware of the scope of this measure as it relates to my own electorate. Mr Bradford-I rise on a point of order. The member for Chifley is referring back to Senate amendment No. 1. We have dealt with Senate amendment No.1. We are now dealing with Senate amendment No.2.",93
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"Order! The honourable member is addressing the matter before the chair.  ... taxable income is taken to be the beneficiary'S share of the net income of a trust estate in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed or to pay tax under section 98 of the Tax Assessment Act. I think the problem for the honourable member for MCPherson is that amendments 1 and 2 are related. The point I want to make to the honourable member for MCPherson and to the House is that I suspect that in my electorate of Chifley-and I would have thought that no-one would argue that there are many fine battlers living in the electorate of ChifleyMr Martin-And well represented.  ber for Cunningham. He is an astute judge in these matters. I cannot say that I am aware of any of my constituents' spouses being such beneficiaries. I cannot think of one. In case I am making a false statement, I plead with any of my constituents who are listening this afternoon to ring me if they are a spouse who is a beneficiary of a trust or the estate of a trust. I do not want to misrepresent the situation when I say that not one person in my electorate will benefit from these measures. In fact, they are not designed to benefit from these measures. It is not the poor or the middle class who will benefit from these amendments, it is those who are well practised in tax matters in setting up trusts. Trusts are set up with the single purpose of minimising taxable income. I am not in favour of this amendment because it is not going to benefit any of my constituents. They are certainly not in the wealthy brigade who can spend thousands of dollars rearranging their tax affairs to pay a minimal amount of tax. It is a pity that the government did not follow the advice of the shadow minister, who suggested that we could have avoided these constitutional difficulties if the parliamentary secretary had been prepared to reintroduce the bill and then forward it to the Senate. (Time expired) Amendment agreed to.",94
75,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.29 p.m.)-I move: That amendment No.3 be agreed to. This is also a minor technical amendment. It clarifies the operation of proposed subparagraph 20P(3)(b) to make it clear that the subparagraph is intended to apply to couples who separate after the end of the year of income. Without the amendment, the provision is ambiguous. We acknowledge that, and that is why the amendment is being moved.",94
76,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"The opposition is pleased to support this amendment to the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill. We note that the first two amendments were taking away eligibility for the family tax initiative, trary to government election promises. This is an amendment which, as was outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), seeks to confer eligibility on parents who have separated. In the context of this provision, however, is worth repeating that the opposition does not regard the Senate as having a legitimate authority or power to move an amendment; it should have come to us by way of a request. But now it is here, and now that it has been put by the parliamentary secretary, it is appropriate to raise the whole raft of administrative difficulties that the government has with the family tax initiative. This is a provision that relates to parents when they separate. It is worth noting that the situation where two or more people jointly maintain a dependant and those people do not reside together was to be dealt with in the proposed section 20L of the bill, which provides that the child will only be considered to be a dependant for the days when the taxpayer has care of the child for the night. I would have thought that, for members who are worried about privacy and the basic rights of citizens to privacy, this is a new infringement that the government is imposing upon the citizens of Australia in an attempt to force them to keep a logbook to determine for taxation purposes whethei or not their dependent child stayed for the night. And not only that, the government is further breaching privacy by forcing parents to keep a logbook for the amount of time that they have dependent children within their care. The administrative efficiency of it is a total nightmare; the administrative arrangements are a total nightmare. Let me raise a hypothetical situation to illustrate what will happen. Say one parent starts out the PAYE period with 70 per cent of the care of the dependent child and the other parent, separated, 30 per cent. Because the government is paying this through PAYE deductions rather than through a rebate, if the 70/30 ratio changes at any time, the employer will have to be notified, and will subsequently have to change the PA YE deduction to reflect, say, a change to 50/50. Imagine the con- administrative nightmare and the inconvenience and the breach of privacy for people. First of all, they have to keep a log as to how many nights the dependent child spent with them. These arrangements are always flexible and fluid. If the arrangements change it and go from 70/30 to 50/50 they have to present a log to their employer to say that the child is now half in their care instead of 70 per cent; they have to ask the employer to alter the PAYE deduction for the purpose of the family tax initiative. The government clearly had not thought any of these things through before it brought the family tax initiative legislation into the House. I note the concern that is echoed on the faces of the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) now that the penny has dropped. The penny has dropped that their much vaunted family tax initiative is an administrative nightmare. What you are setting up in the name of family values is a tax logbook on separated parents: when they have the care of a dependant in their house for the night-not for the day, necessarily, just for the night-they need to put it on the night log. If those arrangements change from PAYE period to PAYE period, they have to tell their employer of that and he will notify the Taxation Office through a change to the PAYE deduction. That is an extraordinarily draconian provision for a government to impose. It is a nightmare for people in terms of their right to privacy. Why should employers know the arrangements that their employees have with regard to dependent children? Why should they have the right to know how many nights their separated employees have dependent children in their houses? Why do they have that right to know? Why, even, does the Taxation Office have that right to know? The answer is: because the government engaged in the folly of not paying this as a rebate or a cash transfer. They decided to pay it by virtue of their electoral research and by virtue of their focus group findings. They decided to pay it as a PA YE deduction. That has led to a whole series of administrative inefficiencies and privacy concerns that this parliament should note. The member for MCPherson looks as though he is about to jump to his feet. He is one of the executive members of the Lyons Forum. He is one of the creators of this family tax initiative. Let him explain to separated parents ·in Australia why they need to keep a taxation logbook every night they have a dependent child in their house. Let him explain why employers should have access to that information. Let him explain why the tax office should. This is worse than the Australia Card. (Time expired)",95
77,Mr BRADFORD,AYES,"I might leave it to the parliamentary secretary to answer the question of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in detail, but I was provoked and I just want to make a couple of brief comments. The family tax initiative is $1 billion for Australian The member for Werriwa once again demonstrates to this House his disingenuousness by 15 minutes ago calling divisions on a principle that there was something wrong with the way these amendments had been introduced. That is when he did not agree with the amendments, because they in fact did what he could hardly argue against, and that is ensure that these benefits were properly targeted. What he is trying to argue now is that somehow targeting is an issue. It has always been an issue for both houses of this parliament that we are concerned about benefits being properly targeted, and yet the argument that he now puts forward in some sense is that it should not be so. So the argument here is about the proper targeting of these benefits and that is whyMr Latham-What about the logbook?",96
78,Mr BRADFORD,AYES,"What about a logbook? The issue here, of course, is targeting and making sure that those that are entitled to and eligible for the benefits get them and making sure that if they are not entitled to them they do not. There are always going to be difficulties with ensuring that those benefits get through to those that are entitled to them. Let me answer quickly the question about rebates. This is a tax rebate and the member for Werriwa was correct in suggesting it could be delivered at the end of the year, but the obvious point of that is that that would not give the maximum advantage. The point of doing it through the PA YE system is to make sure the families benefited from it immediately, so on the first payday after 1 January all of the families in Australia that are eligible for this $1 billion tax cut will get it in their tax packets. Is the member for Werriwa opposed to those families getting that benefit in their first pay packet after 1 January? Mr Latham-If they apply, they do.",96
79,Mr BRADFORD,AYES,"If they are eligible then they will get it, and it is a matter of semantics arguing about whether they apply or not. The fact is that if they are eligible they will know they are eligible and they will get it. You are being disingenuous in the way that you are treating these amendments and by doing so you are demonstrating, in my view, a lack of families. commitment to Australian families. Amendment agreed to.",96
80,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) (to the Prime Minister)(1.37 p.m.)-I move: That amendment No.4 be agreed to. This amendment enables but does not compel taxpayers to quote their spouses' tax file numbers in their tax returns. The quotation will be on a voluntary basis but the information gained will be useful to help prevent double dipping. Arrangements will be worked out to ensure that the consent of a spouse is sought before his or her tax file number is quoted. Without the amendment, it would be an offence for a taxpayer to ask his or her spouse for a spouse's tax file number and for the taxpayer to quote the tax file number to the commissioner. I make the comment that, in terms of privacy, there is no privacy being infringed in regard to this; it is voluntary. I would just like to make that point.",96
81,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"It is interesting to hear that it is voluntary. What do we do about a dispute? What do we do in a situation where both of the separated parents are claiming substantive care of the dependent child? They are both claiming, say, 80 or 90 per cent of the dependent care of the child. How does the tax office deal with that situation if we are not to have some form of record like a logbook? I would have thought what the parliamentary secretary has done to the taxation system is to encourage everyone to claim as much as they feel inclined to claim. If they want to claim 80 and 80, 160, why not? The government will pay 160 per cent benefit. Is that the case? If the government is to police this properly, certainly it needs to have some form of administrative system in place. I would be very surprised indeed if the parliamentary secretary's assurance holds that there will be no breach of privacy as that administrative system is put in place. As he mentioned, this final amendment on the bill deals with the question of double dipping. So the nightmare of the family tax initiative and its administration gets worse. Not only are there the compliance costs for employers of constantly changing their PA YE deductions, not only is there the breach of privacy for separated parents as their employer and the tax office know the arrangements that they have struck in their private life-the nightmare on Lyons Street gets even worse. The nightmare on Lyons Street gets even worse because the Lyons Forum has now run into the problem of how to prevent double dipping. It probably is very difficult in these circumstances to prevent a situation where both parents will claim for the family tax initiative. This is a problem of a taxation system in Australia based on individual income yet the benefit being paid to family units. If both parents claim, what is the government going to do about it? What is the government going to do about double dipping other than this amendment here, the sole purpose of which is to beg people to volunteer the tax file number of their spouse as they lodge their application for the family tax ini tiati ve? The government is begging people to do the right thing but people are not obliged to lodge the tax file number of their spouse as they themselves apply for the family tax initiative. This creates a very interesting situation as to what the Taxation Office will do to try to prevent double dipping. I would have thought it would generate a huge data matching exercise for the Taxation Office. The ATO will now have to match the data from spouse to spouse right across Australia. I know that the Lyons Forum is all about keeping people together in holy wedlock but they are going to be doing it through the tax office by matching people up against each other with their tax file number. Mr Miles-They're splitting them up, are they?",97
82,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"No, the Labor Party is not splitting them; we believe in choice. Remember that strange notion, that strange notion of small '1' liberalism upon which your party was founded? We believe in choice and liberty. We do not think people should be forced into living together if they choose other arrangements. They might be single or divorced, they are elements in our society. Choice! We are not social engineers. We are not part of the big 'C' conservative movement for authority in Australia. We are not part of an authoritarian strongarm movement that tells people that because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) grew up in a white picket fence family everyone else should, or because you grew up in a white picket fence family that everyone else should. We believe in choice and freedom in a free and open society. That is the Australian Labor Party's position. What the Lyons Forum has created is social engineering. Members of the forum are trying to tell women that they belong in the home even though many women in Australia so joyfully choose both a career and a familyMrs Gash-That's why we've got so many women in parliament.",97
83,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"We all know the sort of women the Liberal Party prefers. We are seeing that at the Opera House today. I would not talk too much about the rights of women and feminist issues in Australian politics. The issue on the final amendment is one of double dipping. The government has created a nightmare for the Taxation Office. There are additional compliance costs on employers. So much for the recommendations of your small business report which was going to lower compliance costs on small business. Each small business in Australia will now have to alter PA YE tax deductions on a weekly or monthly basis because there has been a change in the household care of dependent children that then flows on to the family tax initiative. We not only have a breach of privacy, we have the problem of how the Taxation Office stops double dipping. There is no compulsion on people to provide the tax file number of their spouse. That is only voluntary, and if people do not volunteer there will have to be a huge data matching exercise thereby adding to the costs of running Australia's taxation system. The Labor Party would much rather see those expenses devoted to the real task of tax policing in Australia, cracking down on fraud and cracking down on abuse at the big end of town. The Labor Party would much rather see those scarce ATO resources dedicated to catching the tax cheats and the tax frauds. (Extension of time granted). We know why the Liberal Party will not devote the resources where they are needed within the Taxation Office. They are trying to police the situation with their own flawed family tax initiative to stop double dipping when the sensible thing to do would be to ali ocate those resources to the real purpose tax policing in Australia, to catch the big corporate crooks, the tax fraud at the big end of town. Instead, resources will be spent looking through the bedroom windows of Australians through the introduction of this logbook to see what arrangements they are making with their dependent children. The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) earned a reputation in this parliament for wanting the Tasmanian police to look through the bedroom windows of consenting adults on the question of the sex laws and, true to form, he now wants the Taxation Office to be looking through the bedroom windows of Australians to work out whether or not their dependent child is there, whether or not the logbook is correct and whether or not double dipping is taking place. I would suggest that the government really should have accepted the Labor Party's proposal at the beginning of this debate to have a conference between the House and the Senate to look at the gross administrative inefficiencies of the family tax initiative and see how its administration is unravelling day after day after day. Do something positive about lowering compliance costs for small business. Do something positive about protecting the privacy of Australian citizens. Do something positive about an effective means to stop the potential for double dipping on the family tax initiative. The government has rejected those things and it is to its lasting shame that it could not find a better way. It is the old message in public life: good policy stands on its own; good policy leads to sound administration. The government engaged in base electoral research to work out the way in which Australian families would want the family tax initiative paid. As Mr Howard offered his fistful of dollars, the researchers said, 'Pay it through the tax system with PAYE deductions.' In terms of administration, that focus group was wrong, the Lyons Forum was wrong, and the government was wrong. I look forward to reinforcing those points in this House in the lead-up to 1 January and for a long time thereafter. Amendment agreed to. of FAMIL Y (TAX INITIATIVE) BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendment(1) Schedule 2, item 2, page 6 (after line 19), paragraph (c), insert: (ca) point 1069-87;",98
84,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.46 p.m.)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. This is a technical amendment. The amendment makes a technical change to ensure that family tax payment will be payable to a person whose child is overseas, provided the person remains qualified for family payment.",99
85,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"I want briefly to highlight the administrative problems of this system. How will the government know that the child remains overseas unless there is some data matching exercise with Customs? Amendment agreed to. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) Cognate bills: NA BILL 1996 NA CHARGES BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 November, on  That the bill be now read a second time.",99
86,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"I take the opportunity in this debate on the Customs Amendment Bill (No.2) and cognate bills to go to the issue of priority in terms of this government's listing of business. I note that, while I am addressing this, there is not one member of the government front-bench at the table. I seem to recall their making a point of that in relation to us earlier today. This is the government that was going to lift standards and make itself more accountable, and yet it has not even got the Minister for Small  in the House, let alone anyone delegated for him. Mrs Gash-Like you used to do?",99
87,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"There is the question of the after priority that brings this bill to the House. We have to have a backbencher intervene to defend the non-existent, absent front-bench. Half of them will be absent in question time. There will be no Prime Minister, no Deputy Prime Minister, no Minister for Foreign Affairs and no Minister for Primary Industries and Energy at question time today, and yet they say they are more accountable! The priority that brings this bill to the House is disturbing, as is the impact of the measure itself. Let me just go back to the events that occurred on Tuesday night to demonstrate yet again the way in which this government treats the procedures of this House with contempt. We had an agreement on Tuesday night in debating some very important tax measures: one that sees cuts to research and development expenditures in this country which will, in turn, see research and development go overseas; the other which increases taxes on 1996 cooperatives, including a cooperative in the parliamentary secretary's own electorate of Braddon. Yet he sat by and allowed that tax to be implemented. We had an agreement: the opposition said that we would treat the bill as a whole and, therefore, not insist upon going through it clause by clause. We had an agreement that we would be able to move our four amendments, and that agreement was breached. It was breached because the government came into the place with the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) absent--celebrating his passage of resolution through the Senate of the IR bill. He was not even in the House to manage the agreement that he had entered into. The government would not let us move an amendment on cooperatives to support them, and we know that members of the National Party were prepared to cross the floor on it. The government would not allow us to move amendments that retained the 150 per cent tax concession and retained syndication.",99
88,Mr CADMAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"I rise on a point of order. There are plenty of forums in the House where the leader can speak about these things. He has advantages others do not have, but I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the matter of relevance: the subject under discussion is a customs bill, not what happened in the House last Tuesday.",99
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,Order! I call the honourable member's attention to the three bills that are concurrently before the House.,100
90,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"I am addressing them, Mr Deputy Speaker, because what is important is the circumstance in which this particular bill comes here in the first place. It is true that I will have plenty of opportunities to raise the disgraceful procedures that you are implementing in this House. This is one of them and I will use it because of the way in which you proceeded on Tuesday night to deny us the ability to move amendments when it had been agreed that we should. The other thing that we have here is the impact of the measures themselves. In all of the time that we have been debating it, we have not had the minister responsible for this particular measure in the House. The minister responsible for Customs is not in the House. I am pleased to say, though, that by the introduction of this particular bill, the minister has actually now declared that he has responsibility for something. I was beginning to believe that he was getting his ministerial salary under false pretences because every time we said he was responsible for something, to' demonstrate his conflict of interest, he said, 'No, I'm not responsible for that.' To give some examples: when we pointed out the minister's conflict of interest between his construction company, a private company that he still holds a directorship of and a substantial number of shares in, and his ministerial responsibility, his defence was that he was not responsible for construction. His words were memorable. I remind members of the House that he said, 'I've built a business. I've been out there in the heat and the dust working in the rain and the cold.' Mr Deputy Speaker, there was not a dry eye in the place when he told us that. But, unfortunately, having said he was not responsible for construction, he forgot to tell his department, because they went over to the Senate and, in the Senate estimates committee, said he was responsible for the building code. But next, when we pointed to the conflict of interest between his involvement",100

94,Mr CADMAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"I have drawn your attention to this matter once, Mr Deputy Speaker. I expect you to have the member comply with the matter before the House: the three Customs bills. He should confine his remarks to those three bills and not to any other matter.",100
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"The shadow minister and leader of opposition business was speaking to the Customs bill and about the minister's responsibilities. I think that that goes to the three bills that are concurrently before the House. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. I take offence at the last comment made by the member for Hotham about the member for Mitchell. He referred to him as a thug and I ask that he withdraw it.",100

97,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"I thought the person concerned had to be offended. I believe he is not offended; he likes the title. So I do not withdraw in those circumstances-unless the member asks me to withdraw. Mr Miles-No, I am offended by that.",100

99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,I leave it up to the honourable member.,100
100,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"I withdraw the statement. I just note that the person concerned was not offended. I was addressing the question of the minister's responsibilities, or lack of them, because it is relevant to this debate on Customs and the responsibilities which he is pursuing, as well as the stated aims when he took over this portfolio as to what he was going to achieve. I have mentioned one of the things that said he is not responsible for when he was caught up with conflict of interest. I mention another. On a previous occasion I pointed to his involvement in petrol retailing, again through his private company, again through his directorship of it, at the same time cating policy measures that would put money back into the pockets of petrol retailers. When we pointed this out to him, he said he was not responsible for that either. Even though he was minister for consumer affairs, he was responsible for petrol retailing. He was acting for some other minister in the circumstances. One could say that is a reasonable defence, but it is not what he was saying before meeting or after it. He went to the meeting. The question of the temperature control of petrol was on the agenda of the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs meeting. It was the reason he issued a press release on the matter under his title as minister for consumer affairs, and those press statements discussed that. ' the impact of the measure on consumers. Though he saw no need at the meeting itself to declare that he was representing another minister, it was his defence in this House when he got nailed. So I am pleased to say that we have got a minister who is responsible for doing something in his portfolio, because he has denied any involvement in other activities that we have nailed him on previservice, ously. Let me also go to the question of his responsibility for the diesel fuel rebate. minister, through his directorship and control of Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd, does deal in diesel fuel and he has got responthe sibility for administering the act that sets rates and conditions under which the diesel fuel rebate can be obtained. Yet, when this conflict of interest was pointed there was no conflict of interest here either because his companies are not eligible to claim the diesel fuel rebate. This is hardly the point. While diesel users claim the rebate, those who deal in diesel benefit from the rebate's retention, and that is still an issue on which the minister has not been prepared to address this House or his Prime Minister. I see he has finally turned up in the House. he He was not here to defend his bill. He has never defended himself, except for the blood and the toil and the teary-eyed speech, and he still will not come into this place and explain the blatant conflicts of interest inherent in his continued activities: diesel fuel rebate, conadvostruction, consumer affairs-you name them. As I said before, what is really involved in this is not the issue of whether there is evidence that the minister has deliberately sought to profit; it is the question of the appearance not of the conflict of interest. The appearance occurs over and over again with this minister. So it is pleasing to find today that the minister is responsible for something, because the he has been denying all along that he is responsible for the things that he has got caught on. I thought that you were obtaining your money under false pretences, Minister, because every time we identified issues that you are in conflict with, you said, 'No, I'm not responsible for that. No, I don't deal with I am pleased to see that he has actually got responsibility for something, and it has to deal with the Customs Service. I am sure that people who work in the Customs Service would have hoped that he ducked this issue too, because, when you look at the issues that he has involved himself in there-a $70 million cut over the next four years to the 105 jobs gone in Victoria, 65 in New South Wales, 60 in the ACT, 25 in Queensland, 20 in Western Australia, and the comThe plete ending of airport shiftwork-they would wish he had not been involved in this either.",100

103,Mr SPEAKER,JOINT MEETING,"Before calling the first question, I want to make a couple of comments about yesterday's events. I believe we should all agree that yesterday was a very significant day, a truly memorable occasion, and I want to take this opportunity to thank you and everybody else who was involved. The success of the visit of the President and Mrs Clinton was due in no small part to the commitment, professionalism and administrative and organisational skills of the staff of the various parliamentary departments, catering staff and others who had particular roles to play. There was an enormous amount of planning required in the lead-up to the visit and, of course, last-minute details and demands to be attended to on the day. Everything was dealt with with commendable efficiency and courtesy. It was an outstanding effort. Congratulations to you all. I also want to acknowledge the cooperation and patience shown by all occupants of the building on the day when there was of necessity some temporary inconvenience due to the increased security requirements. To all those who contributed in a positive way to the obvious warmth and goodwill generated by this special occasion, thank you most sincerely. It was a truly great day, and a great day for Australia. NA . Health Fund Premium Increases",102
104,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, do you recall saying on AM this morning, in seeking to defend the Prime Minister's failure and your own failure on the latest private health insurance premium increases, 'They have come in, both of them, with lower than would have happened otherwise'? Is the minister aware of the first paragraph of an MBF press release which states, 'A notification of contribution rates as originally submitted by MBF has been approved by the federal government'? Minister, doesn't this show that you and the Prime Minister did nothing more than delay the announcement of these increases so that you could hide behind the visit of President Clinton? Who is telling the truth, Ministeryou or MBF?",102
105,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not aware of MBF's press release. What I would say is that there were several submissions and I am not sure to which one they are referring, but the original submission that they would have made back in October was quite different from what was granted. All I can assume is, firstly, they have either made a mistake, or, secondly, they are referring to a later submission that they put to us. Health Ifund Premium Increases",102
106,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is also addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. I ask: is the minister aware of comments that private health insurance premium changes announced by two funds yesterday are 'massive', and that the changes to health fund products are hiding premium increases? How reliable, Minister, are these assertions? Is it not the case that the overwhelming factor in the need for necessary private health insurance premium changes is the lingering effect of 13 years of Labor government administration?",102
107,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He obviously has hit the point right on the head because the fact is that what we are experiencing now is the result of what the funds experienced over the 1995-96 financial year. Funds right across Australia had a pretty tough time then, and they are having a tough time now because the make-up of their membership base is changing. People who are over 65 are making up a greater proportion of people who have private health insurance. I say 65 because that is the age at which people generally draw more than a dollar having put a dollar in. This is in fact something that has happened progressively over a number of years. The trouble that the Labor Party has is that they basically do not like private health insurance. This was put very well in August by the former health minister, Graham Richardson, who said this: I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically the whole package died when I left the Labor Party because the Labor Party has always been a bit biased against private health insurance. In fact, you only have to look at their record. We hear the Labor Party bleating about premium increases, but between 1986 and 1988 they went up 40 per cent.",102
108,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,103
109,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What did you do about it? Nothing. You sat on your hands and you rubber-stamped every premium increase. And then, between 1991 and 1992, in the financial year, they went up by 17 per cent. So what you did was you hit the old, you hit the frail, you hit the 700,000 people who had incomes under $20,000 a year who still were clinging on to their private health insurance. And you did it because you are a bit biased against private health insurance. It was purely ideologically driven. And how did you do it? You did it very simply. You abolished the federal government's contribution to the reinsurance bill between 1983 and 1989, and you whacked $100 million onto the cost of premiums of private health insurance. You reduced the Commonwealth bed-day subsidy in September 1986 and you whacked another $135 million onto the cost of private health insurance. You then reduced the Medicare rebate for in-hospital services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent and you whacked that onto private health insurance premiums. According to Access Economics, that added, in today's dollars, $846 million onto the cost of private health insurance premiums. That means premiums today are 39 per cent higher than they would have been had you not taken those decisions. Now we see the crocodile tears, we hear the bleating, we hear the gnashing of the teeth, the tearing at the heartstrings, but basically you have always been a bit biased against private health insurance. With respect to these recent increases, yesterday Medibank Private and MBF announced that there would be premium increases. I approved the increase for MBF on Tuesday. I approved the increase for Medibank Private on Wednesday. When I say 'approved', I said that I had no grounds to disallow them. The fact is that, even if you look at those two premium increases, if you average all premiums over recent times, the average increase is a little bit more than six per cent. That is no different from the average increase between March and August. That compares to 12 per cent per year average that you let go through. If you have a look at between 1983 and 1996, you will see that the Labor ministers for health never once intervened. You gave it the tick, you gave it the rubber stamp and you let a 40 per cent increase in two years between 1986 and 1988 go through. I would prefer that there were no increases at all. At least with these two premium increases, I have been able to intervene. I have asked Medibank Private and MBF to go back and re-work their figures. I have asked them to look at their assumptions again, and they did. Not only have the premium increases that have come in been less than what they would have been otherwise-something you never did because you are a bit biased against private health insurance-but also they have been deferred, and that is good news for private health insurance. It is good news for the contributors. At least I am having a go. You never had the guts to. Health Fund Premium Increases",103
110,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Good news is it, Michael? It's good new, is it? My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does the mmlster stand by his claim this morning on the AM program that 'the average increase for MBF is 6.5 per cent'? Does this not assume that 300,000 MBF contributors will downgrade their existing cover? Is it not the case that currently 75 per cent of MBF contributors have no excess cover and will face a 15 per cent increase? Minister, if you claim that you are concerned about low income earners who are paying for private health insurance, are you concerned about the pensioners and the families who are MBF contributors who cannot afford to downgrade and cannot afford to take the risk of a signififamilies cant excess when they get sick? Is it not a fact that these people will have to pay that extra 15 per cent increase in their premiums as a result of your decision?",103
111,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have just been handed a copy of this MBF press release that the shadow minister is happy to quote from. It states, 'a rise in contribution rates of 6.5 per cent across the fund's memberships overall'. So MBF seems to think that it is 6.5 per cent as well. Mr Lee-Read the whole quote; don't be selective!",104

113,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I make no apology whatsoever for opening up a greater range of products to fund members. I make no apology at all. When I became minister, the funds were rigid and had very little flexibility. That provided the public no choice. I have made a deliberate decision to try and offer a greater flexibility of productsMr Lee-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the minister was asked whether he stands by that figure of 6.5 per cent. He is getting away from that specific question.",104
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is traversing a wide topic.,104
115,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last two-yearly TQA health survey on private health insurance, released in late 1995, shows that there is substantial opportunity with front-end deductible products. People want them. There is an opportunity there for new entrants, who have not been there before, to come into the market. I am going to actively encourage it. It has moved quite quickly in recent years: the number of people with front-end deductible products has gone from about five per cent of contributors to about 25 per cent. There is absolutely no reason to think that this should not continue. Families Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the benefits Australian are now receiving as a direct result of the government's economic policies?",104
116,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the coalition went to the last election, it went to it promising Australian families that it would stand by them.

117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is not playing cricket!,104
118,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And that it would cut Australian families back into the tax system in a way in which they had been forgotten under 13 years of Labor government. The proudest boast that this government can make is that legislation today passed the House to deliver on that fundamental commitment to Australian families. As a result of this government's legislative program and as a result of the budget that we brought down, on 1 January next year all Australian families who qualify under the family tax initiative are going to get a recognition of the cost of raising children and are going to be cut into the Australian tax system in a new way. This is a new deal for a new year for new Australian families from a new government with a new start. As a result, in relation to each child, there will be an increase of $1,000 in the tax-free threshold for qualifying families earning up to $70,000 Mr Tanner-Now point the finger, Peter.",104

120,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For single income families an increase of $2,500 in the tax-free threshold where at least one child is under the age of five years. For a qualifying family with two children, one under five, that means that their tax will be reduced by $34.60 a fortnight from 1 January next year. This underlines and demonstrates the coalition's commitment to Australia's families-the kinds of families that returned the member for Lindsay in increasing droves in the recent by-election, the kinds of families which have deserted the Labor Party after having been deserted by the Labor Party over 13 years. Low income families will also have the alternative of fortnightly cash assistance called the fortnightly tax payment. One of the things that makes this government proud about this new deal for Australian families is the way in which it delivers benefits right across the spectrum, especially to those on low incomes.",105

122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is too much noise in the chamber.,105
123,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a change to the tax system which, in tax dollars, is worth exactly the same to the low income earner as it does to the qualifying middle income eamer. It is a proud day for this government to be able to deliver on its family tax tive. We know that the 1993 tax promise of the Labor Party, the l-a-w tax cuts, has never been delivered till this day.

126,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question directed to the Treasurer relates to the 15 per cent increase in premiums that were previously discussed. Treasurer, the Minister for Health and Family Services claimed this morning that these massive private health insurance premium increases had to be approved before the Productivity Commission reports in February-everything was supposed to be held off until then-because, to quote the minister, 'We can't let the funds go broke.' Isn't it the case that at least one of the funds which had approved increases of up to 15 per cent had reserves which were almost twice the minimum level when these increases were approved? Given your central role in this process, can you explain your approval for these massive premium increases?",105
127,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister for Health and Family Services has indicated, he has looked at the required criteria and, in conjunction with the Prime Minister and me, determined that the increases, as he negotiated, were approved. In relation to prudential requirements, the government of course always has an eye for prudential requirements and makes sure that they are justly taken into account-and they were. But let me say in relation to the comments the minister for health has already made, what strategy did Labor ever have to reverse declining private health insurance? Nothing. It not only presided over the decline of it but had no strategy to reverse it. As a result, there was no change whatsoever that could have delivered any behavioural response in relation to private health insurance. So how ill does it initia- fit in your mouth to now complain about fees?",105
128,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise to take a point of order which goes to relevance. It was a very clear-cut question related specifically to the point about the inclusion or otherwise in his consideration as to whether or not there were adequate funds in the reserves of the health companies which received approval. It was a specific question with no generality associated to it at all. Therefore, what he is saying now must surely be irrelevant to it.",105
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. The Treasurer is using some wide-ranging examples before he focuses on the specifics.,105
130,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Of course, I have addressed the prudential requirements which were taken into account by the minister for health and detailed to the Prime Minister and me. But the real point is this: what strategy did Labor have to try to stem the decline or tum it around? Nothing. Thirteen years of nothing. No movement. In comes a coalition government and as matter of priority it sits down and says, 'Let's put the incentive in place to reverse the decline.' Not only did this coalition government give incentives to low income earners; this coalition government had the guts to do something that Labor never would: in the budget it gave an incentive for the high income earner to take out private health insurance. We also know, by the way, that the Labor Party would have liked to have done it but, because Paul Keating refused to take out private health insurance, your whole government was stymied on the issue. So how ill does it fit in your mouths to be complaining about premium increases? If Labor had been in government, the premiums increases would have continued with no offsetting government response. Now we have an offsetting government response to stem the decline, to tum it around. This is the response which was required by leadership, and that is why we undertook it. NA",105

We welcome you to Australia, sir. May you enjoy your visit with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Industrial Relations",106
132,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is minister aware of comments reported today in the Australian Financial Review that the government's changes to the functions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission have altered the focus of that tribunal for the better? Can the minister confirm for the benefit of the House the substance of Justice Kirby's observations on the government's new industrial relations scheme?,106
133,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Some very interesting remarks from Mr Justice Kirby are reported in the Australian Financial Review. On the basis of that report, I believe he is correct in his observations that under the government's reforms the commission has a crucial role to play in protecting vulnerable workers. Whilst the commission's role will be different, its status and involvement will certainly be integral to the effective functioning of the new system. I am very pleased to be able to join with the Treasurer today as he announces the passage of the legislation which gives people a big tax cut from I January. I am also pleased to say that this morning the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill went through the lower house, completed its passage in the parliament, to give Australia a new industrial relations system from I January. Mr CosteU-h, a great New Year's Day. Mr Reith-It will be a great New Year's Day, as the Treasurer says. It means that we have modernised the role of the commission and in some respects its role will be enhanced. For example, in relation to the unfair dismissal law, applications will go to the commission. Its dispute settlement role will be emphasised. Its role in the maintenance of the award safety 1).et is to be reinforced. It has an important job there. In respect of certified agreements, it will also administer the no disadvantage test. It will assess proposed Australian workplace agreements referred from the Employment Advocate where approval against the no disadvantage test is considered to be doubtful. It will also have a continuing role to make the orders to ensure equal remuneration. It will prepare a report on junior wage rates, which will be very important in the debate about junior wage rates. It will handle revised arrangements for assessing proposals for federal award coverage, the registration of new unions and altered coverage of existing unions. It will also supervise the award simplification process, which is very important. What that really means is that, in a practical legislative sense, our policy now is there for all to see.",106
134,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is this your pitch for Foreign Minister?,107
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Banks!,107
136,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are going forward and implementing that policy. While the focus has been on the government's package, no-one should let escape the fact that, whilst we were putting down our policy for industrial relations, the Labor Party was having its policy dictated to it by the ACTU as it was putting down it policy. What we now know-and it may seem a long way off but it should not be forgottenis that, when we get to the next election, the only party that can upset the continuing implementation of the genuine reform that we have commenced, the only party that can put an alternative, is the Labor Party. I will tell you what their alternative is, because they have been moving these amendments. Their alternative policy for the next election is to scrap sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act to give their mates in the trade union movement a privileged position. You won't believe it, but their policy now is also to bring back Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal law. It makes you the laughing stock of Australian politics for this to be your position. You have moved those amendments in the upper house. You are opposed to award simplification, so that means you want awards to be more prescriptive than ever. You want to tie up business with red tape in a way they have never been tied before and from which we are unshackling them in this legislation. You want to put a cap on damages for your mates in the trade union movement-another classic immunity for your mates in the trade union movement. You would destroy the jobs of young people by abolishing junior wage rates. Finally, we were fascinated that, at the behest of your trade union mates, in the Senate you opposed our disamalgamation provisionsthat I can understand-and you then opposed altogether any prospect of dis amalgamation for any unionists. That can only mean, of Course, that if you are ever re-elected you would give the green light again to the super union process which has been a complete failure for rank and file trade unionists. This act says a lot about our policy but it also gives people a very clear idea of Labor's industrial relations policy. We will be very happy to remind you of it all the way to the next election. Telecommunications Towers",107

138,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to try to answer the member's question. This matter is a long, detailed and complex issue. Mr Crean-It sounds like you cannot do it.",107
139,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I do understand it. One person in this House who can understand it would be me, Mr Crean. It is a genuine question and it concerns many peop-e in this House. The point that must be made IS that in 1991 a code was put in place to deal with these issues of the roll-out of the relevant networks. That code was championed by the present Leader of the Opposition when he was minister for communications. How quickly we forget, but you were the one. Mr Costello-Oh, him?",107
140,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, this fellow. That code was put in place by your government and that code has been found wanting. That code is now being reassessed by the government. Senator Alston, the minister for communications, is in detailed discussions with the Australian Local Government Association, the backbench committee and the cabinet to put in place a meaningful code to ensure we get the benefits of enhancing competition in telecommunications, to ensure we get a reduction in prices for - he benefit of consumers, at the same time taking account of the concerns of local communities about the aesthetics of cable roll-out and so on. I can assure the Independent member for Moore that this government will take seriously the responsibilities that it has to ensure we come up with a code that will cater for the concerns of all members of this House, particularly those government members who expressed concerns about this matter. We expect Senator Alston to announce shortly some changes to the new national code which will take account of those concerns and will remedy the deficit which we were left with in the code given to us by the Labor opposition. Petroleum Resource Rent Tax",107
141,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Yesterday, the Treasurer announced that the Commonwealth, Victoria and the Bass Strait gas producers had entered into an agreement which will resolve the long running dispute over the liability for petroleum resource rent tax on Bass Strait gas production. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the prospective benefits for consumers resulting from this agreement?",108

144,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I indicate on behalf of the Commonwealth,108
145,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your ruling?,108
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I have called the Treasurer.,108
147,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicate on behalf of the Commonwealth that the settlement of the long running dispute over liability for petroleum resource rent tax on Bass Strait gas production between Victoria, the gas utilities and their suppliers is a great milestone in relation to a long running dispute which has held up much needed reform in the gas industry in Australia. The resolution of the dispute has major economic benefits. The Financial Review today said 'What a gas! Everyone wins!' I indicate that this outcome was negotiated between me and the Victorian Treasurer in relation to the tax aspects over the last two weeks in relation to intensive negotiations. I would like to thank him, as he has thanked me, for the way in which our teams of offithat cials worked together to resolve this dispute under very difficult circumstances. The essence of the dispute was over the imposition of the resource rent tax. The outcome of the dispute is that approximately $1 billion will be paid to the producers, producing about $620 million in windfall tax to the Commonwealth, $550 million of which will be passed back to the state of Victoria. That is not the only part of the settlement. That pass back required an appropriation which the opposition cooperated in passing through the parliament this morning. I thank them for their contribution and I thank them for the cooperation that they showed in relation to that. However, the good thing about this is that it now opens the way for more competition in the gas industry, for new pipelines to be built, for other regulatory barriers to be removed, to join a single market between New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland, and to have the ending of monopoly arrangements where one supplier and one producer had monopoly in a particular area. Hotter competition and more choice will make sure that there are opportunities for consumers, both domestic and industrial, to get cheaper gas. This will help our international competitiveness. This will mean that it will give bendits to Australian business and Australian producers and it will give opportunities to the businesses that rely on gas for their energy supplies to reduce costs. This is a win-win-win situation-win for Victoria, win for Esso-BHP, win for the Commonwealth but, most of all, a win for business and a win for consumers. Health Fund Premium Increases",108
148,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, I remind you again of your statement on the AM program, when you said: The average increase for MBF is 6.S per cent. I also remind you of your quote from the MBF press release in which you claimed that it said that the rise in contribution rates was 6.5 per cent across the fund's membership overall. Minister, do you agree that the full quote from the MBF press release is as follows: . . . the anticipated effect of the expected movement of members into and up the excess packages, is a rise in contribution rates 6.5 per cent across the Fund's membership overall. Minister, will you now concede that you have misled the listeners of the AM program misled this House because you have assumed that 300,000 contributors will take up packages? Will you now concede that 75 per cent of MBF's contributors who do not have cent? excess packages will face 15 per cent increases?",108
149,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have assumed nothing. I have just assumed what MBF have assumed. They are the ones that have made the assumption. What the Labor Party cannot cope with is that the press release also says that in many cases people will have the cost out of order. of their cover reduced. The cost of people's cover may actually go down. That is because we have actively encouraged a range of new products. Mr Lee-You have selectively quoted and you have misled the House.,109
150,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dobell has asked his question.,109
151,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have allowed greater flexibility in products to give people greater choice because we do not have the minister hang-ups that you have with private health insurance. And this is good news for the uses, Australian public. The real hypocrisy of all of this, the hypocrisy of all of this, is that you sat on your hands for 13 years and did nothing. You sat on your hands for 13 years and whacked costs onto private health insurance premiums. You made the premiums 39 per cent higher than they needed to be. You did not in any way modify a single application in 13 years. Mr Lee-But you have misled the House.",109
152,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have at least gone in there and tried to get a better deal for Australian fund contributors. The increase across all funds in the last few months has 1Sbeen an average of six per cent-March to April, it was six per cent. You had an average of 12 per cent a year when you were in office and nothing will hide your failure, nothing will hide your inactivity, and you will wear changes, with the it day after day .",109
153,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a suppleof mentary question. I note the minister's claim that he has made no assumptions-and that is on the record, thank you. I ask the minister: and will he now concede that 75 per cent of MBF's contributors-those poor families that excess you mentioned before-who don't have excess packages will face increases of 15 per",109
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will allow the supplementary question. Mr Reith-Oh, no. Mr Speaker, on a point of order: that should not be allowed. It is not elucidating an answer; it is simply repeating the question. On that basis, it should be ruled",109
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have listened to the point of order. There is no point of order. I invite the Minister for Health and Family Services to add to his answer.,109
156,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Off the top of my head, I don't know whether that figure is right but I probably should have checked itMr Bevis-Well, why didn't you check? Mr Lee-You should have.",109
157,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because the shadow was using it this morning and, if it is as shonky as a lot of the other figures he it is probably wrong. The fact is that the average increase will be as MBF said. I have gross read it across out of their press release. Mr Lee-But you should know. You approved it.",109
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dobell has had two bites of the cherry.,109
159,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If some people have the opportunity through new products to actually have lower premiums that is good news. But, yes, I do admit I cannot tell you off the top of my head what the membership structure of one of Australia's 47 health funds",109
160,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So you don't know. Is this the detailed consideration you gave it?,109
161,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Quite frankly, you probably didn't even know health funds existed until nine months ago. Aboriginals: Defence Force",110
162,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Has the minister seen reports concerning army support for remote communities which suggest that the army will be involved in widespread construction projects in remote Aboriginal communities? Can the minister inform the House whether these reports are accurate?,110
163,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parkes for his question. There have been a number of media reports which have suggested the army will be conducting widespread construction tasks in some remote Aboriginal communities. I just wanted to clear this matter up because these reports are not entirely accurate and require clarification. The ATSIC army community assistance project developed from a meeting between the Prime Minister and the members of the A TSIC council on 23 October this year. It was announced by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 15 November. This project is designed to enhance ATSIC capabilities to improve water and related health infrastructure, and honourable members opposite should be interested in that. Discussions are under way with ATSIC to identify tasks where the assistance can be utilised. I want to emphasise that it is the army's role to involve itself in design management and participate in projects on the ground in a small number of the most needy communities. In other words, its role is to involve itself in the management design of a pilot project to get the show on the road. So the aim is to establish models for future projects that would involve civilian contractors and local communities down the track. The army will cover its own salary costs and the project costs will be met by ATSIC and by Health. The benefits to army will obviously lie in the training experience that will be gained, and the priority needs to be identified by A TSIC, and the benefits to the community speak for themselves. New South Wales Public Hospital Funding",110
164,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister confirm that the federal government intends to slash $1 million a week out of New South Wales public hospital funding? Did the minister promise in his health policy not to cut public hospitals to pay for the failed private health insurance incentives? Is the minister concerned that Dr John Yu, the Australian of the Year, has criticised the government's policy as an attack on battlers? Can the minister also explain the timing of the announcement? Is the minister asking the Australian people to believe that it was just coincidental that the announcement was made following the Lindsay by-election and on the same day as President Clinton's visit?",110
165,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not $1 million a week. The figures are wrong. It is over a whole financial year. For New South Wales, it is $34 million which, quite honestly, is about $1 in $4 of what we would be entitled to take if we were taking back the cost shiftmg. There is a problem here. I do not like having to do it, but there is one reason I have to do it. While successive Labor ministers bleated and wrung their hands and said how terrible cost shifting was, they did nothing about it. It has been left to me in this area, as best well as to so many others, to fix up your mess. As to the timing, the announcement was project made on 20 August in the budget. Apprenticeships",110
166,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of comments about the difficulties employers experience taking on apprentices under Labor's complex and bureaucratic training system? Can the minister outline to the House what action the government is taking to improve the system?",110
167,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He is a member who has been very concerned about disadvantaged young people in his electorate and has spoken to me on many occasions about them. It is, therefore, entirely understandable that he is interested in the new initiatives of the government to increase opportunities for young people to train for real jobs. Unfortunately, as a result of the training policies that were put in place by the previous government, employers have been faced over the last 13 years with very substantial bureaucratic hurdles when they have wanted to employ an apprentice or a trainee. The fact that their policies have been dictated largely by the ACTU has meant that many small and medium sized businesses have been very hesitant to take on trainees because they do not want to invite a trade union into a previously non-unionised workplace. The government is committed to greatly simplifying the training system and opening opportunities for young people. One of the important initiatives in this regard is going to be the introduction of one-stop apprenticeship shops, which will streamline the process for employers of hiring an apprentice or a trainee and ensure that employers have ready access to our new flexible and simplified national training arrangements. These one-stop apprenticeship shops will have under one roof a number of services currently offered by a range of agencies both Commonwealth and state. They will provide a streamlined service in relation to both state and Commonwealth training regulations. They will also help businesses to process new flexible training arrangements and establish accredited on-the-job training and quality offthe-job training. I have no doubt that one of the reasons why the member for Leichhardt has asked me this question is that Australia's first one-stop apprenticeship shop will be established shortly in his electorate in Cairns. It is an unprecedented agreement between the federal government and the Queensland government to establish three of these one-stop shops over the next few months. The Cairns pilot will be a partnership between the CES and the Queensland department of training. It will be sponsored by the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry and it will have a board of management comprising industry and government representatives. The federal government is also negotiating with other state and territory governments to establish further one-stop apprenticeship shops throughout Australia. The significance of this is that the government has once again delivered on the promise it made during the election campaign to provide training for young people which leads on to real jobs and to ensure that the training arrangements in this country are not those dictated by the ACTU but are those which meet the needs of business, large and small, for training which leads on to greater productivity, greater profitability and more jobs. Economy",110
168,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen today's company profits figures from the ABS which show that, following a very sharp decline in the June quarter, trend profits were down again by 1.3 per cent in September and were down by 2.3 per cent compared with the same time last year? Has the Treasurer also seen the Westpac leading index of economic activity and the coincident index, both of which were released yesterday, both of which are significantly down for September and which together point to a very pessimistic outlook for activity at least until the middle of next year? Given this kind of evidence now emerging day after day after day, will the Treasurer now concede that it is not the opposition talking the economy down but government policy driving it down?",111
169,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the answers to the question are yes, yes, no. But in relation to the speech that was given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would like to say a few things. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was obviously floundering and is, obviously, as I have said, not in command of any economic policy on behalf of the opposition. He gets up here and regularly gives us a little economic commentary on figures. Like his economic commentary which said that our policy could never bring down credit card rates, four days before it did. Like his commentary when he came in here saying that the monthly unemployment figures would wipe the smile off the face of the government, when jobs increased by 25,000. Like the statement when he came in here and said that consumer confidence was flat, when it leapt eight points off the back of a half a point cut in official interest rates. Whatever he says is going down is going up. Whatever he says is going up is going down. His head is spinning until he comes to a dead end. In relation to the company profits, the fact is that company profits rose by 0.3 per cent in the September quarter. They rose. It is true that there was a big decline in the June quarter, but that was before any measures on any basis that the government had put in place could have taken any effect. In relation to the measures we have put in place, of course cuts in official interest rates will in next year.",111
170,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,112
171,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When would you like the cuts in official interest rates to kick in? Before they were made? Was that your idea? Was it your idea that they should cut in before they were made? If they were made in July and November, they should have cut in by June? The fact is that you cut official interest rates, and they kick in subsequent to the cut. These cuts will kick in in 1997. I think I said in the House the other day that one of the problems in the small business sector has been in relation to the house building industry. The opposition had a supply problem grow over the last couple of years, where supply was outstripping demand by a very large percentage. We expect the supply and demand to be coming back more into equivalence, and we expect a pick up in 1997. We are putting in place changes in relation to interest rates. We have put in place changes in relation to capital gains tax. We are putting in place changes in relation to the provisional tax uplift factor. We are putting in place changes in relation to family tax incentives. All we hear from the opposition, as the Minister for Industrial Relations said, is a position from right back when they were in the unreconstructed days of Brere-onism in relation to industrial relations, from the unreconstructed days of Creanism, and from the doubly unreconstructed days of Fergusonism. That was back in the dinosaur age. When we had our friends in the gallery before, I thought we could have sent the opposition around to talk to them about perestroika. That might have made some difference in relation to your attitude on industrial relations. It is important that we put in place the measures that are going to tum things around. Of course the biggest thing in relation to the budget was to tum around the legacy of deficit and debt. There is only one way to grow this economy on a sustained basis-that is, by addressing the two failures of Labor that gave us speed limits in relation to the kick current account deficit and in relation to inflation. They are the measures that you in opposition are opposing. I do not know whether it has dawned on you yet, but you are opposing the measures that can put the Australian economy onto a path of sustainable growth. You, the Labor Party, are opposing them. The shadow Treasurer said, 'Well, our policy would actually be to balance the budget over three years,' which is what the budget did. And he said it the day after the budget. All I can say in relation to the economic position of the opposition is that, where there is no understanding, there is no conscience. Because opposition members do not understand what their position is, they get up and make these little statements which are taking them nowhere. Mr GARETH EV ANS- Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Rising out of the Treasurer's reference to his triumph on credit cards earlier in the week, is he aware that, of the 157 cards offered by banks and financial institutions, only three as of Tuesday had dropped their interest rates by the full one per cent? Is he aware that less than one in five banks and financial institutions have passed on any rate cut at all?",112
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This question is outside the terms of the original question. The question is out of order. Meat and Livestock Industry,112
173,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Acting Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware of the substantial interest in my electorate and other regions across Australia in the Australian meat and livestock 'Reform for the future' task force report? What further consultations will be held on this task force report?,113
174,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Richmond for the question and also note his interest in the subject. On coming to government, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy put some priority action into our structure of the meat industry in Australia. One of the ways we can measure this great meat industry in Australia is by the value of exports from this nation. Beef and sheep meats annually contribute over $2.8 billion of export wealth to this country. The meat industry is also a substantial employer in regional Australia. It is not only a great wealth creator for regional Australia, but also a great wealth creator for this nation. The Minister for - rimary Industries and Energy, on coming mto government, said that he wanted to ensure that the meat industry in Australia was put on the best possible footing to cope with the challenges that lie ahead in the 21 st century. That report has been brought forward to the - inister, on 31. October this year, gIven a commItment to the meat mdustry to consult widely across Australia with the participants in the meat industry. He will be assisted by the member for Dawson, who not only has a great interest in the meat industry but also has a very long involvement in the meat industry as a producer in her own right along with her husband. Quite obviously, members on the other side have very little to do with and very, very little understanding of the meat industry.",113
175,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We know you are a meat head!,113
176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Banks.,113
177,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And that is demonstrated by the rejection of you by people in regional Australia at the last election. The minister will commence those consultations at the end of this month and into December. As I said, he will be assisted by the member for Dawson in those consultations around Australia. On the completion of that consultation, the minister will bring a report forward to the cabinet with his recommendations. The reforms in the structure of the meat industry, coupled with the industrial relations reforms which were passed through this House, will set the meat industry in Australia on the path t? meet and make the most of the opportunitIes that present themselves in the 21 st century. Minister for Finance",113
178,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Following the information provided to the Senate by the Assistant Treasurer concerning the Finance Minister's unpaid loan from Lochreagh P/L, I ask: why did the minister fail to declare this outstanding loan in his pecuniary interest return both to the parliament and to the Prime Minister? Further, if for well over four years the minister made no attempt to repay the loan, shouldn't this money have been declared as income under section 108 of the tax act? How does the minister explain to the ordinary battling taxpayer how he received a substantial amount of money without paying it back .and he has or paying tax on it?",113
179,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to questions Nos 9 and 10 or so from the opposition, Mr Speaker, you know the opposition will run back to shares every single day. So devoid of issues are they, so much difficulty and trouble are they in, that they have to come back to the distractions because they have absolutely nothing else to contribute to the debate in this parliament. I can indicate that the assumption the member makes about a substantial amount of money is, I assure you, not right. The only interest that particular company has is in a house property. It is a fibro cottage. It is occupied by my parents, who are both in their 80s, and it is paid for by myself and my sister each single month. The company has no revenue, and I am advised by my accountant that there is no tax implication. Government members-Shame! Shame!",113
180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right! Order! Resume your seats!,114
181,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my supplementary question is this: why then did Senator Kemp earlier this week in the Senate say there had been a loan to the directors which is unpaid? How much was the loan for? Will you repay the loan or pay tax on it?",114
182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is in order. Mr Latham interjecting,114
183,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! You have asked your question.,114
184,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Assistant Treasurer did indicate to the Senate that there was a loan to myself and my wife and that it is being repaid in a normal manner. Medical Specialists: Rural Training Program,114
185,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister inform the House how the government is addressing the long standing shortage of medical specialists, especially surgeons, in rural Australia in places like Murray?",114
186,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As well as a shortage of general practitioners in rural we face a shortage of specialists. If one looks at Mr Ronaldson-I don't think it will do your career any good, Mark!",114
187,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think we will wait until we read the papers tomorrow before we worry about anyone's career.,114
188,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is too much noise in the chamber. The member for Denison, I will not call you again.",114
189,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If one looks at the age structure of the surgical work force, it would appear that things are actually going to get worse before they get better, given that many of the surgeons in rural areas are old and approaching retirement certainly in the next lO years. This is a particular worry because surgeons are just as important in major regional centres as general practitioners are in more remote centres. One of the difficulties has been that surgical training has been largely confined to large city hospitals and there has been no separate rural training program for surgeons. I am very pleased to say that, somewhat due to the work of the member for Murray, I have had a number of meetings now with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. The college is proposing a new, separate rural training program for surgeons. This is very exciting because it offers the prospect that, for the first time, a young doctor on graduation could go to a country area and do all their training in the country rather than having to go to big city hospitals if they want to specialise. It would mean that, in Victoria, someone could go to Geelong, Shepparton, Moe or Warrnambool, they could sit the first part surgical exam there and then be eligible to be chosen for the surgical training program. The college of surgeons is proposing a new training program that specifically trains people in the needs of rural surgery. Rural surgery is different from city surgery in two respects: one is that rural surgeons need to be trained in obstetrics and the second is that rural surgeons get much more accident and emergency work than a normal general surareas, geon would. The proposal is to increase surgical training from four years to five years and to have two terms rotating through accident and emergency and through obstetrics. This is very exciting. It offers the prospect of surgical training over and above existing numbers. It offers the prospect of a specific rural surgical training scheme with the mentoring, with the resources and with the special skills that rural surgeons can provide. I commend the honourable member for Murray for her work in working this up and for the support she has given. I commend the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. The government is going to do absolutely everything it can to see that this comes to fruition. Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Is it the case that, as reported in the Australian Financial Review today, Australia's major initiative for APEC-a proposal for free trade in primary energy products by 2000, which was also the centrepiece of the Prime Minister's first major speech on APEC in August-is dead in the water? Given that Australia's other major APEC proposal for a regional business travel card is also reported to be limping, is it not the case that next week's APEC meeting is looming as another major foreign policy embarrassment for the coalition government?",114
190,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government places enormous importance on next week's APEC meeting. The Prime Minister will be attending that conference in order to press the momentum for trade liberalisation within APEC and globally-the matter he discussed with President Clinton yesterday. The Prime Minister proposed at a meeting in Sydney on 1 August that APEC examine the idea of free trade in primary energy before APEC's 201 0 and 2020 target dates, and perhaps by the year 2000. This was because the reliable and efficient provision of energy was fundamental to economic growth in the region. It was estimated that removing tariff measures by 2000 in primary energy would increase APEC's real GDP by around $4.5 billion annually. As a major energy exporter, Australia would stand to share in these benefits. The government believes that that proposal will take close consideration, and that consideration may take some time. The Minister for Trade and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy are actively pursuing the proposal. As one might imagine, pursuing the proposal will be a matter of extensive discussions and consultations which will continue leading up to this week's meeting. In relation to the business visa, discussions on that are still continuing through the APEC forum. The government has had some positive responses to this initiative. The government expects to have more in the coming days. Lobbyists Forum Mr HOCKEY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Mr Laurie Ferguson-It is better than public meetings, isn't it?",115
191,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is. Why has the government abolished the register of lobbyists?",115
192,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The history of the register of lobbyists goes back quite some time. It was established by the Hawke government following the Combe-Ivanov affair. It applied only to a narrow class of lobbyists defined as 'a person or company who, for financial or other advantage, represented a client in dealings with government ministers or officials', but, frankly, it was a toothless tiger and its provisions were really unenforceable. There is some evidence that the requirements of the scheme were just not being adhered to. In 1993, 1994 and 1995, only eight inquiries were made with the register of lobbyists. There has also been quite a bit of criticism that the register was not available for public scrutiny and that the scheme was an unnecessary hindrance to the business sector. I believe that the need for the register has been overtaken by general changes to the government processes, particularly in light of the active roles taken by the ministers of this government to ensure that their relevant community and business interests are consulted in the decision making process. There will be a revision to the guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility. It is to be amended next year. There will be additional guidelines for ministers to observe when dealing with lobbyists. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. ADDITIONAL RESPONSES TO QUESNA Migrants",115
193,Mr SPEAKER,TIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I understand that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs wants to add to an answer in response to a question from the member for Oxley.,115
194,Mr RUDDOCK,TIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On Tuesday, the member for Oxley asked me a question in my role as Minister representing the Minister for Social Security in this House about the provision of special benefits for newly arrived migrants. I am now able to provide some additional information that might help on that subject. Newly arrived migrants who have been in Australia for fewer than 26 weeks and are therefore unable to receive unemployment payments may be eligible for a special benefit if they meet the strict hardship and income tests for that payment. Since 1 April 1996, the hardship test has included the requirement that new migrants must have suffered a significant change in circumstances for reasons beyond their control since arriving in Australia. As at September 1996, 227 migrants were receiving special benefit, because the existing 26-week newly arrived residents waiting period precluded them from job search, newstart, youth training allowances. It is not possible to provide a figure on value of the special benefit paid to new migrants. Special benefit is paid at a discretionary rate which cannot exceed the maximum rate of news tart allowance, which is currently paid at $320.20 per fortnight for a single person over 21 years. Special benefit is reduced by $1 for each dollar of income earned. The rate is also reduced for any in kind support; for example, if the person receives free board and/or lodging. NA NA",116
195,Mr FAHEY,IRELAND," Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the House. On Sunday of last week Senator Liam Naughten, the President of the Irish Senate, tragically died in a car accident in Ireland. Senator Naughten was aged 52 and was elected firstly to the House of Representatives in Ireland in 1981. He subsequently lost his seat in the lower house and was re-elected to the Senate where he progressed through to be the equivalent of the President of the Senate a short time later. The cultural and friendship ties which the Australian people have with the Irish community warrant this matter being raised in the House of Representatives today to pay respect in the tragic circumstances of the senator's death, to recognise that at this time his family-his wife and his daughters-are certainly going through that period of grief and, as I have indicated, to recognise very fully the close association there is between this parliament and the Australian people and the Irish Dail and the Irish people. He was known throughout this period in parliament as being a very fair man. He came from the west coast of Ireland. He had a great interest as a farmer in all matters relating to the land. My own family, who still have very small-I assure all honourable members on the other side-holdings on the west coast of Ireland, benefited from the representation that the deceased senator made on behalf of the farmers of Ireland. I raise this matter today in respect for the Irish parliament and the family or sickness of the deceased senator.",116
196,Mr TED GRACE,IRELAND,"I the would like to be associated with the remarks of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and I echo his words. I first met Senator Naughten on a visit to the old country some years ago. I found him to be a very sensitive man. In spite of the fact that he probably never really made the big time in Irish politics, he nevertheless was a great spokesman for his representatives, the small farming community, and was a spokesman on health matters. He was also prominent when he led a delegation of the Irish parliament to Australia recently. His death, as the minister indicates, was a great sadness to us all. I want to be associated with the words of the Minister for Finance.",116
197,Mr SPEAKER,IRELAND,"I thank the member for Fowler. Whilst this is not a formal condolence motion, I understand that the honourable member for Ballarat would like to make a few remarks as well.",116
198,Mr RONALDSON,IRELAND,"BallaratParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (3.10 p.m.)-The member for Bruce (Mr Griffin), the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and I were on a parliamentary delegation some three or four weeks ago and met Senator Naughten. He was an extraordinarily generous man who spoke very highly of the enormous number of friends he had made both in this House and in the other place. I am sure I speak for my colleagues when I echo the sentiments of both gentlemen who have spoken before me.",116
199,Mr SPEAKER,IRELAND,I thank all members for their generous comments. Be assured that the President of the Senate and I will be writing separately to the bereaved members of the family. NA Member for Cowper,117
200,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question to you and it relates to an incident in place on Tuesday night in which the member for Cowper was seen to move from one side of the chamber to the other after you had appointed tellers for a division, an action which clearly breaches standing order 202 and which is confirmed by a viewing of the tape. Mr Speaker, will you review the tape of the incident and confirm to the House that a breach of standing order 202 did occur? Given that the member for Cowper is the Deputy Speaker and, therefore, is well aware of the provisions of standing order 202, will you instruct the member for Cowper to apologise to the House?",117
201,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Hotham for his question to me. I have been distracted somewhat over the last 24 hours by other events and have not yet had occasion to view the tape. It was brought to my attention on the evening, as many of you will recall. I did address a question to the member for Cowper. I will look at the tape and take the matter further as I see fit. Member for Hotham",117
202,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have another question to you, Mr Speaker. A viewing of the tape of Tuesday night will also illustrate that I was deliberate obstructed by the Treasurer in attellJpting to move to the dispatch box. Indeed, I even have a bruise to prove it. Will you report to the HouseMr Costello-Show us!",117
203,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"No, it's only Alex who shows his leg.",117
204,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member for Hotham is addressing a question to me, as I understand it. The Leader of the Opposition is not helping matters.",117
205,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I cannot show the bruise. It is only the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is prepared to expose his leg. Mr Speaker, will you report to the House whether such behaviour is appropriate for this place and ascertain whether it was in breach of standing orders? Will you also report on what action you will take to ensure that such a breach by the Treasurer does not occur again?",117
206,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I am surprised that the this matter was not brought to my attention on the night. However, I will look at the matter separately and report to the House as I see fit. I hope this does not reflect the fact that you did not meet President Clinton yesterday. I thought you may feel aggrieved for some other reason.",117
207,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Only that I was prevented from moving a suspension of standing orders that would have enabled us to move by agreement with the other side what they had said we could-and then sought to prevent it.,117
208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As I said, I will reflect further on the matter after viewing the tape, unless the Treasurer wants to involve himself in the discussion. Mr Costello-I do not, particularly. It is taken as a matter of great jest from a North Melbourne supporter on the other side of the House, but if the tribunal is going to introduce trial by video I want to make it entirely clear that any offence to the member for Hotham and any bruising to his legs which may have caused him pain and suffering amongst any of his friends are deeply regretted by me. Joint House Department: House Cleaners",117
209,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"You should note that the bruising was behind the game. Mr Speaker, could you please inform the House about the cause of the dispute involving house cleaners, members of the LHMU? Is it true that they are to go on strike for 48 hours next week? Is the Joint House Department taking any action to avoid this strike? The Treasurer might laugh about the needs of battlers, the cleaning staff, for whom the strike will mean a significant loss in pay. They would rather not go on strike and cause any inconvenience to the members of this House, their staff and all the people who work in this place as well as the thousands visitors to this place. I know the potential inconvenience does not worry the Treasurer but it does worry most members. Will you take steps to quickly find a fair and decent resolution to this dispute?",117
210,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have only recently become aware of this problem, but I do have a couple of points to make. I understand that there was a stop-work meeting from 0700 hours to 0800 hours this morning involving the staff of Limro, the Parliament House cleaning contractor. I further understand the meeting was called to discuss supervisory and staffing issues, some of which are already before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, with the next hearing scheduled for 28 November. Limro are discussing the issues with the union and, with the assistance of the organisation, the Confederation of ACT Industry, they will be seeking an earlier conference to resolve the issues. The Joint House Department, which are responsible for the cleaning services in Parliament House, monitoring the situation to ensure the minimisation of the impact of any industrial action which may eventuate. I will continue my investigations and inform the House further as appropriate. Australian Flag",118
211,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you would have noticed that the Australian flag, an important symbol of our nation, is present in this chamber almost grudgingly as an afterthought, unlike the central position given to national flags in some other parliaments. You would also be aware of the fact that the government has moved to ensure that the Australian flag is protected and can never be changed without a plebiscite of the Australian people. Mr Speaker, would you be prepared to consult with the Leader of the House to discuss how the flag could be displayed prominently in a position of honour in this chamber?",118
212,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher. I know this is a problem that is very much in the view and purview of the honourable member for Wannon. We do of have some ongoing discussions about national flag placement within the chamber. I will happily take up the issue with the Leader of the House, in the hope that we can evolve further and satisfactory resolution to your query. Parliamentary Library",118
213,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The Parliamentary Library has advised me that delivery of items from the Parliamentary Library to members' offices cannot be guaranteed within 24 hours and that indeed it is better if a staff member is disthat patched to the Parliamentary Library to collect such items.,118
214,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,It is because of your cuts!,118
215,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"In view of the $10.3 billion Beazley black hole you left us, you should not be talking.",118
216,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The member for Fisher is employer addressing a question to me.,118
217,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Given the waste of time that sending staff members to the Parliamentary Library all the time would entail, do are you find such an extraordinary delay acceptable? What is a reasonable period for delivery after an item is placed into the system, and will you investigate whether delivery can take place within half a working day after the item has been put into the system?",118
218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I do not find a delay of 24 hours extraordinary but, as I am unaware of the issue, I will take it up separately with the library and report back to the House or to you privately. Member for Paterson",118
219,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, in addition to the matter raised by the member for Hotham, in which he expressed his concern that the Treasurer had somehow inflicted pain upon him, I raise with you another incident. Earlier in the week, during a double division, I was attempting to move from one side of the chamber to the other when the member for Paterson actually physically restricted my progress.",118
220,Unknown,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Honourable members interjecting,119
221,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! I hope the member for Paterson is prepared to restrain himself the moment.,119
222,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I do note, Mr Speaker, that the member for Paterson is acknowledging the incident. While I do not bear any bruises, you will understand that, with a frame weighing about 82 kilograms, I was somewhat concerned about my safety; and, while at no point, I am sure, did the member for Paterson intend any real physical harm to me, you will appreciate that, if he had become a little overenthusiastic and if he had fallen upon me or squeezed me against the table before you, I could have been seriously injured. I ask you also to investigate that matter.",119
223,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"This has been a most extraordinary week, as many of you would agree. Today's question time is turning out to be a most extraordinary question time. I will take the question on notice, unless the honourable member for Paterson hopes to resolve it for me forthwith.",119
224,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"If the member for Hunter's personality and his ability are so frail, then perhaps he should be more scared in his electorate, which adjoins mine, than he is in the House. Member for Hotham",119
225,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Since we are into Tuesday night and the wholly disruptive procedures surrounding Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), I would like to draw your attention to one possible reason why the member for Hotham had difficulty getting to the dispatch box. You will recall that back on 8 October I asked you a question relating to the member for Watson and whether or not the member for Watson was entitled to speakMr Rocher- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this is nothing like a question to you. That question should be taken out and shot.",119
226,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! As this is probably the closing question of a fairly torrid afternoon, I will allow the member for La Trobe to conclude quickly.",119
227,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I intend to. In fact, on 8 October I asked you a question about when the member for Watson was entitled to speak from the dispatch box. I note that on Tuesday at night, on three occasions, the member for Watson rushed to try to defeat the member for Hotham getting to the dispatch box. It seemed the whole episode was inappropriate.",119
228,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a very clear recollection of the occasion. I know very well that the honourable member for Hotham moved a procedural motion which was ultimately, with considerable enthusiasm, seconded rather unsuccessfully by the honourable member for Watson and, after a series of divisions, that resolved the issue. I do not intend to revisit it further. Hansard Report",119
229,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Is there an answer to the question posed by the member for Barker on Tuesday making allegations against me concerning the record of Hansard? My understanding is that the material has been provided to you and I would certainly appreciate at the end of this sitting week your report back to the House. Otherwise I will take a personal explanation.,119
230,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As I said, my focus over the last 24 hours has been elsewhere. I know that the information is flowing, or has finally flowed, into my office. If I have an opportunity, I will revisit it this afternoon. Mr Latham-I seek leave to make a personal explanation. Mr Reith-Leave is not granted.",119
231,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Is this relevant to the same comment? Mr Latham-Yes, I've been misrepresented.",119
232,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,No leave will be granted because you have just asked me a question which I will revisit. I will further advise the House this afternoon if the information I have is complete. Mr Latham-You knew the truth.,119
233,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The honourable member for Werriwa will resume his seat. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS,120
234,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I present the following Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 14 of 1996-97 entitled Performance auditEvaluation process for the Shared System Suite-Office of Government Information Technology. Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That: (I) this House authorises the publication of the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 14 199697; and (2) the report be printed.,120
235,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the papers will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and Hansard. The schedule read as followsAustralian Securities Commission Act-Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary BoardReport for 1995-96. Australian Sports Drug Agency Act-Australian Sports Drug Agency-Operational plan 1996-97. Complaints (Australian Federal Police) ActFederal Police Disciplinary Tribunal-Report for 1995-96. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-Joint Standing Committee-Report-Human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma (Myanmar), October I 995-Government response. Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act and Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act-Australian Safeguards Office and the Chemical Weapons Convention Office-Report for 1995-96. Motion (hy Mr Reith) proposed: That the House take note of the following paper: Australian Sports Drug Agency Act-Australian Sports Drug Agency-Operational plan 1996-97. Dehate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA",120
236,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Monday, 2 December 1996, at 12.30 p.m., unless Mr Speaker fixes an alternative day or hour of meeting. We previously advised members that we were considering sitting on simply the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to match the final sittings of the Senate in that week. But on a review of progress on various matters, and given the long list of speakers that the opposition insist on having on the balance of matters, some of which we may have to gag if youMr Crean-You already have.",120
237,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"If you are not prepared to take a reasonable view as to the listing arrangements, we will need to sit also on the Monday and the Tuesday. It will be governPAPERS ment business on both days, of course, so that we can deal with the issues outstanding. We would hope though in the management of that week, subject to the Senate's handling of legislation to come back to the House, that we might be able to provide some private members business in the latter part of that week. We will, as we have consistently attempted to do, discuss these matters with the opposition for the proper management of the business of the House. I hope that we will get more cooperation than we have had. In respect of the balance of today, our intention is that the House put the adjournment at the normal time at 5.30 followed by the adjournment debate through till 6 o'clock. I appreciate that there has been some concern about whether or not that could in any way be extended, but my understanding is that the opposition parties are not attempting to keep us here this afternoon after 5.30. Obviously it would be advisable for backbenchers on the other side to talk some sense into their colleagues in the Senate.",120
238,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"As a question to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), by way of a contribution to the discussion on the motion, is it his intention in excluding all of private members business from Monday and Tuesday to exclude the consideration of grievances?When I was Leader of the House, it was from time to time necessary to remove private members business to consider government matters. But we always left in what has been the time-honoured point in the week when backbench members on both sides of the House represent to the parliament in traditional form the grievances of the people in their electorates. That being the case, I would urge the Leader of the House to take the view that is at least one part of private members business that he wiJI keep sacrosanct and ensure that it appears on Monday as it now normally does.",120
239,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"in reply-With respect, I do not think it has always been time-honoured but, obviously, the attempt has in the past been to provide that additional time for people. It is important that grievance and private members time be available. Subject to the programming and what is happening in the Senate, our intention is to provide for a grievance debate later in the week as well as some 90-second statements. We might also be able to have an extended adjournment. We would be happy for that to be the case provided that the time is available. Obviously the purpose of the sitting is to get through the government business and to complete it. It is an additional sitting period as a result of the timetabling and developments with the legislation backwards and forwards between the two chambers. But I agree with you that as a matter of general principle we should aim to do that and that is our intention for that week, but it will be in the week. Question resolved in the affirmative.",121
240,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"by leave-I have another point of clarification, and I would like to make some brief comments in relation to this afternoon. There seems to be some confusion over here. When the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) talked about us reconvening on 2 December, which is the scheduled week, it seemed that what he was saying was that we would be sitting on Monday and Tuesday of that week. I understand you are suggesting the second week, 9 December. Mr Reith-I might take the opportunity, on the motion for the week starting 2 December, which is the usual motion, to refer to the following week, obviously.",121
241,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"In relation to whether we sit late tonight, again I would invite the minister to respond. As I understand it, the opposition is cooperating in trying to get the amendments across here. It is the Greens, as I understand it, who are prolonging the debate. So let us not have any of this nonsense about our obstruction. The further point that I would draw the House's attention to is that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, was only advised last evening, well after the address by President Clinton, that this matter was urgent in that it required to meet the deadline of today. This is despite the fact the issue was on the Notice Paper in the Senate on 11 October. If your government cannot get its house in order, do not come in here threatening us with lengthy sittings. You have a responsibility to manage the affairs of the legislative process in this House. Yet again you have demonstrated your failure to do so.",121
242,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"by leave-Just for the genuine information of people, as the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) made clear, in fact it has been on the Notice paper in the Senate for some time. They were well later aware that this legislation needed to be through by the end of this week. This is no surprise. Mr Gareth Evans-Well, why didn't you bring it on for debate?",121
243,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I am sorry; it is absolutely no surprise to them whatsoever. They have had all week to do this. Mr Gareth Evans-You should have known the deadline. Mr Crean-You are hopeless.,121
244,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The reality is, Mr Speaker, they have had all week. Mr Crean-You are still on cloud nine.",121
245,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"With every good reason to be pleased with the passage of our legislation, thank you very much. Mr Leo MCLeay interjecting",122
246,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Order! The member for Watson is intruding comment from outside his place.,122
247,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"He is. Get back to your cubby hole. Mr Speaker, the Senate parties have been well aware that they have had all week to do the appropriations, and the only reason that this matter has been raised and I have said what I have said is that some doubt has arisen, simply because they have not been cooperative to the full extent so that there would be no doubt by the end of today. Those are the circumstances, Mr SPEAKER absolutely-and it is no reflection on the management of the House here. We have to deal with the mayhem you are always trying to sew in the Senate, that is all. NA Health Care",122
248,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The pain inflicted on the health of millions of Australians resulting from private health fund premiums rising by up to 15 per cent, massive cuts to public hospital funding as a result of the Howard government's first budget and further disruptions caused by the government's retrospective actions on Medicare provider numbers. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",122
249,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is not in the chamber at the moment. He must be the only person in Australia, certainly the only health ministerMr Crean-He is probably out checking the press releases.",122
250,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is probably out checking the press releases, as the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) interjects. He must be the only person in Australia, and certainly the only health minister in Australia, who thinks it is good news when Australia's two largest private health funds increase their premiums by up to 15 per cent. He must be the only one who thinks it is good news-and certainly the only health ministerMs Macklin-Certainly not families.",122
251,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And certainly the pensioners and the families that are going to be hit, as the member interjects, are the ones who will be paying the price because of the decision this government has taken. I am not sure whether the minister is coming in for this debate but, if he is squibbing it, it will be the second occasion in a row that the minister has squibbed an MPI. I hope he is coming into the chamber for the debate because we always like to hear his contributions, and we would like him to respond to some of the points that we are going to raise today about the way this government has turned health policy into a complete shambles. We have to remember that this is the minister who claimed that he was absolutely on top of everything, that he was on top of every detail and every scrap of information in his portfolio responsibilities. But this is the minister who said that he was not aware of the MBF press release. In fact, we saw it being handed to him during question time. He claims to be on top of everything but he has to have someone hand him a copy of the MBF press release. Then he cannot even quote from it accurately without misleading the parliament. Then he admits that he has approved increases of up to 15 per cent for this health fund, but he does not know who will be affected. It must be very difficult to be alvmlutely on top of everything, but to not knov' about the press release announcing it, to not . now whether he has misled the parliament or to not know what the arrangements are for that particular health fund, the fact is that health policy under this government and health policy under this minister is a shambles. We have the two largest private health funds increasing their premiums by up to 15 per cent, we have federal funding for public hospitals being cut back yet again, and today is the third national day of action by young doctors who are on strike or who are protesting about this government's unfair and retrospective legislation on Medicare provider numbers. So that is the reason we raise this matter of public importance today. That is the reason we are trying to give the minister a chance to come and defend himself in the chamber. We can only hope that the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) is going to take up the challenge for the honourable member and perhaps speak in defence of his close colleague Dr Wooldridge, the person whom we all know he would like to replace. Let me start with the issue of health insurrebate. ance. For the 13 years when they were in opposition, they always had only two policies for health: the first policy was to abolish Medicare and the second policy was to give rebates for health insurance. They were the only two ideas you had in opposition: abolish Medicare and give tax rebates for private health insurance. After a couple of election losses, they had to ditch the first promise of the claim that they were going to abolish Medicare. In the background of course, as we all know, decision after decision in this budget undermines Medicare. Publicly, they are saying that they have ditched that first philosophy. They have ditched the claim that they are going to abolish Medicare. The second thing, the only thing, they were left with at the 1996 election was this great idea of giving tax breaks for private health insurance. That was going to be the miracle solution to every problem that we have in the health service today. It was going to increase the number of people who would take out private health insurance. It was going to reduce the pressure on our public hospital system. What we find is that, not even six months before the tax rebate starts to get paid, most of that rebate has been swallowed up in higher premiums. They have spent $1.7 ?illion and they have got nothing for it. IS nothing to show for it. There certainly is not an increase in the number of people who have taken out private health insurance and there is no evidence at all that there is any pressure being taken off our public hospitals. The first mistake that this government and this minister made was that, when they decided to provide this tax break of $1.7 billion to the industry, they did not seek any assurances from the private health funds that they would moderate their premium increases. You would have thought that if the government really believed that this tax rebate would solve all the problems in health insurance from I July next year, they would have brought in all the health funds, sat them down at the table and asked them for some form of assurance that they would not be jacking up their premiums to steal back that health What in fact happened? They announced in the budget that they are locked into giving out this $1.7 billion tax break, yet they had no assurances at all from the industry. Imagine if the government believed that it was good for the nation to buy more steel and offered anyone who bought steel a tax rebate. Imagine if they offered us $1.7 billion worth of tax rebates if we bought more steel stakes and more sheet steel. Mr Hollis-I'd support that.",122
252,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know that the member representing Illawarra is a strong supporter of such a policy. The point is: before you give BHP and all the people involved in the steel industry a $1.7 billion tax break, wouldn't you pick up the phone and ring BHP and ask John Prescott if he would agree to moderate his prices for steel so that he would not try to snatch back the $1.7 billion? That is what has happened. The government could not be bothered to sit down with the health funds to get some assurances from them about what would happen with increases. What we have seen as a result is that funds are snatching back the benefits that have flowed from this tax rebate. What we find is that every time these increases take place the government goes into There panic mode. Back in August, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who has to be seen to be doing something, decided that in future he would personally consider, vet and ultimately approve every application for increase. Mr Fitzgibbon-He'll fix it up.",123
253,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know that the member for Hunter was hopeful that that might make a difference. But what have we seen? Back in August the Prime Minister blamed a junior official in the Department of Health and Family Services for approving six per cent increases. What is happening now? The Prime Minister is approving 12 per cent or 15 per cent increases. So it is okay for the Prime Minister to attack a junior official in the department of health for approving six per cent increases, but when the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the minister for health approve increases of double the there is no blame associated with him. He was forced to do it. But it was okay for the Prime Minister to attack a junior official in the department. Let me remind the House that, back in August when the Prime Minister intervened, he announced an inquiry which is currently being undertaken by the Productivity Commission. It will report in February. The Prime Minister was asked what would happen to further applications that might be lodged by funds before next February. The Prime Minister's response was, 'Well, we'll be disappointed if any funds apply.' He said, The government would look askance at any applications.' So there is the signal. According to the Prime Minister, not only would they be tough on any future application, but they would also discourage anyone from lodging any more applications between now and February. That is what he said in August. What has actually happened? The government's own health fund, Medibank Private, has been approved quite a substantial increase. They say that that is an average of almost 13 per cent, with increases of up to 15 per cent. When the government's own health fund ignores the Prime Minister's plea, that pretty bad. But when the Prime Minister ignores his own plea for restraint then that even worse. When the Prime Minister, John Howard, ignores John Howard's request for moderation on health insurance increases, something is very wrong. The minister for health summed it up accurately a month or so ago when he appeared on Meet the Press. In a moment of honesty, he admitted that this was as much about perceptions as it was about reality. That was the admission that the Prime Minister's intervention back in August was nothing but a publicity stunt. The Prime Minister's intervention in August has actually seen, since he has been personally responsible for health insurance fund increases, a doubling of the size of the applications, a doubling of the size of the increases. It was nothing but an attempt to manipulate perceptions. Question time today was very interesting. We had the minister appear on the AM prosize gram this morning for a few minutes and make three mistakes. He got caught out here today at question time. The first mistake he made was that he claimed that the government had in some way beaten down MBF. What did MBF say in their press release, which was released, by coincidence, yesterday-virtually while the President of the United States was addressing this chamber? The MBF announced: A notification of contribution rate changes as originally submitted by the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia (MBF), which represents the health funding needs of more than 1.3 million Australians, has been approved by the Federal Government. This was as originally submitted by MBF and approved by the government. There is obviously someone not telling the truth here. Is it MBF or is it the Minister for Health and Family Services? We also remind the minister that he said on AM this morning that the average increase for MBF is 6.5 per cent. When we ask him whether he stands by that, whether he is prepared to mislead this House the way he misled the listeners of AM this morning-not deliberately, I am sure-he repeats part of a quote. He quoted quite selectively the rise in is contribution rates of 6.5 per cent across the fund's membership overall, but what he did is not tell honourable members is that the rest of the sentence said that we get that figure of 6.5 per cent by shoving 300,000 contributors into excess policies. It is like saying that, yes, price of a Commodore has gone up 15 per cent but you can get a Barina at a cheaper price. If you take up a product which is of lesser value or with a larger excess, of course you would expect the price to be cheaper. That is the way this minister has misled this House and the listeners of the AM program. Mr Eoin Cameron- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to take a point of order. The honourable member for Dobell would know that, if he wants to accuse a minister of misleading the House, he must do so by substantive motion. Mr Adams-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",124
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I have not ruled on this one yet. Mr Adams-On the point of order,125
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I will hear the member for Lyons. Mr Adams-I think the honourable minister ought to be here. He should be in the House to take objection.,125
256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is no point of order. On the point of order of the honourable member for Stirling: I have been listening very carefully to the member for Dobell, and he did go close to the wind on a couple of occasions. He became aware of that, has moderated his language and will continue to do so.",125
257,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member's point of order raises the question: where is the minister? He has missed an MPI debate for the second occasion in a row. Where is the minister? This is what the chamber is all about. We know the minister had a bad question time. We know he has been caught out misleading the parliament.",125
258,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He's exercising his right to silence.,125
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,So should the member for Banks.,125
260,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He might be back in the cone of silence, but the point I want to make is that this $1.7 billion tax break is being swallowed up by increases in premiums that this government is approving. To pay for that $1.7 billthe ion tax break for private health insurance, what has happened? The government have cut federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million, they have abolished the Commonwealth dental health program-that is $400 million worth-and they have increased the cost of essential pharmaceuticals by $500 million. So that is what has paid for this tax break for the industry: less money for public hospitals, less money for essential dental services and an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. That is what the government has had to do-not because of some deficit but because it had not funded its election promises. With the government having spent that $1.7 billion for no benefit whatsoever, we now have to ask ourselves: to improve the quality of health care of Australians, wouldn't it have been better to have spent that $1.7 billion in improving public hospitals by giving them extra money? I can assure the House that, whatever decisions this government might wish to take in relation to this area, the minister has been exposed this afternoon for misleading this House. He must be the only person in Australia who thinks it is good news when Australia's two largest health funds increase their rates by up to 15 per cent, he must be the only person in Australia who thinks that in some way we can provide better health care to Australians by cutting federal funding for public hospitals and he must be the only Liberal minister for health who has so quickly managed to have gotten so many doctors and so many organisations offside. So it is no wonder that the minister is not prepared to appear in the House to defend his reputation. We can assure him that the questions will continue and that we will ensure that he continues to be accountable for this shambles of a health policy. (Time expired)",125
261,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Boothby) (3.49 p.m.)It has been interesting to listen to the shadow spokesman for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). He has been handed what could be considered a dream portfolio in opposition. Health is a dream portfolio. And do honourable members know what? He is going to blow it. He is blowing it because he does not understand it. It is an enormously complex area. The demands in health are great and competitive. It is very interesting that he was there for most of the past 13 years of the failed Keating and Hawke governments. During that period, private health cover membership dropped from 65 per cent to 33.6 per cent of Australians, and it was actually the direct actions of the Hawke and Keating governments which contributed during that period to a 39 per health premiums. The member for Dobell has mentioned three areas in this MPI. He has dealt with private health insurance and has looked at the funding of public hospitals and the restriction of provider numbers -[or medical students and current interns. I will deal with each of those in due course. It is very interesting to see the ALP now coming in here as the defenders of private health insurance. It is very interesting to see the ALP now coming in here concerned about the fact that all these people who hold health insurance will have their incentives supposedly gobbled up by the premium increases. Mr Albanese-What about the battlers?",125
262,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What about the battlers? This is directed at low and middle income earners. It is very important to separate the issue of private health insurance incentives which are being offered to low and middle earners from the issue of insurance premium rises. They are separate issues. As the opposition spokesman for health understands very well, during the Hawke and Keating governments 174 requests for premium increases were made by health funds. How many did they reject? Not one. They did not reject one. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has not stayed to hear my contribution, but her former boss, Brian Howe, when he was health minister during 1991-92-he is a fellow traveller of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese )--oversaw a 17 per cent increase on average in private health funds. That was at about the same time that he managed to walk into a broom closet at the end of a press conference during the dying days of the Hawke government. It has been estimated that a two per cent drop in private health cover costs this nation the equivalent of 325,000 bed days. That is also the equivalent of two teaching hospitals. As I said before, the Hawke and Keating governments oversaw a decline in private health insurance of the order of 30 per cent. That is the equivalent of 30 teaching hospitals cent increase in around Australia. It is interesting that the member for Dobell, the ALP's spokesman on health, has not even bothered to stay and listen to this debate. He is not even concerned about the real issues which face Australians in the health area. We are interested in addressing the issue of cost shifting, which is a rort and which he defends. We are interested in preventive health measures. We are interested in giving people some relief for holding private health cover and trying to increase those rates of private health cover so that there is not such an incredible private demand on the public system. Labor contributed to that decline in private health insurance by such initiatives as changing the Medicare rebate from 85 to 75 per cent. They removed the reinsurance pool and they totally neglected to address the issue of cost shifting. In fact, back in August, the shadow minister did not even understand what cost shifting was. He had no idea that it was so complex. The ALP also removed the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. All of those actions by the previous government contributed to a 39 per cent increase in premiums. About five million Australians will be eligible for private health insurance tax incentives. It is important to emphasise, especially to those 700,000 Australians whose incomes are below $20,000 but who have been holding private insurance, that this incentive will be available as a tax rebate, but it will also be available as an equivalent amount by way of a reduced premium cost for those who do not pay enough tax. So for pensioners and others who are earning less than $20,000 a year and who hold private health insurance, it does not matter if they do not pay tax, they will be eligible; they will just pay a reduced premium. It should be remembered that Labor had a few health ministers during its period in office. Carmen Lawrence's health legislation did nothing to address the haemorrhaging that was going on in private health insurance. Looking at the issue of cost shifting, if the shadow minister is concerned about cost shifting, which we have addressed, he is in a sense defending a rort. There are plenty of visible signs of this rort. In a Melbourne public hospital, there is a bulk-billing Medicare clinic which specialises in things like plaster cast removal. That is a direct shifting of cost from what should be a state responsibility to the Commonwealth government. In another Melbourne hospital, there are 62 privatised outpatient clinics. This is all quite contrary to the Medicare agreement. Health ministers agreed at their June 1995 meeting in Alice Springs to recover annually the growth that was occurring in cost shifting in that period. That is all we have done. The member for Dobell refers to decreases in funding to public hospitals. It relates to addressing this whole issue of cost shifting. I would like to refer to a few quotes. Here is one: ... as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance ... That was said by a former health minister in the Keating government, Graham Richardson. It is interesting to note that Paul Keating, in the 1993 election campaign, said that people did not need private health insurance, that Medicare would be enough. Richardson went on to say: I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals. That was the situation that occurred under the Labor government. The member for Grayndler talks about battlers. While he was never a fellow traveller of Graham Richardson, Graham Richardson went on to say: Even the thought that the Liberals are prepared make the rich pay more when the Labor Party would not is enough to scare the hell out of me. !f they are so concerned about private health lllsurance and people not being in the system, why is it that they never addressed this issue? Richardson went on to say: . . . there were those in the party who thought any suggestion that public hospitals were not being adequately funded amounted either to cowardice in being unable to face up to funding cutsthat would be members of the Right like the member for Dobellor treason for daring to suggest anything could be wrong with Medicare. That would be members of the Left like the member for Grayndler. Finally, I would like to speak on the issue of the restriction of Medicare provider numbers. There is no doubt this was a tough decision. It was tough on interns and it was tough on current medical students. It was based on the premise that each doctor who goes onto the Medicare benefits schedule adds something like $175,000 to $225,000 through consultations, pharmaceuticals, radiology and pathology services. The OECD has estimated that at least 55 per cent of health care costs are supply driven. This was a difficult decision. We have looked at a number of areas. We are actually addressing the area of reducing medical school intakes. We are making it more difficult for overseas trained doctors to practise in Australia by imposing a lO-year moratorium on those doctors practising. That will apply after I January 1997. In a previous speech on the bill which related to this issue, the ALP spokesman for health said this: The Labor Party certainly understands the importance of seeking to manage the medical work force ... He is so right there, because it is very interesting to look at what has been said on this issue by health ministers in the previous government. First of all, before this proposal had even been floated, this year in Australian Doctor, Brian Howe said: Restricting provider numbers should be considered to limit the general practice workforce. He went on to say: to . . . perhaps provider numbers could control the numbers of GPs. What did the health minister after him, Graham Richardson, say about it? In the Bulletin of October 1996 he said: I hope Michael Wooldridge, the Federal Minister for Health, stands his ground and limits Medicare provider numbers for new medical graduates from November. He went on to say: The AMA was told in 1993 that restrictions on Medicare provider numbers were inevitable. I told the AMA that this would happen, regardless of governed Australia. Last of all, the senior general practice adviser of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), the last health minister in the Keating government, confirmed that they had sought legal advice which indicated that it was possible to restrict access to provider numbers. It is all very well for the ALP to come in here and say that this is a terrible thing the government is doing. We know it is a tough thing. All members on this side of this House know that it is a tough thing. The problem has been that, in order to keep Medicare going, we had to address some of the uncontrolled increases in cost that have occurred in Medicare. In fact, I believe that most medical graduates will be able to get work after this measure is introduced. There will be 400 places for general practitioners and, as of next year, there will be 760 specialty posts available. The increase in specialty posts has been due to an expansion in positions in ENT, orthopaedics, anaesthetics and urology. There will also be positions for 20 doctors to go into medical administration and 20 doctors to go into medical research. Next year, rather than 400 general practice training positions, it will be 420. This year, overseas trained doctors had 89 places. When you put that altogether, the number of Australian graduates being approximately 1,200 and 89 overseas trained doctors getting places, it means that almost every Australian graduate-and not all of them will want to go on to practise medicine-will be able to get a training position which will allow them to be better trained before they go onto the Medicare scheme.",126
263,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler) (4.03 p.m.)I am pleased to support this MPI put forward by the shadow health minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), today. I think it is a pity that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is not in the chamber during this important debate. If I were responsible for his handling of the portfolio, perhaps I would be running and hiding in the cone of silence in my office as well. I intend to begin by addressing the massive cuts to public hospital funding announced this who week, cuts which back up the cuts that were announced in the budget. These cuts are an attack on the Medicare system and public hospitals. They have a bad impact on doctors, nurses and health care workers. But, most importantly, at the end of the day they will have a devastating impact on patients in the public hospital system. There are $75 million worth of cuts-$34 million in New South Wales, $24 million in Victoria, $9 million in Western Australia, $5 million in Queensland and $3 million in Tasmania. This amounts, in conjunction with the budget cuts, to the largest federal cut to public hospitals since the beginning of Medicare. There has been no consultation with governments about this latest round, just letters to the state health departments letting them know that the cuts would start from this week-cuts that will mean, in a state such as New South Wales, something in the order of $700,000 out of the system per week. This is not surprising because this is really consistent with John Howard's views. Of course we saw two John Howards. We saw a John Howard throughout the seventies and eighties as Treasurer and Leader of the Opposition.",128
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl}-He is called the Prime Minister.,128
265,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Prime Minister. And then we saw another one, the candidate for the prime ministership in the lead-up to 2 March. On the John Laws program just a few years ago, the current Prime Minister said: We'll pull Medicare apart ... Basically we will be saying to people you can make your own health insurance arrangements. He went on to say: The second thing we'll do is get rid of the bulk billing system-it's an absolute rort. He concluded by saying: The Medicare system is a total disaster. We will be proposing changes to Medicare that amount to its defacto dismantling. Mr Lee-Who said that?",128
266,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The current Prime Minister said that. We are seeing that he told the truth years ago, but not prior to the leadup to the campaign on 2 March. We weren't sure which Prime MinisterDr Southcott-What did he say then?",129
267,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He changed his mind. He went to the election and he made a series of promises. He said he would keep Medicare, but what we are seeing is Medicare and the public health system being attacked, ripped apart piece by piece. Every week there are new announcements. That is why the Minister for Health and Family Services is not even bothering to be in this House to defend his handling of this portfolio. He is embarrassed by the performance of this government on health. These latest cuts to health are just more in a series that the coalition has introduced since ment. the election, further proof that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services do not consider providing Australians with a decent, fair and accessible health system is important. These are more cutbacks to a system that is already suffering. There are cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals of $800 million, cutbacks to the dental health program of $400 million and cutbacks to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme of $500 million. And what does that add up to? To $1.7 billion, exactly the handout that is being given to the private insurers in their so-called scheme. On top of that, we are also seeing cutbacks to special purpose programs, like specialist health programs for women and men, mental health programscutbacks right across the board. These cuts will have massive impacts on the health care system in this country. To give an indication of that impact, let us take a look at what the latest round of cuts will mean in a state like New South Wales, a state where the Minister for Health, Dr Refshauge, has not rolled over. He has been defending the public health system. Indeed, in the next financial year, funding in the New South Wales system will be increased by $632 million. In spite of the cuts coming from this federal government, there will be a $632 million increase. In real terms, this latest round will mean that over 900 medical and nursing employees will face the loss of their jobs, with another 160 support staff positions to go. Some 400 hospital beds will be closed and an incredible 17,000 fewer patients will be able to be treated in the public hospital system causing severely increased delays for elective surgery and longer delays in emergency departments. The mates of the government over here in the New South Wales parliament are talking about increasing the funding in the health system in New South Wales at the same time as the federal government is making further cuts. It is quite clear that the public health system in this country needs increased funding, not massive reductions. That is why the Carr government in New South Wales has done that, in spite of the role of this governIt is rather ironic that we have a health minister here who is perhaps the only doctor in the country who thinks that it is acceptable for public hospitals to get less funds. It is abundantly clear to anyone who has ever set foot in a public hospital emergency department that the health professionals and support staff are already working incredibly hard, under immense pressure, to provide a quality service to their patients. Members will recall yesterday's comments of the Australian of the Year, Dr John Yu. He said: The public hospitals, hospitals like mine, look after the Australian battler. Remember them-the Australian battlers? He also said: Private hospitals look after people who can look after themselves, but we worry about those who can't. This is the Australian of the Year talking about children and about the latest round of cuts from this uncaring, selfish government. Staff at his hospital, the Sydney Children's Hospital at Westmead, work so hard because they are helping families in need. It is a shame that the coalition is not working as hard as they are on supporting those workers and improving the system they work in. Given a choice of Dr Yu on the one hand and the minister for health on the other, I know whose side I am on. I am on the side of the Australian battlers, just like Dr John Yu. The problem for this government is that they cannot get over their obsessive hatred of the public sector. It does not matter whether it be public housing, the federal Public Service, the ABC or federally funded child care because, if it is public, they will try to mate it. At the same time, the coalition seem to be pretty generous to their mates in the private sector. The shadow minister has pointed that out today with their approval of the 15 per cent rise in fees for MBF and Medibank Private, the government's own fund. These increases will hit the three million contributors in these funds very hard indeed. It makes a mockery of the coalition's election promises on tax rebates for private health insurance when millions of Australians would have lost more than half of that rebate already in premium increases. And that is just since March! They do not get the rebate until July next year, but they have already lost it. The last round of premium increases in August have already been hurting people in my electorate. What does the minister say? He says, 'It's not 15 per cent. They can just downgrade the sort of. insurance they take out.' And he accuses us of being the attackers of private health insurance! He says, 'You can just downgrade. Go for the cheaper model.' What is that if not an attack on those who take out private health insurance? The rather pathetic replacement-the substitute for a minister over there-raised a question of the former minister Graham Richardson and his proposal. He did propose a levy on higher income earners, but he said that you had to put the money back into the public health system. You had to do it-something that you people have not done. Let me conclude with this: I have battlers in my electorate coming to see me. I had a phone call from a constituent called Rita Holden today, a pensioner in Marrickville, talking about the hardships that these increases would bring. They are the sort of people this will impact, not the holders of unit trusts that we see over there. At the same time that these increases were being announced, the President of the United States was addressing this chamber. How ironic, given that Hillary Clinton asked for a briefing on the public health system in Australia-the best in the Western world. How deciembarrassing for this mob over here who are wrecking this system.",129
268,Mr EOIN CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Can I say, for a start, how disappointed I am to hear the words of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) because I did, until this day, have a passing respect for the member for Grayndler. He shares a number of things in common with me-that is, he parts his hair on the same side, he is remotely handsome and he has a deep seated repugnance of the New South Wales Right. However, he has spoken today an absolute heap of nonsense. He obviously has not been looking at recent history, especially Australia's history of the last 13 years or so when his side of politics was in power. He is being hypocritical and utterly duplicitous. When did he complain, during the last 13 years, about the 174 times there were rises in private health insurance? When did you grizzle? Tell me about the battlers that you fended away from your door during those 174 occasions-not one. It is equally duplicitous for the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), the joke of a shadow minister for health, to be bleating loud and long now. The only thing that he does with any kind of authority or any kind of authenticity at all is playa Paul Keating clone with some kind of credibility, and I congratulate him on that. This is an act of hypocrisy and an act of duplicity. For Labor to propose an MPI like this is an absolute gall. You had 13 years to do something and you did absolutely diddlysquat. They expect us to clean up their 13 years of mess in just a few months of government. It is something, quite frankly, that you cannot do in that brief period of time. We recognise the mess that Australia has inherited from your lot and we will clean it up. Labor came to power in 1983. At that time, membership in private health insurance in Australia was 63.7 per cent of the population. In Western Australia, membership was 62.2 per cent of the population. In March this when Labor lost and after they had presided over this travesty, membership in Australia was down to 33.9 per cent and, in Western Australia, it was down to 36.8 per cent. There is an election approaching in Western Australia-as opposition members no doubt know and as they no doubt do not want to hear about-but these figures should remind people in Western Australia about how your mob works in government, or how your mob does not work in government. If Geoff Gallop is elected Premier of Western Australia, he will treat the health system with the same neglect that the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) did. I can tell honourable members that it is only in recent times that I have got over shuddering at the title of 'Minister for Health'. It is only since the present Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, has taken over that role that I have had some confidence in a minister for health. When the member for Fremantle was in that position, my flesh would crawl every time you mentioned the title 'Minister for Health'. Here is a woman who was the Premier of Western Australia but who sold the state down the gurgler through the WA Inc. years and who was a disgrace as the minister for health. She was a disgrace to the women of Western Australia. She sold western women short, and I cannot imagine how opposition members can sit there with her still on their front-bench. Most people would be too ashamed and would not have the gall to have her in any position whatsoever. Having spoken privately to Labor members of this parliament, I know that she is a complete embarrassment to you. The sooner she goes the better for Labor, Western Australia and Australia. The Labor government in Western Australia, when Geoff Gallop and Carmen Lawrence were in power, did nothing to encourage the federal Labor government to stop the flow of members out of private health insurance. They did nothing. They assisted in the destruction of our health system and they pretty damn well destroyed it totally. If Geoff Gallop is year, elected the Premier of Western AustraliaGod forbid-Western Australians can expect higher waiting lists as he sits by and watches, just as he sat by and watched what happened when Labor was in government prior to 1993. The fall in membership of private health insurance threatens the stability of the entire health care system. Despite that, Labor sat back and did absolutely nothing about it. They provided no encouragement for people to stay in private health insurance. To have the then Prime Minister of the country bragging about the fact that he was not in private health insurance used to just absolutely amaze me, but of course the man was loaded. With his piggeries and what have you, he could afford to get himself into the luxury hospitals whenever he wanted to. Labor sat back and did nothing through all those years. They came in here bleating about a premium increase when they did n-thing over the 174 premium increases. Mr Albanese interjecting",130
269,Mr EOIN CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Grayndler must be so embarrassed. I am surprised you are still in the House. I would have thought you would have been too embarrassed to sit here. I obviously misread the cut of your jib, because I thought you were a man of some standards. Why did the Labor Party do nothing when it was in government for 13 years? Labor members ought to answer that before they come in here seeking the high moral ground after completely stuffing up the health system over that time. Labor was happy with the growing hospital waiting list. I knew all about that because I managed to get here against the tide in 1993. I heard all about those waiting lists, I can tell you.",131
270,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You've done a great job ever since.,131
271,Mr EOIN CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the member for Fisher very much. Labor let people flow out of the private health insurance system like water going down a drain. They provided no incentive to remain in private health insurance-absolutely none whatsoever. They let the pressure build on the public health system and they caused the waiting list to grow. They did nothing. The coalition has taken the responsibility to redress that, and we will redress it. We did not inherit this $10 billion mess for nothing. We know we have to fix it, and we are taking the responsibility to fix it. Just looking at the member for Dobell's wording in the MPI, he started off by saying: The pain inflicted on the health of millions Australians resulting from private health fund premiums rising by up to 15 per cent. .. What about the pain of the 174 increases inflicted by your mob when you were sending the health system down the gurgler? What a gall. The 174 increases. What did you do about that? What did you do about the decline in the number of members going into private health insurance? You did nothing. Absolutely nothing. It is forever to your shame that you did absolutely nothing. It is time that you opposite understood that the health system that we preside over is not perfect, but we are going to be doing our best to fix up the mess that you left. I think the Australian people told you exactly what they thought of the way you had managed Australia by the way they voted in March. In Lindsay-isn't it glorious to see Jackie Kelly back?-the Australian people underlined what they thought of your management of this country. Australia's public hospital system is in overload. We need to encourage as many people as possible to ensure that they have access to the full range of health care services, both public and private, and we are doing that. We are doing what Labor was too politically bankrupt to do. There are a couple of things I would like to mention. One is the health ministers under Labor. Let us look at them-and what a rogues' gallery, if you don't mind. Neal Blewett: he started Medicare, but made no provisions for a balanced health care system by encouraging people to remain in private health insurance. Brian Howe: he did nothing, but when he retired-it is amazing how you lot get brave when you retire-he said that he should have done something. Graham Richardson: he did nothing but, during the election, he said, 'Something should have been done.' He had plenty of time to do something, but he did nothing. And as for the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. My God, this embarrassment of Australian politics. One of the reasons why I think politicians have a rotten reputation is the member for Fremantle. She probably forgot what she was the minister for. of She is a disgrace to the Australian parliament. She should never have been a minister. She should never have been the health minister. I will quote from the West Australian on 15 November last year. The headline states 'She lied'. This is the member for Fremantle, who was the health minister at the time.",131

273,Mr EOIN CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She lied, and you people stuck with her. You not only stuck with her, she is still there. She is a disgrace.

The State of Victoria and Others (b) Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 15 November 1994-Speeches of Mr Lavarch-(pp 3336-3342). This motion is intended to grant a request conveyed to the House in the letter tabled by the Speaker on Tuesday. The letter is from Arthur Robinson & Hedderwicks, solicitors, and seeks permission of the House to adduce in evidence certain extracts from the Hansard. The request concerns a speech on the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. Arthur Robinson & Hedderwicks act for the Herald and Weekly (No. Times Ltd, which is, we gather, seeking leave to intervene in two matters scheduled to be heard before the High Court. These are the SENATE proceedings listed in the notice of motion. The motion itself does not address the substantive issue of privilege itself. That is a matter governed by the law as expounded in section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The well-known immunity of parliamentary proceedings from being impeached or questioned in court is inherited from article 9 of the Bill of Rights; however, subsection 16(5) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act does Reference in fact state that neither the 1987 act nor the Bill of Rights is taken to prevent the admission of parliamentary records in connection with a matter arising under section 57 of the constitution or the interpretation of an act. While there is some judicial authority for the view that the permission of the House is not required on the procedural question of actual production of the parliamentary records, as distinct from the substantive question of the use to which they can be put, the House has never formally abandoned the position that permission should be soughthence, today's motion. There are a number of precedents for permission being granted. In fact, three instances have arisen in the present sittingsProcessing more recently on 29 October-in relation the same proceedings as referred to in the present request, but of course different tracts from the Hansard. Further background on these matters is contained in House of Representatives Pracred tice at pages 690 to 698.

282,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On indulgence, I refer to the question to Mr Speaker by the honourable member for Hotham this afternoon concerning my motion during a division on Tuesday night. I have not seen the tape, and I have discussed it with Mr Speaker since then. It true that when Mr Speaker called, 'Lock doors!' I was seated on the right Speaker. It is equally true that after he invited people to move to the left or the right that did stand and move towards this seat in which I am standing at the moment, and then turned to the position to the right of the Budget Speaker. I thought that I was in order, and that I had removed myself back to the other raised ... side at the appropriate time. If I was out of order-if I was, I certainly thank the member for Hotham for drawing it to my House's attention-I unreservedly apologise to the House. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1996 Cognate bills: NA BILL 1996 NA CHARGES BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",134
283,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"I had commenced my remarks about the Import Charges Bill 1996 before question to time intervened. I was dealing with the responsibilities of the Minister for Small  for Customs. I was making the observation that, apart from this bill, putting up charges for the use of customs as well as increasing tape for small business was against the background of some very significant cuts to the Customs Service, thereby restricting its to perform its duties. Those cuts total $70 million over the next four years, the loss of 105 jobs in Victoria, 65 in New South Wales, 60 in the ACT, 25 in Queensland and 24 in Western Australia. This is a government that, on the one hand, is saying it will increase employment but, on the other, is taking deliberate steps that indeed cut it back. The government has also introduced a complete ending of all airport shift work. This is a very interesting decision by the Minister for Small Business and Connot sumer Affairs in relation to his own departis ment, because it comes from a minister who, the before he was the minister and when in of the opposition, told his colleagues: Any budgetary cuts to [customs inspection and I clearance procedures] would slow down the clearance of goods, holding up businesses, and result in rea lesser frequency of inspections. cuts would also result in a decline in the number of audits undertaken and hence revenue Any decline in the intelligence activities will impact on Customs' law enforcement activities and, and the in particular, their success. You have not only the impact in terms of businesses wanting to get access to their goods and that being held up but also the minister admitting before he implemented these decisions that they would hamper the ability of the Customs Service to carry out its own activities. The minister has also presided over a $400 million cut to the diesel fuel rebate. Presumably, this cut came about because they claimed there were $400 million of rorters in the scheme. What the government claimed in advance of the diesel fuel rebate decision, in saying that they had kept their election promise, was they would not cut the rebate except in cases of abuse of the system. The minister is really saying to the farmers and the miners of this country, 'We kept the diesel fuel rebate but, really, it is $400 million less. The reason it is $400 million less is that you are rorting the scheme.' This is the stock defence by the government to a lot of the cuts that they have imposed. Rather than enter the dialogue and the debate about these things, they simply assert the fact that there has been a rort. Turning to the minister's responsibility in the small business side of his portfolio, the minister recently released the Charlie Bell review of small business red tape. This was another of the election promises of the government. Interestingly enough, when this report was released, it was not tabled in this parliament. So we have not been able to gain access to copies of this report in the normal way that one would expect. I am told that the honourable member for  ring the minister's office to get a copy of the report. The person ringing on behalf of the member for Shortland was asked which party the member was from. When they said it was for the ALP, they were told, 'You've got to go to the government bookshop.' In other words, what we have here is a government !hat is so into openness, accountability, Improved understanding and improved information that it will only release its report to mates-having accused us of being in the mates' brigade-and, so far as the Labor Party is concerned, we have to pay for the privilege. This is hardly what you would call an evenhanded approach in government, but it is the way in which the minister operates in relation to his portfolio. I think it is in keeping with the way in which he operates his private businesses about which we have already demonstrated there are so many appearances of conflict of interest that they have become legion. Yet his view on all of these things is to deny either responsibility or conflict, or both, and say that so far as he is concerned he will keep it all to himself. The Charlie Bell review was about finding ways of meeting the Prime Minister's commitment to cut small business red tape by 50 per cent over the term of the government, which was a promise reconfirmed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as recently as last month. The Charlie Bell report has, in effect, set a benchmark for this government. We know the government itself does not like setting benchmarks. It will not set a target for the unemployed, it will not set a target for employment growth, it will not reaffirm targets in important areas of economic activity; but it is prepared, in election promise terms, to set a target of cutting red tape by 50 per cent. Let us understand the importance of that: targets for people do not matter but targets for paper do. When we ask, 'What does the 50 per cent target reduction mean?' they sort of go mute. They say, 'We have got a commitment of 50 per cent over the term of the government.' What is revealing in this report is the ability to measure and benchmark that target. It stated in the report that the average small business spends four hours a week on government red tape-translated, the promise is to cut red tape to two hours. Labor will be keeping a close eye on whether the government does in fact keep to that promise. I see that the minister is not even here in the House. He was not in the House when this debate was on just before question time and he is still not here. No doubt he is lookits ing after the affairs of his private companies. They are more important than the matters before parliament. The minister has made a dreadful start in cutting red tape. As these bills show, one of the minister's first acts is to increase tax. Remember the promises made before the election, 'No increase in taxes under a Liberal government.' Read my lips, honest John: no increase in taxes. This is what this bill does. Don't you think that a charge imposed on businesses that have to use the services to get their goods constitutes a charge or a tax? That is what he has put up. He runs around the country promising to cut red tape and not put taxes up; yet this is a bill that increases taxes as well as increasing the red tape. The package comprises three bills which the Deputy Speaker has indicated we are dealing with cognately. They give legislative authority for the measures announced in the budget to introduce full cost recovery for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. It involves the imposition of 13 fees and charges-in other words, taxes. This is a broken promise-obviously not a core promise-and this is a government committed to helping small business. The new taxes will apply from 1 January 1997. Overall, the bills will not be opposed by Labor because they do expand the user-pays arrangements for Customs begun when we were in office. They apply only to imports and they are levied either on the importer or the shipper. But the opposition does have some major concerns with the impact the bills will have on small businesses and in some regions. We will therefore be moving a series of amendments in the Senate to protect the people whose livelihoods are threatened by aspects of these bills. In essence, Labor is concerned that the bills will lead to extra costs for imports of materials used in manufacturing here in Australia at a time when business incentive measures are being stripped away all through the budget. What the charges will do is also have a greater impact on regional ports where Customs have closed their offices and may impact negatively on regional ports such as Geelong. The measures will also increase small business red tape. The government claims they have consulted widely with industry on the introduction of these charges. This appears mainly to have occurred within the confines of the Customs National Consultative Committee. The intention of Labor is therefore to move amendments as I will outline. The first is a four-year phase-in period for the reduction threshold at which the import entry charge is levied from $1,000 to $250. As it stands now in the proposal, the reduction in the threshold may have a substantial impact on small importers who supply niche markets with specialised product from overseas and to low volume importers, typically small business. The immediate imposition of the lower threshold could drive such firms out of business by imposing the extra $22.80 charge for electronic entries or $44.55 for manual entries. Secondly, we will be moving an amendment for a four-year phase-in period for the new fees. This is particularly important for fees on manual entry which are to be levied at a much higher level than the fees on electronic entry. What this does is threaten disproportionately small businesses which do not have access to the electronic facilities or which lack the expertise to utilise the service. While Customs' advice is that they plan to increase access to electronic entering by installing computers at Customs shop fronts, airports, international mail exchanges and customs houses, where many small commercial importers currently lodge their manual claims, these facilities will not be in place on 1 January when the high fees are proposed to be applicable. It therefore seems reasonable that a phase-in period apply. Thirdly, in respect of the licensing charge for section 17B premises, we will seek to introduce a two-tiered fee based on the turnover of the individual premises. This will help protect premises and jobs based in regional Australia where the turnover may be lower but the service is no less important. So whilst not opposing the overall thrust of this bill we do want to highlight the concerns that we have. The first is with the way the minister has been administering his portfolio-the very fact that he is still not in the chamber is evidence of his neglect and the contempt in which he holds this important piece of work. The second is with the fact that we see inherent in this bill a breach yet again of election commitments on two fronts-first, that it does involve an increase in taxes on small businesses and, second, that it adds to the paperwork that businesses will have to undertake-and the third is in relation to the specific detail of the bill. We think the decision to implement and move completely to full cost recovery on 1 January is not appropriate. For that reason we will be supporting amendments which seek to provide a phase-in for the measures sought.",134
284,Mr SOMLYAY,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) for 20 minutes of his half hour spoke about the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  10 minutes to the Customs Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996. In my remarks J will devote my total time to remarks on the bill. This bill is one of the three bills designed to implement cost recovery for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. The three bills in this legislative package provide for the imposition and collection of 13 charges and fees on import related services. The 13 imposts are located in three pieces of legislation, two new charges billsthe Import Processing Charges Bill and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill-as well as the Customs Amendment Bill. These bills will result in full cost recovery for commercial customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports. This was among the measures announced by the government in the 1996-97 budget. From 1 January 1997 the Australian Customs Service will apply full cost recovery for all commercial customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports. The services to be covered by the new charges are cargo reporting, both sea and air, import entry processing-sea, air and post-and licensing of approved places for the examination of goods. This measure forecasts a net budget impact of $45.9 million per annum. This represents $66.5 million less the $18.5 million currently collected for the use of IT facilities. To coincide with this measure, Customs has taken the opportunity to streamline refund procedures and associated cost recovery, and adjust current charges for out of hours work or work by customs officers in locations where they do not usually work. Charges have been determined from a detailed activity based costing of customs services. The costing methodology has been reviewed by external auditors. The charges are limited to the calculated costs of delivering the functions and will be reviewed annually to ensure that they reflect only the costing structure. Costs to process import transactions by Customs will be examined annually and any material changes will be reflected in an annual review of the charges. Before outlining the industry impact of these changes, I would like to draw attention to the industry consultation which took place after the budget. After the budget announcement, members of the Customs National Consultative Committee, the CNCC, were briefed at a special meeting about the nature of the proposed charges. This committee comprises representatives from the Australian Air Transport Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders, the Customs Brokers Council of Australia-CBCA-the International Air Couriers Association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Their feedback resulted in some changes being made to the charges for entry processing and the methods of collection. This committee met again in September where the charges were once more the subject of discussion. Meetings have been held with various sectors of the importing community, such as the air express couriers and the cargo terminal operators, in regard to establishing the most efficient collection methods for the charges. In meeting with a variety of industry sectors, Customs was made aware of some difficulties that the collection of cargo reporting fees and screening fees would impose on cargo terminal operators and shipping companies for manual reporting charges and on air express couriers for screening charges. Special arrangements may be entered into for the collection of the charges, including periodic settlement arrangements to coincide with the operating environment and billing cycles experienced by many of the firms in the importing community. In addition to meetings, Customs has conducted a series of industry briefing sessions in all state and territory capital cities and in several regional centres. These sessions have provided an opportunity for Customs to explain details about the charges and how they will be collected. At the same time, the sessions provided a valuable forum for feedback from all sectors of the importing community, much of which has influenced the implementation decisions. The impact on the industry is as follows: 103,000 importers generated around 2.2 million customs entries in 1995, containing 7.2 million entry lines; based on 1995 data, 95 per cent of importers have entries averaging less than 10 lines per entry; 65 per cent of importers bring in four or fewer entriesaveraging 3.5 lines or less per year-and would incur total costs of approximately $100 per annum; 99 importers generated 1,500 or more entries each, together accounting for around 15 per cent of all entries; four of these importers generated over 10,000 entries, the largest importer bringing in just over 14,000 entries. Customs' annual funding will be reduced by an amount equivalent to that raised through cost recovery. This measure therefore aligns the cost of processing imports with that sector of the community-that is, the importerswhich generates customs work, rather than spreading the costs across all taxpayers. This measure is consistent with the general thrust of government policy, which increasingly sees a closer alignment of costs with sectors of the community that benefit from the provision of public services. The user-pays system is already used in relation to the recovery of the costs of processing passengers at international airports, through the passenger movement charge. Customs currently recovers part of the costs of its electronic systems through charges levied on importers for import entries. This proposal sees an extension of a current cost recovery regime. The extension of the current charging arrangements relates only to commercial import processing. It does not cover activity associated with Customs' community protection function relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs. The government recognises Customs' important role in this area and in this budget has provided funds to Customs to significantly increase the use of sophisticated technology to maintain and enhance its community protection capability. Nor will charges apply to the processing of export transactions. The exemption of exports from the new user-pays system is a recognition of the key role export industries will play in improving Australia's trade balance. The Australian Customs Service has played a leading role in the development of electronic systems which have enhanced its capacity to facilitate the efficient movement and quick release of cargo. This ultimately benefits the Australian community. The charging regime established reflects the efficiencies of electronic data reporting and will continue to do so. For example, the cargo management strategy-an exposure draft which was released in August 1996-identifies opportunities for enhanced information mechanisms for information exchange between Customs and industry. Within the five-year reach of that strategy, the key elements are: continued recognition of the importance of existing computer syst-ms; to adopt enabling technology which simulates integration of those systems and allows more flexible reporting of information; to permit rationalisation of information needs and reduce duplication and redundancy; and to adopt new technologies which allow more sophisticated manipulation of information for risk management. The end result will be a seamless and flexible system which will simplify information management for all clients and cater for future requirements. The delivery of these types of efficiencies will have a bearing on the ultimate costs to provide Customs' services to its client base. In the cost recovery implementation, significant inroads have been achieved in creating flexible systems both for liability assessment and payment. This is consistent with the thrust of the cargo management strategy. For example, settlement arrangements for manual reporting charges have been made more flexible. As a result of consultation with the cargo terminal operators, the legislation now allows for the CEO of Customs to agree to terms for settlement-potentially monthlyfor some cargo reporters, rather than payment at the time of reporting. In recognition of need to maximise electronic processing of information and to not disadvantage those operators that lodge electronic reports with Customs, Customs has undertaken IT enhancements that will result in the retention electronic data and minimisation of reporting costs. After an approach by the air express couriers, an arrangement for payment of the screen free charge has been agreed by Customs. This arrangement is represented by the payment of a reporting levy against formal entries lodged by those companies entering into the arrangement. For those companies that do not wish to participate in the alternative settlement scheme, monthly settlement will apply. The cost recovery implementation has enabled Customs to address a series of long standing anomalies in its administration. An example is that for several years the air courier industry has criticised an inequity existing between entry requirements for air cargo imports and importation by post. Specifically, commercial air cargo imports valuing $250 or more have required an entry, whereas requirements for entries in the postal environment are for imports valuing $1,000 or more. The new arrangements see this anomaly disappear with a requirement for the lodgement of an entry for all commercial cargo over $250 in value. In summing up, I would like to refer briefly to the background behind the budget decision to apply cost recovery for commercial customs activities relating to the processing of imports. As we in this House are aware, the government was faced with a huge task to turn around the Australian economy. The decision to introduce cost recovery to the Customs import process is in line with the government's general acceptance of the userpays principle. The new charge will have a beneficial side effect-it will attribute direct costs of the import clearance process to goods imported, thereby removing the burden for funding this process from the community generally. While the cost recovery is to do with commercial activity, it is also true that the import clearance process accomplishes far the more than just collection of statistics and revenue. The entire customs process supplies importers with a mechanism which provides awareness of, and monitors compliance with, Australian safety standards, labelling and of other consumer protection laws. In addition, there is an obvious cost in preventing imported goods being used inadvertently or deliberately as a method of bringing in illicit drugs and other contraband. Goods manufactured in Australia do not present the same risk. Finally, the deliberate exemption of the export process from the user-pays regime, as I mentioned earlier, is also extremely important in the context of Australia's future. It is a recognition of the key role export industries will play in improving Australia's trade balance, creating more jobs and reducing the deficit-a task this government has made its highest priority. I commend the bill to the House.",137
285,Mr ADAMS,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"Here is another ill-thought out bill that has some serious ramifications for small business throughout Australia. It is something that has been thrown together. Based on the last speaker's comments, everything has to be met to meet some deficit reduction while small business suffers. Whether it is R&D research or any sort of level of assistance to business, the government's attitude appears to be that we can go without businesses in Australia as long as we have the deficit right. I wish to address the changes to the charges levied for small business to clear customs. Some changes are to streamline processing by adding an electronic link to allow faster clearances. But new charges are being levied on the processing of the cargo reports, import entry processing and the licensing of the approved place for the examination of goods. Customs are trying to cut the costs of processing to 'ensure that costs recovered do not exceed costs calculated to process import transactions'. They reckon the charges are limited to the calculated costs of delivering functions. I would like either the minister or someone on that side to tell me why a small importer who brings in on each consignment an average of between $300 and $400 worth of goods by post suddenly will be hit with a charge of at least $42.65 customs and sometimes up to $80 just for the privilege of having to take longer to clear his goods because the customs officer has been moved. This particular small business, situated in a country area in northern Tasmania, imports goods from England, Scotland, Ireland and Canada from suppliers who previously could not make their goods available here due to the distance of the markets. Their import orders are not large because of the market size and the variety of interests of their customers. Currently, when goods arrive they undertake an informal customs clearance which takes no more than about five minutes. With this clearance, they inform Customs of the value of the goods, the sales tax and duty payable and the cost in Australian dollars. This is then faxed to Customs in Hobart and the goods are dispatched. All these consignments are worth under $1,000 and are imported by post. The amendments moved by the government have put a stop to informal customs clearances. Their user-pays, cost recovery scheme will now involve a $44.55 charge for manual lodgement. This particular business will have to travel to Launceston to lodge it in person. It is going to cost for the lodgement and it is going to cost the small business money in travel. The alternative offered is that they can use electronic lodgement at a cost of $29.65. However, the advice on this was that they would need a customs agent to process transactions to qualify for this reduced fee. The agent has been charging this business $60 per consignment before they started doing the informal customs clearance themselves. From past experience, they believed that this fee would rise with the more formal clearances and licensing fees. They could be charged a fee of $80 by a customs agent plus the electronic lodgement charge of $29.65. They quite rightly point out that, on a consignment of $300, these charges will make the business unprofitable. Although some charges might be applicable for large consignments, the very nature of this particular business prevents them from placing larger orders. They said that they do not consider that a consignment of 15 books, usually worth $300, warrants a charge of $44.55 to process. This is not the sort of charge they can absorb into the cost price of the article. The cost of customs to this particular small business is 15 per cent of the transaction. There is no way any small business can cope with that sort of cost. The government should have looked at ways of reducing the book work involved before proceeding with this legislation. There has been no attempt to discriminate between $1,000 orders and $300 orders. The scheme in the past worked quickly-the duty was paid where and when it should be. The time taken for the processing by the customs officer was minimal-maybe five minutesand it could be done by fax, which cut down on travelling time. To change this to the cumbersome fee collection regime which is being suggested here without some minimum cut off for the value of the goods coming infor example, $1,OOO-seems to be bureaucracy gone mad. Why change a scheme that works well, collects its money and costs little to implement? Has Mr Hilmer put his nose in here too? Change to so-called 'streamline elements of two existing fees' in this case is change for change sake rather than change to achieve efficiency. The government has obviously decided to cut people out of the Customs Service and is using the user-pays principle to justify the cuts. This bill also seeks to charge depots a licence fee of $5,000. I have sought advice on this from customs agents in Tasmania. Some have said that this will result in organisations being unable to afford to operate. Certainly, the smaller ones would have great difficulty. The customs department has informed me that there are 22 depots in Tasmania and they are currently served by 46 customs agents. The government wants to cut the number of agents, so it makes the depots unprofitable and they will close down. Only the big ones will continue to operate. Small business will be the loser. Small business is hit again. The minister should be sticking up for small business, not imposing more charges on it. He comes in and answers questions in question time by saying that the government is in the process of minimising costs to small business. This bill is going to impose more costs on small business. The department mentioned that a lot of the costs will be eliminated once electronic systems are in place at the main airports and post offices. I suggest we put some of those bureaucrats into the middle of Tasmania, in outback New South Wales or in Far North Queensland for a few months and see how they get on. It takes me a minimum of three days to get a letter from Canberra into my office. Most of these isolated areas barely have telephones or decent television reception, let alone lines to allow such things as electronic data transfer. This means people have to drive to their nearest major airport. For people on the west coast of Tasmania that means travelling for 3Vz hours, and for most of the other people in my electorate of Lyons it means travelling for two hours. The Public Service is supposed to be a public service to help the private sector drive our economy. All this government seems to want to do is put obstacles in its way. The governments's intention to sell Telstra, its inability to get Optus and Telstra together to do the cabling-the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts, gave some waffle on how this was somebody else's fault; he did not make any contribution to this debate-mean that the country and regional areas have no hope of being connected to anything, certainly not without paying a considerable amount of money in future. So much for the big argument of helping people in country areas. As I said in the beginning, this bill is badly thought out. It will have all sorts of implications if it is carried in its present form. Some minor but critical amendments should be made to make all the difference to the small business sector. There is a strong argument to leave any major changes to charging on depots until the electronic transfer is available outside the major city areas. This should not take long if the commitment to do it is there. There should still be an ability to clear goods to the value of $1,000 through the informal clearance declaration. I think the government should address these points before the bill goes too much further and before we end up in a disastrous situation for many small operators throughout Australia. There is no doubt that there are some major problems within this bill. They need to be addressed before the bill is passed by the parliament.",139
286,Mr ROCHER,CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING,"Curtin) (5.08 p.m.)Despite the bluster of the Minister for Small  in his second reading speeches, the Customs Amendment Bill (No.2) and cognate bills are blatant revenue raisers, nothing more and nothing less. The rationale employed by the minister is that they are cost recovery measures. 'Cost recovery' are buzz words. They are buzz words used increasingly by successive governments since the early 1980s to justify new imposts because those governments chose to legislate in certain ways. In other words, the need for so-called cost recovery is created first by government legislation, then or some time later down the track the government decides that its laws have created the need for that very same government to claw back some, all or more of the cost that its own laws were responsible for inflicting. These bills are a classic example. Hitherto, there was no licence fee for customs depot licensing charges. Previously, import processing charges might have been expected to raise $17.6 million in a full year. But with the passage of this legislation the take will increase by just over $44 million or 250 per cent. A more modest-or is it less ambitious-increase is in the cost of section 85: warehouse fees, computer recovery, refund applications and overtime for official services of $372,000. Nearly 11 per cent extra will be raised. The full-year addition to revenue raised under the provision of all three bills being debated cognately will be just under $46 million-an increase of 69 per cent. This is not a bad little earner in times of low inflation. It might be laughable, given in particular the minister's crazy justifications for the imposts-if we could ignore some of the more serious implications. Where will the costs fall, for example? The costs will be borne by small businesses and consumers-a pretty good double for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. He might very well be better described by the minister versus small business and anti-consumers. It might be fair to ask the minister how he can look either proprietors of affected small businesses or consumers in the eye, but of course he does not. If this is an example of a minister who is for something, in this case small business and presumably consumers, God help us all if he were against them. Most import agents may be held up as classic examples of small business proprietors. Most other importers are small business owners who do not need, so far in our history, the cost of employing import agents. It is unarguable that these new charges will fall disproportionately on small businesses and their clients. But it does not stop there. Many, if not most, of the clients of import agents are in turn small businesses. These are the clients of import agents. It is not clear if the minister to absorb the charges. Surely he is not so silly. He must know that all the additional costs these measures impose will be passed on down the chain, where necessary, through small businesses to the consumers of imported goods. So much for Labor's rorting of the wholesale sales tax system. They must have extracted all the blood that can be got out of that particular stone. The charges raised in these bills are no more and no less than an indirect tax by another name. So the coalition government, with the willing cooperation of the minister, had to scrape the bottom of the barrel and devise new charges, or exorbitantly raise existing ones, all to be embraced under the political speak terminology 'cost recovery'. By way of an aside, if this parliament ever agrees to adopt an across-the-board expenditure tax of one kind or another, it will only be as a substitute for existing indirect taxes including, hopefully, those now before the House. Levied at 15 per cent, one could not expect more because the cupboard is bare. The need for the responsible minister to explain further is not confined to his rhetoric which purports to support either small businesses or consumers. How often have we heard him rabbiting on in this place about the need to cut regulation and red tape, particularly as it affects the small business sector? It was a temptation to say that he may even have waxed eloquent on the subject, except some would not forgive me for such an exaggeration. Here we have another abundance of red tape, which the private business sector in general and small businesses in particular have to unravel at their great cost. Just examine for one minute the charges to be levied for processing imports. For an import entry application lodged electronically, the amount to be paid is $29.65 plus 20c per line after line lO. But, if the application is not lodged electronically, the charge will be $51.40 plus $1 per line after the first line. We do not seem to be told whether the importer has to have IBM compatible equipment to electronically lodge an application for an import entry, but it is probably buried in some obscure regulation either already at large or expects agents to be devised. The next category involving a charge or charges is an application for import entry by air or post lodged electronically, in which case the fee will be $22.80 plus 20c per line after line 10. A similar application not lodged electronically will cost $44.55 plus $1 per line after the first line. For sea cargo, a fee of $2.60 per manifest line will be payable, $3 per house or straight line airway bill, whatever that might mean, and finally a screen fee charge of $2.40 per house or straight line airway bill. The total to be raised by these charges will be $61,675,000 in a full year. However inconsequential the descriptions of the charges may seem, the cost to be added to imports is no mean figure. I have heard about journalists and others being paid by the line or according to the number of words written, but this one takes the cake. Perhaps the best advice we can give to affected importers is that they lodge manual applications, write in very small letters and use abbreviations of the kind used by the real estate industry in advertisements used to flog off houses. But even then, at $1 per line after the first line as well as an upfront charge, almost in both cases about double that of the electronically lodged equivalent, the manual alternative remains less than attractive. The message to hundreds of affected importers is that, if you do not already have a computer compatible with that used by the Customs Service, go out and buy one. But isn't that a cost of compliance? An interesting outcome, if not intent, of the electronic lodging provisions in this legislation is that boutique importers who do not have this capacity may be driven to engage an import agent. Do-it-yourself business people who have hitherto made their own arrangements with a minimum of fuss might be better served to hire an agent rather than pay the premium to be imposed on the cost of manual lodgments. And all for what-to suit the convenience of a government agency, a convenience that the minister has not even attempted to argue in his presentation. Such an outcome will involve a further increase in compliance costs for affected importers not previously needing to hire import agents. Talking about the cost of compliance, I have thumbed through all three explanatory memoranda and I cannot for the life of me find an estimate of the cost of compliance. Surely we have to have superseded copies, because I have heard the minister talk, almost to the point of tedium, about the evils of compliance costs inflicted on small businesses by government legislation and regulation. Perhaps the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who is at the table, could give me the correct memoranda, which would undoubtedly include estimates of the cost of compliance with these bills, given the minister's strident advocacy in opposition to and awareness of burdensome costs of compliance with all types of legislation, let alone that for which he has sole responsibility. It is obvious that such estimates are possible because each memorandum contains estimates of the amounts to be raised in a full year in each of the seven categories to which reference has already been made. For example, category 1, where an application for import entry is lodged electronically-the charge being $29.65 plus 20c a line after line 10-will raise $24,386,000. The manual equivalent, the second category, will raise $585,000 in a full year. Category 3 will raise in a full year $30,314,000, and so it goes on down to category 7. If it is possible to estimate the revenue, it is equally possible to estimate the cost of compliance. But compliance cost estimates are nowhere to be found, and I do not see anyone rushing around the chamber trying to find me more up-to-date memoranda which might include the information. It raises the question: was this proposed legislation referred to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, which has recently reported to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)? That question gives rise to two further queries. Firstly, if it was, what recommendations does the report contain about the increased and burdensome compliance costs which will ensue under these bills and be incurred by importers and consumers of imported products? The second supplementary question is: if it was not, why not? The sad truth appears to be that the quantum of compliance costs has not even been considered by the minister or, if it has, a deliberate decision has been taken to leave the estimates out of his second reading speech and the accompanying memoranda. In either case, a lack of both honesty and courage is in evidence. The minister also seeks to make a virtue of the exemption of exports under what he quaintly describes as 'the new user-pays system' and goes on to acknowledge the contribution of exporters to improving our trade balance, creating more jobs and reducing the federal deficit. So it is demonstrated that the user-pays principle is not inviolate and, to the extent that it is applied to the Customs Service, will continue to absorb the costs of servicing exports. I am not arguing against that, but the point is made: if it is not a firm principle to recover all the costs incurred by the Customs Service where users can be identified, then it ill behoves the minister and his government to pretend otherwise. In all logic, you could not do so, anyway. We know this government is as much in favour of pulling down non-tariff barriers in its quest for fair trading internationally as it is of seeing tariff barriers removed. If it wants to be able to go to the World Trade Organisation, it wants to go there with clean hands. But wait a minute-what have we got here? New, increased and hefty charges on imports of a non-tariff kind. There must be some mistake, surely. This is not what successive Commonwealth governments have espoused in recent times. What would the Cairns Group say? These are amongst the most cynically explained and stupidly argued pieces of legislation that it has been my misfortune to come across in 18 years in this parliament. If the government is sincere, why can't it simply say that it needed the revenue to go towards the elimination of Labor's legacy of a $10 billion underlying deficit? Admittedly, it would also have needed to confess to ripping $46 million off consumers by way of an indirect tax by another name, and that is contrary to if not its election undertakings then at the very least the spirit of them. As it stands, the minister has resorted to a charade and has brought no credit to him, his government, coalition colleagues or this House.

287,Mr MELHAM,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"At the outset, I foreshadow that the opposition will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage to the Bankruptcy Amendment Bi111996. Those amendments are now being circulated. They are as follows: (l) Clause 2, page 1 (line 9) to page 2 (line 12), omit subclause (2), (3) and (4). (2) Schedule 1, page 4 (line 18) to page 5 (line 11), omit item 13. (3) Schedule 1, page 6 (line 6) to page 11 (line 17), omit item 20. (4) Schedule 3-0pposition to oppose. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 form part of measures designed to increase cost recovery from the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia and from registered trustees in bankruptcy matters. In total, the measures proposed by the government are designed to raise $22.392 million over four years, being $3.648 million in 1996-97 and $6.248 million per year in each of the out years. The two bills seek to do this by, firstly, increasing the initial flag fall fee on estates administered by the Official Trustee; secondly, replacement of existing fees payable in respect of all bankruptcies by a flat levy on all realisations in bankruptcies; and, thirdly, requiring registered trustees to hold trust funds in interest bearing accounts and to pay the interest earned to the consolidated revenue fund, similar to existing arrangements for interest earned on the common investment fund managed by the Official Trustee. The commitment to greater cost recovery in the personal insolvency area was foreshadowed by the government in meeting our commitments. In that document, the coalition committed itself to raising an additional $15 million over three years in the area of personBiLL 1996 al insolvency. The document stated: There is some capacity for increased cost recovery in ITSA. ITSA has total revenue of approximately $27 million, of which $22 million originates from Parliamentary appropriations. Better cost recovery will result in further savings of $15 million over three years. This proposed greater cost recovery is simply bad policy. The persons ultimately likely to bear the costs of these increased fees will not be the people who either through their own financial mismanagement or circumstances beyond their control have gone bankrupt. Rather, it is creditors, the innocent parties in insolvency cases, that will be left to carry the burden of these increased fees. Most of these creditors are the small business owners whom this government constantly claims to protect. These measures will punish those businesses, not because they have done anything wrong themselves but because they had the misfortune to be dealing with a person who ultimately went bankrupt. Why has the government got this measure so wrong? For a start, one need only turn to the sloppy job that was done in putting this commitment together. The estimates of expenditure and revenue raised by ITSA in Meeting our commitments were based on the 1993-94 annual report. You would think that they would at least have got the most up-todate figures before seeking to make a promise of this nature. As a result, the coalition failed to recognise that in 1995-96 a total of $28.715 million was appropriated to ITSA and approximately $7 million was raised by way of revenue. Even in 1994-95, the most up-to-date financial data would have shown the coalition that ITSA received $27.5 million in appropriations and raised $8 million in revenue. Let me now turn to the individual fee increases. First, the flag fall fee on estates administered by ITSA will rise from $2,000 to $4,000. This measure is expected to raise $1.62 million in a full year. In estimates, the Attorney-General's Department admitted that ITSA had estimated that the increase in the flag fall fee alone will reduce the number of estates producing a dividend from 45 per cent to just 30 per cent. Creditors in one out of every six bankruptcies will now not receive a dividend because of this measure alone. Secondly, the increase in revenue from realisation charges will be achieved via an increase in the flat fee payable from three cent to eight per cent. This measure is expectber ed to raise $4.2 million in a full year. In last financial year, the total dividend paid only $12.4 million. Thirdly and finally, the payment of interest earned on realisation by registered trustees consolidated revenue is expected to raise $430,000 in a full year. This interest is currently paid to creditors. The been calculated on an assumed four per cent interest rate on such accounts, although no minimum interest rate is required by the legislation. The result therefore is a senseless slug that will only harm ordinary Australsix-month ians-principally small business owners. However, I am glad to say that the Bankomy ruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 does have some showed. redeeming features. The bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1996 which Labor does not to oppose. It is on that basis that I will shortly move an amendment to the Bankruptcy ty. Amendment Bill 1996 which will delete those provisions of the bill which seek to facilitate the implementation of the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996. For the reasons set out above, Labor will be opposing the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 in full. I now tum to the Bankruptcy Charges) Bill 1996. Clause 4 of the bill imposes a fee of $1,500 on applications to become a registered trustee. Clause 5 imposes a $1,000 registration fee. As a result, first time applicants to become registered trustees must pay a fee of $2,500. Clause 6 of the bill also imposes a $1,000 fee for extension of registration. Clause 7 imposes a $500 fee for variation of the condition attaching to a person's registration as a trustee. I note that the introduction of fees for registration as a trustee, similar in magnitude to the above, were foreshadowed by the previous Labor government's Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. Accordingly, Labor will support this bill. These bills also provide me with an opportunity to raise a matter of growing concern in the the community and that is the growing number of bankruptcies. If one looks at the rate of per bankruptcies over the period from the Septemquarter of 1992 to the June quarter of the 1995, one notices a very stable number of was bankruptcies in the community with figures coming in consistently averaging 3,600 per quarter. However, over the last year or so, we have seen a disturbing trend. In the September to and December quarters of 1995, the number of bankruptcies rose to approximately 4,000 a quarter. This jumped to approximately 4,400 revenue has in the March 1996 quarter. Before the government jumps up and starts blaming this rise on the previous Labor government, I think we all know that in the lead-up to the last election the economy could be reasonably described as having collectively held its breath. The econflattened somewhat as all the indicators However, with the election of the Howard seek government, we were promised a sudden boom in confidence in the business communiQuite simply, this has failed to materialise. As a result, the number of bankruptcies rose to over 4,800 in the June quarter and to a staggering 5,400 in the September quarter, the highest on record, I believe. Far from getting the post-election bounce that was promised, by pulling half a per cent of GDP out of the economy this government has set Australia on (Registration a dangerous path. As the September quarter figures show, the total number of bankruptcies and part X arrangements, assignments and compositions have risen in Queensland by over 45 per cent on the previous year. In the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia, the rises are 50 per cent, 54 per cent and 55.5 per cent respectively. In the ACT, the part of Australia most immediately impacted upon by this government's slash and bum approach to economic policy, the rate of bankruptcies has risen by a staggering 63 per cent on the previous year. One of the few states to buck this trend is, not surprisingly, New South Wales, the only Labor state, which had the lowest rate of increase in bankruptcies at only 19.6 per cent. As members would be well aware, bankruptcies are one of the key indicia of the health of an economy. These figures demonstrate that, under this government, the economy, rather than booming along, is sliding into recession. Finally, I wish to tum to the appalling way this government has handled the pursuit of Christopher Skase. We heard last week that the chase for Skase has been resumed, but only after this government and, in particular, this Attorney-General (Mr Williams) let the Australian people down by failing to seize the first available opportunity to continue the pursuit of Mr Skase. On 26 August 1996, Mr Max Donnelly, the trustee of Mr Skase's bankrupt estate, made an application under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act 1996 for financial assistance to further pursue the assets of Mr Skase. Section 305 of the act vests the power to grant such assistance in the Attorney-General. However, as most of these decisions are primarily bureaucratic in nature, the power has been delegated to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and the assistant secretary of the secretariat branch of the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. On 27 September 1996, the assistant secretary, pursuant to delegation, determined that the application should not be granted. Without knowing more about the detail of that application, it would not be appropriate for me to criticise whether that decision fell within the guidelines. However, the decision failed to understand the importance of Mr Skase as a symbol of the excesses of the corporate Australia of the 1980s. It failed to recognise the deep hurt felt by the many ordinary Australians who lost money to this deceptive man. It failed to recognise the importance of taking all reasonable steps to pursue this man to the ends of the earth, to not allow him to forget what he, through his dishonesty and deception, had done to the good reputation of Australian business, to the esteem in which our laws were held and, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many good, honest, hard working Australians. That a bureaucrat, strictly applying a section strictly in accordance with the issued guidelines, should too narrowly construe his duty is perhaps capable of comprehension. But, mindful of the very real anger felt by the Australian public towards Mr Skase, mindful of the damage he has done to our reputation and mindful of the way he continues to snub his nose at Australia and the rule of law from faraway Majorca, for the Attorney-General to initially condone such a decision is simply deplorable. As was revealed in Senate estimates, the Attorney's office was briefed to the effect that the Skase decision was pending and it was likely to be on 24 September 1996, but the Attorney failed to act. His office was formally notified of the decision on 2 October 1996. Again, the Attorney failed to act. Despite having the power to overturn this outrageous decision, the Attorney failed to act prior to the decision becoming public on 9 October 1996. Even then, despite his office being told the afternoon of that day that the story was about to break that evening on A Current Affair, and despite knowing that at any time he could have overturned that decision, the Attorney failed to act. Even when he did act, it took the Attorney six weeks to make a decision he could have that made at any time. The fact that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) then had the audacity to blame the bureaucrats for a decision which they knew the Attorney knew about and which the Attorney's own inaction had condoned is not only one of the most appalling acts of denial this place has seen but also one of the most stupendous failings of ministerial responsibility of recent times. The Attorney owes an apology to hoteliers in Adelaide, florists, airlines, service station owners, limousine companies, computer firms, caterers, accountants, electricians, lawyers, couriers and even a Brisbane pub, who are all owed money by Mr Skase. He should explain just how he got this decision so terribly wrong. Just as importantly, he should apologise to the bureaucrats whom he has left carrying the can as a result of his own deeds. Even today some questions still remain unanswered. The government is refusing to reveal how much money the Attorney has set as the limit for the funding of the continued pursuit of Mr Skase. All the Attorney has said is that the amount is comparatively small when compared with the $800,000 spent to date. I suspect that the reason why the Attorney will not reveal the sum is that it is embarrassingly small. It is so small that he is afraid it will show the government's decision to be nothing more than a cheap political stunt. It is hard to believe that Mr Skase will know what the nature of the action is simply because of the total amount of money to be spent. So what have the Attorney and this government got to hide? There is no reason why the amount approved should not be released. The Attorney should come clean and do it now. This whole affair has been poorly dealt with by this government. Not only has it put at risk the important task of pursuing the assets held by Mr Skase that belonged to his fellow Australians; it also shows that this government does not understand the real pain and hurt caused to ordinary Australians by the profligacy of people such as Mr Skase. I welcome, and so does the opposition, the government's decision to resume the chase for Skase. It is a pity that the Attorney appears not to have given this matter the commitment that it deserves when he initially did what he did. That commitment is important. Nothing less will satisfy the understandable outrage felt by the Australian people at the way this government and this Attorney have handled the issue. Nothing less will help to placate the anger the Australian people feel at the way Mr Skase has shown disrespect for them and for our legal system.",145
288,Mr SLIPPER,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"Fisher) (5.46 p.m.)Listening to the pious words from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), one could be forgiven for omitting to remember that the Labor Party has been in office for most of the last 14 years. He mentioned small business. He mentioned bankruptcies. He mentioned Christopher Skase. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that the excesses of the 1980s in corporate Australia occurred under the management of the former government. You would also be aware that the former government attempted--obviously not successfullyto recover assets from Mr Skase. I would like to reject the criticisms made of the Attorney General (Mr Williams) by the honourable member for Banks. As the honourable member for Banks would know, the Attorney General is a very effective minister, a person who approaches his duties with a very great degree of ability and diligence. Dr Kemp-Hear, hear!",148
289,Mr SLIPPER,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"The minister at the table agrees. The Attorney-General has done the right thing. The Attorney-General has responded to concerns in the Australian community, and this government will continue to pursue Christopher Skase's assets. I must also reject the comments made by the honourable member for Banks concerning our approach to small business. This is the first government that has come forward with a firm program to recognise the fact that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. In doing that, you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Minister for Small  has made a large number of announcements concerning the way in which small business will be able to do what it does best-that is, get down to business and create jobs. You would also be aware of the drops in interest rates that will assist small business to grow and invest, and you would be aware of the fact that the parliament has now passed the industrial relations legislation which will do away with Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws, enable Australia to get down to work and enable the creation of more jobs. I am pleased to join the debate on the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996. As has been indicated, these bills are being debated in a cognate manner. In accordance with the policy announced in our Meeting our commitments document, the level of cost recovery from bankruptcy activities involving the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia will be increased by an amount estimated at $3.648 million in 199697, rising to $6.248 million per annum in out years. Creditors who benefit from a credible and effective personal insolvency system will thus meet a more appropriate share of the cost of maintaining and administering that system. The increased revenue will come from three measures. First, the initial fee charged by ITSA when administering bankruptcies which have funds in them will be increased from $2,000 to $4,000. This will produce increased cost recovery for the direct use of ITSA services by creditors of an estimated $1.6 miilion net per annum in a full year. Secondly, the current fee charged-three per cent--on all amounts realised and credited to trust accounts of bankruptcies administered by both ITSA and registered trustees will be replaced with a flat realisations charge of eight per cent. This increase will contribute the cost borne by government in providing various ITSA services for the benefit of the full commercial community. This measure is estimated to produce an additional $4.2 million net in a full year. Thirdly, interest earned from trust funds held in bankruptcy and part X administrations which are administered by private registered trustees will be payable to consolidated revenue to further partly offset the cost borne by the taxpayer in maintaining the bankruptcy system. This has been the case in bankruptcies administered by ITSA since 1980, and the measure will thus place all bankruptcies on an equal footing. It is estimated this will produce an additional half a million dollars net in a full year. These arrangements are similar to those which apply in all states where interest on solicitors' trust accounts is used by law societies for public purposes such as the regulation of solicitors and the funding of legal aid. The combined effect of these measures will place all creditors, whether their bankruptcy is administered by ITSA or by registered trustees, on a more equal footing in terms of contributing to the cost of the bankruptcy administration system. The increased charges and fees will only apply in those matters where there are funds. They will not impact on bankrupts. Legislation is necessary to introduce these measures and, in respect of the increase to ITSA fees, will apply to new bankruptcies after the commencement date of the amendments. The legislation will also produce a simpler collection method for fees and charges that are taken. It will streamline administrative practices for both ITSA and registered trustees. For instance, private registered trustees will no longer be required to open a separate bank account for each estate nor issue receipts in respect of each payment into the estate. The government once again is taking the opportunity to reduce the level of paper work required of registered trustees. There has been some criticism of our plans to increase cost recovery of ITSA bankruptcy services. How can we justify this? In accordto ance with the policy announced in Meeting our commitments, increased cost recovery from ITSA will raise an additional estimated $22.3 million over four years. Creditors who benefit from a credible and effective personal insolvency system will now bear a more appropriate share of the cost in administering that system. The proposed fees and charges are not altogether new. They involve an increase in existing fees already collected or, in the case of interest from trust fund moneys in administrations of registered trustees, they apply requirements that have existed in respect of ITSA bankruptcies since 1980-16 years ago. The proposed arrangements for taking interest earned on trust fund monf!Ys administered by registered trustees are similar to the situation affecting ITSA bankruptcies since 1980. They are also similar to arrangements which apply to all states where interest on solicitors' trust accounts is used by law societies for public purposes such as the regulation of solicitors and the funding of legal aid. The combined effect of these measures will place all creditors, whether their bankruptcy is administered by a registered trustee or by ITSA, on a more equal footing in terms of contributing to the cost of maintaining the hankruptcy administration system. The increased costs and charges will apply only in those matters where there are funds and will not impact on bankrupts. The legislation will produce a simpler method for collecting fees and charges. As I have outlined, there are three bills: Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill proposes amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 that are consequential on the proposed enactment of the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill-the bills being debated cognately today. At present, fees and charges are imposed by rules made under the act. With the enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, these fees and charges would have been imposed under regulations made for that purpose. Introduction of a new interest charge and changes to the way in w'hich existing fees and charges are calculated in respect of reali sations and registration of trustees are proposed. The introduction of these proposed new arrangements imposing charges will require the enactment of new legislation. Consequential amendment of the act to give effect to these changes is also required and is proposed in this bill. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill proposes the removal of references to prescribed fees and their replacement with references to the appropriate proposed charges bill-one of the cognate hills. Additional provisions are also proposed to provide for administration of the proposed charges bills, in particular to allow for the orderly collection of charges by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy on behalf of the Commonwealth. Provisions are also proposed to allow for extensions of time in which to pay charges and the remission of penalties and charges in appropriate circumstances. The opportunity has been taken to streamline administration of accounts held by registered trustees by allowing them to consolidate trust account moneys into a single account if they wish to do so and they will be no longer required to issue receipts for moneys paid into accounts in all cases. They will also be no longer required to furnish receipts to the Official Receiver at the conclusion of an administration. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 also ensures that the Inspector-General will be the responsible for ensuring the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1996, the proposed Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 are complied with, and appropriate powers to allow this to occur are contained in the bill. It is clear that the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 proposes the introduction of charges in respect of the estate administration function carried out by registered trustees and the Official Trustee under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. The realisations charge was previously imposed in the rules made by the Bankruptcy Act 1996. As a result of the enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, rules will no longer be made under that act. Instead, regulations will be made in relation to appropriate matters. The opportunity presented by the changes resulting from the need to revise the rules has been taken to enact separate legislation in respect of charges relating to bankruptcy, rather than imposing them by regulation. The interest charge is a new charge imposed in respect of interest earned on funds held in trust by registered trustees in relation to estates and other matters administered by them. The introduction of the proposed charge will place these estates on the same footing as those administered by the Official Trustee where funds held on behalf of estates and debtors are held in the common investment fund and the interest is paid to consolidated revenue. The third bill is the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996. This bill proposes the imposition of charges in respect of applications for registration of trustees in bankruptcy, registration of trustees, reregistration and applications to vary conditions on registration. These charges were previously imposed in the rules made under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill would mean that rules will no longer be made under that act. Instead, regulations will be made in relation to appropriate matters. Opportunity has been taken to enact these charges in legislation rather than imposing them by regulation. I believe this is a very positive step because, quite often, there has been the accusation under succeeding governments that by passing so many matters over to the executive the parliament is in effect negating its responsibility to determine what the law ought to be. The fact that we are indeed enacting these changes in legislation rather than by imposing them by regulation is a very important step forward. The issue of bankruptcy in Australia is clearly a very difficult subject. There have been Commonwealth acts relating to bankruptcy for a very long time. As in so many other areas in the law, it is a question of the appropriate balance. In bankruptcy one wants to give the bankrupt person the opportunity to make a fresh start, make a clean breast of things, make a new life and take the opportunity to commence in business again. Having said that, it is important to recognise that a person who has gone bankrupt clearly has committed an act of bankruptcy and usually owes a considerable amount of money. Obviously, the creditors must benefit to the greatest extent possible. I think both sides of politics would not dissent from the principle that the bankrupt ought to be given the chance for a fresh start while ensuring that the creditors are treated in the best possible way. Where both sides of politics differ from side to side is in determintraverse ing the appropriate balance. We believe that the amendments we are debating in the chamber tonight are an appropriate balance. We reject the criticisms made by the honourable member for Banks about this legislation, about the conduct of the Attorney General and about our approach to small business. We are a government which was elected on 2 March to give the people of Australia a fresh start. We achieved almost a record swing at the election. I am disappointed that those opposite simply have not recognised that they did not win the election. They will not accept that we have a mandate for these changes to the law; on that we have a mandate for so many other reforms which will result from our policies. I am very pleased to have risen in the forward chamber tonight to speak to these three cognate bills. I am confident that, whatever amendments the honourable member for Banks might choose to move, the House in passing judgment on those amendments will support the approach taken by the Attorney General. I commend the bills to the House.",148
290,Mr TRUSS,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"As the previous speaker, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), has mentioned, bankruptcy is a very troubled subject. It is rare that any of the people who are associated with a bankruptcy walk away from their experience happy. It is a little bit like family law: there is an absence of goodwill; there is an absence of a desire on the part of many of the parties involved to see the matter to a satisfactory conclusion; and there is a lot of ill feeling about the circumstances that may have led to the bankruptcy. I do not believe the law in this area is adequate, but I am not sure it is possible to devise a system that will adequately resolve all of the impossible problems that seem to arise in the administration of a bankrupt's estate. The amendments we are talking about this evening will make some improvements, but we would be deluding ourselves if we were to believe that this would bring an end to the problems associated with bankruptcy arrangements. The previous speaker has outlined much of the detail of these proposed bills; so I will not that ground again. He has outlined what is aimed to be achieved through this group of bills and pointed out the reasons why the government is taking the action which is put before the parliament this evening. I have some reservations about the legislation. I am not sure that I am convinced by the arguments that the interest earned on estates should go to consolidated revenue. Obviously, the big losers out of any bankruptcy action are the creditors. It is the creditors who will be losing out as a result of the interest money going to consolidated revenue instead of being shared amongst the creditors. I acknowledge that interest does go to consolidated revenue in circumstances where the Official Trustee is managing an estate but, in those cases, the Official Trustee is actively involved in the management of the estate. So it is probably appropriate there should be a greater recovery of the costs of that action from those who will get the benefit from it. The new interest charge imposed in respect of interest earned on funds held in trust by registered trustees in relation to estates and other matters administered by them will result in additional revenue to the Commonwealthrevenue that otherwise would have gone to creditors. There would have been two ways of achieving equity between estates managed by private insolvency practitioners and those managed by the Official Trustee. The second way would have been to return the interest to the creditors in both cases, but that would have had a negative impact on the government's revenue. In these current circumstances where the government is endeavouring to fund a $10.3 budget deficit inherited from the previous government, that option-whilst perhaps philosophically attractive-was financially impractical. So once again the government has to make a compromise between what might well be good policy and what might well be financially necessary. In this particular legislation, by ensuring that these charges come through to consolidated revenue, we are doing a disservice to creditors. We are also acknowledging the very obvious fact that the costs of bankruptcy not only fall on creditors, not only go against the bankrupt's estate, not only go to those who are associated with the process but also go to the government who has some responsibility for administering these matters. It is a pretty unsatisfactory state of affairs. The government has chosen this option, which I will not oppose when it comes to a point of a vote, but I have to say that it leaves· me somewhat uneasy. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the whole issue of bankruptcy means a great deal of pain and hardship for the bankrupt. They lose what assets they have been working to build up. In many cases, it ends a dream. There is a loss of confidence for them in their capacity to manage their own affairs and perhaps to work in business again. Of course, it also affects their family and their friends. It puts a great deal of stress on the family relationship. Many bankruptcies lead to breakdowns in families, as well as the loss of friendships and the circle of acquaintanceships which the person once enjoyed. For creditors there are also great losses. They obviously lose money. Inevitably, they do not get the full return of the money owed to them. They feel cheated. They have acted in good faith with the bankrupts but do not get paid for the services rendered. It can sometimes affect their own viability in business. The fact that their bills are not paid does not mean they do not have to pay their creditors so they can be placed in a most difficult cash flow situation. There is frequently dispute and litigation which again leads to loss of time and effort on unproductive causes. They generally have to wait years for results, and not only is the money when it comes to them often much less than they had a right to expect but they have had to wait years to get what they receive-and now, of course, they will not even earn any interest on the funds that have been accumulated by the receiver manager. They have to return payments in some instances, as well, that have been made before a person became bankrupt. I have recently had drawn to my attention a case in my electorate where a business was owed a substantial amount of money by another business. They went to court and a judgment was awarded in their favour with costs. They finally received the payment from their creditor only to find, about three months later, that the business became bankrupt and they had to return not only the amount of their debt but also the court costs which had been awarded in their favour when the judgment was made. These people feel justly aggrieved. The court had found in their favour and their bill was finally paid after years of waiting. They had costs awarded in their favour but when their creditor finally went bankrupt they had to return all the money plus the court costs, then wait for their share of the distribution the bankrupt estate. So there are many unhappy examples of the effect of one business on another when bankruptcy proceedings occur. One of the obvious public examples of concerns in this regard have been the effects on subcontractors when a principal contractor goes bankrupt. Quite often this involves governments as well. There is a natural tendency, particularly from governments but also from people in private industry, to accept the lowest tenderer for a contract. Sometimes they are the lowest tenderer for a reason: they do not really have the capacity to deliver on the contract. So when the principal contractor goes into bankruptcy the subcontractors are left without being paid. I know many submissions have been made; indeed, a private member's bill was introduced into this parliament by the former member for Dawson to seek to protect contractors in these sorts of circumstances. It is a very difficult area. The former Labor Deputy Premier in Queensland also propose similar legislation. But when it comes to bringing it into existence, it is not as easy it might seem. There is no doubt that many people who start off in business by acting as subcontractors for principals in large contracts find that all their efforts are wasted when, through no fault of their own, their principal contractor goes into bankruptcy; they are not able to be paid for the work they have done and so their own business fails. Sadly, there are also some people who abuse the bankruptcy laws. There are people who avoid their financial responsibilities by irresponsibly running up debts which they have no intention of ever paying. Some people have no sense of shame about bankruptcy. It is just regarded as a part of business. They will walk away from their responsibilities and, as soon as possible, start up a new business and perhaps go through it all again. This also sometimes happens to people with very small means, even people who are just working in a trade, PAYE taxpayers and others. It is a matter of regret that some people buy electrical appliances, motor vehiof cles and all sorts of things that they cannot afford, with no real intention of paying them off. They willingly go into bankruptcy and leave businesses around town having to pick up the bits and pieces. Those sorts of things are really unacceptable. It is immoral behaviour but it is happening more and more. I do not know how you pass laws for morality. In reality, whenever we introduce laws into this parliament there are some people who are too clever and who find their way around them. The laws which I referred to previously, which affected one of my constituents who had to pay back money to a business after it had gone bankrupt, were introduced to try to catch the Skases and Bonds of this world who deliberately siphon their funds away into safe areas before they go bankrupt so they are able to live a lavish lifestyle, even though their creditors go unrewarded. In many of these cases, people-particularly the small people-have no assets and so go unpursued. It is completely pointless for a business to go to court, even to get them declared bankrupt, because the costs of all as that action are more than they are likely to recover. Again, my attention has been drawn by a constituent to a problem within my own electorate of a man who has gone bankrupt owing about $100,000. He is still driving around in his wife's car and living in the house that was transferred to his wife several years ago. He has substantial superannuation and life policies which are exempt from realisation for the benefit of his creditors. My constituent asked me, I think quite justifiably: why can people put large amounts into superannuation and that money be safe from creditors? It seems in this instance there is substantial evidence to suggest that the person was aware of the fact that he had debts beyond his ability to pay and manipulated his affairs so he could continue his lifestyle and leave his creditors receiving nothing. In this case, the creditors pursued him: they spent $16,000 in legal expenses to be told that they could expect to recover absolutely nothing. So the creditors' savings have been lost in a fruitless pursuit of somebody who, it seems, knowingly defrauded them of the funds that were rightfully theirs. Yet nobody is going to prosecute in this case, nobody is going to take this person through the courts, because it will be seen to he a useless exercise. I think there is a need to have some kind of effort made by law enforcement authorities to endeavour to follow through some of these cases where there may not be a lot of money involved but where there has clearly been a wilful attempt to defraud the rights of the creditors. I know that over recent times it has been increasingly difficult in business. The number of hankruptcies has increased substantially over recent years. Labor's economic policythe 24 per cent interest rates, their punitive taxation measures, the crushing business paperwork-has really made it very difficult for many people to succeed in business. When the Labor government came to office, there were about 5,000 bankruptcies a year between 1982 and 1985. By 1991-92, the numher of bankruptcies had risen to 16,000. Since that time, in each financial year, there have been around 14,000 bankruptcies in a year. Many businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to survive under the threat of government regulation, the difficulties of competing with the multinational corporations, the huge shopping centres, the Coles Myers and so forth of this world. They have also found it difficult to make payments such as fringe benefits tax, superannuation payments, the increasing workers compensation fees and the like. All these have really challenged business people to succeed. There has heen increasing business regulation, and all of this has made it very difficult. But another problem has developed as a by-product of the large numher of redundancies that have bcen offered in the Public Service and in puhlic instrumentalities over recent times. MallY of the people who are receiving suhstantial redundancy payments-even volunteering to receive those payments-do so hecause they would like to have a go in small business. They leave their former, sheltered position in the Public Service to try to find a job running their own business. Business looks very easy from the outside, so they often go to the sunbelt areas of Australia where there are strong levels of growth. Many of them come to my own electorate and buy a small business, with little knowledge about how to operate that business, how you need to develop a cash flow, a business plan, how you need to work through the various issues that are associated with running your business. Many of them have absolutely no management skills. They do not know how to assess the financial records that have been put in front of them before they purchase the business. They often pay far too much for what the business is actually capable of returning. In fact, in electorates such as my own there is a developing trade in small businesses. People establish a business, develop attractive premises and then wait for somebody to move up from the south or come from a redundant Public Service position with a substantial amount of cash to invest in the business. Sadly, most of those businesses fail because of a lack of business expertise and a lack of capital, and a lot of people are hurt. The redundancy payment is gone, which leaves the individual disillusioned with business, with the community and with his own capacity to work in private industry. Of course, they also leave creditors around the town dissatisfied and upset that their accounts have not been paid. Many of these circumstances lead sadly to bankruptcy. Some of these people get advice early enough to be able to get out of their business or to get some management expertise to help them through. I caution all of those people who find themselves with a windfall amount of money from a redundancy payment or from superannuation to look closely at the business that they are choosing to enter before they make that financial commitment. They should make sure that they have got a business plan, get some expert financial advice, talk to people in the community about the record of the business that they are proposing to buy-does it really have a capacity to give them the lifestyle, cash flow and income that they had been used to? Sadly, so many of these cases lead to bankruptcy, a loss of whatever assets the people have ever had and certainly the loss of their own confidence in their capacity to be successful in private industry. We have these many unhappy circumstances associated with bankruptcy: the unhappy experiences of losing life savings, losing friends and contacts, the discord that is always associated and the angry words. Insolvency practitioners have a very unpleasant task, Sure, their income is preserved-they are the only ones that get out of a bankruptcy with their income in place-but they have to accept a great deal of abuse and anger at creditors meetings. And then when the news finally comes through that the payment will be only a few cents in the dollar, everybody is critical. There are some insolvency practitioners as well who leave a lot to be desired. I am aware of one case where there had been gross mismanagement of an estate. Fortunately there was another lawyer who was prepared to pursue the case as a white knight. The incompetence of this practitioner was well established but his only penalty was the voluntary surrendering of his licence. The creditors had to walk away, getting only a fraction of what they should have received. I call on the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to use the additional funds that are going to be coming his way as a result of the interest funds that are going to be transferred to make insolvency practice work better, to make sure that estates Slipper, P. N. are managed efficiently and well and to ensure that creditors get the maximum value for the dollar spent. Debate (on motion by Mr Marek) adjourned.

293,Mr SPEAKER,DETAILED INFORMATION,"The answer to the right honourahle memher's question is as follows: The attached tahle has heen prepared providing hroad running costs expenditure comparisons. It is not possihle to provide direct comparisons across ail departmental functions hecause of differences in the program structures and operations of the two departments. The tahlc shows that: NOES the Department of the House of Representatives' 1996-97 running costs budgd is $0.990m less than the Department of the Senate's running costs budget. In 1995/96 the expenditure outcome for the Department of the House of Representatives was $0.399m greater than that for the Department of the Senate. This translates to a turnaround between the two financial years of $ I .389m; and PAIRS the Department of the Senate's 1996/97 funding allocation for committee support is $0.674m more than for the Department of the House of Representatives. The Senate received additional supplementation of $ I .24 I m for Standing and Select committees 2 whereas the House of Representatives received no additional supplementation even though it sought funding for the net increase of one new parliamentary committee established for the 38th Parliament. Up to now the principle has always been that the Department of the House of Representatives has received additional funding for the net increase in committee activity. There is within the House of Representatives a widely feIt concern that the government recognised the Senate's need for additional committee funding but failed to recognise the same need in the House of Representatives, resulting in an inadequate allocation of funds to that House. J The budget figures used in the comparison are the Running Costs appropriation figures contained in the 1996/97 Budget Paper No 2, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1996/97. These figures exclude Section 35 receipts (Department of the House of Representatives' 1996/97 estimated S35 receipts are $ I 73,000 compared to the Department of the Senate's $207,000) and Other Services expenditure (Department of the House of Representatives' appropriation is $429,000 compared to the Department of the Senate's $400,000). They also exclude Special Appropriation funding (Department of the House of Representatives$I8.790m; Department of the Senate-$9.750m). 2 Includes $288,000 additional 'one-off funding for 1995/96 Senate Committee activity included in the Department of the Senate's 1996/97 Appropriation.

Was it the Minister for Finance who put forward suggestions on behalf of parliamentary departments and other departments of this parliament? What impact will any decisions taken by the ERC have in reference to services to us as members of parliament in the future and particularly in the coming 12 months?",156
294,Mr SPEAKER,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (i) Neither the Speaker of the House of Representatives nor the President of the Senate represented the parliamentary departments in ERC budget funding discussions. Consistent with past practice, the Minister for Finance presented the savings and new policy proposals for the Department of the House of Representatives (the Department) to ERC; and (ii) As noted in the 1996/97 Portfolio Budget Statements for the Department, the Government's decisions to reduce parliamentary outlays by $10m (the Department contributing $0.3m in 1996/97) and to reduce departmental running costs from 1996/97 by 2% in addition to the efficiency diviNA OF THE SENATE 1996197 BUDGET House of Reps Senate $m $m 4.674 1 4.476 4.985 5.661 2.035 1.311 3.491 4.434 5.912 6.178 0.504 0.820 1.168 3 0.879 22.769 23.759 the third edition of House of Representatives is estimated to meet some 80% of the cost compared to the Senate's 20%. Members' services has been included under Corporate dend of 1%, have required the Department to implement a number of savings measures to achieve efficiencies and to reduce or eliminate lower priority activities. The measures that have directly impacted on Members are: a reduction in expenditure on security services, which may cause inconvenience to building occupants arising from the more restrictive opening hours of access doors and the closure of some interchange points during non sitting periods (this measure was implemented jointly with the Department of the Senate); a reduction in Members' personalised stationery entitlement, a reduction in the number of daily newspapers supplied during sitting weeks to Members (from three to one), and reduced staffing for Members' keyboard support pools; and some reduction in planned funding for the replacement of Members' computing and office equipment. In terms of broader support services to Members, for example, secretariat services to committees, the Department of the House of Representatives was unsuccessful in obtaining additional funding for new parliamentary committees established for the 38th Parliament. Up to now, the principle has always been that the Department has received additional funding for the net increase in Committee activity. This principle is considered fair and reasonable given that the establishment of the committees is a decision of the government and the Parliament and not the Department of the House of Representatives. To absorb the cost of the net increase in committee activity and to contribute to the funding reductions imposed on the Department, staff resources available to individual committees have been reduced. The savings were achieved through the introduction of linked secretariats to support pairs of committees. If the House agreed to the establishment of additional committees in the next 12 months or required an existing committee to undertake additional functions, additional funding would be essential. If additional funds were not provided this would have an impact on resources presently allocated to all existing committees. An important issue facing the Depilrtment of the House of Representatives Uointly with the Department of the Senate) is the failure to obtain from budget any funding. for the programmed replacement over the next 5 years of obsolete security systems. Additional funding is required as the chamber departments were not provided with any funding for replacement of major security systems in their running costs bases.

This has become a they would not deny the will of the 100,000 have no way of knowing the will of the rest simply about reflecting their will; it is also think, we stagnate as a society: nothing changes, development. On the other hand, if we simply follows. The balance between the two is the issue of prejudice, it would appear that the issue of euthanasia, it would appear that the from this life. The ironic part is that the position of parliamentarians to those two majorities. That bears some thinking given the complex role of democracy, the way importance in the years ahead. The way we as make and shape what we see as democracy into handling this particular issue with aplomb and we have personal experiences, personal views difficult to accept the point of view of many where pushing one button is ethically allowable it impossible to accept the claim that people so intentionally: that somehow the death of the or irrelevant to their act. I think that position and then try to manufacture the arguments to is a great deal of dishonesty in the fabrication a person to die, they can say, 'Mea culpa, MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 there were two types of acts-self-regarding acts states on self-regarding acts constituted tyranny. on the right of Northern Territorians to have euthanasia is a tyrannical intervention. my constituents, I have formed the view that the is that of terminally ill people to choose for pain.

Of course, other people we represent. They assume that we of the community. But representing people is not about leading. If we simply reflect what people there is no innovation and there is no lead and do not reflect, eventually no-one fundamental issue in both these debates. On the majority support a position of prejudice. On the majority support people's right to chose their exit is almost in the opposite direction about. In this complex life we lead, and those things are worked through will have great parliamentarians handle those two issues will the next century. I am delighted that we are with a majority view. On this particular issue and philosophical positions. I find it very of my colleagues that a system can be devised whereas pushing another button is not. I find who turn off a life support system are not doing person on the life support system is accidental is the position ofthose who have a conclusion suit. There are no ethics in that. I think there that, by turning off life support and allowing but I am not responsible. I did not do it.' NA Thursday, 21 November 1996 I wonder how they would relate to the story off the switch accidentally. You wonder whether technically they should be. But, in the same hospital staff who turns off the switch knowing they die from the illness, from starvation or supplies food, so they starve a person to death. assist a person to die somehow seems to be different. There is no differentiation in my mind, except is having the switch turned off or the button some say, some choice. The person on If we then take the next step, which is the murder, that suddenly doctors, nurses and families and centre because they are expendable and disposable: families are like that, they will not want this case they will need the approval of the person involved. If people are so malevolent, if doctors are give them permission to murder someone, would the families who seek the benefit of to achieving that-the requirement of the not? If anything, euthanasia What we are getting is obscuration. People proposition that euthanasia equals murder. Voluntary decision by the person themselves. What we right now-I read it with some concern last because he helped his wife to die and he tried years who did an act of great generosity, of he failed his own suicide. Week by week we are seeing more and more bear to watch what is happening. A man has his wife but because he did not kill himself. would not be dragged through a court to explain I find those who argue from a Christian I had an experience in recent years of has spent some years not knowing anybody. his children. I do not want to be in that situation someone she does not understand and does not to do that on my behalf. I do not want the family to what my family went through for that cases and, if anything, that made it very clear care is not reflected by persistence with survival. Let us go back to our ethical systems, to pre-Christian have developed. What we are finding nowadays is that we can keep people alive in their dreamt of, beyond what our ethics were ever word-life, l-i-f-e. Therefore, it still means the MAIN COMMITTEE 7323 out of the UK about the cleaner who turned or not they should be charged with murder; way, so should any doctor or any member of the that in so doing the person will die-whether whatever. That switch may well be a switch that Somehow they say, 'It's not my fault.' To I find that the parallel is absolutely total. for one thing: with euthanasia the person who pushed off-whatever it might be called-has the life support system has no choice. suggestion that this will lead to an outburst of will be rushing off to kill people left, right the fact is that if doctors, nurses and legislation because it will impede them.

It is a very strongly held view. I might say, with strong religious beliefs, and that includes the terms described by a competent adult terminally life-is justified. So, in many cases, even those support the availability of the choice If you look at the arguments on euthanasia, firstly, the question of religious belief; secondly, MAIN COMMITTEE 7351 one of the things that concerns me about this I would call a growing conservative obsession with what is a grave moral decision which is inherently quote Robert Hughes, in his essay, 'The But, again, it is an observation which I of the honourable Marshall Perron, who was Territory.

Main Committee adjourned at 12.54 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: International Agreements Implemented by Federal Legislation (Question No. 764) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Which international (a) conventions, (b) treaties and (c) agreements have been implemented by federal legislation since the answer to question No 2351 (Hansard, 23 August 1995, page 380). Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I note that the honourable member has asked for this information in a series of questions going back some years. Clearly, there is a need for this information to be made publicly available. In the Government's response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report Trick or Treaty? Commonwealth Power to Make and Implement Treaties, a commitment was made to provide an annual list to the Parliament of Commonwealth legislation specifically implementing treaties. The complete 1995 list has been compiled and is set out below. The 1996 list is under preparation and will be tabled as soon as possible in 1997. I am informed that the following Acts passed by the Federal Parliament during 1995 expressly implemented international conventions, treaties or agreements. Included under the name of each Act is a brief explanation prepared by my Department which sets out the relevant international convention, treaty or agreement or other matter of international law. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Financial Support Fund) Repeal Act 1995 (No. 13 of 1995) This Act repealed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Financial Support Fund) Act 1976 which authorised the ratification by Australia of the agreement to establish a financial support fund among OECD members. The fund was designed to assist OECD members facing serious external account difficulties following the oil crisis of 1973-74 and was intended to supplement, on a last resource basis, other sources of credit to which members encountering serious difficulties had recourse. The Act was never proclaimed, NA however, because the fund was never brought into effect due to the failure of some other OECD countries to ratify the agreement. International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995 (No. 18 of 1995) and Intemational War Crimes Tribunals (Consequential Amendments) Act 1995 (No. 19 of 1995) These Acts provided legislative authority for Commonwealth co-operation with the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal and the Rwanda Tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and provided for the Tribunals to sit in Australia if required. Income Tax (lntemational Agreements) Amendment Act 1995 (No. 22 of 1995) This Act gave legislative force to the provisions of the renegotiated comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and New Zealand signed on 27 January 1995. The Act inserted the text of the Agreement into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 and made consequential amendments to that Act and to a number of other Acts. Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act 1995 (No. 38 of 1995) The object of this Act was to ensure, as far as possible, that goods and services were not supplied or exported from Australia or by Australian citizens, residents or companies in circumstances where they would or might be used in the development, production, acquisition or stockpiling of weapons that are capable of causing mass destruction or of missiles that are capable of delivering such weapons. The Act implemented in part Australia's obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention, the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1995 (No 57 of 1995) and Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities)(Consequential Amendments) Act 1995 (No. 58 of 1995) These Acts provided that privileges and immunities could be conferred upon the premises of, and persons associated with, certain overseas missions price in Australia which represent self governing or autonomous foreign territories that are not states and are not recognised by Australia as states such as Hong Kong, New Caledonia and the Cook Islands. Transport Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1995 (No 89 of 1995) On 1 November 1994, Australia entered into a treaty with the United States and Canada which requires each country to ban smoking on all passenger flights operated by its airlines between points in the territory of one party to the treaty and points in the territory of another party. Amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 under this Act extended the application of regulations banning smoking to foreign registered aircraft operated by Australian carriers overseas. Further amendments were made to the Air Navigation Act relating to aviation security including hijacking and terrorism.

The Navigation Act was also amended to incorporate the terms and principles adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in its International Convention on Salvage 1989. The convention provides greater incentives for effective and timely salvage operations and to assist with the protection of the environment. The Act also made certain amendments to the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986 to enable Australia to accede to the 1992 Protocol amending the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969.

The Act provided an improved administrative framework, strengthened measures against illegal wildlife trafficking and included measures in support of the conservation of Australia's biodiversity. The changes largely arose from recommendations of the Ley Report which reviewed the Act having particular regard to Australia's obligations under CITES. Ozone Protection Amendment Act 1995 (No. 124 of 1995), Ozone Protection (Licence FeesManufacture) Act 1995 (No. 125 of 1995) and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Act 1995 (No. 126 of 1995) These three Acts amended the existing legislative scheme dealing with ozone protection to reflect Australia's evolving obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The Ozone Protection Amendment Act amended the Ozone Protection Act 1989. Among other things, the Amendment Act repealed the existing licence and quota system to stop the further import or manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons, halon, methyl chloroform or carbon tetrachloride consistent with Australia's obligations under the Montreal Protocol. International Tax Agreements Amendment Act 1995 (No. 127 of 1995) This Act provided legislative authority for the entry into force of the comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and the Czech Republic. The Act inserted the text of the agreement into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 as a schedule to that Act.

Family Court of Australia: Appropriations (Question No. 765)  notice, on 18 September 1996: (1) Does the Parliament appropriate money for the running of the Family Court of Australia; if so, what sums are appropriated for specific purposes of the Court. (2) Are there legislative requirements for money to be spent on specific purposes; if so, what are they; if not, why not. (3) Are there differences between the responsibility and accountability of executive Departments for their expenditure and the Family Court for its expenditure, in particular its administrative expendiglobal ture. (4) Is he or his department developing procedures to ensure that moneys appropriated to the Court for specific programs are spent on those programs; if so, will the procedures be legally binding. (5) Were the moneys appropriated for the expanded mediation and counselling services in 1995-96 underspent by 82 per cent and 59 per cent, respectively; if so, on how many occasions has similar underexpenditure occurred within federal courts. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Portfolio Budget Statements 199697 for the Attomey-General's Portfolio-Budget Related Paper No.l.1-lists the following budget estimates for program and running costs for Subprogram 4.2, the Family Court of Australia, for the current financial year: Running Costs-$I04,962,000 Other Program Costs-$735,000 Total Appropriations-$105, 697,000 Less Adjustments (for revenue)-$709,000 Total Outlays-$I04,988,000 (2) Yes. Chapter IV of the Constitution and Part V of the Audit Act 1901 require that funds be spent for the purposes for which the funds are appropriated. The funds appropriated for Sub-program 4.2 are for all aspects of the administration of justice and the provision of services by the Family Court of Australia. (3) Yes. While section 38A of the Family Law Act 1975 vests management responsibility for the administrative affairs of the Court in the Chief Justice, subsection 38A(4) of the Act prohibits the Chief Justice from entering into a contract for a sum exceeding $250,000 without the approval of the Attorney-General or acquiring an interest or right in land that would constitute an interest or right in land for the purposes of the Land Acquisitions Act 1989. (4) No. Direct responsibility for the management of the Family Court, including management of its financial affairs, is vested, under section 38A of the Family Law Act 1975, in the Chief Justice of the Family Court. (5) Yes. The figures of 82 per cent and 59 per cent are cited in Australian National Audit Office Report No.4 1996-97, Use of Justice Statement Funds and Financial Position, Family Court of Australia The Report also states that ' ... the Court had the legal discretion to allocate these funds for the purposes the Court saw fit. .. '. The federal courts and tribunals each receive a budget allocation, and have done since they became self-administering. The federal courts and tribunals manage their priorities within their overall funding levels, both within a financial year and across financial years. Union Industrial Action (Question No. 797) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 8 October 1996: (I) Is it a fact that workplace issues and political motivations of unionists taking strike action in essential services are often not fully reported to the community. (2) Do the actions of unionists engaging in industrial action often affect a wide cross section of the general community. (3) Will he require unions to publish full particulars of strike action in the mass media prior to or during industrial actions so that the community is aware of the reasons for any disruption to essential services. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) collects data on industrial disputation in Australia, consistent with international conventions. The data are published on a monthly basis and are regularly reported in the press. In line with these conventions, the ABS measures time lost due to industrial disputation in those disputes in which ten or more working days are lost. The data are provided on an industry basis and record information about the causes of disputes, including whether the dispute is over wages, conditions of employment, trade unionism, managerial policy or other issues. The statistics of industrial disputes are compiled mainly from data obtained from employers (both private and public sector), from trade unions and from reports of government authorities. Particulars of some stoppages, for example State or Australia wide general strikes, may have been estimated and the statistics therefore should be regarded as giving only a broad measure of the extent of industrial disputes. (2) It is undoubtedly the case that some industrial disputes can adversely affect a wide cross section of the community. (3) The Government does not intend to require unions to publish particulars of strike action in the mass media. However, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 contains provisions relating to the notification of 'protected' industrial action, and provisions to minimise the disruptive effects of industrial action on essential services. The Bill provides for a limited right to engage in industrial action or to lock out employees in the negotiation of single-business certified agreements. For industrial action or a lockout to be regarded as protected action (that is, free from certain civil liability) it must take place during a bargaining period, which is initiated by a party given written notice to each other party and to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) about their intention to reach an agreement. Industrial action or a lock out must also meet other conditions to be protected, including that it has been preceded by a genuine attempt to reach agreement, and notice must be given to the relevant party about the proposed industrial action. Where such industrial action is threatening to endanger the life, personal safety or health, or welfare of the population or a part of it, or to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it, the AIRC can terminate the bargaining period. The AIRC is then required to conciliate and, if conciliation is unsuccessful and the AIRC considers it appropriate, to arbitrate. Any industrial action or lockout that persists following the termination of a bargaining period is not protected action, and would be liable to the range of remedies and sanctions available for illegitimate industrial action. There is also a limited right to engage in industrial action or to lock out employees in the negotiation of Australian workplace agreements. Immunity from civil liability in respect of such industrial action or lockouts is conditional upon giving notice to the other party of the intention to take the action. Noise Reduction Project (Question No. 865) Mr Zammit asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 28 October 1996: (1) Has the aircraft noise reduction project involving the insulation of homes in Sydney achieved its objective, particularly in the inner-west area. (2) Has the project fallen short of its target. (3) What progress has been made to acquire residences in the most noise affected areas. (4) What progress has been made to insulate schools and public buildings from noise effects. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. 85% of those who responded to a recent homeowners survey offered positive comments and felt that the attenuation of their home had been successful. Early results indicate that the Project is achieving the expected reductions in noise level consistent with the type of building construction and the treatment applied. Homeowners are being approached in batches. To date over 1506 homeowners have been directly invited to participate. 1153 homeowners have indicated an interest in participating in the scheme; 449 residences have been insulated and a further 522 have commenced the process. (2) No. To date progress has been consistent with milestones agreed with the Department of Transport and Regional Development. The announced program to the north of the airport is for 4400 houses and an initial group of 350 houses is being insulated to the west of the airport pending the announcement of the new airport operating conditions. Response rate and timing of the work is largely determined by the individual homeowner and the response rate has been increasing as people are becoming more confident in the effectiveness of the insulation. (3) Considerable progress has been made towards acquiring the 150 eligible residences: 123 houses have already been acquired; a further 8 owners have agreed on the terms of sale; the owners of another 13 houses have expressed interest in participating and have sought valuation advice; 6 owners have not responded to communications from the Commonwealth. Acquired houses are being demolished. 75 houses and one block of 12 flats have already been demolished and the sites grassed. A further 13 houses are under demolition and the remainder are in preparation for demolition. The acquisition program is voluntary. The offer, which is open to the end of 1996, allows owners to relocate at their convenience. Valuations are based on fair market value as if the house was not in an area seriously affected by aircraft noise and residents are entitled to seek an independent valuation at Commonwealth expense. If an agreement on the price cannot be reached the matter can be referred to the Australian Institute Valuers and Land Economists for an independent valuation review. The average settlement price of the houses is $215,305. (4) The program to insulate schools, childcare centres, healthcare centres and churches is well advanced. Sixteen schools, two T AFE colleges and 20 pre schools have been noise attenuated. Overall, exceptionally good results have been achieved. Insulation of Newington College is to be completed by February 1998. Work has commenced on the first two buildings. Concept designs and technical briefs are complete for all eight nursing homes/aged care facilities. Redundancy Payments (Question No. 883) Mr Allan Morris asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 30 October 1996: What was the total cost of redundancy payments made to former staff of the Newcastle office of his Department following its closure. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The total cost of redundancy payments to former staff of the Newcastle office was $111,753. Telephone Interpreter Service (Question No. 897) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 31 October 1996: Will the Telephone Interpreter Service be reduced as a result of fmancial measures announced in the Budget; if so, in which area. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No financial measures were announced in the Budget which affected the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) directly. However, TIS forms part of the Immigration and Multicultural Affairs portfolio, and derives its of funding from within the Department's Running Costs appropriation, supplemented by revenue received from TIS's fee-paying clients. In 1996-97, funding for Commonwealth departments and agencies has been reduced due to both the on-going application of the 'efficiency dividend' (-1 %), plus an across-the-board cut in Running Costs (-2%). Reductions such as these, impact on the TIS funding base. TIS's three functions-translation, on-site interpreting, and telephone interpreting servicescontinue to be provided as they were pre-Budget.",198
