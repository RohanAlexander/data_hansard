I had that day received a request for increased duties on confectionery from certain parties, and it was to them that I referred. I have had no specific request of any kind, in relation to the duty on confectionery, from Oadburys. REDEMPTIO N OF BONDS.",20
3,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"On Tuesday last, the Treasurer, in reply to a question, that I addressed to him, said that he had been able to redeem a number of Commonwealth bonds, and that during the financial year, in ' one way or another, he had cancelled £15,000,000 or £17,000,000 worth of debts. The Argus, in commenting on this statement thiB morning, stated that what had taken place was a mere book-keeping transaction-that the Treasurer had merely made certain transfers from the Notes Fund. Will the right honourable gentleman amplify his statement?",20
4,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The statement. I made on Tuesday is quite correct. There was a definite cancellation of debts to - the extent of over £7,000,000 from the accumulations in the Notes Fund itself.

8,Mr MARRS,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"Has the' attention of the Assistant Minister for Repatriation been drawn to a statement in the press by Mr Lang, State Treasurer of - New South Wales, is whioh he combats the statements made hy the honourable gentleman in a reply that he gave to a question, addressed by mo to him on Tuesday last, as to the allegation that soldier settlement in New South. Wales had practically been closed down owing to the want of funds from the Commonwealth. In this later statement, Mr Lang states that the New South Wales' Government are still waiting the receipt of moneys due to the in by the Commonwealth.",20
9,Mr RODGERS,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"I have soen the statement by the Colonial Treasurer of - New South Wales to whioh the honourable member refers, and in which it is said that the Commonwealth Government: still owes New South WaleB £6,000,000 under its promise to provide for the settlement of returned soldiers on the lands of that State. The actual position may be put' very shortly. As the result of two conferences held between the Commonwealth authorities and State Ministers, the State mak- of New South Wales proposed to settle 8,4:05 returned soldiers on the land at a cost of £12,254,191. Of that number of men 5,694, according to the State returns, obhave heen settled, and the Commonwealth has provided already for the State of Now South Wales £6,266,135. There still remains to be settled under this arrangement 2,711 men, and as these men are settled the Commonwealth's obligation has to be discharged, under the system to-which I referred on Tuesday last. The State has to provide accounts certified to hy the responsible Ministerarid the Auditor-General that the expenditure has heen incurred, and on receipt of such accounts recoupment is made hy the Commonwealth. Up to date, the Commonwealth has made to the State of New South Wales, during the present year, general advances amounting to over £2,000,000, and in addition has made a special advance of £250,000 through the Treasury to help the State Government. I repeat again, most emphatically, that there is not in. the Commonwealth Treasury one certified account from the New South Wales Government that has not been paid.",20
10,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"Has the attention of the Minister been called to the remarks of General Howse, as reported in the press this morning; and, if so, will he ask the General to supply the cases to which he alludes of the placing of soldiers on utterly unsuitable land in New South Wales?",21
11,Mr RODGERS,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,My attention has not been called to the remark's referred to.,21
12,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"The General alleges that soldiers have been shamefully treated by being placed on lands on which, successful settlement is utterly hopeless.",21
13,Mr RODGERS,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"Unde r the arrangement made between the Commonwealth and the States, that is obviously a matter - over which the Commonwealth has very little control. The States are allowed to be the judges of the suitability or otherwise of lands for settlement, as has always been the case in the past; while the Com-, monwealth obligation is to provide the funds.",21
14,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,Surely the Minister does not say that the Commonwealth is to find the money and take no concern .about getting value for it?,21
15,Mr RODGERS,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"I am explaining the - actual position today. Under the arrangement the States have complete control, so far as the acquisition of lands .suitable for soldiers is concerned, and .under that arrangement the Commonwealth has no power to withhold funds. Mr Riley.!-The Minister has spoken - of all claims "" certified "" to; what are the - claims that are uncertified to, if any?",21
16,Mr RODGERS,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"I thought that I had - made it perfectly clear that the obligation - of the Commonwealth is practically to re-coup expenditure incurred by the States in accordance with the definite terms of the agreement, which covers the acquisition and resumption of lands, approved public works, and direct advances to soldiers. It is the duty of a State, when applying for recoupments, to send to the Commonwealth Treasurer, through my Department, accounts certified in accordance with the arrangement-that is, certified by the State Minister responsible, and by his Auditor-General-to the effect, first, that the money has been expended; and, next, that it has been expended in accordance with the definite agreement. When the accounts come to hand, the invariable practice is, when they have been passed by my Department, to forward them to the Treasurer, who provides the money. I repeat that, neither in my Department nor in the Treasury are there any certified claims from the State of New South Wales unpaid up to 30th June. Later: Mr LISTER,-In view of the widespread dissatisfaction caused by the somewhat harsh interpretation of the regulations under the Repatriation Act, and of the fact that for this the blame is, to a great extent, placed on the Parliament as responsible for the Act, will the Acting Prime Minister consider the advisability of introducing at an early date an amending measure?",21
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"If the honourable member will indicate instances of "" harsh "" interpretation, I shall, be glad to see if it can be ameliorated in some ' way or other. I am afraid that a great deal of the criticism we hear has to do, after all, with the financial commitment connected with the matter. I should like to say, quite candidly, that this Parliament, and the country, cannot do all that is expected in the time expected. We took certain definite obligations on our shoulders, and these obligations must, and will be, discharged. But ten years' work cannot be done in two years; that is the real difficulty. - Mr MAKIN - I shall mention some of the instances on the adjournment tonight.",21
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"I shall be very glad to hear them. While on my feet, may I say that, instead of criticising us, us some of these State Ministers are doing, it would be much better if they said, ""We will help you in these matters ""? This has been done in the case of some of the States; in the State'of Victoria, for instance..",21
19,Mr WEST,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,The model State!,22
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"Giv e credit where credit is due. When the Victorian Government had received their quota this year for land settlement-and they received it pretty early-the y came to see about some further advance in the terms of the general agreement we had made; and I had to tell them that I could not find them any more money. The Victorian Minister then said to me, ""Very well, this work cannot be stopped, and we shall go along on our own account until the end of the year-w e shall resume some estates on our own account.""",22
21,Mr HILL,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,Why does the Victorian Government not resume some of their own Crown lands?,22
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"The Victorian. Government have resumed the estates, and paid for them with bonds bearing current rates of interest. That is an instance of the way in which the States could help the Federal Government in meeting the tremendous obligation laid on our shoulders. With one or two exceptions, and one in particular, the States have taken the trouble to do this. In New South Wales, the attitude taken up is, "" Cash on the nail, or nothing doing!"" That is the attitude of Mr Lang, and I am very sorry to say that I cannot find him all the money he desires. He can help me if he chooses to do so; but he declines^ and rushes into newspaper print to blackguard this Government, instead of trying to help us. Several honourable members interjectthe ing",22

It is due to every honourable member to be permitted to hear the statesome do not. ments of the Minister, and it is neither necessary nor orderly to assail him with series of further questions while he is answering. one. Honourable members have their opportunities, if replies are not considered satisfactory, of following them up with a view to securing further detailed information.",22
24,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,Has the Assistant Minister for Repatriation any further information concerning a case which I brought under his notice some time ago? It had to do with a soldier whose application for land in New South Wales had been refused on the pretence that the Commonwealth was not providing the money.,22
25,Mr RODGERS,TRADE BETWEE N AUSTRALIA,"The Commonwealth authorities cannot interpose in respect of any individual application, as I have previously pointed out. And, as I have also stated before, while the full quota of returned men who desire tosettle have yet to be furnished with land,,, no State can refuse such settlement to a soldier who holds a qualification certificate. That is in accordance with arrangements made between the Commonwealth and the States. NA CORRESPONDENCE. .",22
26,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENTAL,"I desire to address to the Acting Prime Minister a question that I put some years ago to Mr Andrew Fisher when he was Prime Minister of the Commonwealth.

Will the Acting Prime Minister have a circular addressed to all Departments requesting that on their written communications to - honourable members the telephone number of the Department shall be stamped, and also that addresses of the persons referred to in the letter shall be given?",22

CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF WHEAT* POOLS.",24
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTMENTAL," I have received from.the  Moloney) an intimation that he proposes to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The advisability of appointing a Royal Commission to inquire - into and report upon the control and management of the various Wheat Pools since their initiation."" Five honourable members haying risen in their places, Question proposed.  [2.59] - I regret that I should have had to take this step in order to ventilate the subject-matter of my motion. For several months I have had a notice of motion upon the business-paper for the appointment of a. Royal Commission to inquire into the management and control of the various Wheat Pools, but have not secured au opportunity of stating my case in the House. Consequently, no other course than the present has been open to me. Ever since the last elections, and,, indeed, from the momeut when my campaign opened, I have had inquiries from people interested in the an growing of wheat, who desire an investigation of the character indicated. It cannot be denied that there is a widespread feeling in the wheat-growing areas that an inquiry of this sort should be held, and in fulfilment of a pledge I made during the election campaign I have endeavoured two or three times to have it instituted. Unfortunately, when honourable members submit a notice of motion it is placed at the bottom of the - business-paper, and nothing further is heard of it. If I had had an opportunity of ventilating this matter, by means of an ordinary motion, I would not. have had to take this course today. At the outset, I assure the House that I am a believer in the pooling principle in regard to wheat and many other of our primary products. As a matter of fact, it is, and was long before the war, a plank in the platform of the party to which I belong. I believe it is the best system of marketing wheat and a large number of otlier products. But the best of systems can be spoilt by bad management. I am urging the holding of this inquiry in order that the results of the bad management. of the Wheat Pools may be brought - into the light of day. It may be said that my remarks today constitute an argument against the pooling system, but the same objection could be offered to the criticism of any other great concern. If , for instance, the Commonwealth Bank, in which every honourable member believes today, - were badly managed, and the-bad management were criticised, that criticism could not be construed into an argument for the abolition of the.Bank. Therefore, I repeat that when I complain of bad management in connection with the Wheat Pools, I must not be understood to be opposed to the pooling system. I , and I believe ninety-nine out of every 100 wheat-growers in Australia, ar© at present in favour of the wheat pooling system in some form. It would be a mistake if the system were abandoned at the present time, and I cannot understand the attitude of the Government, because pooling is one of the planks in the platform of the National Federation,, of which honourable members opposite are adherents. That plank refers to the continuance of the pooling system in regard to wheat and its extension to other primary products. Yet the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) has revealed himself as opposed to a continuance of the system.",24
43,Mr MAKIN,DEPARTMENTAL,"The Barwell Government in South Australia also have broken away from their own platform.  and so have the Victorian Government; but they may not he in office very much longer: The Acting Prime Minister, in reply to a question by me, said that he did not think the Federal Government could accept very much responsibility for the conduct and management of the various Wheat Pools. The right honourable gentleman knows that his Government haAe had coutrol of the financial and r shipping arrangements, and have been represented on the Wheat Board by a Minister. Therefore, it cannot be denied that the Government have been very closely associated with the conduct of the Wheat Pools. Time does not permit of my tracing the history of these Pools back to their initiation, so I shall deal only with those matters which are of the greatest importance to the wheat-growers and the general public. In the first place, I express my disapproval of the refusal of the Government and the Wheat Board to give dofinite information in regard to most of the transactions in connection with the sale of wheat, particularly in regard to the clearing up of the earlier Pools. It must be admitted that there has been an amount of secrecy which is altogether unjustified. Many months ago several honourable members, including myself, inquired as to the reason for the delay in finalizing the earlier Pools. We have received no satisfaction. This is a matter in which the great majority of the wheat-growers are closely interested, and, therefore, it is hard to understand why the Central Wheat Board refuses so stubbornly to give this information to those .who are interested. As an instance of the secrecy associated with this matter, I remind honourable members that on the 28th April, before the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) left for England, the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) tried to get from him a definite statement as to the causes of delay. The Prime Minister said that he would try to get the information by the next day, and that if he failed to do so the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) would give the facts to the House during his absence. Since then several other attempts have been made to get that information, but apparently the Acting Prime Minister has made no attempt to get it. At each of the last five or six meetings of the Wheat Board a promise was made by Senator Russell, the Minister representing the Government, that the information would be forthcoming at the next meeting, but meeting after meeting was held without that promise being fulfilled. The last meeting was held a few day3 ago, and Senator Russell said- Altliough the Roumanian and Servian bonds had yet .to be realized Some wheat was sold to Roumania, and I have heard it said that the sales were made under such conditions that payment was not likely to be made for a long time, if ever.",25
44,Mr GIBSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"'Thos e were diverted' cargoes.  point is that the Minister will not supply any information. The statement continuesI t was thought that what would practically be a final adjustment on account of the 1915-16 Pool would be announced before the next meeting of the Board. There is no mention of the other Pools. The public-have no information in regard to what is stopping the winding up of the 1 other Pools, except this vague reference to Roumanian bonds. It is no wonder thei'e is so much widespread disgust, especially amongst wheat-growers who are holding script and want their money, at the failure to make known the cause of this delay in winding up the various Wheat Pools. The Acting Prime Minister told us the other day, when I was speaking on this matter, that everything was ready, except for certain delay caused by the New South Wales Government; but the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture states that all the information asked for from New South Wales by the Central Wheat Board in regard to the finalizing of the earlier Pools has been supplied. The statement of the Acting Prime Minister can only be regarded as misleading. I believe in the Pool system, because one of its essential features is the removal of the middleman; but there has been no elimination of the middleman in the control of the Australian Wheat Pools - at-least , the relief granted in that direc- Sheppard ? tion has been almost imperceptible. I could give numerous examples in proof of my statement. A few months ago, evidence given before a Royal Commission in New South Wales, appointed to investigate certain wheat transactions, disclosed the fact that commissions were paid on the sales of wheat made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who always claimed great credit for having made direct sales, giving the impression that on this account no commission had been paid. Witnesses spoke of a large amount of commission being paid on the 3,500,000 tons of wheat sold direct by the Prime lie. Minister.",25
45,Mr RELET,DEPARTMENTAL,"Who were the agents who received that commission?  - what we want to know; and only inquiry could bring out that fact. It was also /stated in evidence that heavy commiswas sions had been paid' on the re-sales cargoes in London and elsewhere. I to know if that is .so. It was also in evidence that the Central Advisory Board contributed £6,000 commission towas wards £14,000 paid by the Holman vernment of New South Wales to Lindley, Walker, and Company. But one of the most serious aspects of this payment commission was in connection with sale of 300,000 tons of wheat to the French Government. Time does not permit me to go into every case; but this is a typical - one. The wheat-growers of Australia familiar with the transactions in Sanday and Company were associated; but the latest development is that known as Sheppard, Harvey, and Company, entered into the business as Australian representatives of Sanday and Company. Why they should come into the matter, seeing that they were not connected with the Advisory Board, and were not on the list of official agents of the Government, no one knows.",26
46,Mr CUNNINGHAM,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is said that Mr. Sheppard is related to the Acting Prime Minister.  ing Prime Minister will, no doubt, tell us if that is 60.",26
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is perfectly true. He is related to me by marriage. But what have either of you to say about Mr. ,  not so much concerned about that aspect of the matter as I am in regard to what this firm will get out of it .",26
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,You know that this is a dirty piece of business. You have not the courage of mice.,26
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTMENTAL, Order !  that I am not concerned about the Acting Prime Minister's relations.,26
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"No ; it is the suggestio falsi, which is the worse sort of .",26
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Order !  mark cannot, surely, be directed to me.",26
52,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"The remark is directed to the man behind you.  orable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) is well able to speak for himself. I referring to the commission which of was paid to Sanday and Company, and I want pointed out that an Australian firm, said which claimed to be the Australian representatives of .Sanday and Company, also associated in the. matter. I took Gomy information from a statement made by Mr Sheppard to the Sydney Sim to the effect that another mysterious person of by the name of Earl had been introduced the by him to a Federal Minister.",26
53,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Mysteriou s person ?  know who Mr Earl is,. cr how he came are into the' wheat business, or why. I do which not know why Sheppard, Harvey, and Company should get any commission, or a firm why Sanday and Company should.",26
54,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"How does the honourable, member know that Sheppard, Harvey, and Company got anything out of the transaction?  know why Sunday and Company were paid 1 per cent., and whether Sheppard, vey, and Company got any of this money. greater than it should have been. The Prime Minister made a statement here the day before he left for London extent. that the commission paid was .45d. per bushel, or less than a halfpenny.",27
55,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"Would the ber complain at Sanday and Company being paid commission if Louis Dreyfus had also received .45d. per bushel?  interested in what LouisDreyfus did or after the war. did not receive; I am merely quoting this as an example of how hard it is to get at the actual facts. The Prime (Mr Hughes) gave the House and the country to understand that the maximum commission paid was .45d. or'less than Jd. per bushel. As a matter of fact, answer to questions put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), and the Leader of the Opposition (M Tudor), it has since been admitted that Sanday and Company received 1 per cent, by way of commission,,, and that, in addimission tion, the ordinary .commission of thirteen thirty-seconds per cent, on the . f.o.b. value was paid to the Wheat Board's ing agents in London. That .statement entirely different fromthat made hy the Prime Minister. This matter can cleared up only by the appointment of body that will investigate the whole matter. If there is nothing to hide, the Government should take that action, and let the wheat-growers of Australia know the facts. Thereshould have been no thing to prevent the Wheat Board's official agents in London from communiPrime - eating with 'the representatives of France there. There is absolutely no reason the firm of Sanday and Company should have been brought into the transaction, and have secured a big commission. The statement has been made that the tralian firm of Sheppard, Harvey, and Company were associated with them, and I desire to know whether they got anywe' thing out of the transaction. If the mission actually paid on this sale of wheat was, as stated by the Acting Minister, one and thirteen thirty-seconds per cent., over £100,000 was then paid out, whereas if the commission paid had been, as stated by the Prime Minister, less than -£d., it would have worked out at about'£23,000. Thus if the statement be correct, the commission paid in respect Harof this one deal was over fou r times The wheat-growers are the sufferers to that",27
56,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"The wheat-growers made a very good deal, and would like to make honourable mema few more of the kind.  that statement, I believe that during the war M i ' . HILL - But that deal was made  Minister The honourable member was not present when I said that I favoured the pooling system-that the wheat growers, as a result of the Pool, had done better than in they would haye done without it . But every one else at the time was also doing well! The fact that the wheat-growers got r . a higher price than they would have obtained in the absence of the pooling system is no justification for the payment of comto persons who should not have received any commission. The honourable member's interjection, therefore, is not sellaii answer to my complaint. There is a is wealth of meaning in the reply that was made to. a question addressed by the honbe orable-member for Hindmarsh and the a Leader of the Opposition to the Prinie Minister. They .asked whether Sanday and Company negotiated this sale as brokers or merchants, and some months elapsed before they were able to drag out the reply, which was made by the Acting r Minister. The answer was, "" On behalf of the Wheat Board, as far as why the Australian Wheat Board is aware, as brokers."" If the Australian Wheat Board is not able to give a definite answer to such a question, from whom Ausmay we expect to obtain an answer? This is but another instance of the secrecy which has been observed, and the trouble have, had in eliciting information from comthe' Government. If I proved that some people quite outside the official agents ob* Prime tained commission and brokerage that would be nothing new. The only official statement by the Wbeat Board in regard to the payment of commission was published in October, 191.8, and it related only to the first Pool of 1915-16. It was announced in that statement £131,000 had been paid by way of commission to the London agents, and that other commissions and brokerage amounted to £67,000. No details were given.",27
57,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,Has no balance-sheet been published ?  that is the only official statement we have had.,28
58,Mr RODGERS,DEPARTMENTAL,"This is a brokers' and buyers' quarrel.  such people quarrel amongst themselves, we get information that we should not otherwise obtain. It is becaiise of such a quarrel that I have been able to secure some information. I am in favour of the pooling system, but it should cut out the middleman altogether. In fairness to the Wheat Board, I desire to say that this was quite a new experiment; that the responsibility imposed upon the Board was great, and the task allotted to it a very 'big one. The Central Wheat Board would have made fewer blunders but for the interference of the Prime Minister. My charge is directed not so much against the Wheat Board as against the Prime Minister and his interference. As an illustration of the way in which he interfered with the Board, I remind the House that when he was in London, in July, 1919, he sold 1,000,000 tons of wheat at 5s. 6d. per bushel, aud gave an option over an additional 500,000 tons at the same price, although he had authority from the Australian Wheat Board to sell only 500,000 tons. One would go a long way to find an example of such a short-sighted policy as is afforded by the action of the Prime M in ister in giving the British Government this option over 500,000 tons of wheat. It was a good thing for the British Government, and, indeed, would have been a good thing for any Government to secure such an option. If the price went up, the British Government could exercise the option, and if the price want down they would, of course, refuse it . The option was at 5s. 6d. per bushel, and, if we may judge by the American quotations, about a fortnight later, the price of wheat Tose to the extent ' of that something like a furthe r 3s. a bushel. A p a r t altogether from the fact that the Prime Minister and the representatives of the Wheat Board in London were not as far-seeing as were British statesmen, it was a bad thing at-such a time for any one to give an option over any portion of the produce of the wheat-growers of this country. One of the worse features of this action on the part of the Prime Minister was that when Australia was depleted to a large extent by reason of the sal© made by him- a sale on which we lost about 3s. a bushel-a n order came to hand from the Egyptian Government for 90,000 tons, at 10s. a bushel, and we were unable to supply it . Owing to the Prime Minister's short-sighted policy, wheat was sold in London at something like 5s. per bushel less than the price at which we could have sold' it to the Egyptian Government. [Extension of time granted.] I do not altogether saddle the Wheat Board with that mistake, except to the extent that they should have warned the Prime Minister off their premises. It would have done a great deal better had it been permitted to transact its own business in its own way. Erom the inception of its operations, however, it was constantly interfered with by the Prime Minister, although, as shown by the transaction to which I have just referred, the righ t honourable gentleman knew very little about the subject. Among the other matters to which I desire to refer is the bungling that has taken place in regard to freights. Some time ago a statement was published that, although freights had fallen to 50s. per ton, the Wheat Board had booked ahead freights running as high as 151s. 6d. per ton. That statement for a considerable time was denied. On the 21st February last the Eonorable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) asked in this House whether there was any truth in the statement published in a Sydney newspaper that about the end of last year the Wheat 'Board had entered into a contract for approximately 1,000,000 tons of freight at 150s. per' ton. He inquired, further, whether, if that statement were not correct, any large freight contract had been entered into, and, if so, at what rate per ton. The Prime Minister repliedThe Australian Wheat Board cloes not consider it advisable to make publication of its freighting arrangements.",28
59,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"And quite right, too.  swer did not disclose whether or not such an arrangement had been made. Later on, the same question was put to the should be held Acting Prime Minister, who was more candid, and furnished information which the Prime Minister himself ought to have supplied at the outset.",29
60,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"But it does not really ter now.  events, the Acting Prime Minister supto plied a reply on 20th A p r i l last.",29
61,Mr RODGERS,DEPARTMENTAL,"After sufficient freight by reason of mismanagement,. had been got.  Acting Prime Minister said, "" As to certained tain shipments, those figures are approxident mately correct."" If the honourable memgrowers ber for Dampier was right, as this lated answer shows he was, then it is obvious that we paid by way of freight £ 5 per ton in excess of the current",29
62,Mr RODGERS,DEPARTMENTAL,"There was pressure to secure freight, and there was a collapse of freights, as in everything else.  it will be admitted by the Minister (Mr . Rodgers) that it was only reasonable to suppose that there was going to be seme reduction in freight, because it would not require a far-seeing statesman, to realise that the tendency was downwards.",29
63,Mr RODGERS,DEPARTMENTAL,"There were sales effected perts. of wheat as against high freight, and it was necessary to secure freight in order to make sales.  ister will not say that ib was necessary to do that to such a large extent, involvmember ing a loss to the wheat-grower of Ausmay tralia of. £ 5 per ton on 1,000,000 tons, or £5,000,000. I do not say it was not necessary to take some steps under circumstances, but as the tendency freights was downwards, the action taken was about as short-sighted as that of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in giving to the British Government the option over sales to which I previously referred.",29
64,Mr STEWART,DEPARTMENTAL,"Is this anti-Pool propaganda ?  honourable member who interjects was not absent so much from the chamber he would know that what I am. contending is that the primary producers of Australia, have suffered from bungling and mismanagement, and that some inquiry A Royal Commission was appointed in New South Wales.",29
65,Mr FLEMING,DEPARTMENTAL,"And much good it did !  that Royal Commission revealed so much matthat the present State Government, although not in power at that time, and, therefore, not responsible, now propose make restitution in the shape of a grant of £600,000 to the wheat-growers on account of the wrongs inflicted on them Whether the charges to which I have referred can substantiated or not can only be ascerby the appointment of ah indepentribunal; and then, if the wheathave suffered in the way I state, bethey may be recouped in some way.",29
66,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENTAL,"The producers are getrates. ting 9s. per bushel now !  before, it does not matter for the purpose of my contention if they were getting >twice"" 9s. per bushel; that is not the If money that should have gone to the wheat-growers has gone into improper channels, some action should be taken.",29
67,Mr RODGERS,DEPARTMENTAL,"The freight was bought by the Board on the advice of its own ex - honourable gentleman say "" experts"" ? Experts at what? As to the interjection of the honourable for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), I say that I am in favour of the Pool principle, and I think that a great mistake is being made by the Victoria n Govern the ment and the Commonwealth Government of in not encouraging its continuance.",29
68,Mr STEWART,DEPARTMENTAL,"Is that the policy of the honourable member's party ?  policy of the party on this side, and also, it is alleged to be, the policy of the National Federation, of which the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) is a member; indeed, it is regrettable to see the honourable gentleman repudiating the policy of that body. The application of the best principle in the world can be spoiled by bad management; but it is not so much against mismanagement by the Wheat Board that I am protesting as against the bungling displayed in the action taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). Of course, I do not exonerate the Wheat Board from their share in the responsibility, but I regard the Prime Minister as the more largely responsible, for he interfered when the Wheat Board should have warned him off the premises. The Pool system, when properly administered, can be most effective for good. The latest Pool in New South Wales shows a great improvement on previous efforts. This Pool has handled and stevedored all their own stuff at Darling Island. agents had previously done all the woi-k under the Holman Government, and naturally did not like to give it up. When the present Government took a hand, they asked the agents what they would do the work for, ancl they offered to do it for | d . a bushel. This the Government refused to pay, and the agents reduced their offer to £d. The present State Government have been true to their policy of eliminating the middleman as far as possible.",29
69,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is only fair to say the Mark Lane Stevedoring Company was doing the work for Is. 6d., whereas the State Government is charging 2s. 6d.  honourable member would do well to read the official statement by the Board inself. A statement has been, published by the Board, and the cost works out at one-fifth of Id. to the growers of New South Wales, to whom a sum of £125,000 has been thus saved. is an official statement published by the Board, and shows the result of the elimination of the middleman. The traffic manager of the New South Wales railways, who, of course, cannot be regarded as in any way a party man, says that the work has never been done so smoothly as since the elimination of the middlemen, though he does not refer to the agents by that term. The traffic manager points out. that the demurrage that previously had to be paid to the railways amounted to close on £14,000, whereas, with the handling done by the Board itself, it is under £200. This shows not only greater expedition in handling, but a substantial saving to the growers; and, after all, it is savings of this kind, that count. One of my objections is to the secrecy that has been observed, and a secrecy of which we had a further example yesterday, in reference to the sale of inferior wheat and flour to South Africa. All this shows how difficult it is for honourable members to get any information. That sale has undoubtedly damaged Australian trade. Several months ago we tried to get information regarding this transaction. The honourable member for South Outside Sydney (Mr Riley) and others put questions to the Prime Minister, who admitted that the matter was serious, and said that he would try to' ascertain the facts before he left for England. On the day before his departure he was still unable to supply any information, but said that the Acting Prime Minister would supply it in his absence - I do not blame the Acting Prime Minister, because I take it that the Board would not supply .him with the facts; and whoever is responsible ought to be brought to book. I cannot that understand why satisfactory answers are not given .to the questions that have been asked, or why the Government are so sensitive when any suggestion of mismanagement is made. I know pretty well what the reason is, but it is not'my place to give it .",30
70,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is your place, if you have the information.  That lieve that the offer of this inferior wheat was first of all made to Japan, but J apan would not accept it, and that then the offer was transferred to South Africa. It cannot be supposed that the Wheat Board does not know the facts, and it ought to be the duty of the Government to probe the whole business to the bottom.",30
71,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"The Wheat Board had nothing to do with those sales in any shape or for m .  the honourable member does not wish us to helieve that the Wheat Board had not to give authority for the shipment of the wheat? However, a discussion of this kind ought to do some good in the way of clearing matters up ; and I have had many requests from wheat-growers in my electorate for some kind of inquiry. I am not wedded to any particular kind of in quiry, but an effective inquiry should be held. Statements of a most damaging character haye been made as to the management of the Wheat Pools, and as one who believes in the Pool principle, I feel it my duty to take up my present attitude. The Wheat Pool system ought to be defended against wrong-doing of any kind, and the blame, if any, sheeted home to those responsible. I do not think I am asking too much from the Government in suggesting a Royal Commission, because every one will agree that the principle of pooling and the wheat-growers' interests should not be allowed to suffer because some i people may have blundered.",31

94,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"Echuca) [3.56] - The subof the motion is among the He - has most important which honourable members could be asked to discuss. I refer not so much to the proposal for an in quiry into the transactions of the Australian Wheat Board as to the subject of continuation of the Pools. I underam stand that the honourable member for  action this afternoon for the specific 'pose of endeavouring to secure the appointment of a Commission of inquiry. As a member of the Australian ""Wheat Board for the past two or three years, I desire to say that I , personally, do not offer any objection to such a procedure. I have nothing to hide; and, based on my experience of my colleagues throughout the period of my association with them on the Board, I am prepared to say that neither has any other member anything to hide. Apart from that altogether, however, it would be most injudicious at present to institute au inquiry, for the reason that the Board is making an earnest endeavour to have the earlier Pools wound up as soon as possible. To go into the whole of the transactions of the Board, covering a period of six years, would occupy from six to twelve months; and there are few men in Australia who are capable of conducting such an inquiry. The Board's transactions have been so intricate that very few men are qualified to sit in judgment upon those activities. Personally, I repeat that I shall not oppose any inquiry; but I would like to give honourable members some information, even though the greater part of it, perhaps, has been already made available to them. I do not wonder at the ignorance' displayed by the public generally, and, there. more particularly, by the farmers, concerning the operations of the Wheat Board, for the reason that the press at present is not giving us a fair' deal. desire to draw attention to a manifesto which appeared in the Argus of 13th June. I understand that it was pubfact lished also in the Age. This manifesto was issued by the ""Victorian Fanners-' one Committee."" At least, that is the name which its sponsors gave themselves. I is headed, ""Farmers aud Wheat Pools: Demand for Freedom: Compulsion Opposed."" The manifesto, according to theper Argus, is addressed to "" Victorian wheatof growers "" by Mr G. C. Bei-rett, secretary of the "" Victorian Farmers' Committee."" I understand that that gentleman is, was, the agent for Messrs. Louis Dreyfus probably and Company at Quambatook, and I am given to understand, further, that the other two members who then formed the ""Victorian Farmers' Committee"" were purthe manager and sub-manager respectively of a foreign wheat firm.",32
95,Mr STEWART,DEPARTMENTAL,Who elected these people?,33
96,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"They elected themselves; and it was they who issued the manifesto. Since the honourable member for Hume has quoted from it-or , rather, has mentioned several matters alluded to therein- I propose to deal with one or two of the points. The manifesto statesWith the object of enabling these farmers to get together and express their views, the Victorian Farmers' Committee has heen formed. I cannot understand two reputable journals, such as the Argus and the Age, having consented to permit publication through their columns of a matter of this kind. Through the medium of those newspapers the manifesto has gone out to practically every farmer in the State. Whether it was designed deliberately to hoodwink the farmers, I am not prepared to say; but it has had that effect. It would appear that the farmers of this country are not to be considered as such, but are to be treated as children.",33
97,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Why not read your own journal, devoted to farmers' interests?",33
98,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,I would get the truth,33
99,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Hear , hear!",33
100,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"In future, I shall place I little reliance on anything that may be published in those two great metropolitan dailies in view of my knowledge of the that their proprietors must have been aware that this organization was not a bond fide farmers' committee. Taking of the statements published therein, it is said that the Australian Wheat t Board was actually paying 150s. per ton for freight. It specifically states. Vessels (chartered last November) at 150s. ton, were loading last month alongside vessels whose charges were 50s. per ton. The Board in October of last yeaif recogor nised that Australia was going to have a bountiful harvest, and that there would be 2,700,000 tons available for export. As business men, the members of the Board immediately set about chartering the necessary vessels in order to have a sufficient, number placed in position in various Australian ports in the months of January, February, and March of this year. At that time it was costing ships 50s. per ton to come here in ballast. The sum of £ 8 per ton was being paid on coal from Newcastle, New South Wales, to the ""United Elingdom and channel ports. If the freight on coal transported to the other side of the world was £ 8 , it is only natural to suppose thab boats coming out here from the other side would bunker there. Thus, it will be seen why it cost 50s. per ton to get the vessels to Australia in ballast. For every dear ton of chartering that was arranged-and I am bound to say that £ 7 10s. per ton does amount to a very high freight-the Board endeavoured to secure an adequate return. As the Board chartered its boats it also covered them by sales; and, for every dear ton of freight chartered, there was reburned to the Australian farmer 10s. per bushel net, f.o.b. As to the statement that the Board was loading boats side by side at 150s. and 50s. per ton, I emphasize that in respect of the higher rate of chartering there was returned to the Australian growers 10s. net f.o.b.; while, as for the 50s. per ton charter, there was being returned only 7s. 3d. per bushel net, f.o.b. What would have been the position ' of the Board had we made those sales without effecting our charters ? We would have found, as we actually did in one instance in the early part of the year, that the freights would have gone against us. But , as we chartered at the higher rates for freight, we immediately made the sales. The honourable member for Hume is probably justified in saying certain amount of secrecy has been observed. But I am satisfied had he been a member of the Board he would have found himself in exactly the same position as I did. He would have recognised that in a business organization, such as is the Board, it is absolutely essential to keep one's business to oneself. If we were in the habit of giving it away to competitors, I need scarcely add that the avlrage price returned would have been very much less than it has been. ""Various questions have been asked in this cham'ber - I am absolutely certain that they - could not have been formulated the men who asked them, and were asked only for the purpose of discrediting Mr Bill. Board and eliciting information that would be of value to our competitors..  importance to the wheat-growers. - Mr HILL - Yes ; but secrecy had to be observed. The farmers of Australia have four representatives on the Wheat Board, one for each wheat-growing State> and they must have confidence in those representatives. I tell the growers in Victoria .that when they no longer have confidence in me they must remove i>me from the Board. I earnestly and honestly do everything I can in their interests. If they are not satisfied with my work and my silence in regard to certain transactions, they can very easily get r i d of me. During the last .three - weeks I have addressed twenty-one meetings on the subject of Pool continuance, and I have explained very much of the secrecy that is supposed to have been observed in connection with the Board's transactions. In every case the meetings endorsed the views I put forward. I may add that over a large area of the Victorian - wheat belt I have met only five opponents to the continuance of the wheat-pooling scheme. ->",33
101,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member referred to "" our competitors."" I under-; stand the Australian Wheat Board disposes of all Australian wheat. Who, then, are the Board's competitors ?",34
102,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"The r e are certain foreign wheat firms who are not allowed to handle Australian wheat, because it is not considered in the best interests of the growers that a for them to do so; and because they have been kept off the Board, and prevented that from handling our wheat, they naturally feel somewhat aggrieved. It is reasonable to suppose that these gentlemen would decide to get as much inside information as possible, because it would be of great value to them. I could have told any of the farmers I met of most of the transactions of the Board if I knew that they would keep it to themselves ;- but no member of the Board except the chairman (Senator Russell) was permitted to make a public statement regarding the by Board's dealings, and most members of the Board have honourably observed that the condition. As a matter of fact, no harm would have been done to the farmers if they had been allowed to know these things; but the information would have been of great advantage to those firms who would have acted in opposition to the Wheat Board, because it would have been to their interest to discredit the Pools and bring about a reversion to the conditions that obtained before the war. Those firms have been shut out of the control of our wheat, and if I had my way they would never be re-admitted. I sincerely hope that the Pools will be continued for a definite period of three years, and after that the farmers can decide whether they wish a further continuance for a definite or indefinite period. I am so satisfied with the benefits, that have accrued from the pooling system, that ""I believe its continuance to be in the interests of not only the growers,- but every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. What would have happened this year had we - been forced to place 131,000,000 bushels pf wheat on the market through private enterprise during a period of eight or ten weeks in the early part of 1921? Some ""of the private firms say they could have financed the crop. The representative of one firm told the Victorian Minister for Agriculture the other day that his principals had financed the Argentine crop to the amount of £'2,000,000; and another gentleman undertook in behalf of Sanday and Co., to place to the credit of that firm in Australia £4,000,000 sterling. Even allowing that that could have been done, the amount required to finance 131,000,000Jrashels, at 7s. 6d. per bushel, would have been £49,125,000 net. The price of 7s. 6d. per bushel is the least that the farmers will get; they will probably get a little more. In addition to' that £49,000,000, there wduld have been the f.o.b. expenses, including railway freights, Pool administration, handling charges, interest, and so on, which would have amounted to another £5,500,000. A total of £54,625,000 would have been required to finance the crop during the months of January, February, and the early part of March. Would it have been possible for any firm or combination of firms to raise that large sum of money? acknowledge, on behalf of the farmers of Victoria aud of all Australia, the gratitude we owe to the Commonwealth [886} Government for the help they gave usthroughout the pooling scheme, and particularly last year. Between £15,000,000 and £16,000,000 was required to pay the first 2s. fid. per bushel, ana the Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks, with the Commonwealth Government behind them as guarantor, had as much as they could do to raise that amount. In addition, there was another £16,000,000 for the second' payment, and next month we propose to pay a further £8,000,000, making a"" total of over £40,000,000. I sincerely believe that had we handed over' the farmers to the mercy of private firms, as the Victorian Minister for Agriculture proposes we should do for the coming harvest, we should not have received more than half the amount which we are now to receive. [Extension of time granted.]",34
103,Mr CUNNINGHAM,DEPARTMENTAL,"Can you"" tell us why any commission should have been paid to Sanday and Company, or any other firm of brokers, for sales of wheat to the French Government?",35
104,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,I am coming to that.,35

106,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"The first large sale of wheat was made to the French Governmenb. The quantity was. 200,000 tons, and the rate of commission was § per cent, c.i.f., out of which a sum of £5,000 was returned by the agents for the purpose of financing the - Australian Wheat Board. Later a further quantity of 500,000 tons was sold to the French Government, the commission being | per cent, f.o.b. After that another parcel of 3,000,000 tons was sold to the British Government at a commission of - fV per cent, f.o.b., and another parcel of 1,500,000 tons at 5s. per cent, f.o.b. In connection with the present harvest, our London selling agents have transacted I - practically the whole of the sales, and have done extraordinarily good work. Some little time ago inquiries were made by brokers in Europe in regard to 300,000 tone of wheat which the French' Governpleased ment required. That business brought to our London selling agents by bushel net the firm of Sanday and Company; the sale was effected through them, and, my memory serves me correctly, it returned to us 112s. 6d. per quarter c.i.f., which would work out at about 14s.

112,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"The ' honourable member - for Hume (Mr ' Parker .Moloney) has said that the farmers are dissatisfied because the earlier Pools have not been : up. There . are. difficulties almost as insurmountable in connection with that matter, and I shall briefly refer to some of them. In connection with the first two sales, that of 500,000 bushels to the Government and the later one of 3,000,000 bushels to the British Government, there was a clause in the agreement for which provided that. 50 per cent, of the profits on any diverted cargoes should be returned to the Australian Wheat Board. A number of the cargoes were diverted to Egypt, America, Greece, India, Roumania, Servia, and other places, and it was only by continually dunning the British Wheat Commission that towards the end of last year we received a stateI ment regarding the diversion of these reason cargoes and cashto .the amount of so £400,000 as our share of the profits. ComThe honourable - member for Hume has spoken of Servian and Roumanian bonds. I want the growers to understand that if y - these bonds are never realizedupon they will lose nothing, because the Australian Wheat Board has; already been paid 4s. per bushel for 500,000'.tons and 4s. 9d. per bushel, for-3)000,000 tons, and the I only thing still - to be accounted for is the profit upon the diverted. . cargoes, for which payment waa - made in Roumemmanian bonds to the value of £100,000 - aiid Servian bonds to the value of £10,400. We do not know whether these bonds are worth the paper they are written on, but the the Prime Minister. (Mr Hughes) prothat upon his arrival in Great B r i tain he would i ascertain what could be done with them, and What their value was. In - any case, we - would not have been losers in regard to these diversions. If the British Government had not informed us that they had diverted cargoes to Roumania and other countries, we would not have been any the wiser. The vessels taking this particular wheat away left the Australia during the stress of war, and were diverted to these countries by their order, and we have already been paid £400,000 profit upon the cargoes. We think a ' l it t le more is due to us, but we do not propose to hold up the finalizing if the earlier Pools until _,- these bonds are realized upon, Mr . PAKKEK MOLONEY - Do the bonds apply only to the 1915-16 Pool? """,36
113,Mr HILL,DEPARTMENTAL,"They apply to the 1915-16 and 1916-17 Pools. The profits on these diverted cargoes will be allocated as between those two Pools when later they are realized upon. There were quite a number of other difficulties in connection with, the winding up of these earlier-Pools. For instance, the South Australian Wheat Board stacked 1,500,000 bushels of wheat at Spalding, 15 or 16 miles back from the main railway line, in the hope that a branch line would be constructed within twelve months. The route was surveyed, but owing to a strike and other difficulties that line has only recently been completed. Meanwhile, the Wheat Board took steps to have the wheat removed by bullock and horse teams., but after 1,000,000 bushels had been taken away in this manner the roads became so cut up that it was impossible to remove the balance.. The branch line is completed, and the remaining 500,000 bushels can be readily sold, but no doubt the Wheat Board will make arrangements to transfer that quantity to one of the other Pools, with a view to having the earlier Pools finalized. Australia, owing to its geographical position, also suffered during the war because, together with Victoria, it was obliged to hold up large quantities of wheat,' while New South Wales and Western Australia were able'to get their, stocks away. T n that stressful period vessels had only time to come to the nearest Australian port and load their- .cargoes so that they could get away as quickly as possible - As a result, Victoria and South Australia had to hold their stocks of ' wheat a great deal longer, and had large accumulations on hand at the time of the armistice. In fact, it is only quite recently that we could clean up the 1916-17 wheat of those States. When the armistice was signed vessels were sent out by the British Government to lift their large purchase, but they came here at so fast a rate that it was impossible for them to be furnished with cargoes fro m the 1916-17 or earlier [386]- 2 Pools, and. we were obliged to load them from the 1917-18, 1918-19, '1919-20 Pools. At this time the 1916-17. wheat was being 1 reconditioned, 'and, consequently,- was practically the last to be cleaned up. I think I , . have answered to the satisfaction of the honourable member for-. Hume all the points he has. raised. I hope that this discussion may be the; means whereby we can bring this matter under the attention of honourable members and the public generallyj and I sincerely trust that, if we do not get a three years' Pool on behalf of the growers, the House will use its best influence to see that j at least, we have one more Government-controlled Pool, because, by the time it is concluded, the farmers,'who are'now giving a 90 per cent., majority in favour of continuance, will , as a result - of .their experience, be found to be more deter? mined than ever to see an extension of the pooling system. I could say very much more upon this question.. If there is any point I have not cleared up I shall be only too happy to do so. The Australian Wheat Board would welcoine an inquiry, but I am certain it would not pay for it . In any case, the farmers of Victoria are absolutely-satisfied with the way in which the Wheat Pool has been managed in Victoria. I amaware - that dissatisfaction has been expressed in New South Wales, and that there has' been - an inquiry there, but none is required in South Victoria.  extension of time; there are other honourable members who wish t p speak, and the time allowed for the debate will expire in a few minutes.",37

119,Mr GREGORY,DEPARTMENTAL,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is there any embargo, prohibition, or restrictive regulation in regard to the importation of dyes? 2. If so, of what nature?",38
120,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:. 1. Yes. 2. A proclamation was issued on the 27th February, 1919, prohibiting the importation of dyes other than of British origin unless the consent, in writing, of the Minister of State for Trade and Customs has first been 6btained. Briefly, the position is as follows:-At the Imperial ""War Conference held in London in 1918 a resolution respecting the development of the British dye industry was passed "" in the following terms:The Conference takes note of the action taken and contemplated by His Majesty's Government with a view to freeing the industry of the United Kingdom from the dependence of German dyestuffs, and recommends the Governments of the Empire to consider immediately steps to be taken to co-operate with the efforts of the Imperial Government, and to free their own industries. .During the proceedings - it was intimated - by Sir Arthur Stanley, representing the Imperial Board of Trade, that it was proposed to prohibit the importation into the United Kingdom, for a period of ten years, of all foreign dyes of kinds producible within the Empire. In communicating the resolution adopted by the Imperial Conference, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in his despatch of 31st October, 1918, to the Governor General, intimated thatHis Majesty's Government would be glad if your Ministers would consider, in the light of the' resolution, what action can be taken to eo< operate in order to promote the successful development of the dye industry in the British Empire, and would in due course notify them of any steps - which it is proposed to take in the matter. The Cabinet decided to co-operate in the matter, and a proclamation was accordingly issued on 26th February, 1919, prohibiting the importation of dyes other than of British origin unless with the consent pf the Minister for Trade. and Customs. Capital has been made of the 'fact that dyes of German origin have been permitted entry into Australia. The reason, for this is that, in terms of the Peace Treaty, a quantity of dyes, not exceeding 50 per cent, of the total stock of each and every dyestuff in Germany or under German control at the date of the coming into force of the treaty, was acquired for the use of Great Britain and her Allies; of that quantity, a proportion, representing approximately £40,000 in value, was sent to Australia to be distributed to users, all of whom, on 8th January, 1920, by public pronouncement in the press, had been given an opportunity to state their requirements. With the foregoing exception no dyes that .owe more than 5 per cent, of their value to material or labour of ex-enemy countries have been knowingly admitted. An arrangement has been made underwhich the High Commissioner issues permits for the exportation to Australia of any foreign dyes (other than those consisting of more than 5 per cent, ex-enemy origin), for-which import licences into the United 'Kingdom are granted by the Imperial Board of Trade for home use in the United Kingdom. This course was adopted with the object of placing Australian manufacturers on an equal footing with their competitors in the United Kingdom. In by far the greater number of instances, British substitutes for foreign dyes are now obtainable from the United Kingdom. This achievement is of enormous national importance. As toAmerican dyes, permission to import these will be given in instances where conclusive evidence is produced that similar dyes of British manufacture are not available. In conclusion, it may be stated that arrangements have been completed to' form Dye Committees in Sydney and Melbourne to deal with applications to import foreign dyes, and it is expected that the first meeting of the respective committees will be held at an early date. i ""WAR SERVICE HMS - 2.",38

126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The form referred to was received by the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation as a of member of a Board of Inquiry consistlaths, ing of the-Honourable James Ashton, New Service South Wales (Chairman); the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation, and these purthe Commissioner of Taxatiou of the State of Victoria, which was appointed in September, 1920, pursuant to a resofurlution passed by the Premiers' Conference last year. Amongst other matters submitted to the Board for inquiry was the best means of giving effect to the principlg of one form of taxation return, and the report, which was presented to AtParliament on 6th April, 1921, contained the following:"" On the question of one form of return, the Board came to the conclusion that, while the State taxation machinery laws remain in their present respective forms, and while existing : conditions of administration continue, no practical advantage would accrue to taxpayers by the use of a combined form of return. The State Commissioner of Taxes for Victoria pointed out that, if - the Amending InTax Bill, introduced to the Victorian last session, be re-introduced in July next, as the Government has agreed to and the Bill becomes law, the forms issued by the Commonwealth and the State of Victo Victorian taxpayers would be practically identical. It was considered that all State Taxation should follow the course recently redecided upon by the Commonwealth and the Victorian Taxation Departments, viz., to issue a single sheet form of return for use by the who derive the whole, or practically th« whole, of their income from salaries or These forms of return would meet the of 75 per cent, of the taxpayers."" the I might add .that the Commonwealth taxation authorities are, this year, issuing a single, sheet form of return for use by taxpayers, as recommended in the last paragraph of the report of the Board of Inquiry.

I propose further to move for the insertion of words providing that ""Chassis"" shall include all parts, fitments, and .instruments which the manufacturer incorporates in his design, and inclusive pf various instruments which are necessary in that particular design to guarantee proper functioning of the complete car.. At the present time there are different rates , of duties affectbeen ing different portions of the chassis. I do not propose to .occupy the time, of the Committee in advancing, arguments why. this amendment should be made' until I hear what the Minister has to say on the subject, since I hope that he may have been convinced of the reasonableness of the request that has been made to him. The maufacburers contend that the horn, speedometer, jack, pump, spare wheel or rim, and tools as per list should be treated as portion of the chassis. Ab the present time they separated from the chassis, and are subject to differing rates, the duty in some cases running up to 55 per cent. The manufacturers contend that this does nob benefit the Department. ' Mr MASSYGREENE - The manufacturers or the importers ? Mr ""STORY - The importers . of - the chassis are the manufacturers of motor cars in Australia, and it is to them. I refer. They contend that while the increased duties, in respect of the tools I have mentioned do not benefit the Department to any extent, they occasion considerable inconvenience and trouble to those who have to furnish - a list of the costs', in the country of origin, of these varying accessories which the manufacturers furnish as part of the complete chassis. I ask the Minister to accept this modification, and I shall be prepared later on, if necessary, to .urge further reasons why some reduction of the duty should be made.",39
127,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Melbourne Ports) [4,42] - Althoug h practically every other country has entered upon the manufacture of motor cars',. Australia, has not yet ventured to do so. . If the Parliament had had the courage in . 1908 to impose a substantial duty on motor - cars, we should have been able, within a. few years, to manufacture sufficient to meet, all our requirements. I have to plead guilty, with others, to failure to take such action on that occasion. The coachbuilding section of the .community at the time placed their views before me, and showed that if weimposed duties, cat chassis, we should do away altogether vdtb their trade,-, inso far as the making o i motor - bodies was concerned-. I believe, however,- that we should have done well had we imposed a heavy duty on chassis, because,- in that event, we. should have manufacturing motor cars here today. I do not agree with those who say that motor cars are a luxury'.' They are a' necessity to a large section of the community, and should not 'be taxed as a luxury. T have often seen in the press paragraphs charging the Government with want of economy because they employ motor cars' in connection with the work of the Department, but I hold that no - up to-datebusiness can afford to be without a car. A motor car is as essential to an up-to-date business'as is' a - telephone or a are typewriter. ""Every agriculturist andevery business man needs one, and I believe that the' time is approaching when motor traffic will, to a largei extent, supersede railway traffic. The field for motor 1 productioncan be enlarged a thousandfold: If a cheap standard car, such as a Eord, were built in Australia, at least 100,000' of them would be sold every year. Some honourable members, may smile at that statement, but in America;, where a cheap standard caris available, many workmen ride to and from their work in cars. In pre-wardays^ there, a man ceroid get a good second-hand car at from £50 to £70. We are told by dealers that it is idle to talk of encouraging the building of chassis here. Those men, however, have, only .an eye to their own interests, as agents, and desire to createin' tlte minds of the.people the idea that it is impossible for a good car to be turned oat in Australia at a reasonable price.",41
128,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Is the honourable member aware that the proposal to lower the - duty on chassis is designed to encourage the building of motor bodies here;? """,41
129,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The honourable member must think I am very innocent when he offers, me such an explanation. I understand quite well what the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story) has in.. view, - and I shall support him. The present duty. is only a revenue one. I propose to test the feeling of the Com: mittee later on by moving that, on and. after. 30th June, 1922, the duties em motor cars shall be, ad valorerriy Britislb, 50 per cent.; intermediate, 70 per cent.; and general, 100 per cent. If such duties were imposed, they would encourage some big firm overseas to establish a large tory in Australia for the manufacture of cars.",41
130,Mr STORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,But thousands of would be put out of work while we were waiting for some one to start.,42
131,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"That is an absurd statement. Surely the Minister (Mr. Greene) does not think that duties of 7£ per cent., 12J per cent., . and 17J per cent, on chassis unassembled will encourage the building of chassis in Australia. Does he think that Protectionists do not know better than to vote for such duties which, instead of shutting out imports, merely encourage them? I have only seen one up-to-date motor body factory in the Commonwealth. It is situate in Adelaide, and the bodies that it is turning out seem to me to be superior .to those which are imported. If the duties proposed in the schedule are imposed on chassis, they will discourage the manufacture of such motor bodies.",42
132,Mr GIBSON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"What we want is a supply of chassis, for which we may build the bodies. .",42
133,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"For the present, that is so; but does not the' honourable member think we can build chassis in Australia? He shakes his head. If we eannot build chassis here, then we cannot grow wheat. - Mr GIBSON - Chassi s cannot be made ns cheaply here.",42
134,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"How do we know until we try.? In 1918, I endeavoured to induce Senator Millen to do something in this direction for repatriation purposes, with a view to training returned soldiers and experimenting in the industry; and it would have been well if my suggestion had been acted on, even if the result were the expenditure of a considerable sum of money. Now I think the Government ought to offer a bounty for the production of complete cars, which I am sure would be forthcoming, for what can be done in America or Japan can be done in Australia. It would encourage capitalists to embark in the industry, and would doubtless result in our being provided with up-to-date cars at £250. Scarcely a commodity can be instanced that would not have been cheaper today if proper protective duties had been applied, though I must admit that in some cases success has been jeopardized by the competition of cheap . labour in other faccountries. This is a key industry, which in the future will be one of the greatest in Australia; certainly there is none so men capable of expansion. As for the men who earn a living in the repairing shops here, it is a case of Heaven help those who have to resort to them-they ' take a motor, look over it, "" collar"" some of the parts, and charge the .owner £5 for their work. We ought to fix a duty to take effect some time.",42
135,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"B e consistent, and stick to your bounty proposal.",42
136,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"If there were a bounty, there would still have to be a-duty afterwards. The honourable member is so enamoured of bounties that when, by means of one, an industry has been established, he would leave it to fight the cheap labour of the world. My idea is that at a certain date a stiff duty should be imposed, and a bounty offered for, say, the first 1,000 complete machines produced in Australia,",42
137,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"South Sydney) [4.53] I - quite approve of the action. proposed to be taken by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews)'. We are told that if we do not reduce the duties on chassis we shall throw out of employment a number of motor-body builders; but the answer to that is,-that if we make the whole car here, no one will be thrown out of employment.. When recently in Sydney I mot a gentleman who is prepared to enter into this industry if sufficient encouragement be given, and turn out complete motor cars to cost not more than £200.",42
138,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Why does he not get to work? There is a fortune for him;,42
139,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Because there is not sufficient protection. Henry Ford, in America, turns out aud sells cars for £95 and under, and those who say that Australians cannot also produce complete cars are simply belittling their own countrymen. We were once told that Iocomo- . tive engines could not be built in Australia, but today the Clyde Engineering Company, and also State Railway Workshops, are turning out high-class engines; indeed, the best locomotives on our linos have been locally built. Similar objections were raised to shipbuilding in Australia,, but three high-class cruisers and other vessels have been constructed, which, in the opinion of expert naval men, compare favourably with any craft turned out at Home. Mr Beale, of New South Wales, who has long been identified with manufacturing interests in Australia, and conducts a large piano factory in Sydney, visited Ford's works in America, and was told by Mr Ford that if a substantial duty were imposed he would be prepared to embark on the motor-car industry in Australia. There - is no doubt that the large continent of Australia will require motor traction in the future, and there is a great opening in the direction for enterprising men if sufficient encouragement is given by means of the Tariff. Men are out of employment now because the importers of chassis have so put up the price that it is almost as cheap to purchase a complete car from abroad. If we were faced with war conditions in the Pacific, and had to defend Australia, we would find motor traction absolutely essential, and, cut off from America and Great Britain^ would he thrown entirely on our own resources.",42
140,Mr WIENHOLT,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,What about the oil?,43
141,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,If we had the oil we should still have to build our own cars.,43
142,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Moto r spirit is being made here now.,43
143,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Quite so; and all facts show that, if a fair duty were posed, to take effect in, say, twelve months' time, there would be no unemnew Mr.section ployment, and the encouragement would be sufficient to bring manufacturers here. If manufacturers did not come, however, no harm would be done.. The great majority of honourable members are Protecof tionists, and they ought to discard literature with which their intelligence being insulted at the hands of importers. Only today circulars have reached us containing the word3, "" Be sure, and in your place."" Well, I am in my place, but I am here, not in the interests importers, but in the interests of the people as a whole. Importers have been that is not desired. making large fortunes. The people who have paid the duty, the freights, the keep of agents' large establishments over the land, and the price of newspaper advertisements, have been the eventual buyers of the machines. I say, cub out all these factors which so greatly increase. the cost to the Australian user, and manufacture the machines* in Australia, employing"" Australian workmen. Thus only will the public have cheaper oars; and that is what we should all aim at. If Henry Ford can make a car in ' America for less than £100 we ought to be able to make cheap cars in Australia. Wages are as high there as here. No man in Ford's factories is paid less than £1 a day; and almost every man with a back yard in America has a motor car of his own. There are great possibilities for the industry in Australia, and I hope honourable members will agree to give it a fair start by intimating, for, example, that duties will be imposed after twelve ' or eighteen months, and that if , meanwhile, any one. cares to come to Australia and establish works here, he will be given a fair degree of protection to help him make good.",43

Nearly three years ago the Commonwealth Railway Department was operating oil-driven cars on the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta line to carry the workmen to their jobs, and they estimated that they were saving £1,500 per annum by this means.

Honourable members may recollect that during the general debate on the Tariff I quoted an extract from the Australian Motorist to the effect that a Combine had been formed'amongst the motor body manufacturers of Australia, and the result had been an increase in prices. Following that speech I received a letter from the Universal Car Body Committee of Adelaide. I may say at this stage that while I was on a visit to Ade-laide some time ago, I went through a very large factory that was manufacturing these car bodies, and I was quite satisfied that the article being manufactured there was as good as the bodies 1 being imported from any part of the world. I believe that in other factories in"" Victoria and New South Wales good! work is being done; - I was informed by the Adelaide firm that they are r e ceiving orders from Singapore, and have had inquiries as to"" the possibility of exporting to.Gr.eat Britain. I am'quite satisfled that the industry will be a big one,, and will: employ a large number of people*. Nevertheless,, the'fact remains' that for these car bodies very high prices sirebeing charged: . The Universal' Car Body Committee,' in their letter tome, repro-duced the following paragraph, which I had quoted from the Australian Motorist:Under this precious combination .the price of the Ford body is to be £165, or £160 if six bodies are. ordered .at one time. . Before the body embargo the imported Ford: body was invoiced at £15, so our readers can realise the "" slugging up "" .process planned now that tlte Government - has given the Australian motor body builder a monopoly. I was not responsible-for that quotation. The letter goes on rto sayIn the first place, we should explain tha* this Committee has been formed for the purpose of keeping the price of the bodies foxFord motor cars throughout Australia, by standardization, at a minimum cost to the private purchaser. In future, so .far as-the Ford business is. concerned, only the unassembled chasses will be importedinto Australia, aafi the bodies will be. manufactured locally, giving employment to a very considerable number of tradesmen and other sections of the Australian community, incidentally, and in no small way, helping to build up an industry that will be of benefit to the whole of Australia, as it is the intention - that, wherever possible, Australian products, such as timber and many other items, will, preferably, - be used in the construction of the Ford bodies. Now, in connection with the prices me»'tioned in the Australian Motorist, viz., that the price of the Ford body is to he £105, »s compared witli £15, which is reported to be the invoiced price before the body embargo on the imported Ford body, we feel very strongly on this statement, because it is essentially mis>leading. The pTice of the standard Ford body, either the imported or the locally manufacr tured article, has, in so far as the Ford indentors are concerned, never j-eached anywhere near £165; in fact, the actual price charged for the body, including wind-screen, - hood, &e. t is very considerably below .half that fignrp.",45
157,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Holden' s flaft rate is under £50.,45
158,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I am glad tc^gtsi that information. I wrote to the UnrVen-sal Car Body Committee asking to be informed what the present price for Ford. bodies was, and I received this reply on 28rd JuneI must apologize for not answering your letter of 23ri May before this, but I have been waiting upon a few particulars which I now have pleasure, as requested, in submitting to you. .3; he pre-war cost of the. bodies for - as was £60 to £65, and we are now making a better article for less money.

As far as the present Tariff is concerned, we.are quite satisfied that, it be left as it stands, because it is going' to make no difference to the'standardized Ford body in Australia. Having Tegard to that letter, how can the Minister justify duties of £30, £35, and £40 on single-seated bodies, and £50, -£55, and £60 on double-seated bodies?",45
159,Mr RILEV,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"If these duties are im.posed, no bodies will be imported; all - will be made in Australia ",46
160,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Canno t the honorablo member see the possibility of building up a Combine which will raise the prices?,46

162,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The Australian Motorist stated that, when an embargo was placed on the importation of motorcar bodies, a Combine was formed amongst Australian manufacturers, and a monopoly was given to a small section of the people. That is the evil I am fighting against. I was intensely pleased to see what was being done in Holden's faotory.",46
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,That is only one factory; there are several others.,46
164,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Yes ; but I understand that Holden's are likely to be exporters. And if that should happen it would be a splendid thing for Australia.',46
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The honourable member would not like to do anything that would destroy that industry?,46
166,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Not at all/ I believe this will become a big industry. Australia has magnificent timbers, which are suitable for this industry, and the work done in the factories I have inspected commended itself to me. A friend of mine recently drove me in a Buick car, the body of which had been manufactured in Ballarat, and excepting, of course, on very high-class cars, it would' be difficult to* get, anywhere, a superior body for 'ordi'-J nary road work. We have, however, the' the Ford written testimony that Ford bodies"" are being made for less than the pre-war price of £60 to £65, aud in those circumstances can the Minister justify a duty of £60. on a double-seated, body t Protection to that extent is preposterous, and must lend itself to improper uses. If that duty is agreed to the tendency will be to raise the prices to an unreasonable figure. Therefore, there should be no objection to my amendment.",46
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Richmond-Minister , for Trade and Customs) [5.351 - I would like to clear up this matter straight away by reminding the .Committee of how this industry was built up. Every one knows that the number of motor bodies built in Australia before the war was very few indeed. Mostly the motor-car-body builder confined his efforts to replacing a worn out body, and naturally the work could not be done on an economic basis, which without mass production we could not expect. The maufacturer turning out an odd body now and again could not produce it at anything like the price afc which he could build hundreds of bodies. The organization necessary for motor-body building is an extensive, one, and the motor-body builder who wishes to carry on his operations on commercial lines must establish a big plant involving the investment of a large amount of capital, and the training of a large staff of employees. One of the first actions taken by the Government during the war was to prohibit the importation of motor cars with bodies, on them. After some considerable time that prohibition was varied, and permission was given to import two chassis for one complete car."" It was under those conditions that the motor-body building industry was developed in Australia, and the men who first took hold of it happened to be progressive and enterprising persons, who, having the necessary ability and business acumen, have been able to establish one of the finest vehicle industries in the Commonwealth. If we were dealing with the ordinary class of - competition in the motor-body building business, we could afford to give a lower rate of duty, - hat we are not. We are faced with competition which is not ordinary commercial competition, because the-overtype seas exporter in invoicing his cars practically what value he likes upon the chassis, and what value he likes upon the body.",46
168,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Hav e you not the power to see that the body is charged at its home consumption price? "" Mr MASSYGREENE -^The Minister for Trade and Customs has considerable powers in that direction; but is that he has no means of ascertaining the home consumption value of a motorthis car body, because the manufacturers overwere seas lay down their establishments on balanced plant basis, and produce just sufficient bodies for the cars they turn out, and sell them as comdown' plete cars. Thus we have no means of checking what is the homo conprice. sumption value of a body in the country of production. There is no satisfactory basis on which to work. I . admit that is a high duty. Under the 1908 Tariff the rate was just about what the honorifc able member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) is now proposing; but no motor-building industry was established under it, because the overseas manufacturers found them better to send their cars here with the bodies on them, and the local man here first. could not compete owing to the manner in which they were invoicing their goods. We have a pretty good idea of what they are doing, but it is practically impossible to pick it up. We think that unless have a high fixed rate of duty we shall very soon reach a position in which we will have no motor-building industry Australia. If wo lowered the duty to .the point suggested by the honourable member for Dampier, the net result would be simply to wipe out the industry. Ifc must be rebe membered that we are fighting very strong and immensely wealthy people, who are prepared to go to .a pretty good length as long as they are not losing too much money-wit h a high fixed duty it which would not be possible for them to do i - in order to throw the Australian body builders out of business. Some day hope to see the motor-car industry estabfirms lished in this country by "" building chassis here, but I do not think that will be for some considerable"" time. I think we shall need a big increase in population before it will be possible to manufacture in Australia the various types of oar resarily. quired. If it were possible to use one of car for all'requirements, the incan put dustry could be established here.",47
169,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Eve n that would not make a big factory as motor-car factories go.',47
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Thaf c is so; but, nevertheless, it would make a considerable' in1 dustry which, I think,, could be carried on on commercial lines.",47
171,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Buf c the demand in the trouble Australia is too small.,47
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I have talked over matter with a number of people who in a positionfcoadvise me, and they a say that if we can adopt one standard type of car that would meet allfcherequirements of the people, we could lay a plant and manufacture it economically, and at a very reasonable However, as things stand today, that cannot be done. It is impossible for Australia, at the present time, to talk it about a deferred duty on motor cars. I admitfchafcfrom a defence point of view is highly desirable fchafc such an industry should be established here, and fchafc we should be in a positionfcobuild internal combustion engines afc the earliest it suited possible moment.",47
173,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"We need' more, people",47

The powers we are taking in the Bill to submitted for the consideration of this Parliament later on will prove an effective check in the event of the body builders taking undue advantage of their position. It will contain machinery under this Parliament can, if - it so det sires, very rapidly review, a duty of this character, .which in itself must necesI sarily be confined to comparatively few carrying on this class of work.

175,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Firs t of all, the whole business is standardized. When this concern 'started it was the pluckiest venture of the kind ever seen in Australia, because it meant ruin to the firm if it did not meet with, success. It intimated to the dealers throughout Australia that it could build a. body under certain conditions and at a certain price. The traders deemed .it impossible to do so. However, the firm submitted to a committee representative of all. the States, which met in Adelaide, .the approximate price it would charge for a standard body. The dealers replied that they were importing chassis for certain makesof cars, and, naturally, wouldrequire three or four different designs of body, so that it would be impossible for them to standardize their requirements. The firm pointed out that it could not go on with the enterprise if the dealers could - not agree upon' a standardized body, and it urged them to select the best of the different designs and agree to one that combined all the best elements of the others. The dealers did this, and agreed to one standard design, and under this condition the firm was able to turn out these bodies-and splendid bodies they are at the price, as every one admits who has seen them. But there was another condition. The firm pointed out that it would require a turnover of at least 2,000 cars per annum to get the necessary number of hands trained to turn out the work at the price quoted; but orders came in so rapidly that the turnover soon exceeded 2,000 car bodies per annum, and, as a matter of fact, the firm's premises have been extended to deal with a turnover of 4,000 car bodies per annum.",48
176,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Is the honourable member referring to Holden's ? Mr RICHARD FOSTER: - Yes . understand that there - is a similar firm in Sydney, but I do not think that it is quite as big ns Holden's.

202,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Wentworth) [ 6 . 5 ] - It is not often that I have a dash in on Tariff matters, but this is an item that appeals to me as a car owner. Although I am ji Protectionist, I am glad to hear that the Minister (Mr Greene) has decided to reThe duce the rates on chassis to 5 per cent., 7-J per cent., and 10 per cent.,- respectively. Quite recently I have had .nn Australian body put on my own motor, and I have not seen a better one even in the great English motor 'body factories that .1I have visited. It was made for me in Sydney, and I am convinced that we can make in Australia motor car bodies that are not excelled in any other part of the world. Unquestionably we .must encourage motoring here. The work carried out by the motor body factories in the various States is unequalled, and I am glad that the Minister is not prepared to reduce the duty on the imported bodies. The man who imports a complete car from the Old is not duiy-on the body. Amendment negatived. Amendment (by Mr STORY) prosix posedThat the item be amended hy adding, after sub-item D (4 ) , the following:--""And on and after 1st July, 1921The (4) Chassis(a) Unassembled, ad val., British, free; intermediate, 5 per cent.; general, 7 A per cent.

209,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,I do not know. I am quite willing to furnish the name of motor my informant privately.,51
210,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,How long is ' it since I he made that statement ?,51
211,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Q u it e recently. As the a matter of fact,,he has only returned to I canAustralia during the past few months. This gentleman discussed with Mr Henry Ford the possibility of establishing the industry in Australia. He pointed out that Mr Ford had already opened n factories in many countries where the of success were not so"" bright as they are in the Commonwealth. In reply. Mr Ford said that if we erected a sufficiently high Tariff wall he would establish the industry here. I admit that at present we are not making chassis in Ausmy tralia, and that we would be unable to manufacture them immediately. But the imposition of ' a deferred duty would be an intimation to manufacturers in other parts of the world that if they are prepared to' come here and establish the in and dustry, two years hence, we shall be willing to give them the* benefit of the proposed duty. The point touched upon by the Minister' (Mr Greene), so far as it affects the defence of Australia, is of paramount importance. What we have to realise is the great isolation of our centres one from the other, and the great cost of railway communication over such long stretches in a country which is so sparsely populated. But with the establishment of the motor industry in our midst, it would be possible for us so to mobilize our Forces that in case of attack we should'be in'a position to convey our troops from one point to another very rapidly. We have the lessons of the war before us. The greatest achievement on the part of the Allied Forces during that momentous struggle was the result of motor traction. In the early stages of the war, Paris itself was saved by reason of the fact that France was able to quickly mobilize her troops, and to transport them by motor vehicles to the point where the German Forces were most threatening. Do we not all remember how General Gallieni, by commandeering every motor vehicle available, was enabled to convey his Forces to.the most vulnerable point, and by striking the German Army in the centre, to save Paris?",51
212,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Viewe d from that stand-point it would be better to remit the duty altogether.,52
213,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Le t me show the fallacy of'the honourable member's argument. Australia, if attacked, must be attacked from the sea. Being an island continent, it is quite possible for this country to be completely cut off from the. rest of the world. It is absolutely necessary, therefore, that we should establish the motor industry in Australia.",52
214,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Some honourable memcosting bers opposite do not-care about the defence of Australia so long as they can get cheap motor cars.,52
215,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Apparently, the safety of the Commonwealth does not weigh with them, though, a majority this Committee will agree with me that something should be done to establish this industry in our midst. Consequently, hope that we shall agree to the imposition of the deferred duty proposed *: If at end of two years it is found that it possiblefcoestablish the industry in tralia, i ' shall be quite willing fco see duty remitted.",52
216,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The honourable member's amendment would be all right if Australia had a population of, 15,000,000.",52
217,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,That argument has been advanced in opposition to the establishment of every industry in this country.,52
218,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,It is the argument which has been advanced to me. by the Australian makers of automobiles.,52
219,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,We have always been met with the same cry; but the argument of the honourable member has been - exploded time after time.,52
220,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Not in respect of motor cars.,52
221,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"At the end of two years we shall know the position better ' than we know it today.

Mr - MATHEWS - The reason is that there are not enough Australians here!",52
223,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"That is exactly the reason. Nobody will pretend that any engine is being built in Australia that "" fills the bill."" Of the motor cars in Australia today it 'is stated that those less than £350 each represent 66 per cent.; those costing between £350 and £500 each, 26 per cent.; those between £500 and £800, 4£ per cent.; and those costing £800 and over, 3J per cent. Ifc is a well-known fact that Britain can beat America'""into a cocked h at"" in the of production of expensive cars.",52
224,Mr CUNNINGHAM,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Not many of those I cars .are imported into Australia.,52
225,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Ver y few, the indeed, are imported. British manufacis imturers have devoted themselves mainly to Austhe production of 'such cars as the only the class in which they could successfully compete with American manufacturers, who,, because of the greater population, can'beat Britain so far 'as the"" cheaper cars ' are concerned - We-are told thatBritish inotor .manufacturers state that they - cannot -'produce low-priced automobiles -'because 'thejir h<Sme marketis limited to a ' populationof - 4^000,000, and that the hdihe market, and not the export market, is the determining factor in output-and Consequent cost. The American figures are very eloquent. The state: ment by the British manufacturers is confirmed 'by statistics Concerningthe motor industry of the United Sta-teS of America. We are told .that; due to the'low first, cost, : America is the leading exporter in the world of automobiles. Yet the exports to eighty-one countries last year amounted to only 4^ per cent, of the production; that is, the home market absorbed 95A per. cent, of the output of 1,586,787 passenger vehicles, although the export during that period constituted a record. Eighty-one countries, therefore, secured the benefit of low production cost occasioned by the'great domestic market the United States of America possesses for its own automobile industry.""",52
226,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"That is the old Free Trade, argument I have heard for forty years.",53
227,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The argument scarcely applies to any other industry with which we have to do. We have been told that Mr Ford said that if there were a decent Tariff he would start business in Australia at once. Such an event is scarcely likely, in view of the statement by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), that Mr Ford told him there was no hope of any manufacturer coming to Australia, with its 5,000,000 of people, to enter into the business of building engines. If the time should come when there is a fair opportunity, and some justification for protecting this industry, I am sure this Par- liament will be prepared to listen sympathetically; but it does not seem to me the proper course to encourage the bodymaking industry, which . is giving such abundant promise, and, at the same time, hold out the prospect of a Tariff in thef other direction at the end of two years.",53

"" Mr RICHARD FOSTER - That may be, but it involves absolute discouragement, instead of assistance, to an indus: : Tariff. 9581 try that is promising to ""secure pracJ ; tically the' whole Of the business-, except? in the case of the very costly cars,, for which the purchaser can afford, and ought, to pay.

The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Marks) says that this industry cannot be successful here because our population is not - largoenoiigh to make the enterprise commercially successful.",53
229,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"That . was not my argument,, but my interjection.",53
230,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"May I tell the honourable member that I have heard exactly the same argument applied in the case of the woollen industry? A warehouseman has produced to me material and declared that nothing like it would ever be produced in this country; further, that if it ever were produced it would not pay, in view of the small population, nor would it pay to make the requisite change in the patterns. Exactly the same argument has also been applied to the cotton ancl other industries.",53

233,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I do not expect Australia to bo able to manufacture twenty or thirty different types of cars. What I desire is to see our own people manufacture a strong car for about £250, of a type useful to our agriculturists and - business men generally. With a a duty on chassis and engines, there is enough trade in Australia to keep the industry going. Of course, such a car would not be produced here so cheaply as at Ford's; that i for about £100."" I do S ; not expect a car to be built here at that price, but the market is sufficient to make it profitable to produce cars which could . be sold at £200 or £250. America production is cheaper, because there has been a reversion to savagery, with a ten-hours day. Chassis might as well be free until wo arrive at the stage when we can manufacture the whole car. L. am told that if an interval of two years be allowed, Australia will be flooded with chassis. Well, let them flood us for even up to ten years-w e should still then have a hope of starting the industry. In 1908 there was a fierce debate on this very item, and we were warned by. opponents of Protection of what would happen if we attempted to manufacture them here. The majority of thoso opponents thought., and said, that Australian workmen had the brains to construct an engine. Several admitted that they had changed their minds so far as locomotive engines were concerned, but they pointed to the "" highly technical skill"" essential to produce an engine for a motor car. Such an engine, they said, was not like a big, clumsy engine, and then they proceeded to talk a jumble of trade names and claptrap. But motor cars are made in Japan, and we can make them here if we have sufficient encouragement. It is the duty of the Government, in the interest of agriculturists, business men, and the workers, to do what is possible for this industry.",53
234,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,W c do not want such help.,54
235,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Of course, the honourable member doe's not. I separate him from the rest of the Corner party as a consistent anarchist, who does not believe in the Government having control of anything, not even a police force. As a matter of fact, the honourable member is like one of those gentlemen who drew up the Constitution for the United States of America, and who, in their desire for liberty, gave so much that every man was free to rob his fellows,, so long as he was o the stronger. This will always occur under a social system in which the Government does not interfere. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) and his staff must have put in many months in compiling the Tariff. I . am satisfied that they have gone carefully into every detail of. its various items. It must have become, In apparent to the Minister 'that the time has arrived when we should build motor cars in Australia from start to finish. This is an industry which must increase. No one can say what developments of th« aeroplane are likely to take place! We must have engines for motor cars, aeroplanes and motor boats, and I want, to see a duty imposed upon this class pf engines to induce our people to undertake their manufacture here. I undertake to say that any of the engineering establishments in my electorate could, in three months, train their men to turn out these engines in competition with any workmen in the world. I suggest the imposition - of a duty deferred for two years or three years in order that we may have some hope that in the future the complete manufacture of motor cars will be undertaken in this country. Honourable members who are not prepared to take the"" necessary action to bring this about are, in my opinion, remiss in their duty. They have no right-to represent Australia unless they are prepared to protect Australian industries.",54

239,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I shall not agree, to a deferred duty on motor chassis.",54
240,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The Committe* of experts which the Minister intends to provide for will be able to deal with a matter like this.,54
241,Mr CUNNINGHAM,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I do not approve of resigning to any Committee a duty which should be performed by Parliament. An inquiry by a Committee of . experts would not take us any further in this matter. We can only induce manufacturers to put money into the motor car industry in Australia by guaranteeing fco protect them: We can only do so by imposing a duty on .imported cars which will satisfy' manuf ac- fcurers abroad that it will pay them fco come here to carry on the industry, and so give employment to Australians.

This firm manufactures these engines completely, including castings and everything else. The Ford Company is able to cut down costs because of the way in which its business has been systematized. The moulding of Ford engines is done automatically by machinery, and there can be nothing very intricate about an article which can be manufactured in that way. The war proved that women could readily learn lathe work, and the other intricate work necessary for the production of munitions, and I say that it is possible for our Australian workmen to be trained fco turn out motor engines. I well for men to stand up in this chamber and say that Australian workmen cannot do as good work as can be done by an American, a Frenchman, or an Italian.",54

248,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The honourable member would not like to see Ford's methods introduced here.,55
249,Mr CUNNINGHAM,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"We might manufacture a car in Australia similar to Ford's without adopting his methods., I certainly do not advocate any reduction of the standard of living and wages in Australia. I have heard it stated that a Ford car can be produced in America for £65. Others put the figure afc £85, but I think every one is agreed that it can be produced for less than £100. We have to pay over £200 for it in Australia, and the difference leaves a big margin fco pay for the manufacture of such a car in Australia and allow for the sale of that car afcfchelocal factory at a figure less than fchafc which Australians are now asked to pay for the Ford car ",55

I should like some definite statement from honourable members of the Country party to show whafc they really stand for in the way of protecting Auscars tralian industries. Honourable members in the Corner say that it is not necessary to impose high rates of duty, because they amount to an undue protection to portations the Australian manufacturer. But we should give adequate protection, so that the outside maker may be attracted to come here and set up his works, and, his turn, reap the advantages which wish the Australian manufacturer enjoy.

The reason why Australia had these various industries was that there not adequate protection. It has been argued in the past that we could not prorailway axles and wheels because there was not a big enough demand for them in Australia. But we are doing so today. Judged by our present rate of the population of Australia may be doubled within the next twenty years. a Thus there will be ever greater markets provided. If we encourage our manufacwith adequate protection, the cost if of various commodities will come down. Honourable members may not know that for the last 6ix months for which figures inare available we imported into Australia 6,588 motor cars. That amounts to over 13,000 cars per annum. In the past ten do years nearly £20,000,000 worth of motor have been brought into this country. Those are enormous figures. As motors become more and more widely used throughout the country, so will the imincrease, and in the next ten years probably 250,000 cars will be required in Australia. There is wonderful scope for a new Australian industry. in We are not placing any hardship we on importers today. If a deferred to Tariff is decided upon, we shall be merely saying that Australia is prepared to give any patriotic citizen who cares to put up his money ample protection into establish the industry. Until we oan produce motor cars in Australia, we sliould be prepared to let them in free. Thereafter, with our own industry, well established, our policy should be protection to the point of prohibition.",56

I have pushed a bicycle over a good deal of Australia, and I would rather ride in a motor. We have 50,000 unemployed in Australia today, while we are sending out millions of pounds to imported motor cars. Would it not be far better to have those 50,000 men engaged on the - necessary primary and secondary works for the production of motor cars? Boiled and cast steel comprises the greater part of a motor chassis.' There is'nothing intricate in the manufacture of that prowith duct. Australians can make bridges and locomotives; yet we are told that we not turn out a vehicle of the nature Ford motor car. I am sorry that there are men in the National Parliament who have such ""little"" faith in their country its people as to say and believe that. industry could be started here in a small way. Some of the biggest American makers began humbly, with a relatively small output; but they have grown enorof mously and built up world-wide trade and associations. We pay up to £250 for a Ford car, the factory price of which is £80. Between the two figures there is a wide margin for the successful inauguand ration of the Australian industry, proof vided a guarantee is given that the foreigner cannot kill our industry. taking the Ford as ah example I do because it is everywhere recognised as most popular utility car.

255,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Dampier) [8.43] - I regret that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story) saw fit to withdraw his amendment. The . Minister (Mr. Greene) would have been justified in permitting the motor chassis to come in' free buy from the United Kingdom, and in imposing a lower rate than he has proposed in respect of importations from other countries. However, I am pleased that the Minister .has seen his way clear to accept some reduction. If something in the nature of a bounty were recommended a view to fostering the industry in Australia, I would be very ready to sapcanport it. In that way the whole comof a munity pays for Government assistance, while, if high Protection is imposed, the individual who needs the commodity for and carrying on his own undertakings has to The bear the burden. The Australian Motor Body Association has pointed out that the farmer in the United States of America is required to pay £290 for a certain make car, and that when it is imported heTe the Australian user has to pay £624 for it. The enormous difference is made up, among other things, of duty amounting to £118, and the cost of packing, freight, insurance. They also, give the price Ford chassis imported second-hand for motor lorries of. British manufacture. The In - total cost of bringing these here was so £826, of . which duty paid amounted to the £425. These figures are enormous, and remust tend to prevent the development of this country. _ I am sorry the honorablfe member for Boothby (Mr Story) has witha drawn his amendment because it would in have enabled us to take a test vote.

257,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I should think that people who had money to invest in this industry would have approached the Minister for Trade and Customs rather than a private member. As the amendment has been withdrawn, I am, prepared to accept the reduction the Minister is making, and trust that nothing in the nature of a. deferred duty will be agreed t'o.",58
258,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Melbourne) [8.48]- 1 sincerely trust the Minister for Trade aud Customs (Mr Greene) will accept the suggestion of the honourable .member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), because if he does so he will be the first Minister for Trade and Customs who has had sufficient common sense lo indicate to the manufacturers of the world .that Australia is a field worthy of entering. Only this evening a gentleman- I cannot, without his permission, disclose his name-informe d me that if the Government could see their way clear to introduce a similar amendment two years hence he would be prepared to expend a large sum of money in establishing an industry in Australia for producing an article which is not manufactured to the extent we wish. What does a manufacturer in the United States of America or Canada do when he wishes to start in business? He first of all makes inquiries as to the Tariffs in operation, and if they prevent him selling his goods at a profit he immediately considers the desirableness of manufacturing locally, and thus escaping the high duties. We have only to realise that Cadbury's and other manufacturers have established industries in Australia. If such a provision is embodied in the Tariff, the Minister will have established a precedent that will cause manufacturers to look to Australia in the future. I ask the Minister to correct me if I am in error when I say that there is no Tariff in the world which offers such a conoession to manufacturers.",58
259,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I do not know of any which includes a provision for deferred duties, if that is what the honourable member is referring to.",58
260,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I do not know of any. but I trust. that the Minister will be prepared to adopt the suggestion. We are threatened to be hampered by the patent laws appertaining to manufac-' tures, and whether it is owing to the late war or the broader outlook that is now being taken, many countries are not allowing patent rights to exist unless the. owners of such rights commence manufacturing in the country within a certain period. I believe it was the intention of the Government of the day to introduce a measure embodying that provision.",58
261,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The Senate rejected it.,58
262,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"If the Senate rejected the proposal it is time that Chamber was wiped out. I know it was the intention of the Government of the day to introduce such a measure, and I trust that even now action will be taken in that direction. Honourable members know that it is my desire to get the Tariff out of the way so that we can consider the terrible question of dumping.",58
263,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.52] - Eve n if the generations to come were to look upon me as a wise man for adopting the suggestion submitted I am afraid I cannot do so. Mr RIT.EY - What are you going to lose?,58
264,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"It is premature. I nin afraid that if such a course were taken we would find that one or two comparatively small manufacturing concerns would be established which would create difficulties, preventing the manufacture of motor cars in this country being brought any nearer.",58
265,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,That difficulty presents itself in connection with otlier industries.,58
266,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"It does in a greater or lesser degree. In this case it is to a greater degree, and that is why I - do not think it necessary.",58
267,Mr CUNNINGHAM,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Unde r what circumstances would the Minister agree to such a proposal?,58
268,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"We would require a bigger market. If an industry were established in Australia, it would have to be capable of producing several types of cars, because we could not meet the requirements of the whole of Australia with one type of motor vehicle.",58
269,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The purchasers could pny a higher price for the others.,58
270,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The honourable member forgets that we do not merely require cars for driving in the streets, but need motor-driven vehicles for various purposes, and at least four types would be required. Perhaps, in a few years, it may be possible to offer the manufacturers in other countries facilities for manufacturing here. I quite agree with the desirableness of doing what is suggested, but I am not prepared to recommend to the Committee a deferred duty on motor chassis. For the same reason T do not favour the payment of a bounty, because I do not think it would materially assist the industry. The payment of a bounty might be the means of inefficient plants being established, which would be quite incapable of meeting the actual requirements of the country. For the reasons given I do not feel disposed to accede to the request of the honourable member.",58

It was a new departure, but its operations extended until a few years ago when it was assailed to such an extent that it nearly wiped out of existence, and if had not been for the. protection afforded as Ford. against the American Combine, we would not have had such an important Austrapresent Tariff. lian industry at the present. What applies to that industry is equally applicable to quite a number of others in every State of the Commonwealth.",59

276,Mr CONSIDINE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,I am quite prepared to express my ideas to the workmen.,59
277,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"If the honourable member spoke of them there as he does here, they would not listen to him long, and I would not blame them. There are manufacturers already in field if only in a small way. who fought on the other side of the world utilized the time at their disposal the armistice was signed in gaining inforby mation in a particular branch of manufacture, which, coupled with the knowledge they possessed before going abroad, enabled them to commence the manufacture of motor cycles in Australia. The firms-with which they are now connected are known as F i r t h Brothers, and Foreman and Whiting. A publication issued by the Australian Mining Standard contains the following: For some time past Messrs. Firth Brothers have been engaged making standardized motor parts for the trade houses, so they have had full opportunity - to discover the faults and virtues of the various imported machines. With the object one day .to produee a motor themselves, they have gradually perfected their plant, which, in addition to machine tools, includes a modern foundry, sand-blasting outfit, drop-forge hammer, 'enamelling plant, &c. Messrs. Foreman and Whiting, who, as already stated, recently arrived from England, brought with them valuable plant, and what is perhaps of. even greater importance, considerable experience in massed production. These gentlemen are erecting a factory next that of Messrs Firth Brothers, so that the various processes lie carried out practically under the same roof. The joint area of the works (floor space) will be 10,500 feet, and the value of the plant, The buildings, and machinery approximately £20,250. They anticipate being able to produce 500 motor cycles a year, to employ sixty workers, and disburse £15,000 a year in wages. was I do nob say that these two firms can comi t pete successfully with such manufacturers",59

279,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"They did ; and I fail to see the dangers forecast by the M in ister. Should we not open the door to the great manufacturers of the world, and say, "" . If you come here, we are prepared at any rate to protect you "" ? Notwithstanding the opinions expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . and others, one great cnr manuhim facturer may .have said that he will not establish works in Australia, but other manufacturers have said that and later disproved their own words. The Minister has within the last eighteen months had experience of firms which did not wish to set up factories in Australia, but which, very owing to certain conditionsthat were created, have come here and are manuthe facturing in Australia what they preTwo men viously said could' be better manufactured in Great Britain. I see no reason why after the amendment should not be accepted the Minister. It offers an inducement to big: manufacturers in other parts of the world to come here and establish their industry - . The-late Mr James Page once related to me an incident which illustrates the value - of the motor car in the back country. In apportion of Queensland which was experiencing a drought, a friend came to. him and said thatlie must lose his flock of about 500 sheep, because he had no feed for them.  or 70 miles distant. The grazier agreed that'there was plenty of water and feed there, but said that he had no means of transporting his Stock there. At the in lorries, which were the joint property of residents, were fitted with hurdles, and in this way the sheep were transported, 100 in each load, from a place, of drought to a place of plenty. ;",59
280,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Is not. that an. argument in favour of making the cars as cheap as possible ?,60
281,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,- I believe thaiP. if foreign manufacturers could be induced to manufacture their cars in Australia the price would be reduced.  would be the exception to the rule.,60
282,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The honourable member would not make that statement if he had studied Australian manufacturing history.,60
283,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"For d cars can be purchased for £99 each in America, because they are turned out of the factory at the rate of one* a minute! No big firm in Australia would do that.",60
284,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The honourable member's view is very circumscribed. Our population now exceeds 5,000,000, but it will not remain at that figure. I am optimistic enough to believe that within a few years our population will be. doubled. If we desire to attract a large and virile population we must foster, not only the primary industries, but also the secondary industries.",60
285,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The honourable member's party is opposed to immigration. Mr Fenton:-This , is not the occasion for discussing the resolutions of the Labour Conference. The population Australia must increase by leaps and bounds. But if we put obstacles in the way of the establishment of big manufactures in the country we shall do a great deal towards depleting the population.  Victoria has decreased by' 18,000 in the last few years ",60
286,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Those fluctuations occur in every country. Does the honourable member say that our population will not increase? '0>he TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Mr Watkins) - Immigratio n is not the question before the Chair.,60
287,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The rural population is not the whole of the people. I am not one of the pessimists in this House. I have great faith in the future of this great country; but it is the duty.of this National Parliament to legislate in a way that will help the development of the Commonwealth. There will be no danger in imposing the proposed deferred duty. Throughout this schedule the Minister has provided a fixed duty, an acl valorem duty, and also another duty to operate after a certain date, thereby demonstrating his belief that by the deferred duty system he will encourage manufacturers to start operations in Australia. Even our Free Trade friends of the Country party need not be afraid of this deferred duty, because discretionary power is left in the hands of the Minister, and if , at .the end of, *say, three years, the expert advisers in the Departmentare of opinion that the Australian production of motor cars is not sufficient - to warrant the imposition of the duty, it can be further deferred. I have been informed by those who are very much interested in importing .chassis as cheaply as possible that a few years ago motor cars complete in every detail were manufactured in Australia, and within the knowledge of my informant one, at least, is still in use. If honourable members would visit the workshops in our capital cities and the principal provincial towns, I believe they would have no hesitation in framing a Tariff that would give adequate encouragement to every industry that it is possible to establish in Australia. We started this Tariff on right lines, but there is a tendency now of to turn it into a piebald affair. I do not want a brindled sort of Tariff; I want one that, both in general symmetry and details, consistently expresses the policy of encouraging Australian industry. However, the Czar who is in charge of the Tariff has said "" N a y "" to the amendment. I can only hope that if we are defeated in the division, the Minister will be compelled in a few years' time to tell House that he knows that there are motorcar manufacturers who are prepared to establish their factories in Australia.",60
288,Mr MASKS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"We hope he will. Mr Fenton"" - Giv e him a chance now. Open the door, and say to the manufacturer abroad, ""We can offer a decent market for you to start in ; this is a land flowing with milk and honey, and, so far, we have only scratched the edge of a continent; our population must increase.""",61
289,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Illawarra) [9.12] - I was deeply moved by the pathetic picture which the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) painted of the people struggling in the back countiy to convey their starving stock from one place to another, and I rejoiced with him that the motor lorries had been able to save one poor grazier's stock. The only thing that hurt me about the pathetic little story was the reflection that the Government had been heartless enough to take from the struggling selector's friend a heavy tax upon the means by which the stock were saved, although there was no hope, by so doing, of establishing an industry in Australia. The tax upon chassis is a disgrace to the Government.",61
290,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"That is not the question before the Chair. Mr.""HECTOR LAMOND - The proposal is to impose a very much heavier duty than has ever been imposed before. Although it sounds nicer to call it a deferred duty, it none the less means that the users will have to pay more for chassis in 1923, and farmers who have the misfortune to have starving stock in that year, and who may have need of motor transport, will require to depend upon friends who"" have been able to pay an extra £100 or £125 for a motor car. If there is one class of imports that should not be taxed it is this particular class, against' which the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony). is to-night exerting, himself. Transport is the most important factor in this country. In every State we are taxed heavily, to provide railways. If we had titkea more interest in the development of roads, and had encouraged people to use motor vehicles, the demand for railways would have been very much reduced, the conveniences of life in the interior would the have been increased, and life would have been made very much brighter.. I.shall not vote for any duty upon nieans'of transport that are made abroad and not in Australia, because 1 believe that every encouragement should be given to the people .to use these mechanical means in their indusr tries, particularly the rural industries. Not only is motor transport desirable i i i the interests of the industries of the country; there is no greater educational means at the disposal of the people today than a motor car of the - cheap type'. In America the young mechanic who has just passed through his apprenticeship is able, because of the cheap price at which he can buy a motor car, to see the land he lives in, and thus broaden' his experience in the .best possible way. The best education a man can get is travel in his own country. But we say to the young Australian who wants to buy a motor car that he cannot have it for £95, £100, or £125, the price paid by his American cousin, but that if he desires to have at hisdisposal this means of education available to - the young' American he must ' pay £250, - £275, or. £300 for ""it. The motor car making industry seems to me to stand in an entirely different class from any other we have to consider in framing this Tariff. We can confer no greater benefit upon all classes in .Australia today, rural and urban, than by giving them cheap motor vehicles such as are available to the citizens of America. To call upon the Australian to pay as.much as £225 for a machine that prior to the war was selling in America at less than £90 is a serious handicap to the development of our country. The farmer would be much better off if he could get cheap engines for his work; the professional man would be in a much better position if he could get : about more freely, by being able to purchase a motor car cheaply; but the most valuable purpose to which motor cars can be put is the enabling of the young people of Australia, at a time when they can enjoy the delights of motoring in all sorts of weather, to have the opportunity of travelling in the land in which they were born, and seeing more of their own counis try. I am opposed to any duty that will make it more difficult to use motor cars for any of the purposes I have menmust tioned, and certainly I shall not vote the imposition of any revenue duty upon them.",61
291,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"South Sydney) [9.20] The arguments advanced by the honorlocal able member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) are hardly worth a reply. He talks about the cheapness of motor cars in America, but they are only cheap there because the Protective policy adopted in that country made it possible for them to be built there.",62
292,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Mr Ford has not had any protection.,62
293,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Americ a is a highly motor protected country, and for that reason been able to establish so many industries, among them the motor car industry. What makes the American motor car so costly in Australia? It is because, addition to the price of the car, the .has to pay duty, freight, agent's charges, and retailer's profit. If the honourable member is so anxious that the young men on the land. people of Australia shall be able to travel about their country and see land they live in, his best policy is to vote for a deferred duty on motor that will encourage their manufacture here. The honourable.member for Wentis worth (Mr Marks) says we must have millions more people before this parconditions ticular industry can be established in Australia, but we have already commenced the manufacture of motor cycles without those extra millions, and there not much difference between the engine required for a motor car and that which is required for a motor cycle except that the former is of a larger type.",62
294,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The trouble is that we cannot make them cheaply.,62
295,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The honourable member pends upon. contends that that can only be done with mass production, but without mass prohigher duction Australia is able to produce locodoes. motives equal to those turned out by American firms, and just as cheaply. the arguments adduced today in regard to motor cars have been advanced here previously in regard to locomotives. Every time an attempt is made to establish new industry in Australia the same heard that We have not sufficient population, and that people will not be induced to put their capital into it . We make a start somewhere, and I canfor not understand why the Minister (Mr. Greene) should be so short-sighted in regard to the motor-car industry as to decline to agree to a deferred duty which -- would enable a start to be made in the manufacture of motor cars, and give a guarantee to people willing to make that start that they would at a certain time have a protective duty upon their output, and would not be at the mercy of any Government that might come into power. We ought to intimate now to the people interested in the trade that after a certain time we intend to place a prohibitive duty upon the importation of cars, and that if they want to do business in Australia they must come here has to manufacture their cars. Dozens of industries are carrying on successfully under our Tariff which it was said it was impossible to establish here. How are we in going to get population unless we have buyer secondary industries? We are already producing more wheat than we can consume, so that we do not wantto put more",62
296,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The honourable member's the party is opposed to immigration.,62
297,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,We are not if work cars can be found for immigrants.,62
298,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The policy of our party to make the country attractive to all the people of the world by making the of work here better than they are elsewhere. If we do this, and „afford - plenty of opportunities for employment, people will come to Australia readily is enough. We shall not induce immigrants to come here if we are dependent for the products of secondary industries on what can be brought by ships from overseas. If we attempt that line of policy we will have an unemployed market.",62
299,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,It is the unemployed market in America that Henry Ford de,62
300,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Henr y Ford pays wages than any other manufacturer,62
301,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I have heard it said All that Mr Ford's employees go to their work"" in motor cars, and they can do that because they get good' wages. But if the workers can earn good' wages in America, a and own motor cars, why cannot we have cry a factory here paying good wages? It can be done. We do not want to bring down the conditions of our workers; we want to improve them. We are told.tonight that men are prepared to put up their money and produce a good substantial car in Australia for less than £250.",62
302,Mr MARRS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,How is it that we have not heard of this before 1,63
303,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Because the honourable member moves in a small circle, and does not know what is going on. If we build a cheap motor car in Australia, giving employment to Australians, we create a market fdr the sale of the cars. We imported nearly 13,000 cars last year. If we can turn out a cheap car suitable for our requirements we can double that demand, which would be a fine start for the industry. We have ample proof that there is room for such a factory, and no one who loves his country and his fellow men, and wants to see Australia progress, should hesitate to hold out an inducement in the shape of a deferred duty to a company to commence the building of motor cars here.",63
304,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Robertson) [9.28] The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley), like many other honourable members, has built up a great deal of his argument on a statement concerning the Ford factory, and one would think from the arguments put forward that we could do the same as Henry Ford has done. But it is useless to attempt to pub our workers on the level of the workers of the TJnited States of America. We are told by honourable members opposite that the Ford employees are paid a high rate of wages, and can afford to go to their work in motor cars. They are paid a high rate of wages, and many of them do go to their work in motor cars; but, whilst the system employed in the Ford factories reflects great credit on Mr Ford's organizing powers and ability, it is one that would not be tolerated in this country, and honourable members who are making such a song about it to night would be the very r first to oppose its adoption in Australia. Mr Ford has so organized his works that the workmen are arranged in two rows along a moving table 300 or 400 feet in length, and the various parts of the car are assembled on that table after coming down to it through shootsfrom lofts above. Each man has to do a section of the work in a particular time as the article moves past him, and he is speeded up to the utmost. No one can drop out, or fail to do his little bit at the exact moment as quickly as his fellow man. There are overseers standing by who keep the workers up to the standard. The result of this system is that, although the men are paid nigh wages, within a very short time-so I was informed by the people in charge there, and by. some of the workmen themselves-generall y after three or four years they get out. ""They find the pace too hot. They have made enough, as a rule, in that time to secure their own little dwelling, and very often to buy their own cheap car, and they then go to other factories that work at a slower pace, but where they get a lower wage. It is of no use for us to talk about doing things in that way, as it is lending altogether a false appearance to the whole position. Let us get down to actual facts, and try to establish industries here on a basis such as can exist, and such as honourable members who are advocating these things here to-night will be prepared to tolerate and support. Not only are the men there worked at that high pressure, but Mr Ford relies on the constant influx of ignorant immigrants te carry,on with. I am not saying this in derogation of Mr Ford, because in some /ways he has been a very good man to his - country: B",63
305,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,It is rather in derogation of the immigrants.,63
306,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The immigrants are of all kinds and colours. Most of them aro foreigners who are ignorant of the conditions that obtain in the TJnited States of America. Mr Ford has upstairs a room larger than this chamber, in which his new immigrants are collected every evening for weeks to learn English, so that they can understand .when they are spoken to and carry on with the other operatives in the factory. The whole position there is different from anything that can possibly obtain in ' Australia, and it is most misleading for honourable members to try to persuade the Australian community that we can establish factories in the same way as the Americans have done. If we are going to establish factories here, we must do it on a plane where men can work at what is considered in Australia to be a reasonable rate, and where they have an opportunity to carry on, not only for one or two years, but as long as ordinary men have ordinary strength. There is no slave driving ih this country, although the honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) may disagree with me, and we hope there never will be. The danger about this movement here to-night is that the motor-body building industry, which is of use to Australia, will be destroyed by an attempt to establish an industry which we are not yet fit to carry on. In . the motor-car industry, as in other highly organized trades and businesses, the orders have to be out for some time before the material actually arrives. In this particular instance it is from.one to four years ahead thilt the orders aTe sent for chassis, and the bodymakers. then get to work bere with all their employees in this growing industry to make the bodies for them. If we attempt by this false means and false reasoning to establish here an industry for which we are not fit, in the way of making chassis, all we shall do is to destroy the ibody-making industry, which today is a valuable and growing one in Australia.",63
307,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Melbourne Ports) [9.35] - The remarks of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) have been so pathetic that one could almost hear the tears in his voice, so to speak, as he depicted the lot of the poor working man in America. It is most remarkable to find the poor working man protected by the honourable member. If we establish motor factories in Australia, as we established bicycle works, and try to get good conditions for the workers, it will not be the honourable member for Robertson that will help us. All the pathetic language"" that h'e has just got rid of does not appeal to. me. He could have been stopped by the Chairman very early in his speech, because he did not deal with the question at issue at all. All he did was to depict, in harrowing terms the way Mr Ford treats his employees. If American firms do what the honourable member says, all I can say is that there are. Australian firms which would be just as bad if they got the chance, an i the honourable member' would not help us to stop them. We have heard a good deal from the foreign' Country party, and from, the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Hector - Lamond), and, by interjection, from the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden).",64
308,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,I object to that remark if the honourable member means that I am one of the foreign Country party.. -- - r,64
309,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I separated the honourable.member from them. I do.nob expect a single Australian thought or desire from, the honourable members in the Ministerial corner, and it is, therefore,-of no use to appeal to £h«m; but I do appealto those who sit behind the Government. The Government have brought down a Tariff for a certain purpose. . It is intended to create work for the people of Australia. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) hurls at 'us the accusation that we are against immigration. We are against immigration while there are Australians unemployed. I would rather spread the expenditure of £40,000 or £50,000 per year which is to be spent on immigration amongst the mothers of Australia, and increase the maternity allowance. It would be better for Australia to have immigration in-.the good old-fashioned way.",64
310,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,There is not one member of the Country party who was nob born in Australia..,64
311,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Then they are a disgrace to Australia. They have not one Australian thought or ' sentiment amongst them. It appears to be useless to appeal even to the supporters of the Government, because the Minister himself (Mr Greene) has slipped on a division of the Tariff under which we could have given to Australia something that was really worth, going for. I am surprised at his attitude. I did think that' when a fight was put up on a proposal of this sort we would get some consideration. The Minister said-and , although he was entitled to adduce it as an argument,' it is still verydebatable-that if we imposed a deferred duty it might bring into existence certain manufacturers who would not be able to make on a large enough scale, but who; having put money into the dnduotry, would say, ""We can manufacture here, and we want the trade."" I am. willing to admit that this is not a small man's game, and we do not ask the Minister ""to bring the duty into operation just because some mansays he can make 100 motor cars per year. Nobody asks for that. The honourable member for Wentworth spoke about turning out one motor car' a minute. There is no need to aim at that in Australia at present, but .there would be money in the manufacture of. cars in Australia for any man who could get a trade of 10,000 a year. We import about 26,000, and if we could make 25,00.0 of themhere they would meet all our requirements. The men who want RollsRoyce and cither expensive cars could pay for the remaining 1,00.0, and I would not care what -.they were charged for them. I want to see motor cars manufactured in. Australia, but not in the way depicted by the honourable member for Robertson, and not for £ 6 0 or £ 9 5 each, under conditions which we do not desire, and which the honourable member describes as obtaining in the Ford works. We have mentioned £250 per car as a fair price. All the arguments that have been adduced against our proposal are Free Trade arguments from start to finish, and how the Minister so far forgot himself as to take up his present attitude, when' he is a member of a . Protectionist Government, I cannot understand.",64
312,Mr BSENNAN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The Acting Prime Minister, who is sitting at the table, explains the mystery. . Mr MATHEWS - I do not charge the Acting Prinie Minister with being the .cause of the trouble. I presume the Government as a whole are concerned - in the Tariff, which is their responsibility, and not wholly the responsibility of the M in i ster for Trade and Customs. We have made out a good case, and have' asked, not for an immediate, but for a deferred, duty. The only legitimate argument advanced against it came from the Minister for ' Trade and Customs himself, .but we are not asking him to bring the dutyinto operation unless, after the expiration of two or three years, there is evidence that cars can be produced in this country 'in sufficient quantities to warrant it . U n less that evidence is forthcoming, I do - not want the duty applied, nor does any other honourable member on this side. If we. can getevidence' that the machines can be produced in Australia to a reasonable extent, then the duty ought at once to operate. It seems hopeless to expect the Minister to give way, but he is a young man, and the time will arrive when he will regret that he neglected the opportunity to help forward this one great in dustry by which he might have made a name for himself.",65
313,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Melbourne) [9.41.] - I was struck by the Minister's remark that there would have to-be four types of car - I was present at the Government Farm at Werribee when the Victorian Government gave at r i a l for all motor tractors run with the internal combustion engine, and on that occasion Jelbart, of Ballarat, beat three American and two Australian firms. That maker has reached that standard with a protection of 27£ per cent. British, 35 per cent, intermediate, and 40 per cent, general, under item 177. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) is simply asking on this item for a little increase on those rates, to operate at the end of two years. Let us see what the two most - up-to-date nations in Tariff matters have done in connection with.motor cars. At page 871 of The Tariffs of the World, I find that the United States of America impose a duty oh automobiles of 45 per cent, ad valorem. In the Japanese Tariff, automobiles* are dutiable at 50 per cent, ad valorem. It has been said that we have not the population to provide the' requisite market for an industry of this k in d . We were told not many years ago that we could not play cricket, and - that we should have top it a team of twenty-two against an English eleven. The answer to that statement is to be found almost daily in the press'reports of the doings of the Australian eleven at Home. And so [ would urge that , ' even if we have not ' at present 'the population to support this industry, we should set to work to establish it irrespective of whether or not we shall have to pay more for our motor cars until it is placed oh a sound footing. Let us obtain from overseas the most skilled motor mechanics, and commence operations. I have shown that two great nations, where the manufacture of motor cars is'a firmly established industry, consider it necessary still to impose high Protective duties on automobiles. I compliment the"" present Government on the fact that it is the first in either State or Federal history to provide for deferred duties,, so that the manufacturers of the world may know that if they set up uew industries here, they will be "" protected. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) jocularly interjected that these proposed deferred duties should not come, into operation u n t il 1931, but I am sure that he would like to see the in dustry established before then, and I suggest that the Government should agree to the duties coming into operation five years facturers and those employed in hence.",65
314,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I do not think there is an industry that the Parliament would rather protectthan this if it could be shown that there was a chance, of establishing it on a paying basis ",66
315,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I am sure that is so; but unfortunately little technical differences divide us. I hope that the M i nister will agree to. the deferred duties proposed by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) coming into operation, if not in 1923, afc all events five years hence.",66
316,Mr MAKIN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Hindmarsh) [9.50] - I appreciate the splendid Australian spirit that has prompted my colleagues to support the imposition - of these - deferred duties, and I believe that they have a sincere desire to see the industry established in Australia. I also am .anxious that it shall beestablished here, but I am doubtful whether the action taken by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony)- in proposing that the higher rates of duty shall come into operation on 1st July, 1923, is judicious. We have already set up i i i Australia the industry of motor-body making, and it is an exceedingly valuable asset, since it gives employment to a very large number of our oifcizena. Ifc is just possible, however, that, as the result of the passing of these deferred duties, the trade depression and unemployment existing in the motor-body making industry today will recur again in twelve months because of the necessity for ordering chassis many months in advance, and the sense of insecurity to which the fixing of such a period would 1 give rise.' I learn from the official zation of the employees that, afc the present time, 2,000 of them are unemployed. This lack of employment, I am informed, has been due to some extent to the uncertainty as to what might be done by the Parliament in regard to the duties on chassis, and if we are going to provide that, in 1923, high duties shall operate, we may bring about a recurrence of this depression in the trade, I am sure that my honourable friends who support the amendment have no such desire. If they agreed that the deferred duties should not come into operation for a period of five years, their object would be met, while at the same time there would be a greater feeling of security on the part of the manuthe motor-body industry.",66
317,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Who can say what, alterations may not be made in the Tariff within the next five years? ' Mv. MAKIN - No one can say whafc either this or the next 'Parliament may do; but, in dealing with the Tariff, my desire has always been to try to give effect to requests mado to me by the official organizations of the employees in any in dustry affected by it . I recognise that ss my first duty in this Parliament as a representative of the workers. Where I am not advised by the unions in the respective industries, I have consistently supported the protection of Australian industries. Whilst I shall be reluctantly obliged to vote against the duty which it is proposed to make operative two years hence, I shall be prepared to support a duty thatwould afford encouragement and protection, to come into force, say, in five years' time. This would give a reasonable period for those interested in this and allied trades to determine the prospect of .chassis being manufactured commercially. I believe thatthis industry should be established in Australia, and if there has. been one argument advanced in favour of fostering it , it was the argument put forward by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), concerning the price which is being charged for chassis by the manufacturers of, America. The information with which I have been supplied by the representativeei of. the workers is that there is a grave doubt as. to whether these motor chassis could be manufactured cemmercially in' organiAustralia at the present moment. In all the circumstances a duty deferred for five years is preferable to a duty which will become operative in two years.",66
318,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Dampier) [ 9 . 5 8 ] - I do not know what prompted the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr : Mathews) to make an attack upon the members of the Country party. It struckme that he was a Daniel come to judgment. Whilst he was speaking of the unemployment in Australia, I could not help wondering what efforts he and his party made to remedy the evils flowing from unemployment when the Broken Hill mines closed down, when thousands of men were thrown out of work, and the country suffered a loss of millions of pounds. We' have merely to. look at the records of the motor-car industry in the Commonwealth to realise that if we allow chassis to be admitted free, employment in the motor-hody industry will be f provided for a much greater number of persons than are employed in it today. At the present time we have to pay for a buggy in Australia almost as much as people in America are required to pay for a motor car. The figures supplied to us by the Federal Council of Motor Traders set out the number of motor cars in Canada, as compared with the number in this country. They show that, in Canada^ there are 403,111 motor cars registered, as against 65,000 registered in Australia. In other words, Canada, with only 30 per cent, more population, possesses 500 per cent, more motor cars than we do. Why should we not be able to purchase motor cars in this country at something like a reasonable price? I exceedingly regret that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story) was allowed to withdraw his amendment. I hope that in another place better judgment will be exhibited in dealing with this matter, and that, as a result, motor chassis will be admitted free. If Australia possessed the number of motor cars that is possessed by Canada, look at the tens of thousands of additional people who would be employed here. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) spoke of the high duty which is operative in J apan. But has there been one factory established in that country for the manufacture of these chassis ? Not one.",66
319,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,How does the honourable member know that?,67
320,Mr GEEGOEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Because I have the information. The Japanese. Government is actually paying a subsidy for every motor car in the country which would be available for service in time of war. I hope that the Committee will refuse to countenance this proposal in any shape or form.,67
321,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Dalley^ [10.2] - The whole of the speeches delivered by Honourable members opposite have really been in favour of the establishment of this industry in Australia, and of making it possible for motor vehicles to be manu[387] factured here, so that they may be used in many avenues in which they are not being used today. If we are ever to make Australia great, we must make it a self-contained nation.",67
322,Mr GBEOOBY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,We must get the people here.,67
323,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"And the way to get the people here is to establish our industries. In the absence of industries what is the use of talking about, population? What is the use of industries unless they are organized, so that they may provide employment for - our people? The idea of bringing people to Australia, and of turning them .upon the streets to starve, is an utterly ridiculous one. The members of the Country party have always argued that we can do nothing in Australia. Unless it has been a matter of growing potatoes, or of raising pigs, they have consistently maintained that no industry should be established in the Commonwealth. Do we not remember how these gentlemen ridiculed the idea of establishing an Australian Navy? They said that it was not possible to do it. Yet, when the war broke out, the Australian Navy proved a great protection to this country. No one would suggest that this industry can immediately be established on as big a scale in Australia as it is on in America, but some inducement ought to be held out to persons to establish it here, with protection against the. unfair competition of the rest of the world.",67
324,Mr WIENHOLT,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Why is the competition ""unfair ""?",67
325,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The industry is well established and highly organized in other countries, with unlimited capital at its command, and the moment it is started here, foreign competitors will, in the absence of adequate protection, swamp and undersell those who have engaged in it here. The firms now sending their cars to Australia would, with Protection, establish works here; and they. are the very people we desire. The Minister ought to give some assurance to uch t people that if they do start factories in Australia',, they will be accorded fair and reasonable, protection. If the honourable gentleman will do so, I shall not press my amendment to a division. The amendment is intended as an indication to manufacturers of chassis that they will be given every encouragement here.",67
326,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I do not know that I can give,that assurance.",68
327,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Surely the Minister is prepared to extend some encouragement?,68
328,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"If .any firms were to intimate that they intended to establish the industry on a sufficiently large scale, I have not the slightest doubt that Parliament would protect them; more than that I cannot say.",68
329,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The Minister means, I suppose, that if any firms are prepared to meet the requirements of Australia, he is prepared to extend them fair and reasonable protection?",68
330,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"That is a matter for Parliament, not for me.",68
331,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The Minister oueht not to quibble on such a question; surely he believes in encouraging the establishment of industries';,68
332,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,I cannot give any more assurance than that I have already given.,68
333,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Will the honourable gentleman say that, as Minister for Trade and Customs, he is sympathetic, and personally will do all he can to assist in the direction I have indicated ?",68
334,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Nothin g would please me better than to see this industry established on sound commercial lines in this country.,68
335,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"On the understanding that the Minister is sympathetic, and will do what he can to promote the establishment of the industry, I ask leave to withdraw-my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Item-, as amended, agreed to. Item 360 (Vehicles n.e.i.) agreed to. DIVISION xv - MUSICA L INSTRUMENTS.

Amendment (by Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed - That after the word "" process,"" the following words be added:-""as prescribed by de- partmental by-laws.""",68
336,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Nepean) [10.15] - I was going to move that the words' "" except keyboards "" in this item be left out. Tho effect of that would be to permit keyboards to come in under the duty proposed for this item. Keyboards are dutiable under a later item, and a consequential amendment would have to be made in that item if they are inserted in this. The keyboard is a material part of every piano, but keyboards are not made in Australia, except by Beale's, in Sydney. The manufacture of keyboards is in other countries a specialized industry, and they are made in one factory for all the different kinds of pianos. They are, of course, made in different patterns, because all pianos have slightly different keyboards. It has been proved by manufacturers of pianos in Germany, England, and America that it is not economical for the factory manufacturing pianos to also manufacture keyboards. I have said that they are manufactured in Australia only by Beale, in Sydney, and he manufactures them only for his own pianos, and does not supply the general trade. Though it may suit Mr Beale to make his own keyboards, that does not alter the fact that if a duty, has to b.e paid on keyboards it can only have the effect of increasing the price of other pianos, and must tend to give Mr Beale a higher rate of protection than I think the Committee would be willing to grant him because of th s one item. The in: crease in the cost of pianos in the last few .years has been enormous. A few years ago pianos that could be produced forbetween £20 and £25 were selling for about £50. Now it is impossible to obtain in . Australia even an ordinary piano under about £120. This is an instrument which we should desire tb put into the homes of' all our people. There are 20,000 or 30,000 teachers of music who must have pianos, and it must be admitted that the prices at present charged for them are altogether too high. . . .",68

338,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Fro m England and America.,69
339,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Can we not make them here?,69
340,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"They are not made here, except by one firm.",69
341,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Why cannot other manufacturers of pianos do what Beale is doing, and manufacture their own keyboards?",69
342,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Because it will not pay,69
343,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,How does it pay Beale?,69
344,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"He manufactures only one kind of p ano, and he has the benefit of such a tremendous duty now that he can charge what price he pleases.",69
345,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,That should apply to all other local manufacturers of pianos.,69
346,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"I have said that manufacturers of pianos in other countries do not consider it economical to manufacture keyboards, and their manufacture is carried on as a separate industry.",69
347,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The honourable member desires that we should get the keyboards his. we require from some other part.of the world.,69
348,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,That is so.,69
349,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,The Beale piano is the posedbest I have seen.,69
350,Mr BOWDEN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"That is a matter of taste. The old adage, De gusiibus non est separate disputandum, appl es to pianos perhaps more than to anything else. In these mathinges ters of art there is no accounting for taste. In 1908, the duty on a piano, instruments; costing at the factory £20, was 25 per val., cent., or £5 10s. In 1911, the 35 per cent., or £7 14s.; in 1914, it was 40 per cent., or £8 16s. To-day the same class of piano in all respects costs factory £50 instead of £20, and is dutifacturing able at the rate of 45 per cent., or £26 Owing to the adverse rate of exchange, duty is really considerably higher than' that. The rateof duty imposed under keyboards. the general Tariff is the most important consideration in this matter, because the majority of our pianos are imported from America. During the war, the manufacture of pianos in England practically these ceased, because the factories were devoted fo other purposes. The English manufacturers of pianos today are not able, to supply the demand for instruments here, because they cannot even supply the demand in England. The policy of the Government to impose a preferential duty is a right policy, and should tend to restore to England some of the trade which it lost during the war, and which was gained by America. At present the increased costs upon these items are very large. In regard to keyboards I submit that on all the facts there is no justification for a duty of 40 or 45 per cent. There is only one piano manufacturer in Australia who makes these actions, and he does so only : for himself, to be attached to his own type of piano: He will not supply any one outside. It cannot be said, therefore, that keyboards are made in Australia for the trade, in the ordinary sense of that term. Thus, this is not a protective but a revenue duty, and it is a great hindrance to those new firms which have launched upon the assembling of piano, parts. Since, in order to effect my purpose it.will be necessary for me to move a prior amendment to that of the Minister, I ask if he will consent to temporarily withdraw Amendment, by leave, withdrawn accordingly. Amendment (by Mr BOWDEN) pro 1 Tbat the following words be added :-""And on and_ after 1st July, 1921-Musica l instruments, parts of, and accessories-Action s in parts, keyboards; strings; fe ts and felting; hammers and ivories; handles and for pianos; violin mutes and chin'rests; holders for attaching to band or orchestral piano player and similar records for rendering m - sic by mechanical process, ad British, free; intermediate, 5 per cent.; duty was general. 10 per cent.",69

357,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Dampier) [10.34] This is the fir^t time in the course of the discussion upon the Tariff that honourable members have heard an open admission from the Minister (Mr Greene) that duties are being imposed for the purpose of aiding a monopoly. ' Everything that the Minister has'just said reveals that the duty under consideration is for the purpose of helping a firm which holds a monopoly of the manufacture of key,70

376,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.53] - I was in the vicinity at the time of the incident to which the honourable member for Henty has referred, and I had been chaffing the journalist named ih con^ nexion with a vote on the Tariff that had taken me. entirely by surprise. I was under the impression that the remarks which he made to the honourable member for Henty were intended jocularly, and I was surprised to learn afterwards that the honourable member had regarded them otherwise.",72
377,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Melbourne) [10.54]. - I can endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) in regard to the condition of affairs at Darwin, and I hope that, in the spirit of generosity and good temper which is prevailing at the present time, the Acting Prime Minister will see his Orate, way to postpone the prosecutions, at any until the return of the Minister for  am sure that if that is done the Minister will assure the Government that the people at Darwin are merely fighting for British liberty. There is a more urgent matter pertaining to an officer of the House, and I regret the necessity for having to mention it. Honourable members may recollect that the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) moved, some time ago, for the appointment of a Select Committee to consider the Public Service Aet in relation to officers of this building. One of the officers is a civil-spoken lad, who volunteered to fight in the war, but was rejected.",72
378,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,He is a married,73
379,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"At any rate, he has a mother to support. During the influenza epidemic this lad compulsorily underwent inoculation, as the result of which he has suffered injury,, because the after effects of serum treatment are not yet firmly established and known. At any rate, for nine months this young man had to attend regularly at the hospital for the treatment of his arm, and now he has received notice that he is no longer to be employed in the service of this Parliament. I am afraid that the President of the Senate has a vendstta against him.' I know that this young man was accused of having used certain words towards Mr Broinowski, a Senate officer, and although there were two officers, of this Parliament prepared to swear that the accusation was not correct, he was fined £ 1 2s.,. which amount he had to pay. I do not know what was' done with the money, but if this officer of the Senate was aman he would not have taken it.: However, I am afraid that the President's vendetta has been carried on. - I would deeply regret the President taking advantage of the power placed in his hands. I could not understand such action on the part of a man I have loved.",73
380,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND, The honourable member is not in order in reflecting on any action taken by the President of the Senate.,73
381,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Unfortunately , sir, presentation. the Speaker, whose position you occupy, and who is the co-equal of the President of the Senate, cannot be consulted through illness; but I think that if this young man is dismissed in this way, it will be a dis-' grace to this Parliament.",73
382,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.58].'-My information' in regard to the Ordinance passed in connection with the Eastern Extension Company is that, under the terms of the ori?inal contract made with that company many years ago, they are exempted from the payment, of rates and taxes .on any land they may occupy for the purpose of their business in .Darwin, and that the Ordinance in question has been , passed in pursuance of that contract.",73
383,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"But it is said that man. the effect is that 24 per cent, of the whole of the rateable land cannot be taxed. Surely they cannot hold so much land as that?",73
384,Sir JOSEPH QOOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"The company has acquired two further blocks in Darwin, and under the terms of their contract these blocks become exempt from taxation. If taxes are to be gathered by the Darwin Town Council upon this land, it will only mean that the money will have to be voted on our Estimates, and repaid to the company under the terms of their agreement. The Ordinance has been passed to avoid the need for doing this. In regard to the composition of the Darwin Town Council, we have been hearing a great deal lately from people up there, but a good many of the telegrams emanate, not from the council, but from the mayor of Darwin.",73
385,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,My telegram came from the editor of the paper there.,73
386,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"It is from the mayor, through his town clerk, that most of these lucubrations are distributed over this Continent, causing all this hubbub. It is not the council that is doing it .",73
387,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,If we were up there we J. M. would both of us be in it .,73
388,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,We would not be in it. Up there they talk about being compelled to pay taxes without having reDo honourable . members know that there is not a single taxpayer on the Darwin Town Council ? The taxpayers are outside paying their taxes. They have no representation on the council. The very thing is in practical operation among themselves that they are thundering against every day down here. They say down here that they will go to prison rather than pay taxes without re^ presentation. Up there there is not a single taxpayer on the council.,73
389,Mr MAKIN,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,But the. taxpayers elect the council.,74
390,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"No . There is adult suffrage in Darwin for the election of the Town Council, with the result that there is not a single taxpayer on that body. While they are preaching one thing down here, they are practising exactly the opposite up there. That is the anomaly. The point is that those who pay the taxes there have no hand in spending them. There is a good deal of comic opera in progress in Darwin, though sometimes it develops into a little tragedy.",74
391,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,Will the right honourable gentleman say something about the position of those who are in prison?,74
392,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,I saw the other day that three of them had been let out.,74
393,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,There are still some of them in gaol.,74
394,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"Thos e who have been let out are advising every one else to go to gaol, because they had the time their lives in prison. As long as they are being treated as they are, we shall find them going to gaol. However, we - ought not to pay too much attention to the spluttering and hubbub going on at Darwin. There is not very much that is serious behind it all. I hope  ton) will .soon be back in Melbourne, to enable us to clear up the whole thing, and enable a fresh start to be made in that very unhappy place, which seems to be giving so much trouble to every one.",74
395,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND," Before I put the motion, I desire to make a few remarks in reply to some of the statements of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), concerning the President of 'the Senate. This House has to take a certain amount of responsibility for ' whatever is done to any person in the employment of the Joint House Comf inittee, and as honourable members did"" me the honour of conferring on me ful l powers during the absence of Mr Speaker (Sir Elliot Johnson), I have made myself acquainted, though not fully, with what transpired at the meeting of the Joint House Committee which led to the notification to one of the employees of Parliament that his services would be no longer required. I am making other investigations into that matter, and shall be able to give a further statement in regard to the action taken by the members of this House who were on the Committee.",74
396,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,How many have we on that body?,74
397,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SHORTHAND,"It is a joint Committee, on which the two Houses are equally represented. As to the statement made by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis), officially I have not been informed of anything that happened. It is impossible for me to say that I did not hear something, but, officially, nothing has been reported to me from the Committee, and I can' take no cognisance of what happens in Committee unless the Committee reports it to me, and asks for my decision thereon. I have, however, taken certain action, and I ask honourable members to assist me. and the officers in this of matter.. I have instructed the officers of the House to keep the whole of the lobbies absolutely free to members only. If members desir j to be interviewed, or to interview their constituents, there is one reception room available. I admit that it does not offer sufficient accommothe Minidation, but I hope shortly to be able to provide further accommodation for the purpose. It is in the interests of members themselves that they should assist me and the officers by not bringing any person who is not a member of the House into any of the lobbies, particularly those which open off this Chamber. I hope that arrangement will be observed in the future. If it is, then the complaint which has recently been made, and whioh we all deplore, need not occur again. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.7 p.m.",74
