I (have inquired into the matter, and have ascertained that there was no need to close the room; the public absence. could have beeu allowed .the usual facilities, for obtaining refreshment - But the chairman. Minister has ""power to order the closing uf the bars of refreshment rooms when troops are passing through a town, and a regu lation has been issued requiring that to be done. A justification for this regulation is that, after an inquiry into the death of a soldier, the coroner who presided spoke strongly against the former practice."" The closing of the liquor bars is necessary in the interests not only of soldiers, but also of civilians.",20
4,Mr BOYD,Unknown,At Seymour the bar is in the refreshment room.,20
5,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Still , travellers could have been supplied with refreshment, although liquor could not be served. The general regulationof the railway refreshment rooms in this State is in the hands of the Government of Victoria. Later:",20
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have been informed that, as the result of instructions received from the civil police, the refreshment room keeper, under some misapprehension, closed the doors bf the refreshment rooms absolutely to the public, instead of merely taking measures to prevent the' sale of alcohol while the troops were at the station.

CONTROL OF SHIPPING .",20
13,Mr JH CATTS,MEMBEBS OF CENTRAL WOOL,"It is stated day's Melbourne Age that Great! Britain has agreed to the appointment of an American Shipping Dictator, who w i l control all Allied shipping. Will control apply to Australian shipping?",22
14,Mr HUGHES,MEMBEBS OF CENTRAL WOOL,"I have not seen the paragraph referred to, and, in the sence of official confirmation, Queensland. clined ito accept it . In any case, such t control would be limited in two respects. Great Britain has requisitioned practically all the shipping which flies her flag, and while British legislation governs British shipping everywhere, it does not. d interfere with our jurisdiction over shipping in Australian ports. Furthermore, it does not interfere with ships interned here, or with the vessels of th© Commonwealth Government line. PRISONERS OF WAR .",22
15,Mr FINLAYSON,MEMBEBS OF CENTRAL WOOL,"The information Tasmania, - received by the Prime Minister regarding the arrangements for the exchange of Australian prisoners of war in Germany has given satisfaction to a good many RABBIT SKINS. people. Will the right! honourable gentleman now make representations to the British Government on behalf of Australian civilians who have been interned in Germany ?",22
16,Mr HUGHES,MEMBEBS OF CENTRAL WOOL,Certainly . TASMANIA NMAIL SERVICE. ' ' Mr MCWIJLLIAMS - I ask the Postmaster-General if steps have been taken to bring about the resumption of the runTasmania. ning of .the Rotomahana in the mail service between Australia and Tasmania?,22
17,Mr WEBSTER,MEMBEBS OF CENTRAL WOOL,The question should be addressed to the Minister in control of shipping. My Department is anxious for the restoration of all mail services at the earliest possible moment.,22
18,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEMBEBS OF CENTRAL WOOL,I ask the Prime . E. Minister the question that I have just L . addressed to .the Postmaster-General.,22
19,Mr HUGHES,MEMBEBS OF CENTRAL WOOL,"I do not consider the question an urgent, one, the matter to which it relates having been dealt with, . E. and all information regarding it having G. been published in the press. Every effort has been made since the outbreak of the present unfortunate (trouble LO maintain a service for mails, passengers, and cargo between Australia and Tasmania, and the in toextent to which we have succeeded has been made public in the newspapers. On Monday I saw the Premier of Tasmania, l and made arrangements with him for the that despatch of another steamer to carry cargo and passengers. It is hoped that the whole trouble will come to an end in abthe immediate future, when the present am disindifficulty will cease. NA REPATRIATION BILL . Mr J. BE. CATTS - Is ib the infen-. tion of the Government to postpone its arrangements for the repatriation of Australian soldiers until next year, or does the Government intend to finish the jsill providing for repatriation before the propoeed adjournment?",22
20,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Government intends to go on with the Bill, which it regards, not only as important, but as urgent. If necessary, we shall sit longer than was originally proposed in order to finish with it. We have to pass the Bill. PUBLIC WORKS: DEPARTMENTAL TENDERS.",23
21,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Seeing that the Minister for Works and Railways is calling for tenders and accepting contracts for public woTks, is he allowing his own Department to tender ? If not, will be allow the Department to do so in the future, in the same way as is done in some of the States ?",23
22,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I do not think that that is a business proposition. Our method is to compare the estimates of the Department with the tenders. I should not let a tender if it were much in excess of a departmental estimate. RECRUITING: PICTURE EXHIBITIONS,",23
23,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In view of the aid that the exhibition of moving pictures has given to recruiting on the plan adopted at my suggestion, I should like 'to know whether in the future these splendid exhibitions will be intrusted to Mr Herschell in order thaJtl they may be conducted with the most beneficial results. I am alludbefore him? ing to the pictures that were recently shown in this House.",23
24,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I shall submit the suggestion to the. Minister for Defence for his consideration. MEDALS FOR SOLDIERS' MOTHERS. Mr.l AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Can ithe Assistant Minister for Defence inform, the House when ibhe medals will be ready for the mothers of soldiers who have fallen the Fronti, and when they will be distriwheat buted?",23
25,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I understand that ithifl matter is being expedited, and I shall endeavour to give the exact dates to the honourable member.",23
26,Mr STORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"When the Minisber is making inquiries into the matter just mentioned, will he also ascertain whether a mother who has lost three sons will receive three medals?",23
27,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In such case a mother will get a medal, and a bar for each of the other two sons. Distinct recognition is given for each son who has done service WHEAT SLLOS.",23
28,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Does the Prime Minister anticipate that the wheat storage silos will be available for the approaching harvest?,23
29,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is one of those questions easier asked than answered. I wish I could say that ithe silos will be ready, but there has been considerable initial difficulty, both in this and other States. While I believe tha* many of the country silos will be ready, the (terminal silos most certainly will not. The question of foundations and other considerations make it impracticable to have these silos ready for the harvest. AUSTRALIAN .IMPERIAL FORCE. NON-PAYMENT OF ALLOTMENT MONEY.",23
30,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I have had brought under my notice the case of a man who' enlisted in December, 1915, and allotted 3s. a day to his relatives. Those relatives, however, have not received one single penny piece, and the man, who is at the Front, has been falsely accused of being a deserter. Will the Minister inquire into the case if the facts are laid",23
31,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If the honourable member will give me the name and number of the man, so that he may be identified, I shall have inquiries made. It seems extraordinary that the allotment has not been paid from the beginning, but some offence committed subsequently may have caused the forfeiture of the man's pay. DAMAGED WHEAT.  at ment propose to do with all the damaged which is useless for consumption and export?",23
32,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) mentioned the matter to me last week, and made a suggestion, which I asked him to reduce to writing with a view to laying it before the Wheat Board.",24
33,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is in your office now.,24
34,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is alleged that a considerable quantity of wheat is damaged and unfit for four, and will be wasted unless arrangements are made of a general character to bring about its distribution and sale. I shall place the matter before the Wheat Board, and consider what can be done. NAVA L COLLEGE. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Has the Minister for the Navy in contemplation the appointment of some one to take the place of Captain Morgan, Commandant at the Naval College? If so, will the Minister take into consideration the claims of* some Australian officers for this appointment ?",24
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"We have been in negotiation with the Imperial Government for a Commandant for the College, but with no result to date. In the meantime, the College is doing very well under the capable control of Commander Grant. PRICE OF BREAD. . Dr MALONEY - Has the Prime Minister's attention been called to the fact that difficulties are placed in the way of bakers who desire to supply their customers with bread at a fair price, but who are prevented by some ring, combine, or association from obtaining flour? the Prime Minister, when Parliament is in recess, take some action in the matter?",24
36,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"My attention has been called to a number of combinations which restrict the freedom of action of other citizens in one way or another. I have been told, and I verily believe, that a number of citizens, desirous and anxious to carry on the work of the country, have been threatened that, if they do so, something rather serious will happen. common rule which ought to be applied to all sorts and conditions of men is that every - man's freedom of action shall be limited only by those restrictions necessary for the welfare of the general community. Just precisely how far a man can be allowed to sell bread at a price less than does another who employs labour, and has to pay Wages Board rates, and who buys flour at a price fixed by the Government, is a question for argument. All I have to say is that, on the one hand, we cannot have sweated labour; and, oil the other, we cannot have bakers exploiting the people; and we have to steer between the two. I am not going to say that a baker,, if he does not employ labour, cannot produce bread cheaper than one who has to pay for labour. Everybody knows that he can. I do not propose' to say that legally a baker or a combine has any right to boycott any person or firm.",24
37,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I was alluding to the supply of flour.,24
38,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I know precisely how it operates. These things are as impalpable as a shadow. They are there, very much there, but one cannot get hold of them. This is not the first case that I have seen nor the first that the honourable member has seen. Later",24
39,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Will the Prime Minister prevent the holders of. flour from refusing to sell flour to any person who tenders the price fixed by the Government for the selling price of the commodity ?,24
40,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"We cannot compel people to sell things if they do not wish to do so. I am a little astonished at the honourable member putting this question to me, because he knows perfectly well what the law is. The law says that a person-must not charge more than suchWill and-such a price, but it does not say that he must sell to Jones, Smith, or Robinson; he may,sell to Jones, or he may refuse to sell to him. Do not members of unions exercise the same right? Is there not now a spirited controversy in the Courts as to what constitutes a strikewhether it is a mere cessation of work, or whether it is the right of any free man to decline to "" turn to "" ? These are very interesting psychological discussions, and The they fall into the same class as the honourable gentleman's question relating to flour. . Mr JH CATTS - As in one case the Ministry have set up a Government agency to provide labour where it is refused, will the Prime Minister do the same thing in regard to flour?",24
41,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS," I cannot allow this subject to be pursued any further. This is an in stance illustrative of irregular procedure. noticeAn answer to a question is immediately used as a pretext for the asking of other questions on the same subject, thus in it ating an irregular debate by means of a the series of questions and answers, without notice, which is not allowable under the privilege of asking questions. NA  comments in this House upon the condi- "" tion of the Richmond Main coal mine, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen the report submitted to Mr low :Fuller, the Acting Premier of New South Wales, in which it is stated is the most up-to-date in the southern hemisphere, and that special precautions character. are taken to insure the safety of the men employed in it?",25
42,Mr HUGHES,EICHMONDMAIN COAL MINE,"I am utterly unable to answer that question. I know less, perhaps, of coal mines than any other human noticebeing does, and I cannotl say whether the upon Richmond Main mine is safe for working in or nof. I understand that the Governmantles ment of New South Wales, ih making a Holland statement through the head of the Minisstill try to the effect that it ie a safe mine, is matter? acting upon expert opinion from qualified to express it . The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) expressed an opinion to the contrary. am unable to judge between the two. NORTHERN TERRITORY.",25
43,Mr MATHEWS,EICHMONDMAIN COAL MINE,"H as the Minister for Home and Territories any informaGovernment tion to give me in regard to the question I put to him concerning the delay of tions? twelve days which occurred in the delivery 'of a lettergram which I sent Darwin ? ' Mr Glynn - A e I have mentioned of 8. - previously, the control of is in the hands of the Defence Department, and the Administrator of Northern Territory is not in a position interfere with it . I asked the honourable member to furnish me with a copy of the low :lettergram in order to enable me to find out where the delay occurred. If he does so, I shall have the necessary inquiries made. LOADED INVOICES.",25
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,EICHMONDMAIN COAL MINE,"for Mr KELLY ) asked - the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon 1. If , as stated, the Customs Department is "" loading"" invoices for dynamo electric mai - chinery imported from the United Kingdom to extent of the difference between the export price charged to the Australian importer and the home consumption price charged to domestic buyers, why are "" loadings "" effected in cases where no home consumption exists, such as special orders for specially designed and . constructed plant, t t t 2. Will he lay upon the Table of the House copies of the instructions under which all loading "" of imoices of British goods is made?",25
45,Mr JENSEN,EICHMONDMAIN COAL MINE,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l1. In order io carry out the requirements of that this mine the Customs Act. 2. Tliese instructions are of a confidential GAS MANTLES .,25
46,Mr MASSYGREENE,EICHMONDMAIN COAL MINE,"for Mr KELLY ) asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon 1. Does the New Zealand Government agent, whose report, as stated, the Minister has accepted the invoices of incandescent gas imported into the Commonwealth from as genuine as regards origin and price, advise the Australian Government in this 2. Docs the investigation of the above agent those extend to each consignment? 3. If not, what other steps are taken to test has the bona fides of the said invoices? I 4. Is he aware that many gas mantles have been imported during the last three years in plain boxes, with the country of origin unstamped thereon? CENSORSHIP . 5. Is it a fact that, in June last, incandescent gas mantles imported into England from Holland were condemned as of enemy origin? 6. Did the special agent of the New Zealand inform the Commonwealth Government of this or other similar condemna7. How many gas mantles have been condemned as of enemy origin during the years to 1914-15, 1916-16, and (if ascertainable) 1916-17? Is it true that the imports from Holland gas mantles increased from 5,832 in 1915 to the censorship 178,538 in 1916? 9. What absolute guarantee has he that these the lamps were not of German origin? to - Mr JENSEN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l 1 and 2. The reference to the New Zealand Government agent is, apparently, taken from an answer given by me on the 24th August last, relating to metal filament lamps. 3. No mantles from Holland are arriving at present. If any shipment should arrive, it would, in accordance with the practice mentioned in an aswer given by me on the 7th instant, be detained, and the whole of the circumstances reported to the Imperial authorities for investigation and advice. 4. The law docs not require that the name of the country of origin shall be marked on the containers. The proportion of the total imports that have arrived in plain boxes is, however, small. 5. The Department has no official information on the matter. 6. No. 7. None. 8. The figures are: 1914-15, 27,912; 1915-16, 810,210. 9. See No. 3. MAI LS VIA AMERICA.  General, upon notice I.

If letters are not so endorsed, are they tained until a mail goes to England vid Suez or the Cape? 3. What letters have been so detained, and for what length of time?",25
47,Mr WEBSTER,EICHMONDMAIN COAL MINE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No. 2. Not necessarily. .Letters are forwarded by first suitable opportunity offering. 3. See answer to No. 2. NA  asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. In cases of charges of disloyalty made against enemy subjects or enemy sympathizers, will the Government consider favourably means of protecting persons who are prepared to give evidence in support of such charges, but who have reasonable grounds for fearing JOHN FORREST)injurious consequences to themselves if their names, or the fact of their having given mation, should become known? 2. Will the Government, in cases of the sort suggested, if such persons make a statutory declaration, consider the propriety of having the facts verified by a responsible inquiry out the names of such persons being disclosed, 1917or their being compelled to give viv& voce evidence in the case of a departmental appeal? 3. Have any cases pome under the notice of the Government where, in districts largely occupied by German sympathizers, persons are, under the existing procedure, afraid to give information owing to the risk of subsequent victimization?",26
48,Mr HUGHES,INFORMERS AGAINST ENEMY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1 and 2. In such cases, the source of any information supplied by the Government is not disclosed. 3. I am not aware of any. NA SOLDIERS.  upon notice Whether he has received any answers to the inquiries which he promised to the honourable member for Maranoa on the 23rd August last he would make re the treatment of the sick returned soldiers who had to go to the Launceston Hospital for treatment, and had to pay their own fares?

50,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Yarra) [11.80] - The Treasurer announced his intention of adding to the resolution a new proposal to take 10 per cent, of any money won in a lottery. This Parliament, hy another Act, made lotteries illegal, and the Postal Department will not even transmit correspondence that is connected with a lottery.",27
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Incom e tax is paid now on money won in lotteries.,27
52,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"B y one Act we have made lotteries illegal, and now the Government propose to take money from what may be described as a tainted source. Something we have done with one hand we are asked to undo with the other. The Government's attitude on this matter is most inconsistent.",27
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We collect taxation on lottery money now, and this will provide a simple nxeans of collection.",27
54,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I wish to direct my remarks principally to division F of the resolution. The Treasurer informed us that, whilst this special tax is the policy of the Government, he personally is keenly in favour of it, and that though at times a Minister may disagree from a proposal which has been adopted by Cabinet, he, in this instance, is a strong advocate of the policy which the Government have submitted to the Committee. very interesting to compare the Treasurer's enthusiasm in ' regard to this tax with his wobbly attitude in regard to the war-time profits tax, and I judge that, in connection with the latter impost, he, as Treasurer, was advocating something agreed to by the Government, but not favoured by him personally. In connection with the war-time profits tax, the Treasurer did. not know where he was until the Caucus met upstairs to decide what the Government should do.",27
55,The CHAIEM AN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED, The honourable member's remarks are not pertinent to the proposal now before the Committee.,27
56,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am comparing the attitude of the Treasurer in regard to this new tax with his attitude on another measure. The right honourable gentleman informed the Committee that the tax is to apply to every man who was unmarried on the 1st July of this year, and to every widower without children. . Presumably,, a Bill will be introduced to legalize this proposal.",27
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,What we are now dealing with will form the schedule of a Bill to be introduced later.,27
58,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The effect of the Government's proposal is that, even if a man has married since the 1st July, he will still be liable to pay this tax in years to come. I know of no tax that will be more difficult to collect. The earnings of many men in the community have not averaged 30s. per week throughout the ,year, and they are to be asked to pay about 4s. per week in taxation. No more iniquitous proposal was ever submitted to Parliament. The Treasurer quoted a passage in which the Prime 'Minister said that the Government intended to accept the verdict of the people on the 28th October last, and appealed to the patriotism of the people to uphold the honour of Australia by maintaining the Australian Divisions at their f u ll fighting strength by voluntary enlistment. If the Government had this taxation in mind when they discussed the points of the Prime Minister's policy speech, why did they not candidly tell the people that it was proposed to impose a special tax of 10 per cent., with a minimum of £10, on every unmarried man between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five? The TreaI t is surer states that the Government are carrying out their election^pledges, but we know that if the Government had an-, nounced this tax as portion of their policy, many honourable members who are now on the Government side would not have been elected.

60,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,No good would be done to anybody if we did withdraw it.,27

65,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Then the Government and their supporters have gone back on the promise of the Prime Minister that' their party would accept the verdict of the people on conscription, as given on 28th October last. I say deliberately, that this is an evasion of the promise to accept that verdict. The Treasurer himself said that this tax was brought forward as a means of compelling men to enlist.",28
66,Sir JOHNFOKEEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I did not say that. The honourable member has my speech before him ; why does he misquote me?,28
67,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I have no desire to misquote the right honourable gentleman. In bringing forward this proposal last night he saidThe Government, is actuated by two principal reasons in Bringing forwafd this proposal. The first is that we believe it will stimulate and increase recruiting What does that mean ?",28
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Rea d on.,28
69,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I shall do so. This is the bludgeon thaltJ the Government intend to use to stimulate recruiting. It is not "" a transparent bludgeon"" like that referred to by the honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catits) lastl week in a statement which was attributed to me by the Argus-which , by the way, was only another sample of Argus misreportingbut something more substantial.",28
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The member should complete the sentence that he quoted from my speech unless he desires to misrepresent me.,28
71,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I have no desire to misquote the right honourable gentleman. He saidThe Government is actuated by two principal reasons in bringing forward this proposal. The first is that we believe it will stimulate and increase recruiting, not so much, we hope, by the fear of having to pay the tax, as by bringing prominently, before those who have not yet volunteered for service what is not only their duty to their country, but their paramount duty to themselves. The principal reason for this tax is put in the very forefront of that statement.",28
72,Mr HEITMANN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Does the honourable member think that the tax will stimulate recruiting?,28
73,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I believe iti will have the opposite effect.,28
74,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Then that does away with the Opposition cry that this is a form of economic conscription.,28
75,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I take the view that there .will be such an outcry against this form of taxation that the Government will be ashamed of having introduced it . The possible effect of the tax cannot in any way alter its character. Here is a proposal, one reason for which, according to the Treasurer, is that it will stimulate recruiting.",28
76,Mr HEITMANN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable member might just as well say that the maternity bonus stimulates the birthrate.,28
77,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It is all very well for some honourable members to sneer at what they choose to term the maternity "" bonus,"" but which I prefer to speak of as the maternity grant. That is its proper title.",28
78,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable member would not be sorry if this tax did stimulate recruiting.,28
79,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I would not. I have done my best to stimulate recruiting. ^ Mr LECKIE - I know that the honourable member has.,28
80,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I did my best to encourage recruiting until a crowd, both in side and outside the Melbourne Town H a l ; howled me down. As I said at the time, those who attacked me in that way were a lot of dingoes, prepared only to hunt in packs. I certainly hope this tax will have the effect of stimulating recruiting, I should like the Treasurer to answer honourable my question as to what w i ll be 'the position of men who have married since 1st July this year?",28
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,They will have to pay this tax.,28
82,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Bot h in respect of this year and succeeding years ?,28
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,This is not like a law of the Medes and Persians. We have to pass an Income Tax Bill every year.,28
84,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I have heard that said in connection with every income tax proposal, and I am not unmindful of the way in which legislation of this sort is put through. We are called upon to deal with this proposal, the Defence Bill , the Repatriation Bill , and the Senate's amendment in the Railway Bill by Friday next. This is one of the most important taxation proposals ever submitted to this House, providing, as it does, for a system of taxation such as does not exist, so far as I am aware, in any other civilized country.",28
85,Mr WEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It is a class tax.,29
86,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It is purely class taxation designed to penalize some people who, in the opinion of the Government, have not done the right thing. On the occasion of the conscription referendum the Government announced that "" only sons "" would be exempt. There is no such exemption from this tax.",29
87,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,That was in connection with a proposal to conscript men for active service. This has nothing to do with the sending of any man to the Front.,29
88,Mr COBSEB,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It is for repatriation purposes.,29
89,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"When a wealth levy was proposed' to raise funds for repatriation purposes, a meeting was held in Western Australia, at which an honourable member of this House promised to give £ 1 0 0 to a f u n d to defeat that impost.",29
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,That is absolutely incorrect.,29
91,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I did not say it was the right honourable gentleman who made that offer.,29
92,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The member knows that he was referring to me. He is very unfair. His statement is unjust and absolutely untrue.,29
93,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED, The Treasurer must withdraw that remark.,29

96,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I withdraw it shall not further interrupt the honourable member.,29
97,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I am much obliged to the Treasurer.  proposal dropped out of the honourable member's own party manifesto?,29
98,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It was not dropped out of the policy of the Labour Government while I was a member of it . The CHAIRMAN.'-Order ! That is not the question before the-Chair.,29
99,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Treasurer estimates that this tax will yield only £500,000 per annum, and we are asked to accept it because the money so raised is to be used for repatriation purposes.",29
100,Mr CORSEB,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,That shows the equity of the tax.,29
101,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Did any question of equity affect Ministerial supporters when they were dealing with the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill ? The estimated revenue of £500,000 to be derived from this tax is to be ear-marked, we are told, for repatriation purposes, and, that being so, we' may reasonably assume that it is the intention of the Government to continue it for more than one year. Does anyone say that it will be fair - to tax, for as long as the repatriation f u n d may be in existence, every man who happened to be unmarried and between the. ages of twenty-one and forty-five on the 1st July last'? What will repatriation cost the Commonwealth ? An estimate of £22,000,000 has been made. How far w i ll the £500,000 that is to be got from this tax go to provide that amount? Every one knows that the repatriation schemes will cost more than £22.000,000; they will cost countless millions. Honourable members cannot justify their action honourable in voting for this proposal by saying that they did so because the tax was intended to provide for repatriation. They know that the intention is to get at some of those whom they think did not vote for them at the last election. This is a vindictive proposal, intended to punish certain persons for not doing as the party opposite thinks they should have done. When conscription was proposed last October, only sons, among others, were exempt from service. Why are they not exempt from the proposed tax ? Certain persons engaged in farming and shearing were also exempted. Why are they not , and exempt now? Persons likely to suffer serious Eardships owing to domestic find financial obligations, sole remaining sons the sole support of aged parents or of a widowed mother, or of orphaA brothers and sisters, the sons of a family of which half the members had enlisted, ministers of religion, and others were exempted under the conscription proposals, but they are not exempted fro m this tax. The only persons who are exempted now are the sole remaining sons of families of which all the other brothers have been on active service outside Australia. proposal goes back on the Bendigo policy speech and on the conscription proposal. Every honourable member must know of cases in which sons have been compelled to stay in Australia to support their parents. I know of men who are single and are supporting younger brothers and sisters or parents. In some ,cases the parents are entitled to apply for old-age pensions, but the sons prefer to support them. Why should we tax such men in the way proposed ?",29
102,Mr HEITMANN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,They are not worse off than married men with families who have gone to the war. 1,30
103,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It has never been proposed to compel married men to go to the war, although many have volunteered. As many married men have gone to the war from my electorate as from that of the honourable member. W it h in a hundred yards of where I live is the home of a married man with eleven children, eight of whom are under sixteen years of age. who, with one of his sons, has gone to the war. I do not say that that is right. This is a class tax. It is proposed in defiance of the decision of the people, and it will be difficult to collect. not conceive of any that would be more difficult to collect. Many single men move frequently from place to place. Treasurer proposed to tax all single men of every age, the proposal would be different. By confining the tax to those eligible for active service, he shows that his sole purpose is to force men to enlist.",30
104,Mr COESEK,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,He has denied that.,30
105,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I have quoted his own words. He gave that as the first and principal object of the tax. He says that it will , stimulate recruiting. ",30
106,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It will set young Australia against the Government.,30
107,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I feel that that will be its effect. I trust that the proposal will be defeated, and, failing its defeat, that it will be amended in such a way as .to exempt all who were exempted under the conscription proposals. thing else would be unfair. The Government, not. content with breaking its pledges in regard to war profits taxation, is again breaking its election promises by imposing a class tax of a vindictive character in order to punish individuals for not having done something which Ministers think they should have done. This Mr OHARLTON [11.58] - I think that the country will be greatly surprised by the proposal of the Government, in view of the fact that during the recent electoral campaign no word was said about it on the public platform. To my mind, the effect of this proposal will be disastrous, and it will nob yield the revenue which is estimated. Once it is put into operation, the public will quickly show its resentment against what is obviously class legislation. Some honourable members may think that to tax single men between ibhe ages of twenty-one and forty-five years, and widowers between those ages who are without dependants, may induce young fellows to enlist, but I assert that the effect will be to make the public antagonistic to recruiting. Y o u cannot drive young Australians, though you may lead them. Do the fair thing by them, and they will respond; but endeavour to bludgeon them, and they wil l resent it and their parents will resent it . A large number of those who voted for Ministerial candidates will resent this proposal as keenly as any other electors. None of them anticipated such legislation. Honourable members should take into' conI can- sideration some of the effects of this uncalled for and ill-considered proposal. H a d the Mr WEST - Unjustifiabl e proposal.",30
108,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"No one can justif y it. In Australia there are hundreds of young men who are articled to some profession. Probably many of them wil l enlist when they have served their articles. There are young men serving articles in every town in the Commonwealth. They do not enlist when in articles because no allowance is made for the time they are absent, and because of the difficulty of adapting themselves to study oh return. In many instances these young men are the sons of fathers who, though poor, are careful, and are doing what they can to give boys who have shown marked ability the chance to enter professions. The fathers have paid the necessary premiums, and are Any- keeping their sons going while they are serving their articles. The sons are not earning more than 10s. or 15s. a week, and many of them will not be out of their articles until they are twenty-five years of"" age."" They know that if they went to the war before they were through their articles their fathers would not be able to do anything for them later. Therefore, tliey wish, to get out of their articles before enlisting. The Government proposes to tax young fellows like this £10,- a year. Is that fair? Mr Mc WILLIAMS - Thos e who - have gone to the Front have made greater sac",30
109,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is not a reason for penalizing those who are here. This Parliament should not legislate to the detriment of persons such ae those to whom I refer. Then we have to consider that there are many callings in Australia in which the work is irregular, providing employment for, perhaps, only three days a week. In coal mining, for instance, .there are men, such as wheelers, whose earnings are 10s. a day, and, with four days available, this means £104 per annum. Is it likely that these men will continue to earnup to £ 1 0 0 if they are to bei called upon to pay this, tax ? The chances are that, instead of speeding up and helping the work of production, we shall bring about a system under which men will determine to earn only a certain amount, and thus avoid this imposition.",31
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"' M e n must be poor lot of "" rotters "" to do that sort thing.",31
111,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We have to face the facts as they are, and, if this Bill be passed, the G'overnment will 'laiter on realise that what I am now saying 3>S Sftt*ivin n is true.",31
112,Sir JOHN FOBREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Me n with such i comes have to pay a tax now.,31
113,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"In any case, would be very dimcult to get £ 1 0 from a man who does not possess it ; and know that a young fellow with £ 1 0 0 a year, who has to pay, perhaps, 25s. a week for his board and lodging, and has to provide clothing and so forth , cannot £10 in a year. What are ment going to do with such a man?",31
114,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Sen d him to gaol!,31
115,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,There is nothing else for it .,31
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,We cannot do that. ' Mr Charlton - The Government will have to do something. man with £100 a' year has much dim-' culty in living decently at the present time.,31
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Such a man has pay an income tax under the present,31
118,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"There is no doubt that this Bill , if passed, will create siderable outside opposition to the Government and their supporters. The Treasurer tells us that this Bill does not mean conscription in any shape or form, but I think he would have great difficulty in making the general public believe that it is not really economic conscription.",31
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It is not, for all that!",31
120,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Bill specially applies to men between twenty-one and forty-five who have not enlisted,- and who, according to the Treasurer, ought to go to the Pront. Why apply this tax only to eligible men if it is not for the purpose of or four economic conscription ? We cannot escape the logic of facts. The Treasurer himself tells us that the Bill is to stimulate recruiting ; and if recruiting is to be stimulated by enforcing enlistment, what does it mean but economic conscription? The right honourable gentleman never at any time during the election campaign told the people that if he were returned he in tended to introduce a tax of this kind. No leader or any person of authority amongst honourable members opposite foreshadowedsuch a measure to the electors, a and I venture to say that had they done of so they would not he where they are today in this House. This one measure is sufficient to damn the Government in the eyes of the people for having broken f a it h .",31
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,That is only an,31
122,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That may be, but n - I believe that the futur e will prove the assertion to be correct. I feel sure that it there are many of the Government supporters who do not approve of legislation we of this kind, and on the simple ground that it is unfair. If it is necessary to repatriate our soldiers, and to impose taxation for that purpose, why does the Treasave surer not take ^he wealth of those people the Governwho can afford to give it ?",31
123,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We are taking it , not by confiscation, but by taxation.",31
124,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If that is the position of the right honourable gentleman, I point out to him that h e can tax incomes to an extent sufficient to raise the necesA single sary money, and, therefore, there will be no confiscation. The Treasurer is the very man who has said that, so far as he is concerned, he does not believe in imposto ing any more direct taxation on thei law. wealthy people of this country. Now, however, he proposes to tax the poorest conclass in the community, who are struggling for their livelihood; and all for the pose of bringing in conscription without referring the question to the people. Government and their supporters, when before the country, promised that confrom scription would not be introduced unless the people were consulted; and the people accepted the assurance. Sir JOHN .POKBEST - And we are going find to adhere to the pledge we gave ",31
125,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I contend that this Bill is. a breach of the pledge Government gave, because it affects the poor people, while allowing the rich people to go scot-free.",32
126,Mr FALKINER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Do you not think that larly benefited. the rich people will have to "" stump up "" eventually?",32
127,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I say that eventually the great masses of the people of will Australia will have to carry the whole load in connection with the war. A GoPersonally,. vernment capable of rising to the occaculty sion, and especially a Government which has advocated conscription, should realise that it is necessary to call upon the wealthy of the country to pay for war. If they conscript manhood, ought to conscript wealth, instead of piling up a huge national debt. I have said that previously, both here and elsewhere, that this war is a national crisis, and at such a time we not only ought to call upon men to sacrifice their lives, but ought to that the wealth and property of the counplacard try, for the protection of which the are fighting, pays its proper share of cost. But when I put that position, the Treasurer is the first to resent it.",32
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I do not believe robbery or confiscation.,32
129,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Then it is not they "" robbery "" to take £10 a year from a man winning the war? who earns £100, but it is "" robbery"" to' take away half or three-parts of the come of a man who earns up to £4,000 a' surely? year? Legislation of this kind cannot be tolerated by any fair-minded person, matter. and if the Government persist with it they will find themselves faced with consideryou done? able trouble in the collection of the tax. The Commonwealth Parliament have declared lotteries illegal, and have denied the use of the Post Oflice in their promovernment tion. Yet the Government propose now to ask those who have benefited by something that is illegal to pay in taxation per cent, of their gains for the purpose of war purassisting the repatriation scheme. I venture to say that a big section of the comThe munity will resent any attempt on the part of the Government to get money lotteries for repatriation or any other purpose connected with the war. It means, if we once enter on this plan, \ that in the near future we may expect to Government lotteries instituted.

130,Mr WALLACE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The Post Oflice will not carry lottery communications.,32

I can see nothing but diffiin the administration of this Bill. We are . all anxious that there should be more recruits, but I do not think that a measure of this kind will assist recruiting. the Mr MCWILLIAMS - Then where is the they economic conscription?",32
132,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"My contention is the Bill is intended to apply economic conscription, and it is because honourable members opposite cannot see the force of their own legislation that they are blindly see following the Government. This is a to inform the public that the Gomen vernment have done something towards the winning the war.

145,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I have no tame for such innuendoes. They are too frequently heard in rlhis chamber. It seems to me that, because there has been a difference of opinion amongst honourable members, and certain gentlemen have changed their positions in the House, great, bitterness has been engendered, but that does not help us, and ib would be better if honourable members would refrain from many of the interjections which are thrown out for the purpose of giving insult:",33
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,What about honourable member's jeering about winning the war?,33
147,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I am perfectly titled to allude to that matter as it is part of the Government's policy.,33
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The member claims that it is part of the Opposition's policy.,33
149,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"So it is, but there is a difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Government think that this Bill will help to win the war, though it was never placed before the people, and they do not know that the people approve of it . On the other hand, I say that it will be detrimental to winning the war. There are certain young men who are articled in the legal profession, and are desirous of enlisting immediately they pass their examinations. If we tax them to Ihe extent of £ 1 0 per annum, shall we get them to enlist when they have finished their articles? That is only one of many difficulties which will be encountered in applying this tax. I oppose the Bill because I realise that it. will not help to win the war. I have are you no desire to say one word against the policy of the Government more than I am . entitled to say, but I contend that this Bill will not give effect to the decision arrived at almost unanimously at the recent elections.",33
150,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"At any rate, by a large working majority. If the Government had submitted this proposal to the people, they would be justified in bringing down a Bill to carry iti into effect, but the people knew nothing about it ; it has been brought forward unexpectedly, and it will have the opposite effect to what the Government announced as their policy when they were before the electors. 1 consider that Ministers should give the matter further consideration. I am not in a position to claim that they have not given it mature consideration, but there are times in the history of Cabinets, as well as individuals, when hasty conclusions are arrived at, and certain measures are put forward in order to secure a direct cut to the object sought after. Possibly the Government, seeing that certain young men have not enlisted or done their duty to the country, have come to the conclusion that a tax will compel them to do so. On the surface of it the proposition may be all right from the point the of view of the Government, but there is another side to the question. Consideration must be given to the effect that such en- a tax will have in practice. In my opinion, it will work no good for Australia. In fact, I think iti will be bad for honourable Australia. We are all desirous of seeing these young men volunteer to go to the Front if they can possibly get away, but the effect of this Bill will be to sour them. We can hardly find any man in an industrial centre with £ 1 0 to spare at the end of a year. The young fellow who earns £100 in a year has to spend the whole of his earnings in order to keep himself decently. I would like to know how the Government propose to collect the tax from those who have not the money with which to pay it . , If the legislation is passed, it will be necessary to take measures to enforce the collectipn of the tax. What will those measures be? Will steps be taken to prosecute those - who cannot afford to pay the tax ?",33
151,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,They will be put in gaol.,33
152,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"This Bill is quite unnecessary. It will not attain jecb that Ministers have in view, that helping to win the war. It s effect will - just the reverse. Among the were sent into camp before the military service referendum' there were hundreds who were examined and found medically shape .or form. unfit. Yet they all come under Bill.",34
153,Mr HEITMANN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Not if they are cally unfit.,34
154,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,They will be reGovernment quired to make a fresh application under the provisions of this Bill .,34
155,Mr HEITMANN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,There will be no great hardship entailed in securing a rejection form ,34
156,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I know that there will be no hardship attached to it , but unless persons already rejected are agaiu rejected they will be called upon to this tax. There is no escape for them under the for m in which the B i l drafted. All these matters are of consideration. The Minister f Navy says that this is not a party quespart tion. If he will relieve honourable bers on his side from making it a party question",34
157,Mr WISE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It i will not be a party question ->' orable member's time has expired,",34
158,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am glad to hear the honourable member say that. I have always found that he is one to stand to his opinions. If other honourable bers take the same view and apply their thoughts to the Bill and give considerathe tion to its possible effect, th© Government forth in this Bill . will not carry the measure. Most of arguments we have heard are strongly against the Bill . The only point favour of it is the sentimental one endeavouring to force young men to go to the Pront. I hold that the' B i l have the opposite effect, and if we not force men to go by this method, there against it . is nothing to be gained by passing the Bill. I have had some dealings w industrial section of our communityand I think what applies to them applies to all sections. My experience is that , we are reasonable with them and put ward fair proposals, we can get them to respond, but that they resent any ento deavour to bring pressure to bear on them. Not only will the young fellows resent this tax; parents also will resent it . If the kind.

Thousands of people in men who Australia who opposed conscription voted for the Government, believing that they would not attempt to enforce it in any If those people were this given the opportunity of dealing with a measure of this description and the Gomedivernment which brings ib forward, they would reject the proposal and deprive the of the support given to it at the recent election. In the Hunter district conscription was turned down by a majority of two to one, yet the Nationalist, candidates for the Senate scored a majority, showing that there were thousands of votes against conscription which were afterwards given to the Nationalist Government on the assurance that if the Nationalists were returned to power they pay would not introduce conscription without referring the matter to the people again. l is For that reason I venture to say that if worthy this Bill were placed before the people o r the they would interpret it as an,effort on the of the Government to bring in economemmic conscription or as an effort to bring pressure to bear for the purpose of forcing young men to enlist.",34

If it is a party question, then I regret that I have oppose my party on the matter. I gave no pledge to my constituents that would necessitate my voting for a measure of this The first thing that excites my suspicion is the fact that the Bill starts by announcing that it is a tax upon incomes, whereas subdivision F proposes that certain classes of men are to be taxed whether they have incomes or not. Outstanding fact that colours all my views on any taxation proposals coming from the Government is the fact that over 300,000 men have gone from Australia to the Front, giving up all that ithey hold - dear here, leaving itheir country and their friends and going to the seat of war and risking death for the sake of their country. From my point of .view every man who does not go to the Front, for whatever reason, should pay instead. My point in regard to this Bill is that it cannot be contended that it is a bond fide measure for raising funds for the purpose of repatriation or anything else. OPPOSITION MEMBEBS - Hear , hear!",34
163,Sir JOHN FOBREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Se e where the plause come from.,35
164,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I do not care where it comes from. I am expressing my own views, and my reading of the Bill to the conclusion that it proposes a penal» tax pure and simple. It is a tax for purpose of punishing men who, in the opinion of the Government, should have gone to the Front, but have stayed at home. We have only to read the exempabsolve tions to be sure that the tax is penal in intent and effect. Of course those men who have gone to the Front or who preparing to go are exempt. But the Government then propose that those since the 1st of January of this year have endeavoured to enlist but have been rejected purely on the ground of physical unfitness shall not be called upon to this tax. Why should such men be exbe a penal tax. empt? If the object of the Government is merely to raise money for the purpose of repatriating our soldiers, why those who are anxious to go to the war, but because of physical unfitness do so, be allowed to go scot-free? I see no justification for such an exemption. On the contrary, I should say that who had testified his willingness to go to the Front, but was not accepted, would surer's be only too glad to make a financial tribution instead.",35
165,Mr STORY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Would that argument apply to men over the age of forty-five years?,35
166,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"My view is that there should be no age limit at all. If our object is to raise money for repatriation purposes it does not matter what the age of a man is, or whether or not he is physically incapable of active service. A One man who is physically incapable of serving at the Front may be physically capable of making a very' handsome income. He may be a bachelor earning a large income, but simply because he has offered for active service abroad he is to be exempt. Compare the cases of two bachelors, aged 45 and 46 years respectively, and both without dependants. The man who is only 45 is to be compelled to pay at least £10 in taxation, whilst the man of 46 who may be entirely opposed to the war and using all his influence to prevent men from going to the Front, is to pay nothing. If our object is to raise funds and lay the burden of taxation on those best able to bear it, let us wipe out the age limit altoapgether and make every man who has not gone to the Front liable to the tax.",35
167,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Will the honourable leads me member support that proposal ?,35
168,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I will. The next the man exempted is one who, notwithstanding that he has not endeavoured to enlist, is obviously unfit for any naval or military service. Why should the Government such a man of the responsibility of contributing to a fund for the repatriation of men who have gone to the Front? are There are in the community many men occupying splendid positions and making who handsome incomes, and who are physically unfit to fight. Their very unfitness for active service affords a greater reason why they should pay this tax, unless, pay of course, the Government admit this to",35
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable should member may call it what he likes.,35
170,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I say that, in effect, cannot it is a penal tax.",35
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The physically fit men must pay for the repatriation of a man those who have gone to the war.,35
172,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Fro m the Treapoint of view, if this is a penal tax. conthe exemptions are perfectly justified.",35
173,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Every compulsion to pay is penal.,35
174,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I do not think it is. Many men who cannot go to the Front will be only too glad to pay, and will come to the Treasurer and say, ""Why are you exempting me? I am anxious to serve my country, and as I am physiother cally unfit to render service by fighting, wish to do it by paying.""",35
175,Sir JOHN POKBEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The reason I for the tax is perfectly straightforward.,36
176,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Treasurer said that the tax is not to force eligible persons to go to the war, but to compel those who away. have not gone to assist in the repatriation of the men at the Pront. This tax will may be true, but the principle is not fair. not do that. It will compel only some of those who have not gone to pay, and I object to selecting a certain section of the people to make this special contribuor tion. In view of the fact that when the people of Australia were appealed to referendum they refused to sanction the principle of compulsion, a man who demother clines to go tlo the war is acting quite within his right, and we ought nob to education. punish him for exercising that right.",36

179,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,We say that those who are not physically unfit and have failed to volunteer shall pay a special,36
180,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That provision makes this tax obviously a penal one. I am. an out-and-out conscriptionist, and advocated the cause of conscription on the public platform, but I abide by the dehonorable cision of the people. I shall not be a party to the introduction of conscription by a side wind, and taking a course which is equivalent to endeavouring to force to go to the Front, or, alternatively, pay for remaining at home. I agree with the honourable members who have argued that if we desire to enlist more is not the way to do it. There is still some sense of honour in the men have remained in Australia, and there is a method of appeal that will secure a response if it is only applied the right way. We promised the last man exemptions. and the last shilling, and I am afraid there will be a good deal of competition for the distinction of being the last man to go to the war. Another equally absurd provision is exemption of the man all of whose is brothers have gone to the Front. Why should a man whose brothers are fighting be exempt from paying a contribution to the repatriation of those brothers and men. In one house there may be I two sons, one of whom has gone to the Front, while the other remains at home gave and makes a handsome income. He will pay no tax.",36

I am unable to understand why policemen are to be exempt.",36
189,Sir JOHN PORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,They are exempt under the Defence Act.,37

194,Mr MAXWELL,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Treasurer seems to have resolved to introduce this penal provision in an income tax Bill , and he has referred to the Defence Act to find out the conditions of eligibility. He has then decided that every man who can comply with the conditions of eligibility, but has not volunteered for active service, shall pay a special tax, whether he has any income or not.",37

This is the first occasion on - which I have been able to screw up my courage to address honourable members. .I am painfully conscious of my newness here, for, although I am old in years, I am young in experience of this House, and i ' a m exceedingly obliged to honourable members for the attention they have given to me - at the Government,",37

If ever a clean knock-out blow was given to. any Bill the honourable member has just administered one ",37
200,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"P o e try is all very well in its place, but when we have to deal with the practical things of l if e , the mere spinning of phrases will not help us. In October last the people were invited to adopt the principle of compulsory m i l i already tary service beyond the seas. That proposal they turned down. The electors said that Australia was prepared to do her best by voluntary methods to assist in bringing the war to a successful conclusion ; that she was prepared to assist with her inan power, on a voluntary basis, and exempt financially, to the best of her ability. The implication was that the Government' should not by any side wind attempt to introduce compulsion, or impose conditions which the people had thus decided should not be imposed. Under this proposal, however, the Government say that every eligible who has not enlisted or attempted to do so shall pay a penalty of £10, irrespective of whether he has earned that amount or not during the year. On the other hand, they say to those who have a fair banking account, "" Y o u can buy yourselves out of military service."" If the Treasurer will look closely at this pay proposition",37
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I should never see it from the honourable member's point of view, even if I did look closely into it .",37
202,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Treasurer will recognise that we have here a proposal to revive the old and rotten principle of m i l i tarism in Great Britain , under which men were able to purchase commissions or to buy themselves out of the A r m y.

203,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,That is not r i g h t ; there is no question of gaoling.,37
204,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Does the Treasurer suggest that a man who is' not prepared to pay this tax will be able to snap his fingers and that the authorities will be unable to do anything with him? The right honourable gentleman cannot convince me that there will be no penalty in such circumstances.,37

206,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"And if he has no wages to be garnisheed  nishee "" him.",37
207,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is the point. He will either have to get into khaki or go to gaol. The Treasurer has said that this is not a measure to force men into khaki or to introduce conscription by a side wind, but merely a means of raising revenue for repatriation purposes. He has said that those who have not gone to. the Pront should be prepared to pay - this tax to assist in the repatriation of those who have. I believe that all who have not gone to the Front must be prepared to pay, according to their means, their share of the cost of repatriation. We should not, however, heap the burden upon the backs of those least able to bear it. Those who, have the money, and can best afford to carry the burden, should be required to bear their proper share. A week or two ago we had the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill before us, and Ministerial supporters advanced all sorts of arguments in opposition to it. Many of its provisions were declared by them to be iniquitous, and calculated to hamper the development of new businesses. Honourable members opposite were practically tumbling over each other in their anxiety to provide for further exemptions, and, in the end, it was provided that a man should be allowed to make excess profits to the extent of £1,000 per annum before being called upon under that Bill to pay a penny towards repatriation. Their attitude reminds me very forcibly of the story of the Yankee who, when told that he was unpatriotic, and had no love of country, replied, "" Why, my bosom is swelling with patriotic fervour! I am prepared at any time to sacrifice all my wife's relations upon the altar of my country!"" Ministerial supporters are taking up very much the same attitude towards repatriation. They are prepared to sacrifice all their poor relations-al l the working classes-bu t are not prepared to call for any sacrifice on the part of those best able to make sacrifices. I hope the Treasurer will see his way to withdraw this proposal altogether.",38
208,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable member knows that the Government will not do so. This is all bluff.,38
209,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I regret to hear such an expression coming from the Treasurer, because he is, after all / a big-hearted gentleman, and I am sure that in his calmer moments he will recognise that the people. this measure will put an absolute injustice upon the country.

Though the Treasurer went to great pains to read his speech, so that every word of it must have been carefully studied",41
257,Mr RODGEKS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,We have heard the honourable member do the same thing.,41
258,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Yes ; I have attempted on occasions, when a more than ordinarily difficult subject has been before us, to prepare a speech, but when I have tried to read portions of it , some one like the honourable member who interjects has promptly* risen to object.",41
259,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Because it is against the Standing Orders.,41
260,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Are we to understand that the system of favouritism the Government are now seeking to institute by this motion operates on the floor of Parliament? Are we to understand that the Treasurer may do that which another honourable member may not?,41
261,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable member should haye taken exception at the time.,41
262,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I never take exception to an honourable member reading his speech, but I do take exception to the different treatment meted out to me from that which is meted out to others.",41
263,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable member is not in order in making that remark.,41
264,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Treasurer, in his carefully prepared typewritten statement, said that the first and principal reason of the Government for introducing this measure was to stimulate recruiting. What does that mean ?",41
265,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Rea d on.,41
266,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The second reason was that it would make a contribution towards the repatriation of the soldiers. This is the only tax introduced by the Government to deal with repatriation'; there is not another penny piece of that taxation with that object. The policy of the Government is to find the money for the repatriation of our soldiers from two sources, one of which is the single men who refuse to enlist, and the other is posterity, who find both principal and interest on loans. Babes yet unborn are to find the interest on the loan money, tfie only other class to contribute being the single men who refuse to enlist, and who, presumably, are opponents of this Government. We over here have waited for some time to hear the apologists for the Government explain the reason for this policy. The Treasurer thinks that because he has sugar-coated the pill with a reference to repatriation, the country will swallow it . He evidently thinks that the reference to the soldiers will operate as a kind of threat, so that, if any opposition is raised to the proposition, those who raise it will be pointed out as being opposed to finding money for repatriation. However, both the House and the country can see through that transparent device. The Bill provides a minimum tax of £10 a year on every single man of military age, and every widower without children. It has been pointed out that some men are in such a poor position that they are unable to save £10 with which to pay the tax. What will the Government do ? All that the Government can do is to gaol these men. ",41
267,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"But what can the Government do to give effect to the measure ? Is the Bill to be merely a pious expression of opinion, that may be obeyed or disobeyed according to the caprice of the individual? The honourable member knows that there must be a penalty. If a man refuses to pay the £10, the Government, if in earnest, must send him to gaol. Of course, if that does occur, then, I suppose, the Government will do what has been done in other cases-the man will be let out of gaol on condition that he goes to the Pront. By this means will be brought about that form of conscription which the Government and their supporters pledged themselves would not be introduced.",42
268,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Is that the opinion of - your supporters ? Will they dodge payment like that?,42
269,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Evidentl y the honourable member thinks he is taxing only my non-conscriptionist supporters.,42
270,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I am taking your word for it .,42
271,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Evidentl y the honourable member thinks that my supporters voted against conscription, whereas his voted in favour of it, and, therefore, my supporters should be penalized. The Treasurer, in introducing the Bill, said that those in favour of compulsory service for duty oversea should be exempt from the operation of the tax. This Bill proposes a tax of 10 per cent., or 2s. in the £ 1 , as a minimum, and this is equal to the income tax on an income from personal exertion of £4,000.",42
272,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,How do you make that out?,42
273,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I have not the details, but I give the result as it has been worked out. At the £4,000 level of income from personal exertion the tax is equal to 2s. in the £1. This Bill will operate in the case of young men who are just starting in life, and whose incomes are small; and we are told by the Treasurer that if a man marries after 1st July he will still be compelled to pay the tax. This special tax, I may point out, does not exempt any young man from ordinary taxation on all the commodities he uses. In his Budget statement on the 8th of last month, the Treasurer stated that there were 233,716 persons paying income tax, of whom 167,853 were in receipt of incomes of less than £200 per year. We see, therefore, that the proposed tax is to fall on the majority composed of those whose incomes are less than £200.",42
274,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,A man who pays the tax under this Bill will not be subject to income tax.,42
275,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The honourable member is wrong, because the ordinary income tax has to be paid in addition-this is a super-income tax.",42
276,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If a man is not called upon to pay income tax, he will not be called upon to pay this tax.",42
277,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Certainl y he will. Apparently the honourable member does nob know the nature of the proposal he is supporting.,42
278,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I think there ought to be an exemption in the case of a man who is not called on to pay income tax.,42
279,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I think the party opposite ought to have another Caucus meeting, to agree as to the legislation to be introduced. So far from stimulating recruiting, I believe that this Bill wifl have the very opposite effect. The people who say that they are most in favour of the prosecution of the war are those who have introduced all the discord which has lessened the efforts of Australia in connection with the war. MT. LAMOND - How can the honourable member argue that it is, economic conscription when he says that the Bill will fail to force anybody to enlist ? ' Mr JH CATTS - I hope to hear the honourable member giving reasons for this iniquitous proposal of his Government. It is an attempt at economic conscription, but it will have a boomerang effect, and will come back and hit those who have set it in motion.",42
280,Mr LECKI E,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Indi) [3.0] - The principal objection voiced on both sides of the House is that this Bill is a form of economic conscription; t ut that argument is defeated when it is also claimed that it will conscript no one. If the argument of honourable members that the Bill will not force one person to join the ranks of the Army be correct, the Government cannot be said to have been false to any pledge given at the recent election. But if this is economic conscription, if the liability to pay a itax of £10 will force men into the ranks of the Army, I am glad of it. By saying that men are willing to risk their lives and limbs in order to avoid the payment of £10, which they can earn very easily in this country, honourable members opposite set a value of £10 upon a man's life and limbs. During the election campaign I said that I would endeavour to place the inevitable taxation that would have to be imposed on the shoulders of those best able to beaT it, and when speaking on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply I advocated, this same tax long before the Government foreshadowed it. I knew that, while very many families were doing their share in the wax, other families, maniy of them of German extraction, and some of them sympathizers entirely with our enemies, were getting rich at the expense of those who were fighting at the Front, and were not paying l d . towards repatriation, or helping in any way. I have seen in my electorate-.wha t is typical of many districts throughout Australia- a family with half-a-dozen 30ns, all of them at home, making hay while the sun shines, taking advantage of the fight that is being put up by others, and not subscribing Id. towards any patriotic fund, while next to them is a family in which all the sons have gone t'o the Front, while the old people remain at home to-run the farm. I want to place taxation on the shoulders of those best able to bear it and who are better able to bear it than single men without dependants, possessedof their full strength and manhood?",42
281,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Most of them are now engaged in "" scabbing.""",43
282,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"What are these.men doing whom this taxation will hit? They are scabbing on the men at the Front. I . received a letter yesterday from a ist in'a country district, telling me that he has been called upon to pay a levy of a day's pay a week, in order to help the strikers who are out of work.",43
283,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,'Does not the honourable member consider that the unions are justified in calling for assistance to feed women and children who are starving?,43
284,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Thos e who object to this tax abject to helping those men who are making a .great "" strike "" for Australia at the Front. The honourable member is a great example of the "" starvers."" In stead of the ""poor widow,"" he is taking up the case of the poor, strong, healthy, rich bachelor, who it is said cannot afford to pay £10 towards repatriating the boya who are fighting for him at the Front. It is claimed that there are many single men, between twenty-one and forty-five years of age, without dependants, who are not earning £2 a week. I am very sorry for them. But they can earn that wage at any time, and especially now, if they will only work. Thousands can get work at the present time, but they will not work. Cases of men who will be penalized because they have dependants have been brought forward; but I am sure that the Treasurer will be willing to amend the Bill so that those who have dependants absolutely depending on them may be exempted. It would be quite in accord with the principle of the Bill to do so. It is also said that it will be hard to collect the tax. Honourable members have talked about nomads, the men who are drifting about, who are here today and in another place tomorrow, earning wages wherever they can find work, but that is just the type of man who is the very first one to enlist, and who, if rejected by a medical officer, will apply again and again until he comes to be regarded as a nuisance. The man who is stopping at home is the man who is in a comfortable billet, usually a Government billet, and can well afford to pay the tax, and should be made to pay it. It is also said that this is class taxation. So far the interpretation bestowed by honourable members upon class legislation is legislation that discriminates between working men and capitalists, or between the well-to-do classes and those not so well off; but) this Bill makes no such distinction. unionEach man will pay according to his income. The rich man will pay, perhaps, twenty or even forty times as much as the poor man will pay. Can any one tell me that the young single eligible man, with all his health and strength, should not be called upon to pay something to. help the men at the Pront?",43
285,Mr BRENNAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,This is a new scheme for helping the unemployed.,44
286,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"There is employment jected. waiting for all who are unemployed. They can go into camp and earn 6s. a day, and be kept. This tax will be the easiest one in the world to avoid. Any one can avoid it by walking down to the Melcertificate in my pocket. bourne Town Hall, and doing his duty to his country.",44
287,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,And the honourable member can get out of the other taxes by dropping his profits.,44
288,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Does the honourable member object to any one going down the Town Hall and enlisting?,44
289,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"No ; but I want some"" of the honourable member's crowd to their profits.",44
290,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"They will drop some ment. of their profits under ""this taxation. will lose 10 per cent, of their income. is said that tliere are members of families who are earning nothing. In the country many fanners' sons receive no wages. I is one of the worse features of Australian life, and I would like to see it remedied. There are cases where the sons are anxious to go to the Pront, but they are threatened by their parents that if they enlist they will receive no benefits from them now or hereafter. As these young men receive no wages, if the parents anxious to keep them here, they will have to pay the tax proposed in this Bill. have already said, there are families which not one son is doing his duty to country, while in the case of neighbouring families the parents have given up all their sons, and everything they hold dear, have subscribed liberally to patriotic funds, and worked past the allotted span of life ,in order to keep the farms going until the boys come back from the Pront. When I think of these things, I question the sincerity of men who claim that is a class tax, that it is inequitable, that it is economic conscription. If the Bill will force one>man into^the ranks the Army I welcome it. Honourable memWar-time bers are asking for consideration for the' poor strong healthy bachelor, who not deserve any consideration whatever he has nob gone to the war.",44
291,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable ber looks fit enough.,44
292,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I may look fit enough; but I have offered myself and been rejected.,44
293,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable member knew beforehand that he would be re,44
294,Mr LECKIE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am aware of that; but I will go before any tribunal that the honourable member chooses to name and offer myself again. I have my rejection I have done everything that I possibly could to enlist. However, I do not wish to be led aside by that argument, and I have no desire to glorify my patriotism at the expense of my physical unfitness. Not only as a member of this House, but also as the to Chairman of the Recruiting Committee in Victoria, I have, in justice to the men whom I have induced to enlist, said that drop no matter what the cost to Australia would be, they would receive fair treatEven if it costs the last shilling They the men who have gone to the It Pront are deserving of it. I do not see that this paltry taxation of £10 per annum is inequitable, or an int justice, because those who are in the full enjoyment of their health and strength arte the very men ,wiho can afford to pay the tax. Therefore,* this Bill meets with my hearty and earnest approval.",44
295,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Melbourne Ports) [3.13] - In placing this Bill before us, the Treasurer, in his usual nice manner, are tried to make us believe that it was an innocent little measure that would hurt As I no one, but during the last threein quarters of an hour he has been the in solemn conclave with those honourable members who have expressed their opposition to it. I hope that they have been able to comfort him a little. Somewhat like the War-time Profits Tax Bill, this measure is a supreme farce. We were told by the Government that they were going to do certain things to win the war. We were told, among other things, that those this who made money out of the war would and be compelled to pay for the cost of the war, but the exemptions put into the Warof time Profits Tax Assessment Bill made the Profits Tax a farce. The Bill before us, in seeking to penalize those does who do not come under. the proviif sions of the W'ar-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, is also a farce. I memsmiled when I heard the honourable member for Indi expressing his desire to get at the stalwart bachelors, and when I thought of how the married men talk about doing one's duty to his country. One would think tQiat men married for their poor dear bleeding country's sake. Why did these men get married? cause they saw a "" little bit of cuddle"" they liked. They spruced themselves up, wore a nice tie and tight boots, acquired a sickly look, and said they could not sleep at night. They tell us all this was done for their bleeding country. The truth is that they did it for some "" tarts."" We are justified in ridiculing the whole of this proposal. Some men are to be fined £10 because they will not go to the war, whilst other men arc making hundreds of thousands of pounds in war profits. How can honourable members opposite know the financial position of bachelors? Many of them have responsibilities as great as ried men, and are we to force them to marry? Suppose those men are womenhaters. The women are far better off single than they would be if married to some of the men who will be liable to this tax. I cannot approach this Bill in a serious spirit. We are supposed to be logical, and to give the people legislation which has been duly considered in all its aspects. Every form of taxation bears hardly on somebody. I know thousands of men who are unmarried, and if the Treasurer knows how to get £10 out of them he is wiser than anybody else. Many men who offered to enlist, and were rejected, have since made arrangements to get married. Now they are told that because they were not married before 1st July they will be penalized to the extent of at least £10.",44
296,Mr OECHARD,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,If they have been rejected for military service they are exempt.,45
297,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is not so. If they are fit. for military service today they will be required to pay this tax. We know that thousands of men married in order to evade this taxation, because its introduction was anticipated. And a lot of them would have been better unmarried. The Treasurer and the Government know that this taxation will not be worth collecting if exemptions are to be allowed to anything like the extent proposed in connection with the war-time profits tax; and surely if the men who have made a lot of money out of the war are to get exemptions for reasons, a man who is earning only £100 per annum ought also to get exemption for reasons. The Government are not candid in saying Be-' that this is merely a measure of taxation to raise funds for repatriation purposes. It is intended to be a form of economic conscription. The Government hope that men who cannot pay the £10 will be forced into the ranks.",45
298,Mr MOWIIXIAMS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Would this tax force anybody to go to the Eront ?,45
299,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Most men who reach the age of thirty-eight years without getting married are not necessarily waiting for the girl they want; they have found the girl, but their wages will not permit them to maintain a wife as they think she should be maintained. Men earning £126 a year have not. saved mar- enough money to pay this tax. Lots of men do not earn anything like that amount, and for that reason they will not marry. Now the Treasurer says to them, "" As you will not marry and' drag some poor girl into misery, we shall make you pay £10 per annum."" If that is not economic conscription, I am a Dutchman. 1 hope the Government will succeed in carrying this Bill, because it will help, with their other actions, to so discredit them that their chance of getting a renewal of their term of office will be very small.",45
300,Mr EOWLER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Perth) [3.23] - This proposal is one which finds me without very much enthusiasm. In fact, I might describe my attitude as one of absolute indifference. To my mind, the measure is defective in two respects: it goes too far, and yet it does not go far enough. If this-Bill is intended to produce revenue for a very worthy object, namely, the repatriation of our soldiers, and if it is intended to apply to a certain section of the community that has failed in certain respects in its duty to the soldiers, I cannot see why it should stop at persons of the age of forty-five years. If we are to raise revenue by a bachelor tax, there are many men in this country over the age of forty-five years who have not yet done a great deal in regard to war matters. I may be wrong, but my impression is that in this community there is a remarkably large percentage of bachelors of middle and elderly age, many of whom are rolling in wealth. They have declined all the responsibilities of marriage, they have lived selfish, miserable lives, and rarely subscribe a pound or a solitary half-crown to any charitable or philanthropic object. I know a good many individuals of that kind, and. judging from the applause in the chamber, I am inclined to think that other honourable members know many of the same variety. Why should such persons escape a tax in regard to their lack national service as men? If there is one public duty of more importance than another in a country like Australia, it is marriage. Australia requires population, and if these men have refused a duty and responsibility in this regard, the Treasurer is failing in his duty to the country in introducing a proposal of this kind which stops short at men of the age of forty-five years. I have explained how, in my opinion, the Bill does not go far enough. I shall now explain how, in my judgment, the measure goes too far. If , as the Treasurer says, the tax is intended to stimulate recruiting, this is an indirect and wholly insincere method of achieving a worthy object. I wish to say here and . now that, so far as I am concerned, the Government will have to introduce soon some proposal more thorough and straightforward than any measure of this kind for reinforcing our men at the Front. One honourable member on this side waxed very earnest over the fact that the measure will penalize certain individuals who have refrained from doing their duty by enlisting. There are far too many such men in Australia. We hear of families with four or five men, not one of whom has gone to the Front, and near 'by are other families in which every son has offered himself, and some have paid the supreme sacrifice. Does any honourable - member pretend that the payment of £10 or a little more per annum is an adequate sacrifice on the part of those who have frained from going to the Front? It is the merest mockery to suggest that a tax of this kind is anything in the nature of a levelling up of the obligation of those have so deplorably failed to do their duty. There is only one method by which that can be done, and I say now, in all earnestever, ness, that it is time the Government ously considered the necessity for adopting that method, and giving the country something more effective than this miserable and hypocritical proposal. Mr Fowler.",45
301,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Brisbane) [3.30]. - The attitude taken up by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) is understandable, and quite consistent with the ideals he has advocated. I find myself in considerable agreement with him, especially in regard to the last point he made-that the suggestion that a tax of £ 10 per annum is the equivalent of enlistment is one of the greatest insults that of could be offered to men who do enlist. To say that the payment of a £10 tax is to be accepted as a quid pro quo for enlistment is a proposition that one cannot understand, having regard to the policy promulgated by this Government. The young men of the country have had before them two alternatives in connection with the war. They have had the opportunity either to enlist or to decline to do so. I am not going to inquire into the reasons that have actuated those who have refused to enlist. They have been insulted and abused by my honourable friends opposite, and their supporters, from every platform. Even the recruiting platforms have been used to insult them. I do not think a mistake oan* be more easily made than in trying to determine the reasons that actuate men in doing, or failing to do, certain things.",46
302,Mr SAMPSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Does the honourable member say that in time of war every man should please himself?,46
303,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The principle of compulsion for military service overseas is foreign to our form of government, and to all our ideals. The conscription referendum proved, if proof were wanted, that the people of this country considered that there should be no compulsion for military service overseas. The point with which I am immediately concerned, however, is that for some reason or otherand the reasons are immaterial to my arre- gument-ther e are in Australia a number of young men who have not enlisted. That they have the right to refuse cannot be successfully refuted, and the country itwho self has supported them by its refusal to adopt the principle of compulsory military service overseas. In this proposal, howthe Government are giving these seri- young men a third alternative. Previously it was open to. them to enlist or not to enlist. The Government now say to them, "" If you do not enlist you must pay up.""

309,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Rea d complete the sentence.,47
310,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Treasurer, dealing with the reasons for this Bill , went on to say thatThe first is that we believe it will stimulate and increase recruiting, not so much, we hope, by the fear of having to pay the tax, as bringing prominently before those who have yet volunteered for service what is not their duty to their country, but their paramount duty to themselves. The second reason is to provide funds towards the repatriation of those who have returned from the war after served their country. Where are the additional reasons for which honourable members clamoured?

314,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,H o n o r a b l e bers have heard me quote exactly what the Treasurer said. The primary reason f this proposal is the stimulation-of recruite ing.,47

He can stimulate it under this Bill only by making the tax payable such - a hardship that, to escape it men will think it worthwhile to enlist. The argument advanced by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) is unanswerable. I refer to his contention that ' to compare the risk to lif e and the hardship involved by active service, on the one hand, with the payment of a tax of £ 1 0 and the right on payment of that amount to remain in Australia, is to in sult those who have enlisted. This will not help recruiting.",47
319,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I do not think any one will say it is the equivalent of further; enlistment. ,47
320,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,That is the argument involved in the Treasurer's statement.,47
321,Mr SAMPSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,No ; that is an exaggeration of his argument.,47
322,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If this proposed by tax is to be used as a means of forcing not men-into the ranks, then it is altogether only too small. I object to the whole thing, since we have no right to force men into the ranks, either by .financial or economihaving cal pressure, or by statute law.",47
323,Mr CORSER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We cannot force men to enlist by calling upon them to pay a tax. have Mr FINLAYSON - That is the weakof the Bill . Australia has said that there shall be no conscription for service but oversea; and the Government have said in this House as they said during the purcampaign, that they will honour their pledge to the electors not to introduce conscription - during the lifetime of this - Parliament.",47
324,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,There was a big qualification: not without another re,47
325,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The point I wish to make here is that this Bill is designed memto operate as a form of conscription, so that the Government are in spirit violato r ing the pledge they gave to the constituencies. Although they can honestly say that they are not introducing con"" scriptive military service for overseas, and that they are not going to re-submit the question to a referendum, it cannot be denied that this is part of an effort to force into the ranks men who; for some reason or other, have so far refrained from enlisting. As I said before, I am not concerned with the reasons that have led men not to enlist. I confess I find it difficult to understand why a-number do not. What their reasons are, I do not know, nor do I think it any part of my duty to inquire. A f t e r all, the question of service to one's country is above either statute law or personal opinion. It depends entirely on a man's conscientious recognition of what he conceives to be his duty. Mr RICHA BD FOSTEB - Supposin g has not a conscience.",47
326,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The honourable member cannot establish that suggestion by any argument. The second reason given for this Bill is that it is to raise revenue for repatriation purposes. The single men remaining in Australia are now to be taxed to raise money for the repatriation of soldiers. This is open to two objections. do not think it fair to select any individual section of the community upon whose financial support the repatriation of our soldiers should to any extent depend. .The repatriation of our soldiers is a duty devolving upon the whole country. We have no right to select any particular class of the community to carry the burden, or to bear any special share'of it . How much does the Treasurer hope to gain from this tax ?",48

330,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The Treasurer must have had some statistical information to enable him to arrive at that estimate. Sir JO HN FOBREST - It is a moderate estimate.,48
331,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"P r o m most of the recruiting platforms, we are told that sacrifices. there are 150,000 fit single men in the country, and that they are shirkers.",48
332,Mr CONSIDINE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,What about the exemptions? There are the police and military.,48
333,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The police, the military, and the clergy do not count. If there are so many men of eligible military age, I cannot understand why the Treasurer agrees to an exemption which must deprive him of two-thirds of the possible tax. We haye been told that there are 150,000 fit men of military age. Either those figures are inflated or the Treasurer's estimate of revenue is too small.",48
334,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"In the Budget. I pointed out that the difficulties in making a start were allowed for, and that the estimate is a moderate one. The tax should yield more than has been estiht> mated, certainly in another year.",48
335,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Treasurer has tried to protect himself from criticism by saying that only £500,000 is to be obtained fro m this tax, and that therefore the number of men affected is too small to be worthy of consideration. So.far as I can see, no allowance is to be made for single men-fi t or unfit-whos e income is not sufficient to enable them to pay a fine I of £ 1 0 without suffering serious hardship. The Treasurer says that the Commissioner will have authority to discriminate in: this matter. There should be a special clause in the Bill to protect those who .cannot pay the tax. If the Treasurer would exempt young men who are not earning a certain amount, he would avoid a considerable amount of hostile criticism.",48

337,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I shall not supyear, port the motion, but I shall support every exemption that can be proposed. The hon' orable member for Hunter, mentioned that there are many young men who ' are articled and learning their business who are practically dependent on theirparents. To fine these young men £ 1 0 would really be to fine their parents - that amount.",48

344,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"No ; he says that this tax is imposed for repatriation purposes. That is a sprat to catch a mackerel. No one believes that the real purpose of the tax is to provide revenue for repatriation, but it is a convenient argument to sav that the money should be raised from those who have not enlisted, to be used for the benefit of those who have enlisted. The yield from this tax will be as a drop in a bucket to what is required for repatriation. When it is said that the repatriation scheme should be dependent on the yield from this tax one wonders whether honourable members opposite are in earnest.",49
345,Sir ROBERT REST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,No one has suggested that the Repatriation Fund should be dependent on this tax.,49

Another objection I have to the tax is that which I had to the War-time Profits Assessment tax, namely, - that it introto duces a new method of taxation, requiring repbrts, returns, and much additional machinery and expense. We irritate and harass .the electors by continually opening ber of marriages. new' sores and tapping them in fresh places. It.would be better to say to them straight out, ' ' We require a certain amount of money, of which you must contralia tribute so much.""

The people are prepared to contriApart bute all that is necessary for the war and repatriation. Every section of the comjection [84]- 2 munity is willing to do that. . But it is irritating to have taxation imposed in. so many different ways, and to find that those who are most able to pay are not adequately taxed. The honourable member for Indi expressed the view that taxation should be imposed on those most able to bear it . Honourable members admit the fairness of that, but evidently fear to put it into practice.",49
352,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Every one should pay according to his ability.,49

365,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED, The honourable member's time has expired.,50
366,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Wannon) [4.0] Honourable members seem to lose sight of the fact that the motion is in the main one to reimpose taxation, to add a supertax, and, in addition, to bring within the taxable area a class of people who, although they have all along enjoyed the freedom and privileges of citizenship, have never yet been called upon to pay taxation. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) spoke of the fairness of income taxation; and I think it is a sound principle that in war time all who enjoy the protection of the Government should pay according to their means. I think, however, that in preparing the necessary machinery the Government should draw a line between those who have offered their services in the field and those who have remained at home. I entered Parliament as an advocate of income taxation, and I was an advocate of the principle years before it was thought of in connection with the Commonwealth. Hitherto honourable members opposite have forgotten to describe an income tax as a class tax, but on the present occasion they so describe it ; but seeing that the whole discussion has ranged around paragraph /, it may be taken that the Committee, ,as a whole, are agreed on the soundness of the principle. This Bill proposes, as I have said, to bring in a great new body of taxpayers; but I regard it as merely an instalment, and a small instalment, of what is due to the men who are fighting our battles abroad-as the first instalment contributed by those who are equally capable of serving, but who have elected to remain in Australia. There is one objection, and a strong one, that I have to the Bill in its present form. No distinction is drawn between families which have contributed one or not more sons to the Forces, and families all the sons of which have remained at home. There may be families of five sons and two aged parents, and three of these sons, after a family council, may have gone to the Pront; yet the sons who remain at home will"" be called upon to pay this taxation equally with, perhaps, a neighbouring family of five sons, none of whom have offered their services in the Forces. There is a provision in which exemption from the liability to pay is limited to one remaining son, but my contention is that where the majority of a family of sons have gone to the Front, the rest of the family ought to be immune from this taxation.",50
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I will agree to that.,50
368,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If that is not done, a family which has"" largely participated in the war will be in no better position than that of a family which has entirely neglected its duty in this connection. This Bill has been subject to much criticism, but not ah honourable member opposite who has spoken has submitted any concrete alternative proposition for the raising of £500,000, although the obligation to do*so rests on them.  raise more money.",50
369,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I do not think so; but if the honourable member can show any means, consistentwith the principle of this measure, of raising the money required, J shall support him. As I have said, I accept this Bill merely as an instalment of justice to those at the Front, and I think it will be welcomed by thousands who. are unable to serve abroad, but who recognise their financial obligations. It has been said by honourable members opposite that the payment of this tax will have the effect of enabling a man, by means of a payment, to escape his duty. That may be argued; but it cannot satisfy his conscience.",50
370,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It provides a salve for his conscience. - Mr Rodgers - I do not look upon this as a punitive measure, but as securing the fulfilment bf part of the obligation which every citizen owes his country. The obligation to find the necessary money for repatriation rests on the whole community, and this Bill, as I say, brings in a class of taxpayers who hitherto have escaped, although they have ""bossed"" the country politically, and had tribunals created for the regulation of their wages and conditions. I say frankly that I should vote against this measure if I thought that the direct taxation proposals of the Government were going no farther. I do not advocate raising all the money that is necessary for repatriation by means of loans, for I do not wish the soldiers to return here and find themselves faced with heavy financial burdens. I am prepared to so widen our policy of taxation as to embrace the whole community. The argument as to this being a form of economic conscription is not worth the time it - has taken to advance; indeed, the Leader of the Opposition has expressed the opinion that it will not induce one man to enlist.",50
371,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is the reason for the introduction of the Bill, though.",51
372,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Of course, if honourable members opposite impute to the Government the motive of imposing penal taxation, their argument is quite logical; but they must Tecognise that the responsibility of finding the money for repatriation is the duty of every non-combatant. It is for this reason .that I suggest a strong line of demarcation between the participants and nonrparticipants in the war. The settlement of the repatriation question has been too long delayed; it has not"" been properly handled, and I can only hope that a well-thought-out financial scheme will be placed before the country, so that when our soldiers return they will not find themselves called upon to bear taxation in common with non-belligerents. ",51
373,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is the proper principle-al l (should pay according to their capacity; but I do not believe that any decent Australian man or woman expects, or desires, to have their lives and homes defended without contributing to the cost.  not think that'any honourable member in this House possesses as much knowledge of repatriation matters as the honourable member for Wannon possesses, and I commend him for what he has done in the matter of repatriating our soldiers, but he is all at sea in regard to this tax. I was very much struck by the fairness of the remarks of the honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell) this morning, especially when he spoke of the penal effect of the Bill. I do nof believe that there is a single man or widower, or, in fact, any man in Australia who would seek to avoid taxation which is imposed with the object of securing the repatriation of our soldiers. The Treasurer has told us that the money to be raised by this tax will be used for that laudable purpose; but what a mean,' contemptible lot we should be if we called upon our soldiers on their return to help to pay interest and repay principal on the money that we borrow for repatriation ? Many men who h,ave gone left positions in which they were earning over £3,000 per annum, and after all their deeds, about which we ^ are so proud to express our admiration, are we to ask them, and their children, and their children's children, to pay back the money that we borrow for repatriating them ? I hold that every one who stays at home should put his hands into his pockets as deeply as possible in order to provide funds for repatriation. It is shameful that any Government should introduce a proposal to borrow money for the purpose. If we can raise £100,000,000 in Australia for war purposes, surely we can raise £30,000,000 for repatriation purposes.",51
374,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If the Government had allowed the community to raise the money, £10,000,000 would already have been subscribed on which no interest would be paid.  by the honourable member for Wannon had been applied to the whole of the Commonwealth, we would have already been on the high road to the repatriation of the whole of our troops, but we have been tinkering here and. tinkering there, and we are still tinkering with the question. The Government should come down with a settled policy of repatriation, and tell the House what they propose to do. There is not one honourable member who would. not willingly agree to do everything possible without our having 'to go upon the market to borrow the money required for repatriation purposes. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for. Wannon has said, I look upon this tax as a class tax, because the Rill picks out single men and widowers between twenty-one years and forty-five years of,age, and asks each to pay £10,. no matter what his income is. In the electorate which I have the honour to represent there are from 12,000 to 15,000 single men, and they are principally nomads. The Treasurer will have the opportunity of a - life-time ih trying to collect the tax from those men.",51
375,Mr ROOGEKS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"They are mostly goodhearted fellows, and when they know that the £10 will go to the soldiers I guarantee that the great majority of them will pay.  coiild find a better-hearted man on the face of the earth than the Australian bushman. We can tax him to the extent of £50 indirectly and he will not growl, but if we ask him to pay 10s -,in the shape bf direct taxation he will buck. We have been long enough at the game to know which is the easier and better method of - imposing taxation.",52
376,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Whic h is that?  the Customs. The Australian bushman does not mind how much indirect taxation is placed on him. He growls for a few days, .but after a while it comes to him like mother's milk. In Queensland, a few years ago, every single man who earned £1 per week and over had to pay,, at least, 10s. per annum as a poll tax; but when I had a conversation with Sir Robert Philp, who was 'Premier of the State, and asked him how he got on with the men out West, he said that it cost £5 to collect every 10s. the Treasury received from those fellows. That is the position in which, our Treasurer will be placed in regard to .the collection of outlying portions of the different States, where the population is nomadic. The Treasurer's speech was so poetical, and contained so much flowery language, that it should have been set to music. The right honourable*gentleman said that the Government were under the impression that this form of taxation would stimulate recruiting. If there is one thing more than another that will not stimulate recruiting, it will be the passing of this Bill. ' The only persons from whom the tax will be recovered will be those who are in permanent jobs and those who are living in towns. There will be no chance of collecting it in the country. When an endeavour was made to collect the poll tax in Queensland, as soon as the men in a shearing shed saw a policeman's blue coat, or. got the whisper that sometMng was being done, they hung up their shears or became sick and were paid off, and cleared out before a garnishee could be put in. ;",52
377,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The tax could be collected through .the employers, just as in some countries the social insurance contributions of workers are collected.  older countries cannot be done in this new and 'beautiful country of rours. Perhaps the honourable member for Wannon does, not know that the Maranoa electorate is as large as the whole of New South Wales. Just imagine .the tax collector roaming from creek to creek, and hill to hill, over that vast extent of country, in order to collect the £10 from men who know every inch of it. What a merry dance he would be led.",52
378,Mr RODGERS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We should place the liability on the employer to furnish returns.  ber think that the employers will allow themselves to be tax - gatherers for the: Commonwealth ? The man who proposed to make himself .a collecting officer for the Treasury would get no one to. go to his shied for work. '. A Mulga telegram would be circulated warning men not to approach the station because the boss would-collect for the Commonwealth £10 from each man. The consequence would be that no men would go near the station, and the employer could, not get his work done. Sir .JOHN PORREST - Most of the mem in the honourable member's district have this tax in the gone to the. Front. ",52
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"They are generousminded - men, I expect.  Queensland are the most generous-hearted men in the world, and if the Treasurer asked them for £10 each for repatriation purposes they would give it to him.",52
380,Sir JOHN FOBREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"They will not affected by the tax.  cause most of them are single men, and the reason why many of them do not marry is that they do not earn enough money enable them to keep a wife. This tax really means veiled conscription.",53
381,Mr WEBSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The Leader of the position said that the tax will that effect.  the Government hoped it would have effect of stimulating recruiting, and remark was no slip of the tongue, because the right honourable gentleman was speaknew ing from prepared notes. If this is to a class tax, it is wrong. In regard raising money for repatriation, any direct taxation is preferable toborrowing money on the London market for that purpose. I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that if we are to pass taxation this character, it should not be a penal ta x on the single men and widowers tween the ages of twenty-one and fortyno five,' but should apply to all men.",53
382,Mr WEBSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Would you make old-age pensioners pay ?  man receiving a pension of 12s. 6d. week to pay £ 1 0 per annum in taxation? There must be some exemptions, and the also Treasurer is proposing to remove from scope of the tax a number of people. Where there are two sons in a family, both unmarried, and one has gone to the war, the one who remains at home to escape taxation. But another family may have only one son and five or six soldiers. daughters, and that son is to be compelled to pay at least £ 1 0 per annum. Is fair? Some families have given all their sons, and also the father, to their countaxation try ; and yet the Treasurer would give exemption to the stay-at-home brother & man serving at the Front. On the other hand, a son who is maintaining his widowed mother and several young sisters must pay this special tax in /addition ordinary income ta.x. That is a most jus t proposal. If we cannot defeat this Bill , we should, at any rate, insist 'some modification of its provisions. A l should pay this tax or none should pay i I again entreat the Government to set their face against theflotation of loans for repatriation purposes. This country can - find the money with which to do a fair thing to our soldiers, and every man who can afford to pay should pay. For that be 'purpose, the Government may have every shilling of which I am possessed, because beI realise that if it had not been for the action of our men in going abroad to fight for this country, my worldly possessions to would be no good to me or anybody else.  Opdially agree with the concluding remark not have of the last speaker that the cost of repatriation ought not to be dethat bited to Loan Fund. I believe, also, the that it is possible to make a workable that measure of the proposal which the Government have submitted. It is no phase in Commonwealth legislation to be recognise that the single man has not the to same-obligations as the married man. Laws already on the statute-book make a distinction' between married men with dependants and single men without dependants, but I have a decided objection of to the Government's proposal in its present form. The first faul t in it is that it beproposes to take £ 1 0 from a man who has taxable income. That' penalty, which is equivalent to 4s.' a week, is entirely the disproportionate to the man's proper liability. We should - reduce the minia mum tax payable by those who have no per taxable income, and. then the impost should increase on a graduated scale. I favour the abolition of the age l i m it the in regard to this tax. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) very pertinently asked why a man'over forty five years of age should be freed of any is obligation to contribute towards the funds required for the repatriation of our Why should a single man of sixty-five years, without dependants, be that exempt? Many men of sixty years of age are in an infinitely better position to pay than is a young fellow of twenty-one years-of age. Whilst I believe that of young men ought to pay some taxation 3 for this purpose, I do not believe in making the tax penal. We might very well abolish all the exemptions. I see no reason to for exempting the man who has remained unat home, and has the pleasure of enjoying a good billet, because of his physical unupon fitness for active service. Although this l tax will not force men to enlist, it has the t . appearance of economic conscription, and I am certainly opposed to any legislation of that kind. I have no doubt that greatly increased revenue will be earned by the tax if we remove the age l i m it and the exemptions, even if we also reduce the minimum amount payable. Even the men out back, on whose behalf the honorpledges  spoke, would not object to pay a tax based on equitable principles, if they knew that everybody was making a contribua tion, and that the money was to be earnot marked for repatriation purposes. difficulties of collection mentioned by honourable member could be overcome by a system of stamps, which the employer would cancel when paying off his men. In that way the tax could be collected from jnen who are in irregular employman ment. There would not be the same diffido culty in collecting from men who are regularly employed. I ask honourable members not to reject the Bill , but to to mould it into a fair and equitable measure. What honourable member say that a single man, whether young or old, has anything like the same obligathe tions as a married man ? Even a special bachelor tax of £ 1 0 would not nearly equalize the obligations of the bachelor and the benedict.",53
383,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Unless , of course, the single man has others dependent on him.  can be provided for. I h connection with the income tax, we allow a deduction f income of £ 2 6 for every child under sixteen years of age. I do not say that the waiving q,f the tax payable on that £26 is a sufficient concession for the creased responsibility borne by married man; but, at any rate, Parliarepresentations, ment does recognise the principle of granting assistance to a man who has - others dependent upon him. make the tax apply in a general way, so remove from the Bill the suggestion that this is a penal provision. young men might be foolish enough to think that because they had p,aid the of £ 1 0 there was no obligation upon them to serve their country. No man seriously contend, however, that the payment of such a tax is the equivalent of active service, where a man takes his in his hands. If this tax were applied on broad, general lines I have sufficient faith in the young people of this country to believe that they would cheerfully it . On the other hand, if we tion of the community, and say, in effect, to them, "" Because you have not gone the Front you shall pay this tax , shall only raise their ire. The Bill as it stands is not in accordance with our distinct and emphatic to the people. No one can say that I am opposed to conscription; I think I was the first in this House to speak in favour of the p'rinciple. But while I am conscriptionist to the backbone, I am in favour of the introduction of conThe scription by a side wind, nor shall I supthe port^ anything savouring of economic conscription. If necessary, I would vote tomorrow for conscription, but I am not prepared to bring it in by means of a side wind. This proposal will not induce any to enlist, but, on the contrary, will much damage to voluntary recruiting. I have Indicated the way in which I think the Bill can be so amended as to make it try a useful means of raising revenue for repatriation while removing from it the will sting that it at present contains.",54
384,Mr CONSIDINE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Barrier) [4.47] - In course of his speech last night the Treasurer (Sir John Porrest) said I wish to inform the House and the country that the compulsion proposed in this measure is not to force eligible persons to go to the war, but to compel those who have not gone to specially assist in repatriating those ,who have done so, on their return to Australia. is the only compulsion which we seek to exercise. r o m Any proposal for the assistance of our men and their dependants on their return from the Front will find in me a strong supporter, since I recognise that in - the Labour party more especially owes a the duty to those men who, because of their were induced to enlist for service oversea. For that, if not for any other reason, it is the duty of the We could Labour party to stand by these men, and and to look after their interests when they return. I would strongly support the i mSome ' position of a graduated income tax upon those who are benefiting, ,as the result of tax the war, or who have made profit out of othe war, in order to raise funds for the could repatriation of our soldiers. The one redeeming feature of this obnoxious measure is that under it parlialife mentarians are not exempt.

Even although it would affect me personally, I should strongly support the imposition of a graduated income tax to enable us to do justice to those who, rightly or wrongly, were induced to fight for us oversea.

My objection to war is not based on ethical grounds. It is not because I object to the taking of human l if e or favour a policy of non-resistance that I , have nob enlisted. volunteered because I am opposed to war, and whether my view be right or wrong, it is shared by an increasingly large number of working men in this country. hope that number will grow.

As such I am one of those who were described by a Nationalist newspaper as "" criminals, who, by virtue of the mistaken generosity of the Prime Minister, were allowed to be at large."" It has been said that this Bill means the introduction of economic conscription. That, in my opinion, is the motive behind it . It is designed fo penalize those who do not enlist. The intention of the Government is to exercise in this way financial pressure on those who have not volunteered. Like others on both sides of the chamber, I do not think it will have that effect, and in introducing it the Government are doing themselves more harm than good. We are told that those "" whom the gods wish to destroy they first make%iad,"" and I think the Government are justifying that saying.",55
392,Mr LAMOND,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Then why worry about this Bill ?,55
393,Mr CONSIDINE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am not. If the honourable member is a supporter of Ithe Bill he will be put to a great deal of trouble in justifying it . I am surprised that so much heat should have been engendered by the contemplation of the number of eligibles in Austraha who have taken advantage of the decision of the people that compulsory military service for oversea shall not be brought into operation, that no compulsion shall be apI have not plied, and that the right of individual conscience shall be safeguarded. Apart from those who share my views on this question, there are many who, on conI scientious religious grounds, object to active service. The Quakers and others believe that it is contrary to Biblical teaching to take part in the shedding of human blood, even in self defence. I may not agree with such a ground of objection to compulsory service, but I can well understand a man being true to his conscientious convictions and being prepared, as I am, to suffer, if necessary. for them. I respect and honour those whose opinions differ fro m my own. Even those who, on religious grounds, object to the taking of human lif e are to be unfairly dealt with under this Bill , notwithstanding that the people have said they shall not be penalized or coerced. This is an attempt to go behind the verdict of the people. It is a vindictive and cowardly attack on certain citizens. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie) stated that those-""who have gone .abroad deserve Australia, - because of old."" they have fought for it ; but how much of Australia will fall to their share? The wealth census,, taken a year or two ago shows that about 2,750,000. persons are entitled to vote, and that of these 2,000,000 do not own an inch of land. Of the remaining 750,000, only about 400,000 own £200 worth of property. Those who own Australia are the people who are making huge profits out of rest of the community, who are fighting for Australia, ;and making the products tions. which keep Australia going. There is no attempt to make the profiteers shoulder, the burden of those who have gone to fight for what honourable members oppomade site say is liberty and freedom. Person-: ally, if you also taxed fully-those who made profits out of the war, who own the mines, factories, and - workshops, and joy all that is worth enjoying in life, should be prepared to give up all tihat I dities. have. 'But no such - thing has been posed. ""We hear about the shirkers. Those who do .not volunteer to go to the Front are called shirkers by - the loud mouthed advocates of'leaving well alone, and taxing ""the other fellow.'' What have - the 2,000,000 landless persons in Austrain lia' to lose but their lives.? The proposal of the Treasurer is the good old bushthe ranging demand, "" Your money or your life."" "" Go to the Front, or pay £10."" admit that no one should be forced by this tax to go tp the Promt. The TreasuxeT waxed poetical when making his speech. He said, "" We do not want to be ungenerous; we do not want to ignore any real or valid reasons for not going."" Will he say .that those who conscientiously object to military service have no real or valid reasons for not going to fight? He said, furtherOur general feeling is the same as that strongly expressed in the imprecatory of MacaulayShame on the false Etruscan Who lingers in his home, When Porsena of Clusium Is on the march for Borne. The right honourable gentleman was rather unfortunate in quoting the eulogy of the invader. He did not, however, quote the lines in which Macaulay refers to the fact thatLands were fairly portioned, Their spoils'were fairly sold, The Romans were like brothers In the good days of old.

394,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The ""brave .days Mr .CONSIDINE - They were good days, too. There was some incentive to fight then. Those who fought, had something to fight for besides the shadowy thing that is offered to ourfightersnow.

397,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The aristocrats of England have paid a heavier toll in this war than any other section of the community.,56
398,Mr CONSIDINE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"What I said was that we had got past the stage, when the aristocrats led their forces. I do nob accuse the aristocrats by birth of having made the war. It is the international financiers, whose interest it is to make wars that I accuse of that; those who are so interested in armament trusts and similar words corporations in every country in the world, who benefit by war, and whose business it is to make profits without regard to the flag under which they live.",56

401,Mr CONSIDINE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I do not believe in being forced to go to the Front, nor do I believe in putting pressure on other men to go. As the workers understand more and more the causes of war; as they secure more and more, control, and share in the government of the country, they, wiil alter conditions, so that every man shall have his share' of the wealth produced.. There will then be no need for compulsion. Every man will be prepared to defend the country when it belongs to him. But while it is being used by a handful of people to exploit the rest of the community, and to add big profits to swollen fortunes, I shall, oppose any attempt, no matter how made,, to penalize those who are trying to obey the dictates of their consciences.",56

426,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED," That is not a point of order, but a question for the Chair. The Treasurer did say something about, reporting progress, but it was impossible for me to clearly understand what was meant owing to the buzz of conversation. I asked the Treasurer whether he proposed that subdivisions A, B, a, D, and B should be passed, and that progress should be reported, and he intimated to me that he desired those subdivisions only to be submitted from the Chair; the question now before us is that those subdivisions be agreed to.",58
427,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I accept the Treasurer's assurance that the Government intend to see after those people who are not paying their income tax as they ought to do. 1,58

The only effect of discussing the motion in detail^though that is quite proper from the point of view of parliamentary procedure-is that it will duplicate the debate on the Bill. Frequently a motion like this is accepted, and a Bill founded on it introduced, when the whole measure is open for detailed consideration, and honourable members lose not one jot If honourable members will agree to the suggestion of the Treasurer, we could at once report might, progress, and come down with matured",58

439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It is always better to be frank with honourable members; and I wish to say that the Government will reconsider one or two aspects of matter. As I have already said many times over, these measures which have to do with the war, and with taxation consequent on the war, ought in no sense to be regarded as extreme party measures. The Government, in this case, do not take up in the attitude that any proposals they bring up down must have every "" t "" crossed and every "" i "" dotted by the Committee.

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 18th September, vide page 2188): Clause 2 (Amendment of section 4 ) .",59
444,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Yarra) [5.35] - Instea d of defining "" active service,"" as having a meaning corresponding to that of the same words, as used in sub-section 1 of section 189 of the Army Act defining the expression "" on active servioe,"" we should incorporate in our Defence Act the actual definition in the Army Act. It will save a great deal of trouble. Honourable members know the difficulty that there is in searching for anything in the Army Act . By the process of incorporating amendments as they are made with the principal Act, we have reduced the size of our volumes of Statutes very considerably, and have rendered the task of studying the Commonwealth Ac t a comparatively easy one. In the same way it would be much better to have the actual definition of "" active service"" in our Defence Act , where it can easily be found. It would probably not occupy any more space than will be taken up by the proposed new definition in the Bill before us, which refers us' to the definition in the A r m y Act, and at the same time it will be an advantage to have everything in the one Statute.",59
445,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [5.38] - I appreciate the spirit in which the honourable member is making his suggestion, but I can assure him that the Parliamentary Draftsman, after having considered the point that he the has raised, has decided that the course adopted in the Bill is the best one to follow. The A r m y Act applies to Australian Forces who are on active service, and the definition of "" active service "" is easily ascertained by a perusal of the Statute under which our Forces are working. Furthermore, it is desired, by - adopting the proposed new definition to avoid the necessity for legislating every time the definition of "" active service"" in the Imperial Act is amended. If the Imperial authorities alter their definition, the alteration is adopted immediately by the wording of the definition in the clause. Those who work every day under our Defence Act by under peace conditions are not called upon to consult the Imperial definition of until "" active service."" That is only necessary where our Forces are working under the A r m y Act when they are on active service,, and the definition is then easily ascertained from the Statute under which the Forces are working.",59
446,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If the British definition is amended, our Act is automatically amended ?",59
447,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,For the purposes of our Act the amended definition is accepted.,59
448,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Brisbane) [5.42] I object to the proposition of the Government on principle and on constitutional grounds. In this clause, "" active service'* has a meaning corresponding to that of the same words as used in sub-section 1 of section 189 of the A r m y Act defining the expression "" o n active service."" In section 4 of the Act , "" A r m y Act "" is defined as meaning the Imperial Act called the A r m y Act . Clause 12 of the Bill proposes to amend section 47 of the Act by rendering the Citizen Forces liable to be employed on "" war service,"" instead of "" active service."" "" War service "" is defined in the Bill as meaning "" active service."" Thus we have this position: The Citizen Forces of Australia are liable to be employed on war service; war service means active service; "" active service"" means what the A r m y Act says; and the A r m y Act is an Imperial Act ; therefore, the Citizen Forces of Australia are liable to be employed as the Imperial Government may decide' under their Act.",59
449,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The honourable member is wrong.,59
450,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Then this Bill does not mean what it pretends to say.,59
451,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Activ e service is already denned in existing law, but we are now adopting the Army Act definition.",60
452,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We are proposing to accept the Army Act's definition of active service, and the Bill says that war service is to mean active service. We are substituting the words ""war service "" for "" active service "" in controlling the Citizen Forces. I am not referring to men sent overseas, because I believe in the principle contained in the Bill that when men go overseas they must come under the control of the Army Act.",60
453,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The conditions under which the Army Act applies to Australian Military Forces are set out in section 55,",60
454,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am complaining of the Army Act's application to section 47, and I am contending that our Citizen Forces should be controlled only and absolutely by laws made in Australia by Australian representatives, and not in any way should they be under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Act, so far as their control within the Commonwealth is concerned. I do not think that the Minister would be so unpatriotic as to desire to hand over the Citizen Forces to the control of some outside authority. But he must see that the actual effect of the amendment now proposed is to make the Citizen Forces in Australia subject to any amendment of the Army Act which the Imperial Government may consider necessary in connection with the Imperial Porces. I object to handing over the Government of Australia, either in part, or in whole, to the Imperial authorities. That is not expected of us. I am sure that this amendment has not been suggested by the Imperial authorities. It can .only have been suggested by some sort of slavish desire to manifest a jingoistic patriotism. We have had several rather severe experiences lately of the foolishness of following the Imperial lead in legislation. The necessities of Great Britain demand an entirely different outlook and application from those demanded in Australia. Simply because the Im perial authorities adopted daylight saviug, the Australian Government thought it necessary to do the same thing. That Act proved unworkable in the Common-, wealth. We have had an even worse experience in connection with the War Precautions Act, which was simply a slavish copy of the Imperial Defence of the Realm Act. If members had had any' suspicion that that Act was to be used as it has been used, it would never have been agreed to. In that and other Ways we are simply abandoning our rights of self-government, and placing our feet in the footprints of the Imperial Government. To that principle I 'am entirely opposed, not because of any lack of regard for the Imperial Parliament. The mother of Parliaments is a very safe and salutary institution for us to take cognisance of, but to do things simply because the Imperial Parliament does them seems to be an abrogation of every constitutional privilege we enjoy. I refuse to hand over the control of the Citizen Forces or the defence of Australia to any authority but the Australian Parliament. The Imperial Parliament may at any time alter the definition of "" active service"" or ""war service,"" and the Government are asking us to say .that whatever amendment is made in the Army Act shall automatically become part of the Australian Defence Act. In effect the Australian Defence Force will become an integral part of the Porces controlled by the Imperial Government. Already we have gone a very long way in that direction. We have said that, in time of war, our Fleet shall pass automatically under the control of the Admiralty. We have provided, also, that when Australian Expeditionary Forces are outside of Australia they shall pass under the control of the. Imperial authorities. In that direction we have gone further than the Imperial Government asked us to go, and I am sure the British Government is not asking us to provide that alterations of the Army Act shall necessarily and automatically become part of the Act controlling the Defence Forces in Australia. I object most strenuously to giving the Im perial Government the right to amend our Defence Act, and say what shall be done in peace time with our Defence Forces.",60
455,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Darling Downs) [5.53]. - The honourable member seems to be under the impression that we propose to hand over to the Imperial Government the control of - the Citizen Forces of Australia. The principle of Australian control of Australian soldiers is not being violated in the slightest degree by this clause. Section 47 provides that Citizen Forces shall be liable to be employed on active, service, and section 49 says distinctly that members of the Defence Forces-shall not be required, unless they voluntarily agree, to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and any territory under the authority of the Commonwealth. Therefore all we are concerned with is that our Citizen .Forces may be called upon to be employed under the existing law .on active service in Australia. Does the honourable member object to ihat?",60
456,Mr FJNLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,No .,61
457,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We are proposing .to use the term "" war service,"" which has a wider meaning than "" active service."" If this'Bill is passed, ""active service"" will, mean- . ' Whenever lie is attached to or forms a Force which is engaged in operations against the .enemy, or is engaged in military 'operations in a country or place wholly or partly occupied.by an enemy, or is in military occupation of any foreign country. Citizen Forces in Australia may be called upon to take up arms in operations against an enemy attacking our shores, but they cannot be sent beyond the limits of the Oommomvealth or its territory without their consent. We are simply adopting from the Army Act the definition of active service.",61
458,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,And we are giving the Imperial Authorities power to change that definition at any time.,61
459,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We are entitled to say .that ""active service"" shall have the same meaning in Australia as it has in the United Kingdom. At the present time, the Australian Imperial Forces are operating in conjunction with the Imperial Forces and troops from South Africa, New Zealand, and Canada.",61
460,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"But our Citizen Forces are not doing that, and the Defence Act draws a clear distinction between Citizen Forces and Expeditionary Forces.",61
461,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Our men are fighting oversea side by side with Forces from other parts of the Empire, and it is necessary that all there should be under the one Act. The object of adopting this definition is to secure for our Military Forces, when they are operating outside Australia, the same definition of active service as applies to troops from other parts of the Empire. The Imperial Government is not seeking to interfere with our rights of self-government in any way. We are simply adopting an Imperial definition of "" active service,"" providing, that, for the purposes of our Act, it shall have the same meaning as under the Army Act.",61
462,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Cook) [5.581- I join with the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) in offering the most strenuous opposition to the principle embodied in this clause. The Minister said that we are not, at the request of the Imperial Authorities, sacrificing any of our rights of self-government. The trouble in Australia is thati'the Imperial Authorities are more considerate for the self-governing rights of the Commonwealth than are many people in Auspart of tralia. Unfortunately, many of our people seem to kow-tow to the British authorities by continuously surrendering Australia's right of self-government. I am quite sure that the Imperial Authorities charged with the administration of the oversea Dominions would not have attained the success that has marked their policy in dealing with different parts of the Empire if they had followed the system which a number of persons in Australia wish adopted. The Minister says that the same principle of reliance upon an Imperial Statute is operating in many other Acts. That admission shows that, although we have full self-governing' powers conferred upon us by the Imperial Authorities, we are not prepared to live up to the full measure of our rights and privileges. The Government seek to commit us to something indefinite and unforeseen. Not only do they wish us to adopt the definition of active service at present contained in the Army Act, although they have not got that definition, but. they ask us to agree . to be bound by every twist or turn that may take place in the Army Act in the future. But the most tyrannical' Government that ever existed in Great Britain might come into power and introduce into Ihe Army Aot provisions for disciplining its troops abroad, to which our men fighting side by side with them would be amenable. I absolutely object to that. I have spent some time in the Library endeavouring to ascertain, by reference to the Imperial Army Act, what these various alterations mean. Even with the assistance ef our experienced Library officials, however, it is almost impossible to trace the many amendments of the British Army Act, and so to discover the true purport of these alterations. We have, provided for the consolidation of our Statutes, but that system does not obtain in Great Britain, and in order to find out what is the meaning of these references in the Bill to the British Army Act, one would probably have to look through fifty different amending laws. A skilled lawyer alone could trace them.  member suggest? Mr J. II . CATTS - That we should embody in this Bill whatever definitions we desire to take from the Imperial Army Act, instead of making a mere reference to them.  in time of war.",61
463,Mr J,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,H . CATTS - That is quite immaterial. The point is that we have no right to give up our self-governing powers.  or three differing sets of conditions applying to troops fighting side by side.,62
464,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is bunkum. I have before me an index to the public Acts of Great Britain, in which there is a whole page devoted to the British Army Act, and amendments of it, with twice as many references to them in other parts. If the Honorary Minister endeavours to follow up the various amendments of the Army Act in order to trace the references in this Bill to the Imperial law,' it will not be long before he finds himself in an inextricable maze.  much about Army Acts when they are in the trenches.",62
465,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Do they not? Is the honourable member aware of some of the treatment that has been meted out to our soldiers at the Front? I have seen letters from soldiers at the Front stating that they have been cruelly punished for the most trivial offences. If the people of this country knew of all the punishments that are inflicted at the Front, we should not get our present rate of enlistments. ",62
466,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"But the discipline imposed by a Tory Government in Great Britain might be altogether different from what an Australian Democracy would have its men subjected to - Let us set out in the Bill itself every provision to which our men are to be subjected, so that our soldiers may read them for themselves.",62
467,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The honourable member realizes that the provisions in this Bill in regard to the Army Act are substantially the same as have been ""followed by the Commonwealth for a long time?",62
468,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is no answer to my complaint. There is too great a readiness to fall down on our faces and to bow to whatever the Imperial Government does, without considering whether we desire to apply to this country the principle involved. We have here some gentletaen from Great Britain who spent the first half of their lives in Australia in repudiating all the conditions existing there, while in the second half they are getting down on their stomachs abjectly following the British Government.  troops have to conform - to our laws if they were fighting here?",62
469,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Is not the honourable gentleman aware that in the Balkans troops representing the whole of the allied nations are under the control of a French General? Because of that fact would the honourable member have us insert in this Bill words to the effect that the French Army Act shall apply to tliose of our troops who are under the control of a French General ? I do not think any , honourable member would be prepared to agree to any such provision. It is absurd to say that because our men are fighting side by side with the British Forces they should be subjected to the same conditions. In one of the most vital respects our men are not fighting under similar conditions to them. The Imperial soldier receives ls. a day, whereas the Australian soldier draws 6s. per day. The conditions of ser-_ vice in that! respect are altogether dis-' similar. This principle of simply declaring that such-and-such a provision of the British Army Act shall apply to our soldiers is wrong. The particular provision sought to be applied in this case may be good or bad, but no honourable member knows what will be the effect of it . .",62

471,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It is Australian money-ever y penny of it . Let not the efforts of Jhis country be decried in that way. Does riot the honourable member think we are doing a fair thing in return? That argument may be carried a little too far.

We recognise that he must have a little opportunity to set out for himself.  receive 6s. a day even if they were fighting under a French General?,63
472,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Yes . I repeat that there is a difference between the pay of our men and that of the Britsh troops, and there should also be dissimilarity in the administrative conditionsI assert, with some knowledge of what I am speaking, that some of the administrative conditions of the British Army are positively injurin g recruiting in Australia. I have seen letters from Australian soldiers at the Front dealing with the way in which they are treated by some of the British Generals. Some of the British A r m y conditions to which they are subjected are totally foreign to Australian ideas, and must have a detrimental effect upon recruiting. The Government are here proposing to expand the ' principle of declaring that such-and-such a provision in the British A r m y Act shall apply to .our Forces. The Imperial Act may be amended from time to time, and we shall not have an opportunity to review the amendments so made and applying to our-troops at the Front. Such a principle is absolutely bad, and I most emphatically protest against it . would strongly urge the Government to embodv in the Bill itself any provision of the Army Act which they desire to apply to our Forces. / Whenever any alterations in the conditions of service are to be made, let this Parliament have an opportunity of considering them. Whilst the war exists, we are continuously in session, so that, if at any time the British Government wish to amend the A r m y Act , it is open to them to cable to us the alterations they propose, and we can simultaneously amend our Act. There is no difficulty in the wav of so amending our law, but the principle of committing Australian soldiers to alterations madei n the I m perial Act after they have enlisted in Australia-amendment s the effect of which even the Honorary Minister cannot 'foresee-is a vicious one. This principle was strongly objected to in another place, and it should be reconsidered. This is not a mere matter for the Parliamentary - Draftsman. Draftsmen do not govern the policy of this country. It may be easier for a draftsman to simply provide in a Bill of this character that such-and-such a provision of the Army A ct shall apply to our Forces, but it is infinitely better that there should be direct legislation by this Parliament. This principle, as I have said, was strongly opposed in another place, and it is strongly objected to here. If the Government persist in following it in respect of this and other clauses of the Bill , I can only say that the measure will have a very rough passage.",63

We must act upon the fundamental principle that our soldiers, when serving with the Imperial Porces outside Australia, and while travelling to and fro between Australia and the scene of conflict, must be subject to the one law, and that the British Army Act.",63
474,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Why ?,63
475,Sir ROBERT BEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Because it would be impracticable to have our soldiers working under one set of conditions side by side with the Imperial Forces controlled by quite a different set. When they are fighting side by side against a common enemy, it is essential that they should all be under the same law. Discipline demands that they should be. I This is a fundamental principle which we have acknowledged from the very in ception of our Defence legislation, and it is rather late in the day to suggest a departure from it . I can appreciate the view of my honourable friend that we should embody in the Bill itself the actual governing provisions of the A r m y Act that we desire shall apply to our Forces while oversea. That undoubtedly is desirable, but there are many difficulties in the way. His object might be achieved by attaching to every copy of the Bill a copy of the provisions of the Imperial Act applying, under it , to our Forces. The trouble is that if , during the war, amendments of ;an urgent charI acter were made in that Aot by the perial Parliament - while we were not i session, an .undesirable .state might arise.

I should like to hear from the Minister the exact difference there is between cadets under eighteen years of age, who, I understand, do seventy-two hours' drill per annum",66

502,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Brisbane) [8.15] Provision should be made so that cadets in the employment of the Commonwealth shall have the same protection as is extended hy this Bill to those who are employed by private individuals. In the case of a telegraph messenger in the General Post Office, Brisbane, who was prosecuted for failing to attend the drills, the .only way in which he could make up his time was by attending at his work early in the day, though he did not reach his home from his employment in the post-office until close on midnight. The magistrate, on hearing the circumstances, refused to record a conviction against him. Reasonable discretion should be given to meet such cases, and I hope that the Minister will take the matter into consideration. In Richmond, toria, a boy was convicted for having failed to put in the required number of drills. His defence and that of his parents was a conscientious objection tb military training. I do not wish to raise the whole question of how far conscientious objectors may go in refusing to Last undertake military service, though the matter mieht properly be discussed, but the Minister will not disagree with the fact that there are people who have honest, conscientious objections on this score. . The fact that the Act does not allow the magistrate to exercise any discretion is an atrocity in a country like Australia. Conscientious objection to military training does not appeal to me, but I know that there are people who are intensely in earnest in regard to the matter.",66

504,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It was understood that conscientious objectors would be given non-combatant duties in the Citizen Forces, but how far that principle can be applied to cadets is not quite clear.. Their duties are neither combatant nor non-combatant. I am anxious to know what provision can be made to meet the case of boys who have conscientious objections to military training.  event of all of them having conscientious objections ?",66
505,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The remark of the honourable member is open to two objections. Such a state of things is not likely to arise in Australia, and in the second place people who have conscientious objections to"" military training are just as good citizens as those whose consciences do not trouble them in that respect. In fact, the higher the conscientious scruples of a community are the better the community is. * I notice that no effort is being made in this Bill to alter the hours during which cadets' are drilled. I commend to the notice of the Minister a motion which I have on the business-paper urging the abolition of night drills. I hope that the Government are giving the matter consideration. For some years I have been urging that compulsory, training should not be confined to boys, but that girls should be trained in nursing, hospital, and Red Cross work. The war has shown what Vicmany of us were quite well aware of, that we had latent in Australia an enbrmous source of valuable assistance to our Militar y Forces in the shape of the girls of the community whose adaptability to nursing and hospital work is remarkable. .Unfortunately nothing has been done to recognise the Bed Cross system in Australia. The Army Medical Corps is recognised by the Defence Act , but after all the magnificent service rendered by the Australian nurses during this war, they are still left outside the pale of the measure. Sooner or later we must provide, uot only men fit to fight, but also girls who are ready to nurse our wounded. I am sure that the Minister sufficiently' appreciates the value of the work done by the nurses at the Front to insure that a'nursing corps will be made a permanent feature of our Defence system. It is just as necessary to have nurses to.nurse the wounded as it is to have men tp do' the fighting. that we have been spared serious losses of men through sickness has been mostly due to the thoroughly well-organized nursing corps which is attached to the Australian Imperial Force. But it had to be scraped together at the last moment, with the result that every capable nurse who went to the Front left , behind her a Vacancy, mostly in the hospitals, which could not easily be filled. I hope that something will be done to in sure that the Australian girls will be trained in nursing just as the boys are trained for the defence of the country.",66
506,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [8.25] - In regarcl to the question of cadets employed in the Commonwealth Service, my view is that if the Commonwealth requires' private employers to allow their employees to be trained in the employers' time, the Commonwealth sliould endeavour to arrange its services so that its employees can do their military training in the Commonwealth's time. I do not know what the Minister's view is, but I shall submit the matter to him. Sections 61 and 143 of - the Act exempt, to some extent, conscientious objectors from duties of a combatant nature, but that exemption does not extend to the training of junior cadets.",67
507,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,The objection is military training.,67
508,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That training is disciplinary, physical exercises, and so on. Conscientious objectors object to something that ends in the taking of life. When the principal measure was under discussion Parliament gave serious and sympathetic consideration to the case of conscientious objectors. The very reasonthat the honourable member has advanced in urging the abolition of night drills is that which has induced the Minister for Defence to bring forward the amendment which will enable drills to be held during periods which are not half-holidays, when boys should have their recreation. It will also enable the Department to avoid night, drills.",67
509,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Where does the Bill say so ?,67
510,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It does not say so. At present the boys must be trained outside their hours of work, and the regulations have to be framed to meet .that condiThe fact tion of affairs. We are now amending the Act in order to enable the Department to have the hours of dril l either at night or during hours when the boys are required to be at work. The scheme has not yet been worked out, but we are asking for the power to do what the honourable member suggests-that is, to have the drills during such time as the boys are ordinarily employed at work, and to meet the objections that have been raised by parents to night drills. It is about the only objection that parents have raised to compulsory training. They do not raise any objection to Saturday afternoon drills. The boys themselves have raised that objection. I quite agree with the honourable member in regard to the fourth point that he has raised. A f t e r the war is over, we should do all we possibly can to form Red Cross branches in Australia as was done in the United Kingdom before the war broke out. In the United Kingdom, a large number of societies have been formed to carry out this work, and fortunately those societies were in operation, and were able to do much valuable work in connection with the war. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that after the war. something on the lines he has suggested must be done. It is a matter of very great importance, and ought not to be lost sight of. to Mr TUDOR (Yarra) [8.30] - This clause provides that a senior cadet shall be paid by his employer for any time he is absent from his employment for the purpose of training, but that the employer shall not be liable to pay for any time when the employee is prevent absent from his . employment f o purpose of training in the Citizen Porces. There is a risk of the whole ing being done either at night or on Saturday afternoons. The Minister mits that the Department has not yet worked out a scheme for training the boys on. other than Saturday afternoons. know the boys have felt keenly the of their ordinary recreation on that afternoon. In many cases, the officers have done their best'to meet the wishes of the boys by avoiding, as far as posselves sible, training on Saturdays. ' The boys are required to parade at 2 o'clock in afternoon, and very often it is impossible for those living m my electorate, and their working in the city, to get their occupations, have their meals and change into their uniform in time for the parade. No doubt, the same disadvantages are experienced in other electorates to a greater or less extent. Boys livin g at Brighton or Sandringham, and working in Melbourne, would find it impossible to be back in. their suburbs much before the time for starting d r ill. Often on the days appointed for whole-day training boys can be seen going - to work in. their uniforms, so as to be able to go straight from, their placeof employment to the drill-hall. Often they have been obliged to go to d r ill without lunch. That system is not good, and I ask the Minister to see if it is not possible to amend the law so that all drills may be done during the day-time, and without depriving boys of their only afternoon for recreation. I am reminded that the large public schools have companies of their own, and boys attending those in stitutions are allowed to drill on an afternoon to suit themselves. That concession is the cause of much heart-burning amongst other boys who have to leave their employment on Saturday at midday, and give up the afternoon to their drills. I have no very great objection to the night drills, although in some cases it may be difficult for the boys to attend their drills and return to their homes at a reasonably early hour. But I ask the .Minister to see that, as far as possible, the drills are carried out in the day-time, and without entrenching oh the Saturday afternoon recreation of the boys.",67
511,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"South Sydney) [8.36] - I have pleasure in congratulating the vernment on amending the law so as to boys from losing their wages for r the the time which they have to devote to drill. I know that boys employed by the trainColonial Sugar Refining Company, and receiving only 7s. 6d. per week, have to adsuffer deductions of. as low an amount as one penny on account of the loss of working'time caused by their military training. I One would think that a large company loss which has so much property to defend would not be so mean as to make such deductions from the wages of cadets on account of the time given to fitting themf o r the defence of the country.",68
512,Mr GHOOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If this amendment is the agreed to, the employers will not any longer be able to make deductions when employees are absent at d r ill during home from hours of employment.",68

514,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Melbourne) [8.42] The Defence Department has abolished distinctive national uniforms and insisted on all cadets and members of the Citizen Forces wearing khaki, and. we should be careful that there are no differences in the treatment of the boys in connection with their training.

Militar y training of our boys is a national undertaking, and I hope that the Government will insist that in the metropolitan areas, at any rate, all boys, whether they are the sons of workers or the sons of swells, - shall be trained on the same days. I desire to eliminate every cause of friction between the boys of d if ferent classes - Honourable members will agree that each college is entitled to have a company of its own, but let the training throughout the community be uniform , and let all the boys in the big centres of population be trained as far as possible together.

529,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [ 8 . 5 3 ] - I would remind honourable ..members that the Act applies uniforml y to cadets livin g in town and country districts. We have already made concessions to country cadets, inasmuch as in section 127 of the principal Act we have legislated thatProvided also that in the ease of Senior Cadets who reside over 2 miles from the place appointed for training, attendance for a less number of hours than prescribed above may be allowed to count as prescribed for the full statutory duration of drills, and power may be given to the prescribed officers to grant leave of absence from training required by this Act when the conditions of the .weather, by reason of excessive rain or heat, would render attendance a hardship, and equivalent attendance as prescribed may be required in lieu thereof.",70
530,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It would seem that the country cadets have the best of it .,70
531,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,No ; but we cannot do too much for these boys. The desire of the Government is .to do justice to both city and country cadets.,70
532,Mr LIVINGSTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Barker) [8.55] I am afraid that the provision just quoted. by the Honorary Minister is not strictly observed, with the result that attendance at drills in many cases is extremely unpopular. We should do everything possible to popularize the work of training our youths in the defence of their country.

535,Mr WISE,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Gippsland) [8.59] - This clause raises the question to which the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr . Manifold) referred a few evenings ago. It appears to be an anomaly that men who have gained their commissions on the field have no opportunity to secure appointmenb as omcers in the Permanent Porces. I notice that, under this proposed amendment of the principal Act , power is given to appoint such oflicers to positions in the non-combatant branches of the Permanent Forces. Why should they not be eligible for appointment in the combatant forces, since tliey have gained their commissions in the most practical way 1",71
536,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [9.0] - Sectio n 148 of the principal Act was inserted on the recommendation of L o rd Kitchener, for reasons which still prevail. It really relates to staff appointments, - and it is the staff officers who deal with the whole science of warfare. It is not the fighting forces alone with which they are concerned. man might be a first class regimental leader, and yet, by reason of not having the requisite technical training, would not be suitable for a staff appointment.  technical knowledge.",71
537,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"That is so. where officers of the Citizen Porces have been appointed to the command of regiments or battalions, they have asked that their adjutant should be a member of the Permanent Staff. One of the objects of the Act is that our own boys who have been trained at the Military College, and who, from their school days, devote themselves to a military career, shall be appointed to permanent positions on the In structional Staff, the duties attached to which hecessarily 'involve training and study over a long period. The record by the officers from the Duntroon Military College made in this war is oneof which Australians should be very proud. About 140 lads graduated, and went from there to the war; thir.ty-one of them have fallen, while forty-two others have been wounded or are missing, fifteen have gained military crosses, as many moia have been mentioned in despatches, and generally, they have been praised in the highest terms by Commanding Officers at the Front. Their training has stood them in good stead; they have shown individual bravery, skill, and ability under the actual conditions of warfare, and thus the value of the College training has been proved by the hardest of tests. Some of the lads went away to the war before they had completed their courses. Staff officers have functions and duties entirely different from those of other officers. The Government has at heart the wel* fare of those who have won promotion on the field, and their rank will be preserved when they come back to Australia. Particular inquiries which I have made into this subject confirm everything I said regarding it last night. The official list published on the 1st July last gives the record of all our officers, with the ranks they have gained, and honorary rank is retained when they cease to belong to the M i l it a ry Forces. While men are under training they cannot assume the rank which they may have won abroad, but directly their training is finished that rank is confirmed to them. We have provided that service across the seas may be taken as equivalent, in the case of trainees, A to training in Australia, and we have also provided that privates who have won distinctions may be promoted and made officers in the permanent service of the Commonwealth. Then we have amended section 63 to give preferential treatment in defence appointments to our military, and naval men. Now we are dealing with In cases staff appointments. The necessities of the case require that these should be filled by brained men.  that the Committee should p^tss the clause as it stands. Por staff positions educated and highly-trained men are necessary, to control the technioal work of the A r m y . However brave a man may be, or however good a leader in the field, he may be f ill at sea in regard to the technical business of the army. The clause, however, gives the Government power to appoint men who have served with a satisfactory record, but are not graduates of the M i l it a ry College, to be officers of the non-combatant branches of the Permanent Forces, including the medical, veterinary, ordnance, survey, and clerical branches. It also provides that warrant and non-commissioned omcers of the Permanent Forces may be appointed to the commissioned rank for the ' position of quartermaster to units of the Australian Military Forces. That is a wise provision. The Minister has told us that if a man has to put in drills as a trainee he will , after his return, still have a chance to be promoted as bigb as a warrant officer or quartermaster. In regard to the Duntroon oflicers, all I have co say is that when the College was established we were told that it would turn out men possessed of great technical ability. As one of - tliose who framed the original Defence Act, I venture to say that the College has done even better than we hoped that it would do. As the Minister has said, the boys from Duntroon have made a name in this war which will be ever memorable in the history of Australia. If in the f u t u r e the College turns out officers as good as these have proved themselves to be, wo need not fear for our;militar y prestige, nor dread that our officers may not possess sufficient technical ability.  what has been said by the Minister and the. honourable member for Maranoa regarding the Duntroon officers. General Sir I a n Hamilton declared at Gallipoli that every one of them was worth his weight in gold. In every Department they have made good on the battle field. Some of the' lads practically went on .strike because they were not permitted to _go to the Pront, and I believe that the regulations were altered slightly so that they might leave after a,- three years' instead, of a four years' course - The students at the College are instructed in .every branch of military science. learn strategy and tactics',, and are thoroughly drilled. The training at the College is, I believe, equal to that in any college in Europe or America, and compares favourably with that at Sandhurst., The Minister is .right in saying that the graduates of the College should be the future officers of our Permanent Porces.

544,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Melbourne) [9.15] I did not speak on the second reading, or in Oommittee, and I desire to say a* few words now in regard to the proposed new section 73c, which provides that any contractor, purveyor, or other person, or any employee, who fraudulently supplies to the Commonwealth, or any officer of the They Commonwealth, for the use of the Defence Forces, inferior food, or food less in quality than that specified in the contract, .shall be guilty of an offence. Then proposed new section 73D provides that the punishment for any such offence, if the proceedings are taken summarily, shall be a fine not exceeding £ 2 0 , or ""imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months; and if the prosecution is upon indictment, the punishment shall be imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for any term, not exceeding three years. I welcome these provisions, even if they do not go so far as I would wish. Under the Code Napoleon, the punishment for such offences is not fine or imprisonment, but fine and imprisonment, thus preventing the escape of wealthy offenders. When the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Jensen) was Minister for the Navy, he informed me, in reply to questions, that bullocks' livers, supplied for the transports, had been found to be infected with hydatids. Luckily, an officer of the. Department found that this meat was diseased, or there is every likelihood that our men, who were going abroad to offer the supreme sacrifice of their lives in defence pf their country, might have been infected with the disease. As I am speaking, there is possibly a riot outside on the question of cheap food. The people are meeting in the street; and I am sorry to say that possibly the gaols to-night may be filled with men who are as earnest as are members of this House in their desire to right the wrongs which, unfortunately, prevail in our midst. On the 15th February I the then Minister for the whether he could inform me who the men were who had supplied this diseased meat, and the reply was, "" I shall tell the honourable member next week.'"" Week after week I could not get the information, owing to the fact that the then M i ister for the Navy had been transferred to the office of Minister, for Trade and Customs. Ultimately , in March last, I asked the Minister for the Navy (Mr . Joseph Cook) whether he would state the names of the contractors who had supplied the meat and bullocks' liver for transports from 1st January, 1916, to 31st December, 1916, and the names supplied to me, in reply, were those of W . Angliss and Company Proprietary Limited, T. K< Bennet and Woolcock Proprietary Limited , and F . Watkins Proprietary Limited . It was then my duty to find out who were the guilty ones, and when I referred to. the matter in the House I quoted from the Graphic newspaper, which I compliment for having exposed this infamy. What ' came out in the press was a mere bagatelle compared to what was done, and if there were a commission of inquiry, it would be found that meat has repeatedly been supplied; and yet the offenders go free. Angliss and Company, if there had been such a law as is now proposed, might possibly have been fined a paltry £ 2 0 . When speaking on Supply on 7th March last, I quoted from the Graphic showing that, on 2nd March, 1916, 6th March, Sth May, and 26th May, livers infected with hydatid cysts and fluke had been rejected by the inspectors, aud, to the credit of the then Minister for the Navy (Mr Jensen), he insisted that no more livers should be supplied to the Naval Department. point out to honourable members that if Messrs.' Angliss and Company sent out such meat for. general consumption, the public would not have the benefit of a second examination by a departmental officer. On the 8th March, 1917, I put further questions in the House regarding the supply of diseased meat for the troopships, and I was informed that Messrs. Watkins Proprietary Limited had not supplied any of these livers, but thatOn the 25th May, 1916, T. K. Bennet and Woolcock Proprietary Limited tendered ox liver which was diseased, and it was rejected. This meat had been previously inspected and passed at the abattoirs, and it is not considered that asked the firm deliberately attempted to supply Navy diseased meat. And thatOn the 6th March, 1916, and 3rd and 4th May, W. Angliss and Company Proprietary. Limited tendered ox liver which was diseased, and it was rejected. This meat had been pren - viously inspected and passed at the abattoirs; and it is not considered that the firm., deliberately attempted to supply diseased meat. Subsequently the Angliss Proprietary Limited tried to throw a slur on the Melbourne Municipal iCouncil, but it was resented ""and repudiated by that body. .",72
545,Mr SPEAKER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED, I ask the honourable member to say how he connects his speech with the Bill ?,73
546,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am referring to the proposed new sections 73c and 73D, in order to show that nothing short of i m prisonment ought to be inflicted when offences of this kind are repeated. The Melbourne Municipal Council denied that they ever sent out from their abattoirs any livers except for pigs' food and dogs' food; so that, if the livers .in question did come from the municipal abattoirs, their destination must have been changed to the diseased troopships. W . Angliss and Company Proprietary Limited have their own abattoirs, and they have repeatedly been found guilty of .breaking the Factories Act . I cannot accuse the company of having supplied this diseased meat designedly, but when it happens repeatedly in .the case of our soldiers, I ask what chance the general public have of escaping? Under the Bill .as it stands, the wealthy offender may escape on the payment of a fine, and even if a wealthy purveyor gives £ 5 0 0 to a patriotic f u n d , the public ought to know that it is possible to realise thousands of I pounds by the supply of infeisior and diseased meat.",73
547,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I know of a case where a wealthy offender was imprisonedi n England.,73
548,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"A wealthy offender can always escape if the penalty is fine or imprisonment, whereas he cannot escape if it be fine and imprisonment, as under the Oode Napoleon. However, the provision for proceeding by way of indictment may meet such cases as I have cited. It is always difficult to sheet home a cliarge of the kind to the wealthy proprietor of a large factory, but when we find diseased meat supplied two or three times, it ought to be regarded as primd facie evidence of guilt.",74
549,Mr BAMFORD,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Herbert) [9.30] - I would like the Minister to explain what is meant by the word "" detention,"" which occurs in several clauses. It seems to me that it opens up the possibility of discrimination. If a court martial finds any one guilty of an offence there should be no difference in the punishment meted out. One man should not be subjected to detention while another is subjected to imprisonment.",74
550,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [9.31] - The word "" detention "" is used not with the object of assisting any one to escape punishment or for the purpose of giving preference to any one, but because it is thought desirable that military., offenders should be subjected to military detention rather than be confined in gaols, where ordinary offenders against the civil law are undergoing imprisonment.

The first amendment deals with clause 12. As the clause left this House the Commissioner of Railways could be removed from office by the M in ister on an address praying for his removal being presented to the Governor General by the Senate and the House of Representatives in any one session, or by the House of Representatives alone in two, consecutive sessions. The effect of the Senate's amendment is that an address for the removal of the Commissioner must be passed by both Houses in one session. It is the practice that is adopted in most of the States, and I propose to accept the view taken by the Senate. Motion agreed to.

552,Mr WATT,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Balaclava-Minister ' for Works and Railways) [9.35] - Before the Bill left this House I introduced an amendment at ""the request of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), giving the Commissioner power to provide house accommodation for the employees of on terms and conditions to be determined by him. The amendment simply alters the position of the provision, and involves no substantial change. I move That the amendment be agreed to. Motion agreed to.

Senate's Amendment - After "" report "" insert "" and balance-sheet showing stocks on : Prohand, depreciation of property.""",74
553,Mr WATT,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways) [9.36] - The object of the Senate's amendment is to render more explicit the provision dealing with the production of balance-sheets for submission to the Minister. It is not the most convenient method of doing it , but I propose to accept the Senate's amendment. I move That the amendment be agreed to. Motion agreed to - I congratulate the Government on adConsequential amendment in clause 42 agreed to. Senate's Amendment - After clause 47 insert the following new clause :"" 47A. The Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1911 shall apply to the Eailway vice in like manner as it applies Public Service of the Commonwealth: Provided that in its application to the Eailway Service any reference in that Act to the Public Service Commissioner ' shall be read as a reference to the Commonwealth Bailways Commissioner.""",75
554,Mr WATT,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways) (9.37] - This amendment may be regarded as controversial. When the Bill was before this House some honourable members asked whether clause 47 provided for the fixing of wages by an Arbitration Court. I in formed honourable members that I was advised it did, but I promised them that if , on reconsideration of the matter, I found that the Bill was not quite clear on the point, I would make it so. I consulted the Solicitor-General, and he told me that there might be some doubt upon the point, and accordingly he was instructed to prepare an additional clause for introduction in the Senate to make clear the understanding arrived at in this chamber. Honourable members will see that the new clause provides that the Arbitration (Public Service) Act is to apply to the Railway Service in ' l i k e manner as it applies to the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Some honourable members may consider that we should not give the railway employees the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court of the Commonwealth. I have never hidden my view that it is a point of doubtful expediency and wisdom to give employees of the Commonwealth generally .the right to appeal to an Arbitration Court, but the law of the Commonwealth makes that right perfectly explicit and beyond any doubt, and as it is the established policy of the Commonwealth, there is no reason why officers - of the Commonwealth Railway Service should be denied a right which, is extended to officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. Until the Commonwealth revises the whole procedure, .there is no legitimate reason for making fish of one set of employees and flesh of another set. In that spirit, I move That the amendment be agreed to.",75
555,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Brisbane) [9.41]. hering to the principle of arbitration. In view of the attacks made recently on Mr Justice Higgins and on arbitration work generally, it is pleasing to hear that the principle of arbitration is not Ser- yet to be jettisoned, so far as the Comto the monwealth public servants are concerned, but the attitude of the Government is rather a peculiar commentary on the action of the New South Wales Government, which brought about the present industrial trouble in Australia.' It is well known that the refusal of that Government to employ the arbitration laws of the State to settle an industrial dispute brought about the present regrettable disturbance of which we have had evidence in the streets of Melbourne tonight.",75
556,Mr WEBSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It is not so.,75
557,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am content to hold more' firmly to my own opinion, that if the New South Wales Governmentl had been willing to accept their own arbitration laws, and adopt the arbitration method of settling an industrial dispute, we would not have had the trouble which we have had during the last month.",75
558,Mr WEBSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"The honourable mem-, ber knows that the matter did not come within the purview of the State Arbitration Court.",75
559,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"If that is so, why have we had all this denunciation of the Arbitration Courts which we have heard from Mr Cuming and others? Rightly or wrongly, buti in my opinion rightly, the Commonwealth has adopted conciliation and arbitration as a means of preventing and settling industrial disputes, but the system has largely failed, not because the principle of arbitration is wrong, but because the machinery of the Arbitration Court is unable to deal with cases quickly enough to prevent a dispute taking place.",75
560,Mr SAMPSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,It has failed because the organizations will not observe the awards.,75
561,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,Tb e honourable member knows that his statement cannot be substantiated by facts. There are on record more cases of violation of awards by employers than by employees. ,76
562,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"I am speaking of what the records show. The Arbitration Court has always had more difficulty with employers than with employees. I believe in the system of conciliation and arbitration, and I congratulate the Minister who, in spite of his personal predilections in the matter, bows to the will Parliament, and evidently, to the will of the Government, that, in the matter of approaching the Arbitration Court, the railway servants of the Commonwealth shall be given equal facilities to those already' extended to officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. This is a step that will commend itself to the railway employees, and will also have another effect of considerable value; it will offer a guarantee to the employees now in the Commonwealth service that there is no immediate intention of taking from them their right to approach the Arbitration Court. One can only hope that this principle may be extended until we can have an effective arbitration system to deal with industrial troubles, and I offer a suggestion to the Government, believing that both parties in the Blouse, and the community at large, are anxious to arrive at some system whereby we can avoid the ever-recurring industrial disputes. Would it not be possible to appoint competent men, especially those who have had experience in the Arbitration Courts of the State and the Commonwealth, to prepare a-comprehensive arbitration scheme that will enable us to deal quickly .and effectively with industrial troubles 1 Once - we have overcome the war nervousness, which makes everybody unsettled, .we shall.desire to settle down some system which will prevent these interferences, come from whatever source they may, with the continuance of our industrial activities. The system of arbitraTherefore, tion, which we here recognise should be applied to every section of the Commonwealth Service, without restriction and distinction, should be extended generally throughout Australia,' and would, I believe, commend itself to the great majority of the people.",76
563,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Wakefield) [9.47] - I am very strongly opposed to this amendment. The Minister has mentioned, as the particular reason why the Senate's wishes should be conceded, the fact that the Commonwealth Public Service generally has the Arbitration Court available to it. I do not believe in that principle. The alteration in the administration of the Public Service was resisted very strenuously by a considerable number of members now sitting on this side of the House, but was carried by an overwhelming force of numbers, at a time of when a good many vicious principles were introduced into the legislation of this. Parliament. In my opinion this amendment does not stand on all fours with the privileges enjoyed today by the Public Service, because a Railway 'Department is distinct from every other Department. It is supposed to be removed from political control. In the States there are Railways Commissioners whose business it is to administer the railways on commercial principles, and they are oharged with the responsibility of making the systems pay. It is a well-known fact that whoever deals with the payment of employees, and fixes their wages and conditions in any business,-controls that business to a large extent. The purpose of appointing. Railways Commissioners is to insure that the railways shall be managed free of political control. Unfortunately, that object is not always attained, but a Railways Commissioner cannot be made responsible for the successful manage-, ment of .his Department if he does not control it.",76
564,Mr WATT,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,I am afraid we cannot make this Department pay.,76
565,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"It cannot be made to pay in any case, whether the employees have the right to approach Ihe to Arbitration Court, or not, and we cannot have more industrial unrest in connection with the Commonwealth .Railways than we have had up to the present' time. in those respects, the intervention of the Arbitration Court cannot make the position any worse. But I wish to say broadly that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act has not operated in the direction of 'promoting industrial peace. That fact has been demonstrated abundantly during the last three months. The Court has become the storm-centre of industrial unrest. It has promoted a condition of affairs in the industrial life of the community which has been most disastrous. It has been a curse to Australian industries, which can never be built up, so long ^as we have a continuance of the conditions which have 'obtained in Australia since we have had the present arbitration influence in the Commonwealth. I maintain that tliere is a distinction between the railway services and the ordinary services of a Government., The accident, in another place. Eailway Service under the Commissioners has special privileges which no other partment of the Public Service enjoys. It has an Appeal Board, for instance, which men may resort if they aredissatis- > Bill was before the .Senate. fied with the dictum of the Commissioner. In the interests of the Railway Service, and ultimately in the interests of the it would be better for them to continue as they have done in Victoria and South Australia without the right of appeal the Arbitration Court. In the Australian Railways there has never'been a strike, and there is more satisfaction in that service than.' in . any other Railway Service in the Commonwealth. No doubt this amendment will be agreed but I express the hope-that before long there will be considerable revision of the conciliation and arbitration legislation of the Commonwealth.

574,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Brisbane) [10.1]. - I am glad that the Minister has taken this action with regard to the Senate's amendment. As amended by another place, this would be a general provision, but with the further amendment which the Minister has proposed, each individual case will have to be determined on its merits by Parliament.

577,Sir JOHN FORREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Swan-Trea surer) [10.7] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I desire to give honourable members a brief explanation of its provisions. Clause 3 contains the most important provision. It relates to the transfer to the' Consolidated Revenue of moneys standing to the credit of the Trust F u n d established by the Treasurer under section 62A of the A u d it Act, and known as the London Liability Account. In introducing the Budget. I explained that for some years it had been the practice of the Treasurer when goods were ordered in Great Britain to transfer from the Consolidated Revenue I'und to the credit of the London Liabilities Account moneys to pay for those goods on delivery. In this way money has been carried forward from year to year because in some cases two or three years have elapsed between the setting aside of the money and the time of payment for the goods. It is the usual practice for a Government, unless its Treasury is overflowing, to provide in each year for the expenditure of that year. I referred to that fact in my Budget Speech, and also informed honourable members that under the financial arrangement for this year it was posed to transfer £825,355 from the London Liabilities Account to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, that transfer being necessary if further taxation was to be avoided during the financial year. This amendment of the principal Act provides that the Treasurer may at any - time pay into the Consolidated Revenue Fund-in reality, pay back to the Consolidated Revenue FundAny moneys standing to the credit of the trust account established by the Treasurer under this section known as the London Liabilities Account, except moneys which have been paid into the London Liabilities Account out of the Loan Fund. In other words, it is only in respect of moneys belonging to the Consolidated Revenue that the Treasurer is to have any control under this Bill. balance of moneys lying 'to the credit of the London Liabilities Account on 30th March last was £4,591,776. Of that amount £2,925,291 belonged to the Consolidated Revenue and the balance of £1,666,485 was derived almost entirely from the Loan Fund, and therefore, will not be interfered with in any way under this Bill. Part of the £1,666,4S5 which was not derived from the Loan Fund consists of small amounts such as deposits for the completion of contracts. We propose this year to take from the London Liabilities Account £825,355 of the moneys rightly belonging to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. We think it better to do that than to impose fresh taxation this year.",78
578,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"Some part of this Bill is to be retrospective. Sir JOHN"" FORREST - That relates to quite another matter to which I am about to refer. Clause 2' involves no ques[85] tion of policy. It relates only to bookkeeping. Under the law as it stands, moneys received in respect of the hire and earnings of any vessel used, as a transport should be credited to revenue if the expenses are charged to revenue; but as the cost of transports is charged to the Loan Fund, clearly such a procedure would be wrong. The Treasury has been crediting to the Loan Fund moneys earned by transports, since transports are paid for out of Loan Account. It is desired now to legalize that process. It would be wrong to credit to revenue moneys received in respect of the hire and earnings of a vessel used as a pro- transport, seeing that the cost of that vessel is being .paid for out of Loan Fund. Such earnings should be credited to the fund from which the cost of the vessel is provided. This is merely the legalization of a bookkeeping practice which the Treasury has followed, and which is clearly the correct course, to. adopt.  When I held office as Treasurer, the amount to the credit of the London Liabilities Account varied from £900,000 to £2,000,000, or more. I should like to ask the Treasurer whether it is not a fact that the bulk of the money standing to the credit of that account is not operated upon by the Commonwealth Bank, which lends it out on short-dated loans, with the The result that it earns something like 4f per cent. Is not the Treasurer proposing to borrow from that fund, and will he not have to replace it later on?",79
579,Sir JOHN POEEEST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,"We are proposing, not to borrow it, but to transfer it to the Consolidated Revenue, to which it belongs. We shall have to replace it, of course, when we have to pay for the goods in respect of which money was put to the credit of the London Liabilities Account.  when the Treasurer requires to replenish that fund?",79
580,Sir JOHN FOBREST,TREATMENT QF RETURNED,We shall have to find the money.  the money will have to be cabled from Australia.,79

It is extracted from an American publication, The International Socialist Review, and deals with the matter of shop and factory control. It beginsThe war has precipitated a new discussion in the British Labour circles. This time it is the part that Labour is to play in the management of industry. The syndicalist movement, which had made many gains prior to the war, finds a partial expression in this new development, which will, no doubt, increase in force as time goes by, and the necessity for the reorganization of industry at the close of the war becomes more pressing. When Mr Lloyd George went to the Clyde last year to deal with the trouble in the work-shops, he returned with the conviction that the controversy, in its essence, was not between the Government and the workers, but was the evidence, of friction between fractions in the trade unions.",82

There is, without doubt, much fermentation in the British unions at the present time. The new spirit will manifest itself more fully at the close of the war. Then the controversy and conflicts will take many and various forms, but the earliest appears now likely to be that concerning the part of organized labour in management. This was actually projected into the Law Courts last .February, when several of the Clyde strikers were charged with violation of the provisions of the Munitions Act.
