The reason advanced by the Government for yearly payments ""that the lower level of inflation made twice-yearly payments inappropriate "" is not valid. Great injury will be caused to 920,000 aged, invalid, widows and supporting parents, who rely solely on the penReturn to Writ sion or whose income, other than the pension, is $6 or less per week. Once-a-year payments strike a cruel blow to their expectation and make a mockery of a solemn election pledge. Accordingly, your petitioners call upon their legislators to: 1. Restore twice-yearly pension payments in the Autumn session. 2. Raise pensions and unemployed benefits above the poverty level to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That a grave threat to the States of Indo-China arises from the policies of the Government of Vietnam. That, as a result of these ugees are fleeing their homes and risking starvation and drowning. Because of the failure of the rich nations of the world to provide more than token assistance, the resources of the nations of first refuge, especially Malaysia and Thailand, are being stretched beyond reasonable limits. As a wealthy nation within the region most affected, Australia is able to play a major pan in the rescue as well as resettlement of these refugees. It should be possible for Australia to: establish and maintain on the Australian mainland basic transit camps for the housing and processing of 200,000 refugees each year; mobilise the Defence Force to search for, rescue and transport to Australia those refugees who have been able to leave the Indo-China States; accept the offer of those resettle some thousands of refugees in Australia.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the sales tax as artisans is unfair. An artisan is a handcraftsman, or a handcraftswoman, who exercises a non agricultural activity, revolving around the transformation of materials with his own handwork or that of his family. On craft, above all, the accent must be on design, practicability and quality, perforce pay highly for his raw materials and time must not be a conditioning factor in the making of an article. This petition seeks the objective examination of the existing Sales Tax Acts in respect to persons seeking to earn their living by the labour of their hands alone. Every day, skilled artisans livelihood, not by the competition of machine made goods. not by high prices of materials, but by the injustice of antiquated Sales Tax Laws. The artisan, thus taxed out of his living, will then go onto unemployment benefits, or worse still, to prostituting his craft by sacrificing his professional integrity, forcing him to lower his standards of workmanship in order to conform to existing laws. We therefore request that a Sales Tax exemption be created immediately for all hand crafted articles. We also request that the current exemption limit of $ 1,400 and $1,000 respectively referred to in items 100-(1) and IOO-(2) of the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1935-1967, be immediately raised to a realistic figure, in line with current living standards, and from then on to be periodically reviewed so as to keep pace with the Australian standard of living.

The Fraser government's irresponsible proposals to sell off our Nation's interest in the Ranger Uranium Mine, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, and to dispose of other successful statutory corporations such as Trans Australia Airlines, would be contrary to the Nation's interests. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright proposals of the Fraser government to sell the Ranger Uranium Mine, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, Trans Australia Airlines, and other publicly owned enterprises. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Gippsland of the State of Victoria, respectfully showeth, that many Gippsland television viewers enjoy excellent reception of Melbourne based television stations, such reception of programs in the area has been of mutual benefit to both Melbourne and countiy commercial interests and country citizens generally. This good reception has been of particular benefit to many viewers in the central and western end of Gippsland who have experienced difficulty in having receivers pick up a clear signal from GLV 10. Most Gippsland TV viewers who receive Melbourne station signals have gone to considerable expense to provide special antennas and booster equipment. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that no action be taken which would prejudice the signal of Channels 7 and 9 being received in the Gippsland Region. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Nixon. Petition received. Television: Advertising of Alcohol To the Rt Honourable, The Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Ballarat respectfully showeth: We the undersigned citizens of Ballarat wish to express our great concern at the mounting road toll and at other forms of social troubles caused by excessive drinking. Whilst fully accepting the need for individuals to have freedom of choice, we wish to express our concern at the encouragement to drinking, particularly by young people, which is caused by the advertising We ask the Government to take action to restrict the advertising of alcohol on television in the same way in which it has restricted the advertising of cigarettes. We are deeply concerned about this matter and we ask our Honourable Members to give it their urgent consideration And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Short. Petition received. Importation of Fish To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition e.g. certain citizens of Australia (electors of the ision of Leichhardt) and other citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed restrictions on importations of inoffensive fish will severely restrict species most popular to aquarists whilst government releases of predators such as trout, gambusa and Nile perch can only be detrimental to the environment. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that sound reason will prevail and a more realistic view will be adopted resulting in the defeat of the proposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Thomson. Petition received. Pensions Television To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble Petition respectfully showeth: That the decision of the Australian Government to depart from its 1975 election promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 election campaign, that pensions would be increased twice-yearly in line with increases in the CPI, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. Your petitioners are impelled by this fact to call upon the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to review the above mentioned decision, and to determine. That pensions will be increased twice yearly in line with rises in the CPI as promised by the Prime Minister in his 1975 policy speech.

9,Mr FALCONER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,My question is directed to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and concerns representations which have been made to the Minister concerning the involvement of the Commonwealth Employment Service and its Professional Employment Office in activities already well covered by private employment agencies. Is the Minister aware that the ComNotice of Motion monwealth Employment Service has recently extended its temporary staff activity into Victoria where private agencies already offer comprehensive temporary staff services? What public benefit is being served by such duplication of effort? When will the Minister respond to the many representations he has received requesting him to define more precisely the proper areas of activity of the Commonwealth Employment Service and its Professional Employment Office.,36

I have also recently received a report from the advisory committee to the Commonwealth Employment Service. That committee held some discussions with representatives of the private personnel agencies. Out of both the representations I have received from members and the advice I have the received from the advisory committee, I hope that I will be able to establish a situation in which each section will have its own role in this field. what Historically the CES and PEO have always their services to employees or prospective this employees who want assistance in obtaining There is a role for the CES in the area of those and seeking temporary employment as well as those not seeking permanent full-time employment, but I do see a need to rationalise both areas.

13,Mr WILLIS,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I ask the Treasurer whether he is concerned that the already low level of consumer confidence has recently been further depressed as shown by State retail sales and motor vehicle registrations, and in particular by the publication last week of a poll which showed such confidence to be at its lowest ebb since such polls commenced five years ago? Is the Treasurer also aware that the pollsters have concluded that that alarming situation is due to a strong adverse reaction to the mini-budget of last May and to deep concern by consumers regarding their personal financial positions which will not be alleviated by marginal tax cuts? In view of these findings will the Treasurer now concede that as an exercise in economic management, the minibudget of last May was a disaster?",36
14,Mr HOWARD,THE PRIME MINISTER,My answer to the last part of the question is no. My comment on the first part of the question is that later today I will have a few things to say about a few of the matters raised and I invite the honourable member to come along. NA,37

Is he aware that when I visited at least nine of those countries, I found that Radio Australia was considered to be one of the most valuable and most useful ways by which the views of this country are expressed abroad? Will the Minister, therefore, take all necessary steps to see that Radio Australia is given a higher signal and more power so that our views can be well heard in world affairs?",37

Work on the limited restoration of the Shepparton installation has now been completed and in February 1978 the Government approved the restoration of the Cox Peninsula installation. Some limited repair work had been undertaken and some limited transmissions have taken place to improve the situation. There are other major developments, but because of the presentation of the Budget tonight I am prevented from making a precise announcement about the details of work to be undertaken in the next year. I can assure the honourable member that the Government has decided that the work will go ahead in the current financial year.

Has all the material pertaining to this matter now been made available to the Prime Minister?

18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The Australian Labor Party has sought to introduce this matter into this Parliament on many occasions, notwithstanding the fact that an inquiry is being conducted by Mr Finnane under the auspices of the New South Wales Labor Government. One would have thought that natural justice would require that while that inquiry is in train the matter should not be prejudiced by debate in this Parliament or any other place. If it were occurring before a court of law, that rule would prevail; but, because there have been developments in quasi-judicial tribunals and administrative tribunals since the time the rules of sub-judice were formed, these other tribunals and administrative inquiries are not covered by that rule. I do believe that once this particular case is out of the way this House should address itself to that question as a matter of great seriousness because the Australian Labor Party on every occasion has sought to prejudice the environment",37

The point I am making is that while it is conducting that inquiry honourable members should accept this matter without debate so that the atmosphere will not be poisoned against the report of that inquiry. Of course, the objective of the Australian Labor Party is to poison the public mind in relation to my colleague, the Minister, notwithstanding whatever Mr Finnane might ultimately report. I am advised that what the Minister has donefitsin with the pattern since he first became executor of his father's estate. He reported these matters to the Corpora.; Affairs Commission of New South Wales; he reported these matters to the Taxation Office and I am advised that he has taken all the actions he could to put the matters right. Against that background, the settlement which was consummated a few weeks ago is a further step in that process. have nothing to add on this matter.

The formula is designed to protect both the producer and the consumer. In my mind it is akin to the indexation arrangements which we and other governments advocate in conciliation and arbitration tribunals. Therefore I do not believe it to be in any way akin to a sweetheart arrangement. Of course, that term has a different connotation in the industrial sense. I hope that the New I South Wales Government sees fit to agree to the new proposals. I believe that it is very close to doing so. When we have that agreement, of course, complementary legislation will be of introduced into this Parliament and into each of the State parliaments.

36,Mr CHAPMAN,DISPUTE,"Is the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of the severe disruption being caused to production in the motor industry by an industrial dispute involving a minority of employees at the plant of W. H. Wylie and Co. Pty Ltd at Tonsley Park in South Australia? What are the consequences of this dispute tralian motor industry in general and the employees of Chrysler Australia Ltd in particular, many of whom live in my electorate of Kingston?",39
37,Mr STREET,DISPUTE,"I am aware of the critical situation which is developing in the vehicle industry in Australia as a result of action taken by unions at W. H. Wylie and Company Pty Ltd in Adelaide. In July members of the Australasian Society of Engineers banned overtime in pursuit of a $20 a week wage claim. That claim came before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which ruled that it was outside the wage fixation guidelines. The commissioner concerned recommended that the bans be lifted. On 8 August the company dismissed 10 employeesmembers of the ASE-for refusing to work reasonable overtime in accordance with the terms of the award. That was followed by strike action by the ASE and the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and also the establishment of a picket line. In combination those actions have drastically affected the delivferred ery of essential components to other vehicle manufacturers in Australia. Subsequent hearings have failed to resolve this dispute. I am informed that as a result the major vehicle manufacturers in Australia very shortly, perhaps as early as tomorrow, will be forced to stand down employees due to not getting essential components from Wylie's. These stand downs could be quite massive, and could involve Chrysler Australia Ltd in the honourable gentleman's electorate. This dispute highlights the selfish attitude of some unionists in pursuing excessive wage claims irrespective of what happens to their fellow workers. I am informed that the company has been prepared to discuss the issue at all times, provided of course that the picket line is removed. I believe that is an entirely proper attitude. NA",39

I refer to certain private companies which tax investigators have discovered to have understated their incomes by more than $500,000 and which have been ordered to pay $340,000 in back taxes, including $113,000 in penalty tax. Is it a fact that the Minister for Primary Industry has been a director of these companies for up to 20 years?

50,Mr NIXON,NEW ZEALAND,I must pay tribute to the honourable member for Denison for the consistent way in which he brings forward the problems of the electorate he represents and of Tasmania as a whole. His actions are in stark contrast with those of the members of the Australian Labor Party in this House. I have not had one question from them on Tasmania's behalf since I have been Minister for Transport. They prefer to follow the dirty path of smirching by innuendo that they have been following today.

The ball is really in the court of the airlines at the moment because we are awaiting further information as to details of costs, fare proposals and the like before the Australian and New Zealand Governments can come to final conclusions on the matter.

Does the Prime Minister know the source of the funds used to pay his former adviser and can he be sure they did not come from misappropriated funds?

60,Mr ANTHONY,AVGAS,"Some attention has been given to this matter in the last 24 hours by the Leader of the Opposition who has made some allegations which are somewhat unfounded. I assure the House that no avgas which should not have left the country has left it. In fact, no avgas that the Government could or would want to prevent from leaving the country has left it. There have been allocations of crude oil to our refineries for refining and distribution to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, including Fiji. This has been a traditional form of trade. To suggest, as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, that we should prevent those sales from taking place is virtually to say that we should seize somebody else's property. Because there is a shortage here, that does not give us any right of piracy regarding avgas which is destined for another place. The prices that were cited by the Leader of the Opposition were not accurate. They related to different periods.",40
61,Mr HAYDEN,AVGAS,"If your Department of Trade and Resources is reliable, they were accurate. you deny that they are accurate?",41
62,Mr SPEAKER,AVGAS,The Leader of the Opposition will remain silent.,41
63,Mr ANTHONY,AVGAS,The Leader of the Opposition made a number of allegations which are completely wrong and unfounded. He came to the completely wrong conclusions. The exports that took place were in March this year. It is true that they were recorded in April by the Commonwealth Statistician. It is a matter for the Commonwealth Statistician to explain why they were recorded in April.,41
64,Mr HAYDEN,AVGAS,I see. The Government's figures are wrong and everyone else has to take the blame.,41
65,Mr ANTHONY,AVGAS,"It would not make any difference whether the figures were recorded in March or April because there was no shortage at that time. The facts are that we were not notified until May about a pending shortage of avgas. We immediately took action to see that all exports were being monitored. It is all right for the Leader of the Opposition to make a lot of noise now. He is obviously trying to win some goodwill amongst those people who are concerned about the shortage of avgas. Having explained the reasons and the details, if the Leader of the Opposition continues in the noisy way in which he is now going on, then it will show that he is nothing more than a hollow Leader of the Opposition.

66,Mr KEATING,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,"I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to his statement of 6 August in respect of the Ranger project and the Government's intention to sell control of yet another Australian resource. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: What criteria will the Government use to assess offers for the sale of its 50 per cent interest in the Ranger project? Will consideration be restricted to Australian interests or will the Government sell to any interest that offers the highest premium on its share of Ranger? If the latter is the case, does the Government intend at least to stand by its 75 per cent-2 5 per cent Australian equity policy for uranium deposits or does it intend to invoke the 50-50 approach developed for the Yeelirrie deal and thus run out on its own stated investment policy, its commitments to the Parliament with respect to uranium policy and the national interest?",41
67,Mr ANTHONY,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,I do not know whether to laugh or cry at the Opposition's new found interest in uranium and its concern about any actions which might take place which might inDo terfere with the development and the prospects of this very valuable economic resource to Australia. The Australian Labor Party has not been wanting to develop uranium.,41
68,Mr UREN,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,Can' t you sell it?,41
69,Mr ANTHONY,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,I am glad to see that the honourable member for Reid has woken up. The mention of the word 'uranium' generally does wake him up. It is nice to know that he is still here. The Labor Party has wanted this resource left in the ground.,41
70,Mr KEATING,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,We still do.,41

72,Mr KEATING,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I have asked a specific and detailed question relating to the Government's investment policy in relation to a deposit of uranium, and I am entitled to a specific answer to that question.",41
73,Mr SPEAKER,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,The right honourable gentleman's answer is relevant to the question. The honourable gentleman cannot call for the right honourable member to answer in the way in which the honourable gentleman wants. The answer is relevant.,41
74,Mr ANTHONY,RANGER URANIUM DEPOSIT,"There is a vast difference between the philosophy of the Government and that of the ALP. The ALP wants to take over ownership and instigate the nationalisation of Australian resources. When the Labor Party was in office it started this process of taking over partownership of various resources. When we came to office, we declared that we would relinquish and divest the Australian government's interests in various projects such as Wambo, Cooper Basin, Mareeba and Mary Kathleen. These are areas in which action has been taken to divest the Commonwealth interest to allow the private sector to get on with development. Because of the attitude of the ALP we saw development of these valuable resources come to a standstill. Nothing took place in this country. It was largely as a result of this that we saw the development of so much business stagnation and unemployment. Therefore, the Government's attitude is that it should get out of these enterprises. There was a memorandum of understanding into which the Labor Party elbowed its way to get control of 50 per cent of this resource. It tually bludgeoned Peko and EZ into this arrangement. That is history now. It took place under a Labor Government. We are now examining the question of whether the Government should remain in this joint project. We are looking at the matter now because we believe that it is the opportune time to do so. The project is under way. We have managed to usher the project to a point where it is proceeding to develop. We have to make marketing arrangements. Often marketing arrangements can be on a long term basis. If it were ever suggested after these marketing arrangements were made that the Government might divest itself of its interest that would limit the potential buyers of such a project. What we are doing now is seeking out those people who might be interested in taking over the Government's ownership. To this time approximately 40 companies have shown an interest in buying the Government's share. I think that this completely exposes the falseness of the argument of all those people who say that there is no market for or interest in uranium. Forty companies are prepared to take over the Government's interest. We will be looking at all of these proposals. We will then assess what action the Government ought to take-whethe r it should divest itself of the whole of its 50 per cent interest in accordance with its philosophy, whether it ought to divest itself of part of it or whether it ought to retain the understanding it has at the moment with the companies concerned; that is, to provide 72!6 per cent of the capital and retain 50 per cent of the production.

As the House would be very much aware virand as I have pointed out publicly recently, these reports were brought down to provide, in a sense, a discussion paper to allow groups in the Australian community to respond to the draft nature of the Industries Assistance Commission's thinking at this time. All parties will have an ample opportunity to respond to the IAC in the public hearings which it has scheduled. The House will also be aware that the policy for the industries concerned has been extended on the basis of the IAC report through to mid-1981. As for the final part of the honourable gentleman's question, I assure him that the Government, when taking decisions on the final IAC report when it comes before the Government, will do so on the basis of the most comprehensive information which is available to it. It will have regard to all the available policy options. NA",42
77,Mr HURFORD,SUCCESS OF BUDGETS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that, counting the mini-Budgets, tonight's Budget will be about the sixth Budget since he became Prime Minister nearly four years ago? Which of the past five Budgets has been most successful in achieving the result of pointing the Australian economy in the present direction of double digit inflation, record levels of unemployment",42
78,Mr SPEAKER,SUCCESS OF BUDGETS,"Order! The honourable gentleman is entitled to ask for information, but he is not entitled to argue.",42
79,Mr HURFORD,SUCCESS OF BUDGETS,"I am asking for information on which of the past five Budgets has been most successful in directing the Australian economy in the present direction; that is, to record levels of unemployment and higher interest rates.",42
80,Mr HOWARD,SUCCESS OF BUDGETS,"All I would say in response to the honourable member for Adelaide is that all Budgets and principal economic statements the Fraser Government, including those of May 1976 and May 1979, have made a far greater contribution to recognising the economic problems of this country than any Budget or statement produced by the Opposition No. 80 of 1979, when in government. UNITED STATES: BEEF SHIPMENTS",42
81,Mr OKEEFE,SUCCESS OF BUDGETS,"Can the Minister for Primary Industry advise the House whether shipments of of beef to the United States will fill the quota this year? If so, is there likely to be any distribution of shortfall? In either event, what is the effect of the announced introduction of counter-cyclical restraints on future levels of beef imports?",42
82,Mr SINCLAIR,SUCCESS OF BUDGETS,"During the first six months of this year the rate of shipment of beef to the United States was way above that required to meet the 12-month allocation within the United States quota. Accordingly, there will need to be some reduction in the rate of shipment during this next six months but it is expected that there will be no difficulty at all in meeting that quota. Indeed, we would hope that there might be an allocation of shortfall. If so, Australia would feel itself well and truly in a position to meet any cation that might be made to it. Last week, in north-west Western Australia, I ran into a number of problems at meat works. It seems that the rate of supply of cattle is likely to outstrip the present available allocation of quotas to those works. Therefore, I am sure there is no reason for anybody in Australia to feel that there is an inadequacy of livestock to meet the present quota entitlement in the United States. With respect to the counter-cyclical legislation, the honourable gentleman would know that the special trade negotiator of the United States Government, Ambassador Strauss, is due to confer shortly with my colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources with respect to the impact on Australia of the announcement by the American administration of its acceptance of terms with respect to shortfall allocation that differ from the original arrangements made within the multilateral trade negotiations. Both the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Resources, and I have written- I to the Secretary for Agriculture, Mr Bergland, and he to Ambassador Strauss-wit h respect to the impact of this decision on future tradeflowsfor Australia. However, there is no likely immediate impact on Australian exports of any decision with respect to counter-cyclical legislation. In the immediate future the general world supply of beef is such that markets are available in the United States and elsewhere around the world which will ensure the stability of the Australian beef industry. Therefore, while there is a concern in the medium term about the impact of this United States legislation, in the short term it is not expected that it will impair in any way the present prospects for a continued buoyant market condition generally abroad for Australia's beef exports.

Is he also aware that in Victoria alone the number of Housing Commission tenancies in arrears rose by over 50 per cent between February 1978 and February 1979 to nearly 14,000, which is 40 per cent of the Housing Commission tenancies in Victoria?",43

It announced by the Prime Minister at the recent Premiers Conference that we will be substanprivacy, tially increasing the funds available for rental housing through grants in the current financial year. The sum of $ 100m will be provided to the States for rental accommodation. The important point is that this money is to be provided by way of grants and not by way of advances, as in past. Therefore, this is money that the States not have to repay. It will assist those in need. will assist pensioners in particular. It has been announced that $30m will be provided for 1978. pensioners. Additional funds will be provided for Aboriginals. This money will certainly assist those in need of rental accommodation. The facts do not support the contentions of the honourable member for Reid.

107,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented?,44
108,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes. During Question Time in a question to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) intimated two facts which I would like contest. Thefirstmatter was a suggestion that I 48 had been a director of the Walsh group of by companies for more than 20 years. Whilst, nominally, I had been a director I played no part in the operations of those companies other than in signing a very few forms and then at the behest of my father. During that time, in fact, I did not even meet members of the companies nor play any part in any of the affairs of that group until my father's death in 1976. The second matter was one in respect of allegations that in some way as a result of my association with these companies I had been involved in manipulating their financial affairs and so minimising tax. Indeed, directly, the reverse is true. It was as a result of my actions, which I disclosed in this House nearly two years ago, that the whole of the affairs of the company were brought to the notice of the Commissioner of Taxation and then not by me. So as to avoid personal involvement, accountants and solicitors on my behalf advised the Commissioner of Taxation. It was directly as a result of that action the Commissioner of Taxation became aware of these matters. Of course, since my instruction of independent chartered accountants to bring those books up to date, the Commissioner of Taxation has, in continuance, been involved in ensuring that there has, in fact, been a complete meeting of the necessary tax obligations. I would suggest that some of those members of the Opposition who are so anxious to query me on this matter might well have their own affairs investigated to the same degree.",44

Mr Speaker, you can see from the process of Parliament over the last two years that these matters are coming out very painfully, bit by bit. The situation will not be helped if we are to be frustrated in questioning the Minister about some of these affairs. He now takes the course of reading out what he thinks is to his benefit.",45

This is the first day of this sessional period and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has been interjecting continually and speaking while I am speaking.

119,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes. The Minister for Primary Industry has denied the whole thrust of the question which I raised in this Parliament and has sought to use a personal explanation to give an explanation. He should give an even more detailed explanation to this Parliament to allow debate to ensue. The situation is that the Minister for Primary Industry has signed documents,45
120,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable gentleman is not making a personal explanation to putrighta misrepresentation. The honourable gentleman is debating the matter. He is debating it and I will not permit that.,45
121,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Minister in his personal explanation referred more that once to the statement explicit in my question which I directed at Question Time today to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and which affected the Minister for Primary Industry. Therefore, I think I am entitled to put another point of view. Mr Speaker, you have allowed the Minister to canvass this issue fairly broadly. He has sought to argue, in circumstances designed to prevent debate in this House, that he is not a responsible director of certain family companies which were the subject of that question. Mr Speaker, I am putting it to you that there is a misrepresentation both of fact and of my question in that he has signed certain documents. I might say that there are serious inconsistencies in signatures purporting to be his signature over a certain time",45
122,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. That is not a personal explanation. It is pursuing debate.

My point of order that the moment the Minister chooses to raise these issues in this way-it is his choice-thos statements become the property of the House. such-this is the point upon which I seek your guidance-thes e matters ought to be quite properly the subject of questions in Question Time gentleman and we should be able to refer to them. Otherstand wise we are getting into the difficult situation which a Minister can get up and say that interpret although he is a director of a company he is not personally responsible, that he is some kind of other nominal defendent.

127,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I take the point that the honourable member is making. The fact is that I can only interpret Standing Orders. If the Legislature honourable gentleman is dissatisfied with Standof ing Orders, then it is a matter for moving change the Standing Orders. But, as the Standing Orders exist relating to questions, questions without notice are confined to those things for which the Minister has an official responsibility to the House. There is no official responsibility to the House for these matters of a private nature. honourable gentleman says that because the on right honourable Leader of the House has introduced into the House certain material way of a statement or personal explanation today, then that in some way transforms the Island, Standing Orders and what the Standing Orders Australia permit. It does not do that. The right honourable sented gentleman has taken the opportunity that is presented by the Standing Orders to do what he has done.

133,Mr KILLEN,BENEFITS FUND,"Moreton-Minister for Defence). For the information of honourable members. I present the second report by the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board, together with a companion repon to the Board by the Australian Government Actuary, on the assets and liabilities of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund at 30 September 1972.1 seek leave to make a short statment relating to the report. Leave granted.",47
134,Mr KILLEN,BENEFITS FUND,"In 1973 following a report from a joint select committee of the Parliament, lation was introduced to establish the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme with effect from 1 October 1972. That scheme superseded the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme. Provision was made in the legislation for the assets of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund totalling over $160m at book value to be transferred to the Commonnew wealth. Under the new arrangements, the Comwhich monwealth assumed responsibility for the paythere ment of all future benefits to beneficiaries under the new and superseded schemes. An undertakMalcolm ing was given by the Government of the day to arrange an actuarial investigation of the fund, i.e., the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. Its purpose was to ascertain whether the assets transferred were more or less than and reasonable to meet the fund liabilities assumed by the Commonwealth. The administration of the affairs of the superBonnett, seded scheme is vested in the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board. Itsfirstreport on investigation which I tabled in the Parliament 28 April 1976 dealt with DFRB pensioners at September 1972. An amount in excess of $8m was distributed to eligible pensioners. The further report I have just tabled deals with tributors including first those transferred to DFRDB scheme and second, those who constill tributed for portion of the period, 1 July 1964 30 September 1972, but with pensions falling due before 1 October 1972. The latter group par Mr ticipated in the 1976 distribution arrangements. The report reveals that the value of the releven evant assets attributable to transferred contribuing tors was not more than was fair and reasonable to meet the fund liabilities assumed in respect of them. There are therefore no surplus monies gift as a funher earnest commitavailable for distribution. It deserves to be clearly understood that this conclusion has been reached by an actuarial investigation of the fund, a report by the Actuary and a consideration of that report by the DFRB board. These procedures are conducted on a completely independent basis.",47
135,Mr SCHOLES,BENEFITS FUND,"by leave-The Opposition does not quarrel with the statement made by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). The Actuary has in fact reported that surplus funds do not exist. There will be considerable disappointment among a number of members who have been members of both funds and had some expectation that some distribution would take place. I do not think it is unrealistic to say that those who did in fact transfer from the Delegisfence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme would have obtained substantial benefit from that transfer and from the introduction of the new fund, far in excess- I would have thought-of the possible excess contributions that they may have made prior to the introduction of the new scheme under the terms of the scheme, had it been applied in retrospect, I am not sure is a good policy. However, is still an outstanding matter arising from the change in the fund. The Prime Minister (Mr Fraser) has given undertakings that he would make certain alterations to the fund, and the Government has indicated that it has had them under study for some time. The people who expect those alterations are becoming doubtful was fair that they will ever take place. During the period 1975 to 1977 a former member for Herbert in this House, Mr Duke was given the responsibility of operating as a committee of one to inquire into the the disadvantages of pensioners under the DFRB on scheme as compared to persons who retired sub30 sequently under the new scheme, especially in the period shortly after transfer. Mr Bonnett completed his report and presented it to the conPrime Minister, after he had ceased to be a the member of this Parliament. I understand that he had the imprimatur of the Government and to the Prime Minister, in that it was a governmentsponsored inquiry. I point out to the House that Bonnett had to pay for his own typing and assistance as the Government refused to provide basic reimbursement for his work in preparthe report for the Government. I think that is just an indication of the petty meanness which most governments would not indulge in. Apparently the present Prime Minister did not want the report and therefore did everything possible to make it difficult to be presented. The fact is that the report has now been in hands of the Government for over 18 months. No indication has been given to anyone as to whether the report will be acted upon and yearly whether those retired persons, who are under substantially reduced conditions compared to persons who retired under the new scheme, will in fact have the anomalies removed. The difference in pension between that of a person who retired on 1 January 1974 and that of one who retired on 1 December 1972 is up to $2,000 a year, even though the rate of contribution for the latter was higher in comparison to his salary at that time. The Government has an obligation to consider the report which the Prime Minister authorised and that the parties informing the Government approved. If the Government inthan tends to reject the report it ought to say so. does not intend to reject the report it ought dicate what action it will take. Persons who tired from the defence forces in 1972 or earlier are getting older and if the Government waits long enough it will not have to act on the there will be no one left as a beneficiary of the fund. I ask the Minister for Defence to take matters into consideration. I understand that the Prime Minister has the carriage of that report and I seek from him an undertaking that he will consider it. If it has been considered I ask him act upon it. NA 1979 REVIEW Ministerial Statement",47
136,Mr JOHN MCLEAY,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,Pursuant to section 6 of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 19731 present the Remuneration Tribunal Review 1979. This report was distributed to honourable members during the adjournment. I seek leave to make short statement. Leave granted.,48
137,Mr JOHN MCLEAY,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"I shall be introducing legislation to give effect to changes to the Tribunal 's determinations which I announced on 20 June, as soon as is practicable. These changes will apply to automatic adjustment of members' and senators' salaries on a twice yearly basis, and to the increases determined for Ministers and office holders of the Parliament. In the case of private members and senators, the Tribunal took into account the 4 per cent national wage increase of December 1978 and determined a new basic rate of $26,720. The Government is prepared to accept this rate and the increase flowing from the last national wage case decision, but it the could not agree to the Tribunal's proposal that national wage case decisions apply automatically, that is, under present arrangements, twice adjustments. Steps will be taken to ensure that automatic application of national wage case decisions on a twice yearly basis will not apply. The Tribunal also proposed increased salaries and allowances for Ministers and office holders of the Parliament. In some cases, these go well beyond what indexation would have yielded. While the Government recognises that the objective of the Tribunal was to see some readjustment of relativities in this field it is unable to accept the proposals. To do so would have the effect of granting proportionate increases greater those received by the majority of Australian If it wage and salary earners. Accordingly, the to in Government will take steps to increase present resalaries for Ministers and parliamentary office holders only for indexation increases since the last review, including any increase flowing from report; the last national wage case decision.",48
138,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"by leave-The Opposition notes what the Government has said. It gives us a chance to indicate again that the Government is using some sort of confidence trick by saying that full to indexation must not be granted to people in this country when they are earning their living. It has become a ploy of the Government to suggest that members of the Parliament and others are pacesetters in that area. I am happy to advise members of the Parliament that if they look at the report they will see that the members of the Tribunal are not at all persuaded by this illogical argument. In fact, they point out that the remuneration of others, particularly in State administrations and local government, is far and away above what is paid to office a holders, members of Parliament, judges and others in the Federal sphere. They also advert to the fact that people in Qantas Airways Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank are leaving those statutory organisations because they can look after themselves better in the private sector. The point we wish to make as an Opposition-w e do not wish to emphasise it too much-is that there is always a chance for a Prime Minister or an Executive to play politics by saying: ' I am going to set an example by not taking the increase'. Let us have a look at the assets and other income of many of these gentlemen. They are very substantial indeed. These gentlemen would not require any increase. We want to try to establish the principle that the Parliament should not try to set its own members' salary. We believe that it should be referred to a tribunal. We believe that evidence should be given to that tribunal and when the tribunal makes a decision the Parliament should stick with that decision. Why have a situation where one can play politics, as can happen, by coming in and saying: 'The Tribunal has all the evidence. It has heard our submissions. But we are not going to agree with what it has decided'? I do not think that anybody in the country would agree with that. It does not do us justice at all. From the point of view of the people outside it does not give the Parliament any dignity or credibility. It is the Opposition's considered view that, matter having been submitted to a tribunal, there should be no power of disallowance. This affords an opportunity to go and argue the case before tribunal. I note with interest",48
139,Mr BAILLIEU,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,You disallowed it for 1975.,49
140,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"I do not think that we the made the right decision. Let us put it on record; do not let us hide it. I want to make a further point. Twice-yearly indexation is not going to be adhered to, just because that has been recomdown mended by the Tribunal. We can relate it directly to the fact that the Government has failed to here to its promises in respect of pensioners. That was the sole reason for this decision. I hope twice-yearly indexation of pensions tored this evening. Let us hope that this Government gets back to some of the promises that it shadow has broken. Most of the objections to any inmember creases in parliamentary salaries were directly the related to pensioners. A number of pensioners ants. made protests. I note with interest that those protests were forwarded to the Government by the Tribunal; so they must have done some good. Some 157 pensioners protested on the issue not getting twice-yearly indexation. That is the point that the Opposition wishes to make. Why not agree with what the Tribunal has said? It should not be interfered with because we get into the realm of politics where people who are very well endowed and are occupying senior positions will say: 'We will be pacesetters'. This is nonsense. Nobody outside cares a tinker's cuss as to what happens, provided it is decided in fair and proper fashion and provided evidence can be given. I would invite some of the editors who write these editorials to get into the witness box in front of the Tribunal, where some of could ask them a few questions as to their rate of salary and their behaviour. All we ever get from them is a downgrading of the Parliament. In order to get an effective Parliament we must attract the best people. They are not going to come on the basis that they are wealthy people; they are entitled to come on merit. Finally, let me have a look at another matter which is of concern. It relates to the Opposition. We made a submission, which we again make, as to the staff to which the Opposition feels it is entitled. We should at least be able to match some of the resources of the Government which has all the bureaucracy and administration right behind it. While Ministers might need substantial aid, they get plenty of staff to help them. The Opposition has to try to match them with very limited staff indeed. In 1978 we made a recthis ommendation to the Tribunal with which the Tribunal agreed, but it was not adhered to by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Prime a Minister made an administrative decision that the Tribunal's decision was not right and cut back the staff of the Opposition, despite the fact that he has increased his own staff, allegedly on basis of increasing his standing in public life. He has a special Press group that is conducting a public relations exercise. He ought to dismiss the whole lot of them because his popularity rating is to 29 per cent. From our point of view we still have to try to match the resources of the buadreaucracy and everybody else who is able to help the Government. This point is adverted to in the that report. Paragraph 35 of the report of the Rewill be resmuneration Tribunal reads: In the 1978 Review the Tribunal expressed the view that Ministers should be provided with an additional of staff, such staff member to be employed under terms and conditions which applied to electorate assistThis was implemented only in part. We reiterate that we see a need for the additional staff as then recommended. I suggest that the Government, and in particular the Prime Minister, review these considerations. of Let him forget about the Boeings and other things that he is now giving to himself, and talk about facilities for a democratic Opposition.",49

142,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"I am coming on, on the basis of what people think. While I come on, the honourable member may go out if he is not careful. It was on the basis of economic management that we could not get this staff. Yet the a Government squanders millions on resources for the Prime Minister who made that decision. I would say that if he had put the same proposition to his back bench it would not have been agreed us to. These decisions are made in one office and they are deemed to be the decisions of a government. They are not. I doubt whether any one of the honourable members opposite has ever discussed them in the party room. It is on that basis that the Opposition raises this objection. Every honourable member opposite knows that what I am saying is fair and reasonable and that not one of them has had the chance to discuss it. If honourable members opposite want to run along with the one-man band proposition, that is their problem; it is not ours. On that basis I say future we want decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal adopted without any further debate in this Parliament and we should not have this nonsense about so-called or phoney pacesetting legislation that is going to affect the standard of living outside. We know that the Government does not want the workers to get an indexation increase. We do. To use parliamentarians and others as pacesetters is a phoney exercise.",49
143,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"by leave-I express some degree of surprise at the statement that has been made. I did not know that the statement was to be made today, but of course that could be in accordance with the normal processes of the House. I would have liked the statement to have been discussed with the Government Members Committee before it was made. That would have been a part of the normal process. One would hope to look at the legislation when it is introduced.",50
144,Mr DONALD CAMERON,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"by leave-As a member of the Parliament and as a member on the Government side of the Parliament, I am not stating any opposition to the decision that was taken some weeks ago in relation to this matter. However, as a private member on the Government side I believe that at the very least there should be some consultation with members on this side of the House before arbitrary decisions such as this are taken on our behalf.",50
145,Mr SCHOLES,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"by leave-The statement made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr John MCLeay) is incorrect in that it says that the Government cannot agree with indexation. The recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal is that the decisions in the national wage case be applied in the terms in which the national wage case decisions are given, which is not indexation in the true meaning of the word. The other remark I make relates to the provision of staff for the Opposition. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) reduced by six the number of persons recommended by the Tribunal. He allocated five persons to the back bench of the Government, which was not recommended by the Tribunal. Therefore those staff members are additional to those made available to the Opposition. He then changed the terms under which the appointments of staff were to be made in such a way as to make the financial obligations on the Government similar or more than would have been the case had he implemented the Tribunal's recommendations. It was not a cost saving exercise; it was an exercise in semanthat in tics. He exceeded the Tribunal's recommendations in relation to Government members. I do not object to what was done in that regard. However, he refused to implement the Tribunal's recommendations in relation to the Opposition. Had he done so it would have meant no additional cost to the Government.

146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The use of a selective and disguised S2,000m petrol tax on motorists to hide the real impact of the Prime Minister's high tax policies. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",51
147,Mr KEATING,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The Opposition raises as a matter of public importance the following matter: The use of a selective and disguised $2,000m petrol tax on motorists to hide the real impact of the Prime Minister's high tax policies. We raise this matter of public importance because we think it is about time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government were brought to book for masquerading as a low tax government. In fact the opposite is the case. The Prime Minister and the Government have indulged in tax policies which have moved from direct income taxation to indirect taxation. Such policies unfairly impinge on low and middle income earners and penalise them differentially in comparison with people on higher incomes. During the three years the Fraser Government has been in office taxation receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product have been significantly greater- I want to stress that point-tha n was the case under the Labor Government in the three years between 1972 and 1975. The myth is that this Government is a low tax government. Of course it is not. It is a high tax government and the Prime Minister has tried to dupe the public by saying that he has kept taxes down. He wants the public to believe that he is a tax cutter when in fact the opposite is the case. There has been speculation in newspapers of recent days that in tonight's Budget some personal tax cuts may be announced or that tax indexation may again be taken aboard.",51
148,Mr BAILLIEU,ASSENT TO BILLS,Or both.,51
149,Mr KEATING,ASSENT TO BILLS,"O r both. The Prime Minister may do those things in an attempt to regain credibility from his base of 29 per cent acceptance by the Australian public in relation to the way in which he is handling his job and in an attempt to convince the public that he is keeping promises, practically all of which have been broken. Promises made by the Prime Minister in TAXATION a number of election campaigns have been broken quite unashamedly. This has been done in clear view of the public, so the public is aware of his actions. Now the Government is contemplating attempts to regain credibility. After all, it has a Prime Minister who cannot be believed. Nobody can believe the present Prime Minister. The Government is thinking about going into an election campaign with a leader the public does not believe. It intends to look at ways in which to gild the lily with taxation cuts after it has collected $2,200m in tax from the motorist. Let us look at the way in which the Governyear. ment has operated. It has put the emphasis on direct taxation. The public will remember that last year's Budget the price of whisky increased from $5 or $6 a bottle to $ 11 or $ 12 a bottle. price of beer and cigarettes increased. All these increases were in the form of indirect ation. The Government in its mini-Budget would abolished the 40 per cent subsidy for health surance. So the costs have been borne by the public by way of indirect taxation. The greatest increase by way of indirect ation has been in the case of petrol. In the years that the Fraser Government has been office the price of petrol has risen by 100 cent; it has gone from 60 cents a gallon wholesale to $1.20 a gallon. Since Mr Fraser has been Prime Minister the average motorist with 12-gallon tank has paid an additional $7.20 per public. tank full of petrol. I will put it another way. This year Australian consumers will spend about $3,000m for products from oil produced in ment Australia. Of that $3,000m, $2,500m will go called straight to the Fraser Government's tax coffers. It will be collected by way of the crude oil levy. The public may be at a loss to understand this subterfuge or sleight of hand has been worked on them. It has been done very simply. The public may believe that the Organisation Petroleum Exporting Countries or the Arabs in ing $3,400m. the Middle East are responsible for this policy. In fact Australia is dependent on imports for only one-third of its crude oil requirements. So we must pay the going world price for one-third of our requirements. However, for the other twoit thirds we can pay whatever price the Govern the ment determines. Until three years ago the price was $2.09 a barrel. The Government has now deSince termined that the Australian public will pay equivalent of $18.66 a barrel. It has done this the hoax of implementing a policy of import ity in respect of old discoveries. In other words, the Government, by the ence of a low cost oil field in Bass Strait, has option of deciding the proportion of the value import parity it may charge for oil produced in Australia from a low cost oil field. It has decided to give the producers $5 a barrel and to keep $ 13.66 a barrel for itself. From that $5 a barrel, $2 is collected by way of company tax. So the Government keeps $ 15.66 for itself producers $3. This has nothing to do with the Arabs; it has nothing to do with OPEC. It was a decision made by the Fraser Government, resulting from its obsession with the Budget deficit, to collect $2,200m. Until the latest OPEC increases the rate of collection was about $ 1,250m in a full When the increases from the OPEC states inbecame effective, the Government thought that it in was an opportunity to grab another $900m and to blame it on the Arabs. So the Government anThe nounced that two-thirds of domestically of produced oil would be charged for at the world taxprice. Once again the motorists and farmers pay through the nose. As a result of that indecision the Government gained $850m. Perhaps tonight it will give back a little of that money. But if it does so it will not be done against taxthe backdrop of election promises. All the three Government will be doing is taking $2,200m in with one hand and giving back a small proper portion of it with the other hand. So if the Treasurer (Mr Howard) does any gladhanding tonight let it be clearly understood that no real a return of moneys will be made to the Australian In addition to the $2,200m that the Governis collecting, it collects $95 lm from what is the refined products excise; that is, the ordinary pump tax which always has been imposed on petrol. So the Government is collecting $2,200m on crude oil, $95lm on petrol, $250m how on company tax from the windfalls and $100m on company tax from the revenue from Bass Strait. On one commodity alone-oil , petrol and of petroleum products-the Government is collectThe Australian motorists who are listening to the broadcast of this debate while driving home in their cars and the farmers who are listening to on their farms should know clearly now that Government is getting 11 per cent of its total budgetary receipts from one commodity alone. this Government has been in office it has the collected roughly $2,500m more from petrol. by The rising costs, the inflationary impost and the parcrushing burden upon the lower income earners of indirect taxes by way of petrol pricerisesare of course the express policy of the Fraser existGovernment. It does not have to charge the the world price for the oil produced in Australia, of which is two-thirds of Australia's consumption of oil. It does so simply to enable it to hide behind the subterfuge that the prices are being increased by the Arabs, that this selective and disguised tax of $2,200m is caused by the Arabs. It is caused by the Fraser Government's rapacious greed for and gives the budgetary revenue. It is worth recounting simply the way in which the Fraser Government has spent money since it has been in office. It put itself up as a low ing, low tax government. In fact, Budget outlays as a proportion of the gross domestic productthat is the only way one can look at them-hav e increased in real terms from the 28.1 per cent average during the three years of office of the Whitlam Government to 30 per cent now. The same has been done with taxation receipts. This Government is the highest tax government Australia has ever had-in real terms, not in money terms. The Government will collect roughly an additional $ 1,000m by way of the crude oil levy just from the middle of this yearnot from before that, just from the latest increases. It will receive $850m and the company tax on the windfalls to the Bass Strait producers. That $ 1,000m represents $200 in taxation for every civilian employee in Australia. That is not just a small proportion or a surcharge; it is $200 per annum for every civilian employee from that increase. That is apart from the additional $ 1,300m imposed before the recent increase; it involves just the increases since May-June of this year. Honourable members opposite should be ashamed of themselves as a government. They masquerade as members of a low-tax government when in fact they are slugging the backside off every motorist and consumer of petroleum products in Australia and placing the burden of revenue raising more and more upon indirect taxes. The switch to the imposition of indirect taxes a tragedy. Indirect taxes are indiscriminate. No assessment is made of one's capacity to pay. That means that low income earners, the small person with his motor car or even small farmers and small businessmen alike, are paying through the nose by way of indirect taxes on petrol. If that kind of tax were levied according to one's come it would be assessed on the person's pacity to pay. Instead of that the low income earner, as always, is hit the hardest. This product of the policy of the present Fraser Government. The move to import parity supby posedly was applied in the interest of the vation of oil. The Government said that it was increasing the price, otherwise people would the oil too quickly. What has happened? In fact there has been no drop in consumption. The latest figures released by the Bureau of fields Statistics-the ones for the first four months this year-sho w that the consumption of petcan roleum products increased by 5.2 per cent over the same period in 1978. The Department of $18.66 National Development-the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) is not here to answer the charge, by the way-predicte d spendthat demand would grow by 2.7 per cent. All the petrol companies are planning for higher and higher consumption in the next 12 months. They do not believe that the crude oil levy will retard consumption. The measure was introduced simply to raise revenue because of the Prime Minister's obsession with the Budget deficit. The Government might have been able to cover the Budget deficit this year but then came the windfall of the price increases agreed to at the meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna in June and July. Once the increases were announced the Government saw that it could raise another $800m or $900m in tax in a full year and that this gave it certain budgetary options. No doubt tonight the Treasurer will make great play of any small handouts that the Government makes. Let the public understand clearly that even if the speculation is true Australians will not get anything like the amount that the Government has collected by way of the crude oil levy, the refined product excise or any of the indirect taxes which have operated in the last 12 months. The Government speakers who are to follow me in this debate will be back bench members. I see the Minister for National Development entering the chamber. I do not think that he will speak in this debate. He indicates that that is so. The Government will not even answer this charge. It will not even defend itself. It will put is up two obscure back bench members, who will not be here after the next election, to answer the case. No Minister will front to answer it. The Minister for National Development is on the edge of ministerial failure and of being removed from his office by the Prime Minister. He is a disgrace to his team. He has let it down through his inincompetence. The Treasurer will not come into cathe chamber to explain to the public why the Government is collecting S2'A billion in taxes is the from motorists and the consuming public. This levy is a massive sleight of hand. It is tax stealth, blaming the Arabs when in fact the conserGovernment has made a decision to link the OPEC price with the official price being paid by use Australian refineries for oil produced in Australia for 65c-no t dollars, cents-pe r barrel. Oil from Bass Strait is produced from the big at 65c per barrel and the Australian public of is charged $18.66 per barrel. In other words, we say that most of Australia's oil is produced at around $ 1 per barrel and the public is charged a barrel. The Liberal Party has broken its commitment to the Australian public about being a low tax party. It is the highest tax party Australia's history. The Fraser Government is the highest tax government in Australia's history. It is also a dishonourable government as it does not keep promises. It may try to discount the damage which has been done by in some way handing back a minute proportion of the massive collections it has taken by stealth from the motorist.",51
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS, see Order! The honourable member's time has have expired.,54
151,Mr COTTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It was ment's amazing to listen to the pipe-dreams of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). The Government makes no apologies for its fuel pricing policies and its energy policies. At least we have comprehensive pricing policies in the energy field. The Opposition has no such Not one item which came from the lips of the honourable member for Blaxland gave a positive indication of a policy which the Australian Labor Party or a Labor government would put forward in future. The Labor Party has no policies at all relating to pricing. The only possible alternative would be rationing or shortages of fuel. There no doubt that the honourable member for cheap Blaxland, in all his ramblings, ravings and realise dreamings, had nothing positive to say. He has been living in dreamtime. He has been out cloud nine somewhere. There are no worries about our policy. It is very comprehensive and positive, unlike the dreamtime policy of the Opposition.",54
152,Mr KEATING,ASSENT TO BILLS,I raise a point of order. Is honourable member for Kalgoorlie telling all constituents that he is in favour of higher prices?,54
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Dr Jenkins)Order! There is no point of order.,54
154,Mr COTTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,I am telling all my constituents that the Labor Party Opposition has no policy on energy or the pricing of fuels.,54
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! I remind the honourable member that he is addressing the House and that he should confine his remarks the House.,54
156,Mr COTTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The policies of the present Government at least have reversed the downtrend in exploprice ration and have caused a revision of our estialistic mates of fuel reserves in this country. It is a known, historic fact that the policies of the preconservation vious Government resulted in a severe downturn in our oil reserves. Exploration almost stopped in dead in its tracks. No oil exploration was being carried on at the end of 1975 and early in 1976. It is only because of our revised and positive policies that exploration again has picked up. Mr Wallis-How many wells?",54
157,Mr COTTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In 1978, 52 wells were drilled. In 1979 no fewer than 52 wells will be drilled and probably in excess of 80 or 90 wells will be drilled. If people look at the situation they will that the positive policies of the Government resulted in the known reserves of oil in this country being greatly increased. As this Governpricing policies have progressed, it has become economic to extract the uneconomic reserves of between 600 million and 700 million barrels of oil. That 600 million or 700 million barrels of oil that this country was not able to take out of the ground will now be taken out and policies. they will form part of our reserves. On top of our positive policy in pricing, energy resources and conservation, a research and development program is under way. This will lead to further development of alternative energy sources. It will also lead to further development of our oil reserves. The people of Australia well is and truly recognise that living in a dreamtime of fuel prices is completely unrealistic. They that fuel has to be paid for and they also realise that without an escalation in fuel prices, on as we have seen in more recenttimes,we would be desperately short of oil in this country. Mr Dawkins-Who wrote this speech?",54
158,Mr COTTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,This is quite amazing Mr Deputy Speaker. We on this side of the House the permitted the honourable member for Blaxland his to be heard in silence. I would hope that petrol members of the Opposition would return the compliment.,54
159,Mr KEATING,ASSENT TO BILLS,No you didn't. Baillieu cackled all the way through it.,54
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Dr Jenkins)positive Order! The House will come to order. Mr Dawkins-Where are your supporters? You have not got any. Who is listening?,54
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! The to honourable member for Fremantle will remain silent.,54
162,Mr COTTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is of the highest importance that the of petroleum products should be at a relevel allowing the pricing system to work. well This realistic pricing level will encourage the of scarce sources of energy, particularly liquid fuels other than liquefied petroleum gas. It will promote the use of available energy sources, mainly natural gas, LPG and coal. It will stimulate commercial development of major new energy projects such as shale oil. We have seen intense interest in developing Australia's massive shale resources. The pricing level will allow development of coal liquefaction and of the ethanol and methanol industries. All of these things are positive moves taken by this Government. The Labor Opposition has not put forward one positive alternative. It is important to remember that notwithstanding the import parity pricing of oil, Australians still pay much less for petroleum products than consumers in most Western countries. For example, to show just how unrealistic some members of the Opposition are, I point out that recently I was in several member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. For instance, I saw that in Korea the price of petrol the equivalent of $A4 a gallon; in Thailand it was about $A2.50 a gallon; in the Philippines it was about $A2.50 a gallon and in Hong Kong it was over $A2 a gallon. So other countries fully realise the value of having a realistic fuel price. There is no question that Australia's policies are, in fact, the envy of many countries. America wishes it had bit on the bullet some two or three years ago in respect of fuel prices and energy conservation. Today America is trying desperately to move towards some semblance of the policy which Australia adopted some two or three years ago. This Government's energy decisions are based on realistic prices for petroleum products. Countries which have been slow to face up to the reality of higher prices for oil have experienced shortages as a result of the world oil situation. We witnessed long queues and even shootings in California because of oil shortages in America. The honourable member for Blaxland said that we do not need to raise our prices beyond the 1974 level. He said that we could run the Australian oil industry at the 1974 level. If we adopted that approach there would be desperate shortages, today. People would have to queue for petrol and the farming, rural and manufacturing industries would be brought to a grinding halt. Perhaps that is the objective of the Australian Labor Party. Australia has no options. Like all industrial nations, it is heavily dependent on oil as an energy source. It is inevitable that consumers either will have to pay world parity prices for domestic crude oil or they will have to pay for imported crude oil. In the former case, we encourage exploration and development of our own resources. In the latter, we become dependent on foreign suppliers. In either case we will be paying world parity prices. That is the point that seems to have escaped the Opposition. Again I say that we make no apologies whatsoever for our present pricing policy. It has had a beneficial effect on the conservation of fuel in this country. Apparently many people do not realise how short our oil reserves really are. Unless we are able to conserve oil and establish new reserves we will be in pretty desperate straits in a few years time. As far as the amount of money that we have been able to pay into Consolidated Revenue from the fuel levy is concerned, I wonder whether the honourable member for Blaxland and the Opposition are in favour of continuing the 1974 oil prices. In so doing, this would deprive the pensioners of Australia of increased was benefits, because approximately 40 per cent of the money that is gathered from the fuel levy is expended on social welfare payments. Is the honourable member in favour of halving payments made to the people who are unemployed? Would he be in favour of raising personal income taxes substantially? I think that is probably the alternative that the honourable member is looking at. It is my opinion that the taxpayers of Australia are paying far too much personal income tax and for the honourable member for Blaxland to advocate higher taxation, lower pensions and lower social welfare payments is absolutely unacceptable. In addition to the Government's pricing policies we have also established several new initiatives in the conservation of fuel. We have dropped the octane rating on supergrade motor spirit from 98 to 97 and the Commonwealth Government has requested the New South Wales and South Australian Governments not to proceed with the third stage of the emission control legislation because it would have a fuel penalty of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent. The Labor Party supporters obviously dislike the people who live in remote areas and in clean air areas. They have no thought for the penalty that they impose on people who live in rural areas and remote areas of Western Australia. They have no time for the farmers, no time for the fishermen and notimefor the people who have no problem at all with air pollution. Because Sydney has an atmospheric problem in that it suffers atmospheric pollution, members of the Labor Party want to penalise the rest of the nation simply to clean the air of Sydney. But what they forget about the problems of Sydney is that all sorts of other industries and machines are putting harmful emissions into the air. The oil refineries and the humble two-stroke lawnmower put a considerable amount of pollution into the air of Sydney. Yet no thought is given by the honourable member for Blaxland at looking at emission controls and at other methods of cleaning the air of Sydney. The honourable member for Blaxland goes on about using $2,000m in petrol taxes to benefit the Australian taxpayer. He reckons that that is not a good thing. I ask the honourable member: 'What would be the alternative area of expenditure for the income that has been raised?' Would he advocate that the oil companies reap the benefit of that huge increase in oil prices? Would he advocate that the oil companies run off with that sort of money and that the pensioners and the unemployed people of Australia should suffer, while the taxpayers of Australia suffer even more? The answer is no. I put it to honourable members that the honourable member for Blaxland does not have any positive ideas; he does not have a positive policy that could be put forward as a comprehensive energy and pricing policy in Australia.",54
163,Mr KEATING,ASSENT TO BILLS,That is the last time the Governelectorate ment will put you on.,56
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS, onlyfivemiles Order! The honourable member for Blaxland should set an example. I call the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.,56
165,Mr COTTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy the Speaker. The honourable member for Blaxland is obviously performing like a political vandal the moment with no thought at all for the quesfor tion before the House. This Government has taken positive strides in this area. It has a positive policy. It is not ashamed of what it has utilising the income from that additional fuel tax in most comprehensive and sensible ways. It would not be a party to allowing the fuel companies to rip off huge extra amounts of money, nor would it see the taxpayers or the sioners of Australia suffer.",56
166,Mr JOHN BROWN,ASSENT TO BILLS," I increases almost feel sorry for the honourable member Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter); not only is he staring defeat right in the face in the forthcoming general election, but as somebody has suggested, he apparently drew the short straw and has had to stand up in this chamber and defend a policy that the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) will not defend because it is totally indefensible. The motion moved by the honourof able member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) reads: The use of a selective and disguised $2,000m petrol tax on motorists to hide the real impact of the Prime Minister's high tax policies. That is exactly what we are trying to establish here now. Three definite facts have emerged. Firstly, and nobody from the Government side will deny this, within three years the price of petrol in Australia has doubled. As the honourable member for Blaxland has pointed out, the farmers are probably listening to the parliamentary broadcast this afternoon. However, I might add that there is not one member of the National Country Party in the chamber. I should have thought that petrol pricing would have been a most important policy as far as the National Country Party was concerned. Surely if doubling the price of petrol affects anybody it is the farmers, yet there is not one of their worthy representatives in this chamber to defend them. Where are they? Perhaps they are out defending the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). Perhaps they are helping him with his tax return. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie told us that the price of petrol in Hong Kong is higher than in Australia. I am sure that the people of the of Kalgoorlie who have to drive a thousand miles would be very concerned to learn that somebody in Hong Kong who has to drive is paying a bit more for his petrol! Hong Kong does not have a natural source of domestic oil. It has to import its oil, which is something that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie seems to have forgotten. So here we have honourable memberforKalgoorlie, in a very doubtful seat, defending the Government's most at doubtful policy, to be supported by the apologist the nuclear industry, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Roger Johnston). For heaven's sake, where are Government Ministers? Are they done. It is not prepared to defend this policy? The simple fact is that the price of petrol has doubled within three years. The important point that we want to make to the public is that the penGovernment has made a conscious effort to blame the Arab countries for this, to blame the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for the increase in Australian petrol for prices. But such is not the case. ",56
167,Mr JOHN BROWN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Yes, I do read the papers but I read only the truth. I do not read what the Government has to tell us. The point I want to make is that Australia is in a most fortunate position. We have a 70 per cent production oil within our own domestic capacities. We have to import only 30 per cent of our crude oil from overseas, and most of that 30 per cent comprises heavy industrial crudes anyhow. The simple fact is that almost 90 per cent of motor distillate used in Australia is refined from Australian crude. The Government has a vested interest in having the public believe that the Arabs are responsible for this hike in petrol prices. This has been reinforced by reports on television of a group of Arabs sitting down in Vienna and other places to determine what the world price for oil will be. This does not bear much relation to the situation in Australia. The fact that we have 70 per cent local production is a big reason why petrol should not be the price it is in Australia. I notice the Minister for National Developproduction ment smiling. I do not know what he is smiling about. I am sure that all the people who are lisGovernment tening to this broadcast and who are paying get another $7 a tank for their juice will not being. I am sure that they will not be confused there are some handouts in the Budget tonight are honouring the promise that we saw newspapers back in 1977, that fistful of dollars that pandered to human greed. I hope that people do not think that any handout they might get tonight will be a fulfilment of that promise. will simply be returning what the people are being robbed of when they buy a tank of petrol. So let us put that furphy to rest. It will be no generous effort by the Government if it gives people some tax relief tonight; it will simply returning some of what the people have paid in the last three years in the form of higher petrol prices. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie sugto gested that we on this side of the House do have a positive policy with regard pricing or with regard to the petroleum industry. I advise the honourable member to get hold of the paper produced by the honourable member for Blaxland at our conference in Adelaide just recently. The honourable member for Blaxland pointed out in that paper that an Australian its Labor Government would form, as is done almost every other developed country with the exception of the United States basically, a Bass national oil company to be known as the AusWe tralian Hydrocarbons Corporation. This Corporthat ation would involve itself not only in exploration but also in the refining and retailing of petrol. And it would provide a government-topened. government basis for negotiation countries. It would give the national government a real say in its energy policy, something which this Government badly lacks. The Minister for National Development would be the first to admit, privately I presume, that the Government has no real knowledge of what the energy situation is. The Government's belief is: Leave it all to the oil companies; leave it all to the nine sisters. What a way to have one's national future lined up, with the oil companies deciding what is going to happen. I think a fewfiguresare very telling. Seventy per cent of our oil is produced locally. It costs less than a dollar a barrel for producers, particularly Bass Strait producers, to produce that oil. So consumers are paying $18.66 a barrel for that oil which costs less than a dollar a barrel to produce. On average, with the 42 per cent that attracts world parity price and the 58 per cent of the total that does not, the total return to the producer is $5.12 a barrel while the return to the is $ 13.54 a barrel. So the companies $5.12 a barrel for oil that it costs them $1 a smilbarrel to produce, and of that $4 profit, the if Government gets half anyhow. The simple facts that the high cost of petrol in Australia is dein the termined by the Government. It is a conscious decision of the Government to the make people pay more for their petrol in Australia in order to finance the booming deficit It that it has developed because of its incompetence in economic matters. They are the simple facts. We are not paying a high price for petrol in great Australia because of any OPEC decision. We are the paying a higher price merely because of a conbe scious decision by this Government to hike up the price of petrol to cover its booming deficit. So let the furphy that it is the Arabs who have caused the high price of petrol in Australia be put rest. It is a government decision and it is a not government decision that the Government does to petrol not want to go back on. In 1977 when the Government decided to move progressively towards world parity pricing we as an Opposition did not dispute this because we realised that the oil companies have to be encouraged to explore. The Government used as rationale the fact that a higher price for petrol in would provide some impetus for these companies to look for more expensive wells in Strait and perhaps to explore in other areas. did not dispute that. The other reason was it would provide some sort of rationalisation of our use of petrol, that it might prevent the wasteful use of petrol. But that has not hapThe honourable member for Blaxland with the Arab has cited the figures. Mr Newman-He is wrong.",56
168,Mr JOHN BROWN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The Minister's own Department decided that the increase in petrol consumption this year would be 2.7 per cent whereas in fact it is 5.2 per cent; it has doubled. Exploration has not gone ahead despite the rantings and ravings of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Exploration in Australia is almost decimated. Only 19 new wells have been put down in thefirsthalf of this year. No oil has been discovered in Australia since September 1975.1 repeat: There has not been one new oil discovery. So do not let us have this rubbish about the Government encouraging exploration or there being an improvement in exploration. It is a nonsense. The simple fact is that more oil has not been discovered and very little exploration is going on. The fact is that the public is paying twice what it paid for petrol in 1975. This financial year the Government will get over $3,000m in revenue from the sale of petrol to the Australian public. This is $ 1,000m more than it got last year. This Government has plucked $ 1,000m out of the pockets of the Australian people by a sleight of hand and it wants them to believe that this has happened because of the Arab decision to raise the price of oil. It was a conscious decision of this Government to rob the Australian public of $ 1,000m this year. Perhaps tonight it will give a little back and say: 'We are honouring our promise of 1977 to give you some tax cuts.' Such is not the case. If the Arabs had not decided to put up the price of their petrol as they have in the last couple of years, I do not know what the deficit would be. It would probably be about $4,000m. The people of Australia would have no hope of having that election promise of a tax cut honoured. They believed that promise and it helped to elect the present government. I notice that members of the National Country Party have now entered the chamber. I welcome them to the discussion on petrol pricing. I am sure that all the farmers of Australia will be pleased to hear that they take an active interest in the fact that the petrol prices they have had to pay in order to try to harvest their crops have been doubled in three years. I am sure that they will be delighted to see that two members of the National Country Party have belatedly appeared to represent them. The facts are very simple. This Government has introduced a petrol pricing polthis icy merely as a tax on the motorist. Let the motorists of Australia simply and clearly underabout stand this.",57
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,58
170,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The matters of public importance which the Opposition bring forward, when it brings them up and how it brings them up, never cease to amaze me. This matter is not new, so why bring it up now? Opposition members had the opportunity to raise it during the debate on the last Budget and on other occasions? Presumably they think that there is some mileage to be gained before the bigger audience which has come to see the opening of the Budget Session. I do not know how, as the subject has been so well canvassed previously. One would think that if the matter were so important the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) would have spoken instead of the last choice in the popularity contest of the Whitlam Government. I notice that only 13 Opposition members are now present, which makes me think that the matter cannot be important to them. Why bring up the matter on the first day of the Budget Session? (Quorum formed). Oil pricing is only one part of the energy policy. The energy policies on which all countries are working-Australia' s energy policy was enunciated on 27 June this year-were brought to a head by the price increases of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the crisis in Iran at the beginning of this year. Some countries, such as Japan and America, have massive problems for very different reasons. They are working on different approaches to their problems. America has had trouble in making its people understand the extent of its problems. In consequence it is having a great deal of trouble in getting acceptance of legislation to deal with the situation. However, the President and his energy advisers have indicated that Australia's approach is the answer and agree that America should have world parity pricing for oil. The whole idea of import parity is to allow decisions on energy to be made on the correct basis. It will provide a very major incentive to increase oil exploration activity and maximise the development of existing fields. I will talk about that matter later. It will encourage conservation of scarce sources of energy. It will promote the use of available alternative energy sources. It will stimulate the commercial development of major new energy projects in areas such as oil shale-again , I will refer to later-coa l liquefaction and the extenders, ethanol and methanol. These things will come only if we have a realistic price for petroleum products. Notwithstanding import parity pricing the price of petrol in Australia is lower than in all other countries except America and Canada. The choice is between paying realistic prices for petroleum products and not having access to adequate supplies. There are no other options. We need oil, not just for making petrol and diesel fuel for cars and trucks but for industry and electricity generation. Without oil many country towns would have no electricity. Many large cities would have power rationing. I think that this is what the Labor Party wants. In spite of the plaintive pleas of the low energy lobby there is no way that we can maintain the standard of living of Australians, much less raise it, unless we use more oil and more energy. This is not to say that we should not try to save oil. We must and we will. But this will be possible only through realistic pricing of oil. It is because of import pricing that oil companies are progressing with drilling on the North West Shelf. Without such a pricing policy they would be drilling off Timor, Indonesia or elsewhere to get realistic prices for their product. They would not be drilling on the North West Shelf. This is a reasonable proposition for the oil companies. It is a very reasonable approach by a government to help its balance of payments now and in the future. It is interesting to note that the Labor Party has put forward no alternative to cover its objecinvestigated tives, even though this matter came up a year or more ago, except to promote a socialist aptain proach. We have not drilled extensively on land areas not considered prime oil bearing prospects. This has been for the reason which I mentioned previously. There are immense quantities shale in the world. We certainly have a good share in Australia. It has been uneconomic to gain oil from this shale at the price the oil companies would have obtained for their product. It is not hard to understand why they did proceed and why the Government has underrelate taken its energy policy. One must realise that oil wells presently take only 30 per cent to 40 cent of the total oil from the field. This again purely an economic decision based on the low prices. With the higher oil prices oil companies will now be able to afford to take the extra step taking more oil from thesefields.There are other means of gaining more oil from oil fields but much more research is required. This research will be done only if oil is realistically priced. We are going through supply problems bebags, cause of political events overseas. These lems can be solved only by countries in the ganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and OPEC agreeing on the obvireduced ous. It is obvious that each group needs the other and that they should get together to work out best arrangements with respect to supply and demand. Honourable members may have read about some farmers in the United States of America lobbying for the swapping of a bushel of wheat for a barrel of oil. That is no solution to the problem, but it is the basis of their argument. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has a great record in international affairs. I would ask him to use his international status to bring the parties together. I am sure that amicable arrangements would result. The whole point at which the Opposition has directed its raising of this matter of public importance is not the reason for the pricing of petroleum products. Therefore, its whole argument has no relevance. We have parity shown good reason for setting the world parity price as the price for our oil. It affords many advantages to Australia.",58

172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUORUM BELLS,"I have received a complaint that while the quorum bells were ringing some red lights were flashing instead of green lights. Until that fault can be and corrected, I hope that members will take care when the bells are ringing to ascerwhether they are ringing for this House. NA . Mr FIFE (Farrer-Minister for Business and of oil Consumer Affairs) (4.37)- I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 20 to 27 (1979) and Excise to try Tariff Proposals Nos 5 and 6 (1979). Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 20 to 27 not The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos. 20 to 25 formally per place before Parliament, as required by law, is tariff changes introduced by Gazette notices duroil ing the last recess. Proposals No. 20 contains tariff changes effected by the Government's deof cision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on bags, sacks and certain polyolefin fabrics. The Government has decided not to accept the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission that short term assistance for the production of sacks and certain polyolefin fabrics be disprobcontinued from 1 July 1979. Instead, the OrGovernment has decided that additional assistance be provided until 31 December 1980 but at rates. This decision will be effective in maintaining the ad valorem rate of 35 per cent the on bags and sacks and 30 per cent on fabrics from all sources except New Zealand and in reducing the fixed rate portion. Most goods of New Zealand origin will continue to enter duty free. reaching this decision the Government has been mindful of the Commission's comment that the industry has made progress towards competitiveness through cost reductions and improved productivity and considers that the industry should be given the opportunity to complete its development programs. The Proposals also contain certain changes of an administrative nature which do not involve changes in duty rates. Proposals No. 21 arises from the Government's acceptance of the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on hoists, pulley tackle and winches. The effect of the decision was that the short term assistance, in the form of tariff quotas, accorded endless chain hand operated pulley tackle and hoists would be discontinued and in its stead an industry rate of 25 per cent would be phased in over a period of 3 years. Imports from New Zealand and Papua New Guinea sources continue at duty free rates whilst goods of developing country origin attract preference margins of up to 20 per cent. The Government had noted the Commission's comments that, despite relatively high assistance for many of the products, the competitive position of local manufacturers had generally declined. However, in the Commission's view, phasing down of duties should reduce the likelihood of a sudden disruptive flow of imports and in addition should give local manufacturers adequate time to adjust their activities, including the completion of structural changes currently being undertaken. Proposals No. 22 reflects the Government's general acceptance of the recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on travel goods, briefcases, toilet cases and similar goods. The effect of the decision means duties of 45 per cent apply to some of these goods, and will be maintained until 30 June 1980 and then be reduced to 30 per cent. All other goods are provided with assistance in the order of 30 per cent except for a range of products which phase to minimum rates after 30 June 1980. Imports from New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are duty free, whilst a 10 per cent preference margin applies to goods of developing country origin. In accepting the Commission's recommendations the Government noted the Commission's view that long term assistance over the whole range of local production at the present level or the level requested by the industry would not be justified because of the high cost to the community which this would involve. Also noted was the Commission's view In that continued assistance for rigid cases and brief cases would be justified because their production was less affected by imports and appeared to offer better prospects for long term profitable operation with moderate levels of assistance. As a result of agreements negotiated with New Zealand, the changes contained in Proposals No. 23 include that country in tariff quota restrictions applying to imports of babies napkins. The Proposals impose a $ 1 per square metre penalty duty on goods of New Zealand origin imported outside quota allocations and is operative on and from 1 August 1979. Proposals No. 24 arises from the Governto ment's decision to continue the short term duties applying to imports of certain ceramic floor and wall tiles which were due to expire on 4 August 1979. The Government has decided to maintain the current levels of assistance pending a decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on ceramicfloorand wall tiles, et cetera. Proposals No 25 reflects the Government's acceptance of the recommendations made in the Temporary Assistance Authority's report on continuation of assistance for insulators to continue the imposition of temporary duties, except in respect of fence insulators, until 30 June 1980. Fence insulators no longer attract temporary duties from general or preferential sources and are dutiable at 37.5 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. However, temporary duties continue to apply at a reduced rate to insulators from developing country and New Zealand sources until 30 June 1980. All imports from Papua New Guinea are duty Free. Proposals No. 26 removes the 12.5 per cent levy which applied to imports of certain chest freezers. The change is necessitated by the Government's decision to terminate the import licensing restrictions on these goods. This action has been taken following a review of the industry situation in which it was found there was insufficient evidence to justify the continuation of such assistance. Proposals No. 27 implements the Government's decisions on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on chemical products (Part A), (b) confectionary, chocolate and cocoa products, and (c) miscellaneous industrial machinery. The Government's acceptance of the recommendations contained in the chemical products (Part A) report means most of the goods under reference from all sources will be dutiable at minimum rates. Where minimum rates have been decided, the Government had noted the Commission's comments that there was either no evidence of local manufacture or no demonstrable requirement for assistance. In respect of the assistance accorded the cyclamate industry, it was found that assistance in the past had been high. The proposed dudes phasing down from 50 per cent to 20 per cent over the next five years should prevent any undue disruption and the local producer will be given the opportunity to demonstrate its potential viability. Additionally, as only small quantities of artificial sweeteners have attracted excise duties in recent years these duties have been abolished. The duties now applicable to cyclamates are therefore solely protective in nature. Duties of 25 per cent are proposed on fire extinguisher charges, maintaining assistance pending further consideration of the fire extinguisher industry by the Commission. A 20 per cent rate of duty will also apply to gelatin imports. This agrees with the Commission's views that the manufacture of gelatin should continue to be assisted as it is a relatively low cost export oriented industry. The decision on the confectionery report means that chocolate, sugar confectionery and biscuits put up as confectionery will generally be dutiable at 20 per cent. The remainder of the goods under reference will attract minimum rates of duty. This report is a result of the Commission's review program. The Commission's assessment was that the local industry currently holds over 90 per cent of the market, receives nificant natural protection and is expected to increase its market share later in the year when one of the industry's largest importers commences local manufacture. The effect of the decision in relation to the miscellaneous industrial machinery report means that most goods currently imported at minimum rates will continue to do so. Other goods will be dutiable at an industry rate of 15 per cent, except that most goods which are presently attracting duties higher than 15 per cent would retain their duties for a further five years. In respect of the latter goods, the Government noted the Commission's view that, following tariff reductions in January 1977, the industry would benefit from a period free from further tariff adjustment. The Government has generally accepted the Commission's findings in respect of this report. However, the Commission had recommended that some goods of which there was not local manufacture and which were previously dutiable, should now attract minimum rates. The Government has not generally accepted this recommendation on the basis that the adoption of an industry rate for a range of related products is essential to encourage the efficient allocation of resources between activities and this approach should be extended as far as practicable. The section of this report dealing with injection moulding machines was acted upon separately during the last sitting of Parliament. I have had a comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the duty changes prepared and circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Excise Tariff Proposals Nos 5 and 6 Excise Tariff Proposals No. 5 (1979) which I have just tabled formally place before Parliament alteration to the Excise Tariff introduced during the winter recess by authority of Gazette Notice No. 1 (1979) under section 160B of the Excise Act. Proposals No. 5 (1979) increases the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $70.98 to $102.27 per kilolitre operating on and from 1 July 1979. This alteration followed determination, by the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman), of new import parity prices from 1 July 1979 in accordance with the Government's decision that all Australianproduced crude oil should be priced to refineries at import parity levels. Excise Tariff Proposals No. 6 which I have also tabled is complementary to Customs Tariff Proposals No. 26 and has the effect of abolishing the $4.41 per kilogram excise duty on saccharin and sig- cyclamates. Together, the Customs Tariff Proposals and that Excise Tariff Proposals implement the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations on levels of protection and other matters relating to these products. I commend the Proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA NA",59

SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL Debate resumed from 24 May, on motion by Mr MACKellar: That the Bill be now read a second time.",62
176,Mr WILLIS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendcombined ment Bill which is now before the House is a minor piece of legislation. This is indicated by the fact that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr MACKellar), when introducing it, spoke for only three minutes. Of course, minissumably terial brevity is not always a good indicator the minor importance of legislation. I recall that the Commonwealth Employees (Employment set Provisions) Bill which was introduced two years ago by the present Minister for Industrial Retive lations (Mr Street) had an accompanying second reading speech of less than two minutes. That certainly a highly controversial piece of legislation. In this particular case the Minister's brevity in the second reading speech was entirely The Bill seeks to clarify the law relating to tax at the top rate of 2Vh per cent so as to remove doubts arising from the development of new products and from the production of various combination products incorporating some items which in isolation would be subject to tax at the of 2Vh per cent but which would otherwise a lesser rate. The types of items particularly involved in this legislation are radio and television sets, record players and records, record holders, tape recorders and tape players, cassettes and cassette holders and other sound reproduction equipment. The principal purpose of the Bill is to insert a new provision in the Act to the effect that in the case of products that conprotain components that would in isolation be subject to sales tax at the rate of 27V4 per cent, those products will be subject to the rate of 27!Â£ per if the componency which in isolation is subject to that rate forms more than 50 per cent of the total value of the products concerned. More simply, in the case of a cocktail cabinet incorporating a television set or some form of sound system, the rate of tax would be determined by the proportion of the value of the cabinet that the television set or sound system part of comprised. If the television set contained in such disan item of furniture comprised over 50 per cent of the total value, the tax payable would be 27.5 per cent. If it was less than 50 per cent, the tax would be that applying to cocktail cabinets alone which is a mere 2.5 per cent. (No. 2) 1979 The effect of this decision will be greatly to Second Reading differentiate the price of these similar products. For instance, a cocktail cabinet containing a television set with a wholesale price of $1,000 could be priced very differently after tax with just very minor changes. If the television set comprised 49 per cent of the total value of the unit, that is, the cocktail cabinet incorporating the television set, the tax would be only $22.50. If the television set was 51 per cent of the total value of the combined unit, the tax would be $275. The effect of this extraordinary tax difference in very similar items will therefore prebe substantially to discourage the proof duction of such combined items where the proportion of total value comprised by a television or sound system is more than 50 per cent of the value. There will be a very substantial incenindeed for consumers to purchase such items separately rather than buying pieces of furniture is which incorporate such highly taxed products. Despite the somewhat anomalous situation which may arise, the Opposition recognises the need for some arbitrary decision to be made as to the point at which the 27.5 per cent shall apply to such items, Given that reality, the level of 50 per cent does not seem unreasonable. The Opposition therefore does not oppose the Bill. However, it should be noted that one way of reducing the degree of potential anomaly would be to reduce the upper rates of sales tax. There are, in fact, good macro-economic reasons for doing that at the present time. It would reduce prices and so be anti-inflationary and would also stimulate demand for consumer products. Given this present state of consumer confidence, this would not be a bad thing. However, I have no confidence whatever in the likelihood of such a common-sense announcement being made in the Budget which will be brought down tonight.",62
177,Mr GRAHAM,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) of 1979 will be supported by the Opposition so I hope that I can make these comments about this legislation in what might be described as a non-party political atmosphere. The Bill relates to television receiving sets, radio receiving sets known as sound equipment such as record players and tape players. These provisions apply also to records and tape recordings, parts and accessories for sound equipment. The high rate of 27.5 per cent is now payable on television sets, radio sets, record players, tape recorders, tape players and the combinations of these items as defined in the second schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The amount of 27.5 per cent is now payable on records, tape recordings of music or verbal entertainment material as well as component parts, accessories and other specified classes of goods which are used in association with television, radio and sound equipment. From time to time, manufacturers at home and overseas do try to outwit the Commissioner of Taxation who is charged with the unenviable task of collecting the taxes decided upon by the Parliament. Fromtimeto time, advances in science and technology lead to a smoke screen of semantics called 'new terminology'. This environment has led to doubts about the proper and valid application of the 27.5 per cent rate particularly to television, radio and sound appliances. This amending legislation will clarify the position and remove any doubts about the legal validity of the Commissioner's decision. The amount of 27.5 per cent will be payable on virtually every item of equipment used in the reception of TV or radio programs, the reproduction of sound or noise-as I think it might be fairly described fromtimetotime-from records, tapes or wires or for any two or more of these functions. It is interesting to note that although clocks with radios built into them are included for the benefit of the amateur radio fraternity, radio transmitter/receivers will be taxed at the rate of 15 per cent. Particular sections of the amending legislation deal with television, radio or sound equipment which has other uses or functions. The Minister gave as an example an article of furniture which has a section of it designed to hold glassware and which also includes built-in record and cassette player equipment. Such an article of furniture would be taxable at 27.5 per cent if the value of the record and cassette player components together made up more than half the value of the whole article of furniture. The 27.5 per cent sales tax on records, tape recordings, parts and accessories for television, radio and sound equipment will also apply to envelopes, stands, cabinets and other facilities for the storage of records and also to cassette racks, holders and other storage facilities for tape and items of what is recordings. The Industries Assistance Commission report of 15 February 1978 deals with the music recording industry in Australia and contains the requests from interested parties about sales tax on recordings and music. On pages 43 and 44 the report stated: The Commission received a number of requests relating to sales tax on music recordings. The main requests were: exemption from sales tax for promotional copies of Australian records; exemption from, rebate of, or reduction in rate of sales tax for all Australian records; and that sound recordings be regarded as a cultural medium for the purposes of Annex C of the Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials ' (the Florence Agreement)Consequently it was requested of the Industries Assistance Commission that it should recommend an exemption from sales tax. The report continued: The Commissioner of Taxationalways very keen to keep an eye on the Consolidated Revenueadvised the Commission that under the provisions of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act goods that are given away for promotional purposes by a manufacturer or distributor are subject to tax on the grounds that they have been applied by the manufacturer or distributor to his own use, i.e., that he has used them for the purposes of his business by giving them away for promotional purposes. An exemption for promotional copies of recordings would be difficult to justify while tax remained payable on other classes of promotional goods used or given away for business purposes in other areas of industry. The taxing of goods plied to their own use by the of those products is also designed to preserve equity by placing them in the same position as retailers and must purchase any goods they require for business purposes and bear tax when purchasing them. The first two requests referred to . . . involve differential sales tax treatment between the Australian and imported product. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised . . . That advice was given to the Industries Assist the ance Commission. . . that such differential treatment would be contrary Australia's commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In relation to the third request . . . This relates to the Florence agreement to which have referred. . . the Commissioner of Taxation has advised that Australia is not a party to the Florence Agreement. if it were, the agreement would not prevent the imposition sales tax on recordings; it tax on the imported product in excess of that on the product. Therefore in these circumstances the Industries Assistance Commission decided that there was little justification for recommending any change in the present sales tax provisions for music recordings. References have been made in this House to direct taxation and its significance the economy, and also to the attitude of the various political parties from time to time in lation to the problem of differentiation direct taxation and indirect taxation in its various forms. I believe that the whole of the sales tax process should be reviewed because its impact upon the national economy is important and significant. I am prone to believe that direct taxation is less harmful than indirect taxation in the context of the progress and development of the forthwith. national economy. In spite of what honourable sides of the House have said, I would like to quote from the basic statistics that are submitted to the Parliament by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its economic survey which, as is well known, is carried out over a number of years. For example, I note that the report of July 1975 year 1973-74 referred to a gross domestic product of $50,433m and the current revenue was 28.9 per cent of the GDP. I think that this when Mr Crean was the Treasurer. The OECD piece said that direct taxes at that stage represented 14.9 per cent of the 28.9 per cent. If one the report of 1978 covering 1976-77, one finds enormous increase in the GDP to $81,560m; curCoal rent revenue as a public sector percentage of GDP being 31.8 per cent and direct taxes having ap- risen to 18 per cent. Last year, with a gross dommanufacturers and distributors estic product of $90,68lm, the current revenue others who percentage was 31.3 per cent and direct taxes were 17.8 percent. I mentioned those figures because I suspect that fromtimetotimethe House is given an impression about the relationship between the total taxation take by governments in Australia and gross domestic product which is prone to be a political interpretation. I feel that in those circumstances the House ought to be reminded that to with a little study it can be shown that there has been not a great deal of variation over quite a long period, irrespective of the government in power. I complete my remarks by saying that in I terms of the total sales tax concept I believe that the figures are unnecessarily high. I am aware of the fact that Consolidated Revenue must be colBut even lected from some source and that the Parliament of instructs the Commissioner of Taxation to collect merely forbids the imposition of domestic all of the Consolidated Revenue that he possibly can. Notwithstanding that, I think that indirect taxation generally has an adverse effect upon production in the community. In my judgment this effect would be worthy of exploration as one of our very great problems at the present time is the problem of producing employment for young people in the next decades of our national develin opment. I conclude on that point. I will support the Bill and I am aware of the fact that my refriends on the other side of the House will also between support the legislation.

178,Mr YOUNG,COAL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"The was Coal Industry Amendment Bill 1979 is a formal of legislation which formalises that agreement reached between the New South Wales turns to Government and the Commonwealth Governan ment whereby the person who constitutes the Industry Tribunal dealing with the coal in the dustry of New South Wales and Queensland is able to be seconded to either the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or to the Industrial Commission of New South Wales. The Opposition does not contemplate that that would happen frequently, but there should be no objection to that person being seconded to either of those tribunals should his position in the coal industry be such that he is not required in it. This was the practice with Mr Gallagher, the person previously constituting the Tribunal, but at that time the legislation named him and this did not allow for a flow-on to other people who would hold the position. This amending Bill does. Complementary legislation will be passed in New South Wales. This Bill has the support of the Opposition.",64
179,Mr WEST,COAL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL," I would like to use the debate on the Coal Industry Amendment Bill 1979 to make a plea to the Government that when it brings down the about Budget tonight it remove the discriminatory $3.50 per tonne levy on the export of coal and place it with the policy of the Australian Labor Party which calls for the replacement of flat levies on tonnages with a resources tax based profitability of companies. To show just how tified I am in raising this matter I refer to the of Bellambi Coal, a subsidiary of Allied Fields. At the end of the last financial year it turned in a pre-tax loss of $2.9m and then had to pay a $4.5m levy on coal produced. I ask the House to compare that situation with that of the Utah Development Corporation which, after paying some $80m-odd in coal export levy, still forthwith. turned in a profit of $ 130m at the end of the last financial year. There can be no doubt that the coal export levy as a flat levy on tonnage rather time. than a tax on profits discriminates against marginal mines, particularly the smaller underground producers in New South Wales vis-a-vis the larger open cut mines in Queensland in the Bowen basin which have a tremendous advantage in having rail transport to the ports of Mr Street: Queensland, and, of course, being much closer to Japan. I make an appeal to this Government to move the coal export levy tonight and replace with a resources tax on profitability. If $350 tonne levy remains, at least $2 per tonne ought be returned to State governments, such as New South Wales Government, to pay for been transport infrastructure to the much needed new ports. We cannot allow a continuation of a situAustralia ation in which we export larger amounts of coal and build ports to expedite its sea transportation, but do nothing very much to expedite its land transportation. While the levy remains, clearly proper percentage of that levy ought to be returned to the appropriate State government for transport purposes. However, the last point I make is that the levy clearly ought to come off and be replaced by a resources tax. Such a resources tax, pitched at the right threshold level of profitability to investment, would most certainly miss most of the smaller mines in New South Wales and thus would allow the New South Wales Government to impose levies less than the present $3.50 per tonne-say , $1 to $2 per tonne-to pay for the ports, the railroads and the conveyor systems that are so necessary in order to get our coal into the ships.",65
180,Mr YOUNG,COAL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,Would it help industrial relations?,65
181,Mr WEST,COAL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"I think that it would help industrial relations enormously. There is no question it. If this situation continues much longerwith the Bellambi mine, about which I have just respoken, making a $2.9m loss after paying $4.5m to the Federal Government as a coal levy, none of which is returned to the State government for on infrastructure purposes-w e will not have to jusworry about industrial relations in regard to case employing people, because obviously the mine Gold will not continue to operate.

182,Mr YOUNG,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"Whilst rethe Opposition does not oppose the amendment it brought in by the Government, we have some per things to say about it. The amendment deals with to the fact that since late last year the Department the of Employment and Industrial Relations has split. This is a matter to which we on this side of the House object. As soon as the people of re-elect a Labor government, that will become one department. I must say that the only reason why the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations was split, which is apparent a to honourable members on this side of the House, is that the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street, in making a statement to the House in September of last year, for the first time gave the people of Australia some idea of the crisis of unemployment with which we were living and some idea of the great difficulties of unemployment with which we were going to be confronted in the next five to 10 years. It seems to us that the truth in the statement made by Mr Street last September was too much for the Government. It is not something of which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is-terribly fond. Later we found that a new Department of Employment and Youth Affairs was established, separate from the Department of Industrial Relations. There was no necessity tification for this. Obviously a Labor government will reunite the two departments. In addition to that, we give recognition to enormously important role played by the have National Labour Consultative Council. In dealpublic ing with industrial relations in this country there are perhaps few bodies that play a more importwill ant role in trying to unravel the difficulties arise between employees, employers and government. In no other body in this country more superior people from each of those bodies discuss the matters that come before them. We give recognition to the importance of this mechference anism. I must say to the Government that it is fool's errand to send any Minister, whether the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Minischarges. ter for Employment and Youth Affairs or the Minister for Productivity, into a forum such the NLCC and expect that the people representevery ing organised labour in this country will comprocome. mise their position as the representatives of organised labour by buying some of the crazy ideas put forward by this Government for tling industrial disputes. One need only point the Commonwealth Employees (Employment dard Provisions) Act or the Commonwealth ployees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act in order to show where the Government has created a vacuum in dealing with its own emSpeaker. ployees as far as industrial relations are provisions concerned. When these matters were before the Parlianent ment, speaker after speaker from the GovernLabour ment side said that these measures were welis comed by public servants and that these measures were looked upon as being favourable legislation. to the Public Service. The whole emphasis of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill was given over to optional early retirement at 55 years of age and not to the early forced sacking of any public servant in this to. country. We warned the Government thenduring the recess that we have just been through we have been proved soright-that the Public Service overwhelmingly is not prepared to accept those measures. That could have been sorted out in the NLCC. It is my opinion that, left to his own devices, the Minister would have sorted out those measures in the NLCC; but there is another demon at work in this Government, namely, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He has to have a confrontation with the trade union movement. In his last national broadcast, which we were urged to witness on national television, he told us that all the problems of this country belonged to and rested on the shoulders of the or jus- trade union movement. In all the problems that this country faces he finds as his only foe the trade union movement. the So we have legislation such as that to which I referred in order to harass and provoke the servants and perhaps to politicise the Public Service of this country. That type of legislation not work. Had the Minister for Industrial that Relations and the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-if the Treasurer had had thetime-gone to the do NLCC to discuss what ought to be the wages policy in this country, they would have known that they were wasting theirtimein going to the conon wage indexation to put forward the a foolhardy idea of automatic indexation adjustit be ments with discounting of all government There are two features of this to which I wish to refer. One is that the Government has as already made decisions which are now costing person in Australia a great deal of his inThese are the decisions on petrol prices and the health insurance scheme which is about to commence. These are not charges which wage setand salary earners can ignore. They are not to amounts of money making up a part of the stanof living which the working people of this Emcountry are prepared to sacrifice. Mr Street- I take a point of order, Mr Deputy I draw to the attention of the Chair the of the Bill we are debating. It provides merely for the representation of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and the permahead of his Department on the National Consultative Council. My point of order that the honourable member for Port Adelaide is not speaking to the provisions of the",65
183,Mr YOUNG,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"Speakin g to the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I am referring exclusively to the role of the NLCC, and that is what the Bill refers",66
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"Mr Drummond)Whilst the amendments to the Act are only of the nature that the Minister has described, I think that a more broad ranging discussion should be allowed.",67
185,Mr YOUNG,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"We have already seen an enormous increase occur in the cost of petrol. Every consumer, every wage earner who uses his own vehicle or public transport, now knows the impact that the Government's decision to meet world parity pricing on crude oil is having on his pay packet. Mr Street- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I take your point in relation to the of the National Labour Consultative Council Act, but I suggest that it does not refer to petrol prices.",67
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,I uphold the point of order in this instance and remind the honourable member for Port Adelaide that the Chair and the Minister were generous in their interpretation of the Standing Orders relating to this matter. I ask him to confine his remarks to the matter under discussion.,67
187,Mr YOUNG,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"I will not talk about petrol. If someone said to a person earning $150 a week that he would be charged an extra $6 a week to travel to work-this situation has arisen in the last 18 months as a result of government decisions-woul d he expect that wage earner to accept a package that did not take that aspect into account? My view is that if these matters had been thrashed out by the NLCC-wher e they should have been thrashed out- a proposition as stupid as the proposition that was put to the indexation committee last week would never have been put forward by the Government. The other point to be made about such an offer is that this Government has told the working people of Australia so many lies that no one is prepared to believe anything it says. This is the other vulnerable aspect of the offer about which the representatives of organised labour are concerned when they go to meetings of the NLCC. These matters ought to be discussed. Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of the NLCC in determining these questions. If any of the matters to I have referred had been discussed or thrashed out at meetings of the Council, the Government as one of the partners-eve n the senior partnerwould have known that it would be futile to put forward provisions such as those contained in the legislation affecting its employees or the propositions it has put forward on how to solve the wages problem in this country. People outside the NLCC and perhaps the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs are not privy to the decisions and discussions of the Council. These are confidential. So I do not know whether wages have been discussed by the NLCC. But it seems to me to be ironic that for almost a year the Government has been without a policy on wages. I believe that in eight of the last 12 national wage case hearings the Government has gone before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and asked that no wage increase be granted. These are matters that ought to be discussed by the NLCC. This situation will not be helped- I refer to the amending legisambit lation before us-by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs being at the Council's meetings. If ever there has been an example of His Master's Voice sitting on the front bench of the Government is has been the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs when he has been representing the views of the Prime Minister. Whatever the Prime Minister wants the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to say he will say it. So his presence at meetings of the NLCC will not add anything to them. I think that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street) understands more than anybody else the importance of the Council, not only in relation to what it should discuss but also in relation to maintaining and consolidating its role. Some action has been taken by the Government and perhaps the unions have over-reacted to it in playing their role on the NLCC. The Opposition sees the NLCC as being enormously important. We want to see it continue to play the role that it has and perhaps to enlarge its role in industrial relations. At the moment people all over this country are sitting down and talking about the problems between employers, employees and the Government. Why are we having so many problems in industrial relations? Members of the Opposition who serve in this field are being invited every day to speak to groups about industrial relations. What is the problem that cannot be solved? A mechanism like the NLCC ought to be given the respect that  people like that meet with the Minister, such a meeting should be given great respect. They , re Q the people who should be able to solve some of the problems. I believe that the Government ought to give them more rein in dealing with the problems that come before them. Perhaps consultation will overcome many of the problems. They will not be overcome by the provocation which has been so much a part of industrial relations in the past couple of years.",67
188,Mr BURR,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE," I join the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) in supporting the Government for the introduction of this measure. I think that any layman would agree that it is sheer common sense that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs should also sit on the National Labour Consultative Council. The Minister assists the Minister for Industrial Relations in those matters and I think that he should be fully informed and be able to participate in NLCC discussions. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street) should be congratulated by honourable members on both sides of the House for his foresight in establishing the National Labour Consultative Council. I think that the Minister showed statesmanship in bringing around a table representatives of unions, employers and the Government. Whilst they may not agree on particular issues, at least they are given the opportunity to sit down in a forum and discuss those matters. I congratulate the Minister for introducing this measure in the first instance and also for allowing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to take part in these discussions. I think that it needs to be recognised by people on both sides of the House that if the NLCC is to work as we hope it will work-that is, in the manner on which the honourable member for Port Adelaide commented; I am sure it has his approval-ther e must be a common consensus among the people around the table to make it work. Any forum, no matter what it is, will produce results and have an effect only if there is a desire from all people around the table to make a particular measure work. It is unfortunate that in the short history of the Council there has been evidence of its being used as a political forum stead of as a forum for consensus. I was very disturbed at the decision of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations not to participate in meetings of the NLCC because of the proclaiming of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act. It is unfortunate that the trade union movement took that stance because, whilst it may have objections to that provision or other provisions that may be introduced by the Government or by employers, the Council is a body which enables people to sit around a table and discuss matters of importance. There can be consultation without confrontation. Above all else I think that the people of Australia are looking for consultation and not confrontation. If some of the bodies that are appointed to that Council adopt the attitude that it can be used as a political plaything then it will not have the desired effect which the Minister has hoped for and on which the honourable member for Port Adelaide has commented. I think that it needs to be taken into account by those who are appointed to the NLCC, the employers, the unions and the Government that there should be a common desire to go into that forum and talk about problems and to make it work. I think that it is fair to say that the reaction at the moment to industrial relations matters is probably the cause of the most widespread concern amongst the people of Australia. In 1975 and 1977 the Government brought forward policies to help overcome the industrial relations problems that were in existence at that time. The policy to establish the National Labour Consultative Council was one of those measures brought forward by the Government. But still there is widespread industrial disruption in this country. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide correctly pointed out, people around this country are asking why there is so much industrial disruption and why there is confrontation among employers, unions and government. Why should there be this confrontation when clearly its effect is to dampen economic prosperity and in fact to retard the job opportunities that might be created for people who unfortunately are out of work at this stage. The effect of current industrial relations defies all common logic. It does nothing to help those people who are in work at the moment and seeking to improve their wages and conditions. It does nothing to help young people and other people who unfortunately do not have jobs. It does nothing to improve the economic prosperity inof Australia or to provide for the future of this country. But still there is widespread industrial disruption and there does not appear to be any reason to assume that industrial confrontation is abating. We all need to ask the question: Why is this happening? Mr Deputy Speaker, I put the view to you that better direction needs to be given by the leaders of this country-by the leaders of trade unions, industry and government. Rather than have a situation in which the leaders are put into a position in which they are expected to be gladiators about to take each other on and to pound each other into the ground, there should be a situation in which the leaders of the various industrial and government groups can sit together and talk about common problems about which all of us are concerned, regardless of our political persuasion. I hope that the leaders will then come up with some sort of consensus that will provide a mechanism for improvements in the future. But that is not happening. The leaders in the country-regardles s of whether they are in unions, industry or government-ten d to take the view that for the sake of political expediency or individual monetary gain they should adopt a role in which they are gladiators and try to hammer each other into the ground. That attitude causes people in the community to lose confidence in the system, in the leaders, in the governments, in the parliaments, in the trade unions and in the industries in which they work. This is not good. It is not helping people plan or causing them to expect that there will prosperity in the future. I believe that if we regenerate the sort of confidence that we think the community should have, and which it has right to expect, the lead has to be given by people in the community who choose to call because themselves leaders. I must admit that I was impressed by some of the statements that Mr Hawke made during the parliamentary recess. He said that there should be consultation rather than confrontation. I agree with that and I think that all of us on both sides of the House would agree with that approach by Mr Hawke. But it no good for him to say: 'Yes, there should consultation' in one breath and then in the breath to support a motion that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Auschitty tralian Government Employee Organisations not participate in NLCC discussions. One attitude completely contradictory to the other. Sure, the statements are good but they have to be backed up by practice. I do not necessarily single out Hawke. The same situation applies to the leaders in trade unions, employers' groups and governdecisions ment. There should be consultation that gives lead at that level to people in the community so that they can plan and be confident cisions coming from unions, industry or government can be respected and followed by the community at large. The NLCC, which was set up by the Minister for Industrial Relations, was the body that I hoped would provide a forum for that process to take place. It was a forum set up for the senior people of industry, trade unions and government to sit round a table to talk. But if that body is work in the way that I had hoped it would- I lieve that people on both sides of the House certainly in the community hoped it would in this way-ther e must be a desire on the part all the people sitting around that table to make it work. If there is the suggestion by any of the individuals or groups around that table that they have some mysterious right to be able to use the Council as a political forum or as part of their weaponry in the battle against an opposing group it will not work. If people take that attitude, regardless of what body or group they represent, around that table at the NLCC then they should be condemned roundly by the community at large. Those individuals who adopt that attitude rightly deserve to be condemned. Certainly I will not be backward in tipping a bucket over anyone who might adopt that attitude. The NLCC is a forum that should be looked to by the community as one in which consultation to can take place and in which the confrontation in be the industrial arena can be broken down. I supare to port the honourable member for Port Adelaide in saying that it is a body that should be given a much greater recognition by the Government, those unions, employers and the community at large it is a body in which that sort of consultation can take place. I support the Bill. I know that it is a machinery Bill allowing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to be a member of that body. Anything that can be done by the Ministers who attend the meetings of the Council, by leaders in the trade union movement is and in industry and by employer groups who can be come together around a table at that forum next should be done. They should not only come together with the idea of having a nice little chat and a beer afterwards but also they should come together with a view to coming to is statesmanlike decisions that can be expressed to the community at large so that from that forum a lead can be given to the community so that it can Mr have confidence that the leaders in the various groups are at least trying their best to arrive at or at a consensus for the betterment of a this country, not reaching agreements that will benefit some group or individual just for the sake that deof political expediency.",68
189,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"It is always interesting to hear the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) address this chamber on matters of industrial relations and had this afternoon was no exception. Regardless of all his fine oratory to this chamber it is a shame that his political clout within his own party is so insignificant that he is unable to persuade his to political boss, the Prime Minister of Australia be- (Mr Malcolm Fraser), that what he was saying and had some merit. I want to initially correct a work misapprehension that the honourable member of labours under; that is, that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) supports the legislation. Nothing is further from the truth. Neither the honourable member for Port Adelaide nor the Australian Labor Party supports the legislation. The attitude that is adopted by the honourable gentleman for Port Adelaide and by the Labor Party is that we do not oppose the legislation. We do not support it for the very good reason that we do not support the splitting into two portfolios of a Ministry so important as that which dealt with matters relating to industrial relations in this country. The Government did this in December 1978. We do not support that at all. We have made that clear. If we do not support that we cannot support this legislation because it simply broadens the National Labour Consultative Council. I would like to know the name of the person who perpetrated that little trick of including the word 'Labour' in the title. The purpose of the legislation before us is to embrace on the Council the new Ministry that was created in 1978. If we of the Opposition opposed the creation of the new Ministry we must of necessity not favour this Bill. So we do not oppose it because we know that it is part of the machinery, but we do not support it. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Wilmot speaking about there being consultation and not confrontation. Of course, that is the whole attitude of the Labor Party in of its industrial attitudes and in its attitudes towards the trade union movement. It has always been one of consultation and not confrontation. It is a pity that the Prime Minister of this country did not take some note of that attitude during the recent Telecom dispute when he gave strict structions to Telecom that it was not to negotiate with the Australian Telecommunications Emat ployees Association-wit h the union it was not negotiate. If what the honourable member for consumption. Wilmot is telling us is true-and I believe that it is-that is, that negotiation will obviate industrial disputes rather than confrontation, it is a pity that his own Prime Minister did not embrace same creed. We would have fewer industrial putes in Australia if there were consultation rather than the continued confrontation as is practised by at least two Premiers-in Western Australia and Queensland. I have just recently returned from Japan from speaking with industrialists in that country it would seem to me that this neat little ploy of stirring up industrial strife that the Government has got going for it to divert the attention of community away from the Government's own be inadequacies is starting to backfire on it. It might be all very well for domestic consumption, as honourable member for Wilmot put it to us, that the Labor Party is associated with the unions and therefore the Labor Party must be held responsible for the industrial disputes that exist. That is a nice little stratagem, a nice little ploy, and it is probably working. I do not deny that it is probably working. But the end result of that is that in every news bulletin that one reads in overseas newspapers and reports, industrial disputes in Australia are highlighted. That in turn is being used as a weapon by those who wish to exploit the natural resources of this country, including its people for their own benefit. The Government has been very successful in this area too. It is the Government which foments industrial disputes in this country because the unions have nothing to gain out of industrial disputes. It is not a very great pleasure to go home to one's wife after being on strike for a week with no pay in one's pocket. I can say from experience that that is the case. The unions have no vested interest in creating industrial disputes. It is the present Government and governments of that colour throughout Australia that have a very real interest in creating industrial disputes. They are the traitors to Australia. The traitors in Australia are those governments which foment industrial disputes. The governments of Australia which bring down all provocative legislation well knowing that it will create a dispute are the traitors. Those governments of Australia, amongst the eight of them, that take provocative actions, that encourage employers not to negotiate but to confront, are the traitors because they are doing Australia irinreparable damage overseas. They like to turn their wrath upon the unions and place everything the heels of the trade union movement. As I to pointed out, that is done purely for domestic The whole idea of a consultative council has a great deal of merit. But it must be attended by the people of goodwill, as the honourable member disfor Wilmot pointed out to the House. He said that originally the legislation had been brought about in order to reduce the number of disputes in Australia. Among other things he said that that was one of the purposes of its existence. But in the next breath, after he had patted the and Government on the back for taking some action to reduce the number of industrial disputes, he pointed out that the industrial situation had worsened since the Government had been in office, the and I think everybody in Australia knows that to a truism. Whilst the Government, through its private members in this place, would like to put the the point of view to the public that it stands above all this, I put the contrary point of view. I would point the finger directly at the Government as being the instigator of industrial unrest in this country. It is well known that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street), who is sitting at the table, curiously enough does not seem to do very much in industrial relations. It seems to be his colleague, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), who has a lot to say about trade unions. I freely admit that I have a lot of time for the Minister for Industrial Relations. I believe him to be honest and I believe him to take a keen interest in the subject that he has specialised in over the last few years. Mr Barry Jones-You have answered your own question.",69
190,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"As the honourable fore member for Lalor said, I have answered my own question. I know why the Department was divclaim ided. I think everybody in Australia knows and think the Minister for Industrial Relations knows. The reason is that he is too honest. was looking at the problems and endeavouring to understand them. He would not take action that he considered to be ungentlemanly in order to stir up industrial disputes in this country political advantage and domestic consumption. Mr Barry Jones-He is not a confrontationist.",71
191,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"He is not a confronbelieve tationist. He is a man who looks at problems endeavours to understand them. It is for that very good reason that he was moved sideways. He is an old school chum of the Prime Minister, so he could hardly cop the axe. The Prime Ministoo ter handled that one very neatly by dividing the Department and shuffling the honest Minister off to one side. He introduced another Minister and am not implying in any way that he is dishonest, but the man does have a reputation for confronbit, tation as he had in his previous portfolio and he has demonstrated to us quite clearly in his handling of his present portfolio. It is while there are people like that associated with the NLCC, the while there are sitting around that table Government representatives who are bent on confrontation, not consultation, that the spirit of the legislation will not work. It is hardly to be wonminutes dered at that the trade union movement is not going to be snowed and it is hardly to be dered at that the trade unions did refuse to around the table while the Government was such an intransigent mood. It would do this House and the nation good if there were a full-scale debate on the whole ject of industrial disputes because they are not doing anybody any good, and everybody admits that. But the difference between the Government and the Opposition is that the Opposition has a clear endeavour and an honest approach to the subject and would confront such situations with a spirit of bringing about conciliation between all of the parties rather than driving them into arbitration as is the attitude of the present Government. While that situation exists, while that attitude prevails within the Government, there will continue to be industrial disputes in this country which will benefit nobody. There is no quarrel with the principle of the legislation, as I pointed out, provided that it is administered by people of goodwill. There is no opposition in the Labor Party to the Bill now be the House which seeks to include the new Minister on the Council. Our opposition is to the that there is a need for that Minister. We I do not believe that there is. We believe that the addition has been made for a particular purpose He and we believe that the eight months that have passed since December 1978 have indicated that purpose quite clearly. The Prime Minister seems to have a predilection for appointing Ministers for for everything. He did that with the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) by making him the Minister for all sorts of things-ra g bags-in Europe and that, Mr Deputy Speaker, you me, is a matter of derision amongst and our overseas trading partners located in the Asian region-in the Pacific Ocean, not on the European continent. As that is a matter of derision amongst our overseas trading partners, so is this whole question of the appointment of a Minister to deal with these matters. There are no real reasons for it. It is a window dressing exerI cise. One could go right through the Community Youth Support Scheme, right through the whole to show that it is window dressing. There has as been absolutely no achievement by the Minister responsible for its administration. I leave it on that note, that the Labor Party does not oppose legislation but it certainly does not support it.",71
192,Mr STREET,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"in reply-In the few before the sitting is suspended for dinner I would like to make a couple of points. I thank wonthose honourable members who have taken part sit in the debate. The honourable member for Port in Adelaide (Mr Young) spent a good deal of his speech talking about issues which I think were not strictly relevant to the Bill but as you allowed subhim a fair amount of latitude, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that you will allow me the same indulgence in replying to one point in particular that he raised. It related to Public Service legislation, the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. The honourable member referred to provisions which, in his terminology, allowed management to sack people and the undesirable effects that could flow from that. I would like to point out that lic Service legislation has given management that power for a great many years now. The new Act provides appeal machinery which is not available under the present legislation. The honourable gentleman also referred wages policy. I was interested to note that now the Australian Labor Party formally opposes Government's wages package. I believe that this for Burke. was a test of the Opposition's sincerity in relation to recent statements that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and other ALP spokesmen on the need for a sensible cil. wages policy. But what we have heard today makes it quite apparent that those statements the were mere window dressing. The Labor not really interested in a constructive approach to what is one of our major economic issues.",71
193,Mr BAILLIEU,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,Bo b Hawke snowed them. That is what happened.,72
194,Mr STREET,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE,"That is quiteright.The honourable member for Port Adelaide referred to the forthwith. importance of the National Labour Consultative Council, as did my colleague, the honourable time. member for Wilmot (Mr Burr), and I thank him for the remarks he made on the establishment of the NLCC. As the honourable member for Wilmot rightly pointed out, if the Council is to play its full role, the members of it need to attend to put their point of view. I personally greatly the decision of the union movement ticipate in the last meeting of the NLCC. I hope that this absence is a temporary one. In the meantime, there is not much point in the Opposition or the union movement talking about lack of consultation when they have decided not to attend the very body, the National Labour Consultative Council, established for that very purpose. Finally, I turn to the comments of the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). Listening to the honourable member for Burke, one might be forgiven for thinking that the union movement as a whole had nothing at all to do with any form of industrial disruption. I will leave it to the honourable member for Burke to try to sell that idea to the Australian public. honourable member also alleged that the year, Government had instigated industrial disruption in this country. For the benefit of the honourable member for Burke and of the House I would like to cite some fairly simple statistics. They are these: During the three years of the Labor Government an average of 4.1 million man days per year were lost through industrial disruption. During the full three completed years of this Pub- Government, the averagefigurewas 1.8 million man days lost if the one day aberration of the Medibank strike is excluded and just over 2 million man days lost if the Medibank strike is included. But, in either case, the number of man days lost per year under this Government is less to than half the number lost under the Labor Government. Really, this makes nonsense of the the arguments advanced by the honourable member I believe that the Bill before the House will improve the National Labour Consultative CounIt will give it a broader base. I believe that as both sides of the House support the concept of Council this Bill will result in that body being Party is able to do its job better. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time. Second Reading (Budget Speech)",72
196,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL LABOUR CONSULTATIVE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1979-80. The purpose of a Budget Speech is not only to give details of a Government's revenue and expenditure plans for the year. It is also an occasion to take stock, to review The the course of the economy over the previous to assess prospects and problems for the year ahead and above all to restate the basic economic policies of the Government. One persistent theme has dominated this Government's conduct of economic policy since its election in 1975. That has been the uncompromising nature of its attack upon inflation as the fundamental and most enduring cause of the economic difficulties of the 1970s. Tonight I reaffirm the determination of this Government to maintain that attack. In recent months, due largely to world wide price increases, inflationary pressures have intensified in Australia. The prime purpose, therefore, of this Budget is to respond decisively to these renewed pressures. In doing so we should not lose sight of the real gains that have been made. Despite the recent upward movement in inflation, it is still very much lower than it was several years ago. It should not be forgotten that inflation was as high as 17 per cent in the year to June 1975 and stood at 14 per cent when this Government took office. For the year to June 1979 it was 8.8 per cent which was below the average for the OECD countries. The priority given by the Government to the attack upon inflation has been vindicated by the steady improvement in Australia's economic health over the past three and a half years. That improvement strengthened and broadened in 1978-79. Real gross domestic product is presently estimated to have increased by 4.7 per cent. It was, of course, a very good year for the rural sector, with a most gratifying rise in real farm product of 36 per cent. Growth elsewhere, while less spectacular, was still quite firm. On current estimates, real non-farm product grew by 2.8 per cent. Business fixed investment recorded an increase of 10 per cent in real terms. Private dwelling construction has also picked up. Overall business profits improved last year. This process must continue if recovery is to be consolidated. Civilian employment grew by 1.4 per cent over the course of the year. Most encouragingly private sector employment rose by about VA per cent and, for the first time since 1973-74, there was arisein jobs in manufacturing industry. Our balance of payments turned sharply for the better in the second half of the financial year. It was especially pleasing to see a strong growth in manufactured exports reflecting a substantial improvement in the competitiveness of Australian industry. Confidence in the strength and stability of the Australian economy continued to grow. Private capital inflow for 1978-79 was the largest for seven years. There was also a markedrisein the number of major investment projects foreshadowed. These developments clearly show that policies which address fundamental economic problems do yield results. Lower inflation does inspire greater confidence and encourage greater risk taking. Lower costs do make our industries more competive; they do encourage development; and they do, thereby, provide jobs. The clear benefits of firmly pursuing an anti-inflationary policy over more than three years are reason enough to reaffirm that policy tonight. Moreover, the difficulties faced by the entire industrialised world-includin g Australia-ove r the next year in responding to fresh inflationary pressures make it all the more essential that fighting inflation be the hallmark of this Budget. In doing so we should remember that no Government can guarantee that price rises will never occur; indeed, some price rises are inevitable. Therisein the price of oil is a case in point. Our policy in respect of crude oil is to conserve our resources through a reduction in consumption, to promote exploration and to encourage the use of alternative energy sources. There is no way this policy can be effectively pursued unless the price of Australian crude oil is set at the world level. This means we now feel the full effects of price increases by the OPEC countries. Oil prices alone will add direcdy about 1 Vz per cent to the Consumer Price Index in 1979. We might wish that we could isolate ourselves from higher world oil prices. But to have persevered with the old pricing policy would merely have delayed the,inevitable change and would have run counter to our energy objectives. Ultimately the change would have been forced upon us: Ultimately it would have been necessary to recognise that if something is scarce, artificially holding down its price will make it even scarcer. If we had delayed the change the eventual dislocation would have been all the greater. THE 1978-79 BUDGET OUTCOME The Budget deficit in 1978-79 was $665m higher than estimated when the Budget was brought down last August. The higher deficit was not due to a relaxation of expenditure restraint. Outlays grew by 8.4 per cent which was only 0.6 per cent greater than estimated in the Budget itself. Most of the higher deficit was due to a revenue shortfall of $490m largely in the areas of provisional and company tax. Tax avoidance played no small part in the lower revenue collections in these two areas. Of the total revenue shortfall, $ 180m was due to tax avoidance over and above the allowance which had been made for that when the Budget figures were prepared last year. To illustrate the continuing nature of the tax avoidance problem, I point out' that the total amount of income tax outstanding at 30 June 1979 included an abnormally high figure of $433m attributable to specific tax avoidance schemes against which the Government has taken action. This amount is in effect tax in dispute arising from these schemes. Given the nature of the processes involved, it is not assumed, for the pose of the revenue estimates, that any of this amount will be recovered in 1979-80. . In addition, in preparing this year's estimates of revenue it has been necessary to allow a sum of $250m to cover further possible loss of revenue through tax avoidance. NA I have already explained the economic needs to which this Budget must respond. Accordingly, we have decided upon a major reduction in the size of both the total and the domestic deficits. In doing so we have continued firm restraint over our expenditures. The containment of Government spending has been one of the central elements of our economic policy. It is worth noting that in the three years to 1972-73 Commonwealth Budget outlays grew by an average of 4% per cent per year in real terms; in the three years to 1975-76, by 10!6 per cent per year; and in the three years to 1978-79 by only 1 per cent per year. There is growing and I believe proper sentiment in the community towards lower taxation and smaller government. However, it is all too often the case that enthusiasm for taxation reductions and for the general restraint on expenditures which makes these reductions possible is not matched by a willingness to accept the consequences of expenditure reductions in particular areas. It is the Government's responsibility to achieve a proper balance between these competing pressures. No one should be under any illusion that the task is easy. It is often compounded by unexpected changes in the need for certain government services. For example, an examination of our defence needs earlier this year showed that we required a greater commitment to defence spending. This priority will undoubtedly command the support of the Australian community but, obviously, it comes at a price. Furthermore, the need for social security spending-whic h is the largest single item in the Budget-ca n increase through circumstances not always within the control of any government. The proportion of social welfare pension and purbenefit recipients in the community has about doubled since 1971-72. Whilst a considerable part of this increase results from an extension of benefits such as the removal of the means test for those aged over 70 and the introduction of the sole parent benefit, social and demographic factors have also swollen the social welfare bill. These include the aging of the population, the greater tendency towards early retirement, the increased incidence of single parent families, and a sharprisein the number of World War II veterans becoming eligible for the service pension. However, all in all, this Government's record in expenditure restraint speaks for itself. On the revenue side I noted in my statement of 24 May that it was not possible to make final decisions about revenue measures for 1979-80 until closer to the Budget. I also foreshadowed in that statement that it would not prove possible to both restore tax indexation for this financial year and remove the income tax surcharge imposed in the last Budget. In the final event, we have been able, within the context of a responsible Budget, to remove the surcharge from 1 December. As it happened, there were major changes in the revenue picture between May and final preparation of the Budget. One of the main changes related to the crude oil levy. Prior to the new arrangements I announced May, it could have been expected that, on the basis of then posted OPEC prices, revenue from the levy would have been $ 1,363m in 1979-80 $ 174m more than actual receipts in 1978-79. Revenue from the levy is now estimated to $2,023m, or about $660m greater than the earlier estimate. Of this additional amount, $140m reflects the new arrangements concerning the levy on parityrelated oil announced in my statement in May and fully set out by my colleague the Minister National Development on 29 June 1979, had posted OPEC prices remained at their May cation levels. The remaining $520m thus represents the additional revenue flowing from the further price increase announced by OPEC on 28 June. But this does not mean that when we came to finalise the Budget we had $520m more in hand than we had supposed on 24 May. In particular, policy decisions aside, estimates of other revenue items were some $400m lower than the preliminary revenue estimates available in May. I shall now give details of expenditure and revenue decisions. I turn firstly to expenditure. Many of the Government's 1979-80 expendimeans ture decisions have already been announced. Deto tails of these and the others I am about to anings. nounce are contained in the accompanying benefits in 1980. Budget documents. Positive steps are being taken to maintain and improve the operational effectiveness of our defence forces. The Budget provision for defence expenditure this year is $2,887m. This is a rise of $281m and implies an increase of 2.6 per cent in real terms. The Minister for Defence will keep the Parliament informed of particular decisions made by the Government in this important area. NA Programs of the Education Commissions The provisions already announced for the Tertiary Education Commission will maintain total intakes of students into universities and colleges of advanced education in 1980 at current levels and permit substantial real increases in activity in in technical and further education. Present real levels of recurrent support for or schools will be maintained in 1980 and in some areas, such as migrant education, increased. The prospective decrease in capital expenditure is in be line with a levelling off in total enrolments in schools and projections of a downward trend throughout the 1980s. Overseas Student Charge Commencing with the 1980 academic year, for private overseas students who enrol at an Australian university or college of advanced edufor the first time, or who change courses, will be charged between $1,500 and $2,500 per year towards the cost of their tuition. Ths charge is consistent with overseas practice where foreign students attending tertiary institutions are required to contribute to the cost of their education. The move will also assist in alleviating the current excess demand for places available to overseas students. This charge is estimated to yield about $6m in 1979-80 and will help to defray the costspresently met in full by Australian taxpayers-of educating private overseas students in Australia. Full details of these new arrangements will be announced after consultations have been held with major source countries. OUTLAYS Student Assistance Schemes The Government has decided to adjust the tests used for determining student benefits reflect past increases in average weekly earnThere will be no change in the level of those These adjustments are estimated to cost $3.1 m in 1979-80 and $6.5m in a full year. NA NA Budget outlays classified as Social Security and Welfare Payments are estimated at $8,92 5m in 1979-80, an increase of 9.6 per cent and equivalent to 28 per cent of total outlays. Indexed Pensions and Benefits Last year when the Government took its decision to introduce annual indexation adjustbenefits ments of social security and repatriation pensions and benefits, it was with the prospect of a rate of inflation than now prevails. In the event this expectation Following many representations to the Government, it has been decided to restore twice automatic indexation for all and benefits. This means that in addition to the forthcoming November increase, there, will be a further increase in May 1980 in line with the rise in Consumer Price Index over the six months to December 1979. The additional cost of restoring twice yearly indexation is $63m in 1979-80. Pensioner Fringe Benefits We have decided to extend eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit Cards to supporting parents and their dependants. This means that supporting parents will be eligible, as are widows and other sole parents in similar circumstances, for certain fringe benefits, such as free pharmaceuticals. The basic income test limits for eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit Cards have not been altered since 1973. This has resulted in the loss of this particular benefit by large numbers of pensioners. As a consequence, the Government has decided to increase these limits as follows: from $33 to $40 per week in respect single people; and from $57.50 to $68 per week in respect married couples. These extensions will be effective from 1 November and are estimated to cost a total of $ 13m in 1979-80 and $23m in a full year. The"".changes to welfare benefits just outlined will also be available to repatriation pensioners. In addition, as promised in the 1977 policy hospitals. speech we have decided that, from the first pension pay-day in February 1980, the Service Pension will be available, on a similar basis as for British Commonwealth veterans, to erans who served as members of the formally raised forces of allied countries in any war warlike operations in which Australia participated. The Government will re-introduce free medical and hospital treatment for all conditions for all veterans who received TB pensions prior to 2 November 1978. There will also be increases in a range of available to specially disadvantaged Repatriation beneficiaries including Orphan's Penlower sions, Attendant's Allowance, Recreation Transport Allowance, Gift Car Allowance and was not realised. Clothing Allowance. The rate of Repatriation Funeral Benefit will yearly be increased by $200 to $300 as from 1 indexed pensions November 1979. My colleague, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, will be announcing full details tonight. The total cost of these changes is estimated at the $ 10.7m in 1979-80 and $27.6m in a full year. Other Programs Other provisions which indicate this Government's concern to assist needy groups include: $62.5m for the construction of homes and hostels for aged persons, an increase of $9.8m; a further $4m for senior citizens centres; $69.2m for assistance for pre-school and child-care projects in the States and Northern Territory, an increase of $5.4m; $39.3m for handicapped persons facilities, with further approvals up to $5m for funding in 1980-81; and grants totalling $500,000 to community welfare agencies which are in need of support in providing emergency assistance to members of the community. NA The Budget also provides $125m for special of assistance to Aboriginals through programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal of Affairs; this is an increase of about $9m on 1978-79. NA Hospital Payments The Commonwealth will provide an estimated $1194m to the States and Territories in 1979-80 under the cost-sharing arrangements for public But for the increase in public hospital charges effective from 1 September 1979, this amount those vetwould have been much greater. As foreshadowed, an independent inquiryor with the powers of a Royal Commission-is to be established to investigate and report on the efficiency and administration of hospitals. It is planned that an interim report be available by 30 June 1980. Medical Benefits Expenditure on medical benefits is estimated to increase by $64m in 1979-80 to $593m, not withstanding the previously announced changes which are to apply from 1 September 1979. In the absence of those changed arrangements, the medical benefits bill in 1979-80 would have been about $ 180m higher. Pharmaceutical Benefits Legislation is to be introduced to increase the patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits supplied under the National Health Act to the general public from $2.50 to $2.75 per prescription. This increase will be effective from 1 September and is estimated to reduce Commonwealth outlays on pharmaceutical benefits by $5m in 1979-80 and by $7m in a full year. Eligible pensioners-thos e holding a Pensioner Health Benefits Card-will , however, continue to receive their pharmaceutical benefits free of charge. The Government is also proposing to examine the range of drugs available under the National Health Act with a view to reducing the costs of the scheme by up to $20m a year. The Government will shortly receive the report of the Inquiry into the Pharmaceutical Industry-the Ralph Inquiry. NA Assistance under the overseas aid program is estimated at $485m in 1979-80, an increase of $29m. NA NA Assisted Migration Program Provision is made in the estimates for an assisted migration program of 23 500 persons in 1979-80, approximately 5000 more than last year. This total includes up to 14000 Indo-Chinese refugees, compared with 12 000 in 1978-79. Services to Migrants Some $15m will be provided in 1979-80 for the continuing implementation of the Galbally recommendations to provide special services to migrants. An amount of $24.1 m has been allocated for the Adult Migrant and Refugee Education Program, an increase of $6. lm. Departmental Charges Charges are to be introduced to help offset the administrative costs incurred by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in providing certain of its services. These charges, which will be detailed by the Minister, are estimated to yield $2.3m in 1979-80 and $4m in a full year. NA The Budget provides $319m for cultural and recreational activities, $38m more than in 1978-79. This includes $ 189.2m for the ABC and associated activities. Over the next three years the ABC will also be permitted to retain, for its own purposes, increases in revenues from its entrepreneurial activities. The total also includes: $26.3m for assistance to the arts through the Australia Council; $ 17.6m for the National Gallery, including $ 10.1 m for its new building; $4.2m for the National Parks and Wildlife Service; and $2.7m for sports development. NA Welfare Housing As already announced, the Commonwealth will provide $260m to the States for welfare housing in 1979-80. Of this, $100m will be provided by way of grants. This compares with grants of $ 14m in 1978-79 and will enable substantially increased assistance to be extended to pensioners, Aboriginals and other disadvantaged groups. Homes Savings Grants As I announced in May, the Homes Savings Grant Scheme has been modified by the introduction of a tapered dwelling value limit with the aim of directing assistance to those most in need. However, because of the build-up of approvals awaiting payment, outlays are estimated to increase from $20m in 1978-79 to $75m in 1979-80. Private Sector Housing Activity in the private sector housing area has strengthened during 1978-79. This has been aided by the record amounts of finance made available by the major housing lenders. It is the Government's policy that a high priority for housing finance be maintained consistent with overall monetary policy. Lending institutions are again being informed of the Government's wish that, within the parameters of monetary policy and subject to their own commercial judgment, they lend to home seekers to the maximum extent. NA NA The allocation for the National Water and Resources Program is to be increased from $20m to$25min 1979-80. This will enable a number of new projects to be commenced, including urgent salinity control and drainage works in the Murray Valley. NA Air Navigation Charges It is the Government's intention to fully recover costs incurred on the domestic trunk sector over the next three years. To this end we will be seeking annual increases of 25 per cent in air navigation charges for domestic airlines over that period. Air navigation charges for the general aviation sector are to be raised by 20 per cent. These increases are estimated to yield a total centre. of about $4m in 1979-80 and $8m in the first full year. Crawford Report The recommendations of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment have been ceiving careful consideration and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will make a detailed statement on the Government's response shortly. I note, however, that in respect of two of principal recommendations in the Reportpilot encouragement of exports and industrial search and development-this Government Annexe. already has a commendable record. Export Incentive Grants A total of $215m is provided for export incenstructing tive and market development grants, of$157mover 1978-79. This large increase reflects the full-year effects of the generous export incentives scheme in 1979-80. introduced last year, the strong growth in eligible exports, and steps taken to expedite the processing of claims. Industrial Research and Development Industry will also benefit from a substantial increase in the provision for industrial research and development. Expenditure for this purpose increased from $14m in 1977-78 to $24m in 1978-79 and is estimated to increase further to $32m in the current year. Tourist Industry The tourist industry has the potential to generate a large number of additional employment income opportunities in Australia. To foster this industry, the Government has decided to provide additional assistance for its expansion and development. The Minister for Industry and Commerce will announce details but I mention, as one illustration, that $8.2m will be provided to the Australian Tourist Commission in 1979-80 compared with $4.2 million last year. I shall have more to say about this industry in airline the Receipts section of this Speech. NA A further $ 10.5m will be available under the Commonwealth Regional Development Program to encourage the development of selected non-metropolitan centres, together with a further $5m for the Albury-Wodonga growth NA The Callaghan Report identified certain areas where special assistance might be provided to Tasmania and the Commonwealth proposes to reoffer assistance for a number of projects. These offers amount to $ 1.3m in 1979-80 and include assistance for native forestry, restoration and development in the Port Arthur region, the the establishment of a fish centre in Hobart and a industrial estate at Legana; and rereequipment of the Launceston Precision Tool The Commonwealth has also agreed to fund, by way of special grants, the full cost of cona second bridge across the Derwent an increase River at Hobart. The total cost of this project is estimated at about $32m of which $ 1 m is likely to be required NA NA A total of $ 131m will be provided for training programs in 1979-80 to assist some 170,000 Australians to improve their own employment prospects and to help fill gaps in the supply of skilled workers. The total provision represents a reduction of $27m, mainly because of a reduction of almost $50m, to $68m, in estimated expenditure on the National Employment and Training System (NEAT). This in turn reflects the steps taken by the Government to limit subsidy payments under the Special Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) to people who would not otherwise have been employed. Expenditure on the CRAFT program, under which employers receive tax-exempt rebates for the costs of releasing apprentices to attend approved trade and training courses, is estimated to increase by $26m to $54m. STATES, NORTHERN TERRITORY AND NA Taken together, net Commonwealth payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government authorities are estimated to increase by 7.8 per cent in 1979-80, to $ 11,608m. Payments to the Northern Territory Government amount to $442m and comprise both general and specific purpose payments akin to those made to the States. The total also includes $222m-a n increase of $42m or 24 per cent-in tax-sharing grants to local government authorities and reflects our decision to increase their share of 1978-79 personal income tax collections from 1.52 per cent to 1.75 per cent. The Government's election promise to increase the share to 2 per cent will be met by the time of the next Budget. NA NA For its part the Commonwealth intends to maintain maximum restraint on expenditures in 1979-80 and to pursue economies and eliminate wasteful practices wherever possible. In this connection I mention that last year there was a further net reduction of 780 in areas subject to staff ceilings and ing this year will be retained at about the same level as in 1978-79. In each of the past four years this Government has held actual spending below, or very close to, the Budget estimate of total outlays and we aim to maintain that good performance in 1979-80. NA In turning to the receipts side of the Budget, I deal first with personal income tax. NA As I have already indicated, it has only proved possible to remove the income tax surcharge. Tax indexation will not be restored for 1979-80. Whether or not tax indexation can be restored in 1980-81 will depend upon general economic conditions. Wage decisions by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will be relevant to that. The Government hopes that the increase in take-home pay of wage and salary earners as from 1 December will encourage greater wage restraint. Let there be no mistake. The Government wants to be in a position to restore tax indexation but economic circumstances have to be right. One of the factors which will be relevant is the extent to which wage and salary increases contribute to inflation. From 1 December 1979, the standard rate of personal income tax will be reduced from the present effective 34.57 per cent to 32 per cent for PA YE purposes and PA YE tax instalment deductions will accordingly be reduced from that date. There will be corresponding reductions of 2.57 per cent in the rates applying to higher incomes, to 46 per cent and 60 per cent. For a person on average weekly earnings, the reduction in tax instalments and increase in takehome pay will be about $4.45 a week. Rates for assessment of 1979-80 tax will be derived as a weighted average of the present effective scale for PA YE purposes and the scale to apply from 1 December. For example, the 'standard ' rate on assessment for the year as a whole will on that basis be 33.07 percent. Provisional tax payments for 1979-80 will also be based on that weighted-average rate scale where the taxpayer self-assesses. In accordance with past practice, somewhat higher rates will apply for provisional taxpayers who do not that the overall ceilself-assess. There will also be adjustments to provisional tax arrangements to take account of the withdrawal of the Trading Stock Valuation Adjustment from the beginning of the current year. Further details of these measures are contained in Statement No. 4. NA Provisional tax is not at present ary and wage earners, pensioners and superannuitants if income subject to provisional tax is less than $400. This amount, which has not been changed since 1970, is to be increased to $1,000. This will have the effect of freeing large numbers of taxpayers with small amounts of property and investment income from the liability to pay visional tax. NA A frequent concern of small business is the maintenance of adequate working capital. The Government acted in 1976 to ease the distritoday, bution requirements for private Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act by increasing the retention allowance from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. We have now decided to go butions in respect of taxable incomes of 1978-79 and subsequent years, the retention allowance for trading or business income will be increased from 60 to 70 per cent. No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule tht there is no retention allowance for dividends that one private company receives from another. The increase in the retention allowance will have negligible cost in 1979-80 but is estimated to cost $30m in a full year. NA INCOME-PRODUCING BUILDINGS-TRAVELLER NA To encourage the provision of accommodation for tourists and travellers, the Government decided to introduce a system of depreciation altonight. lowances for new income-producing buildings, or extensions to existing buildings, used for accommodation of travellers, where construction commences after today. Eligible buildings or extensions to buildings must contain at least 10 guest rooms. Depreciation will be allowed at a flat rate of Vh per cent of eligible cost. This deduction will have no cost in 1979-80 but a progressively increasing cost in subsequent years. Further details will be announced at a later date. STORAGE FACILITIES FOR GRAIN, NA Since 1973, on-farm facilities for the storage of grain, hay or fodder have been subjected to decharged to salpreciation in the usual way. In the light of recent heavy grain harvests and the consequent pressures on bulk grain facilities, and in order to encourage the holding of hay and fodder reserves against the requirements of poor seasons, a special rate of depreciation will be alprolowed in respect of on-farm facilities for the storage of grain, hay or fodder in conducting a primary production business. A rate of 20 per cent per annum will apply to such facilities which are ordered, or the construction of which by the taxpayer commences, after so that the cost of such facilities is written companies under off in 5 years. The investment allowance, at the 20 per cent rate, will continue in respect of eligible storage facilities covered by the new special rate of further. For distridepreciation. This measure, which will have negligible revenue effects in 1979-80, is estimated to cost $6m in a full year. NA NA NA Whilst the Government recognises that cars are needed in many businesses and professions it does not believe there is any reason why the revenue should subsidise the full cost of expensive luxury vehicles used for such purposes. The Government has decided to limit to $ 18,000 the amount which may be depreciated for income tax purposes for motor cars and station wagons (including four-wheel-drive vehicles, leased vehicles, and those used to provide has services to the general public) ordered after The excess of the price above $18,000 will not the be depreciable and balancing adjustments on disposal will be calculated by reference to a deemed cost of$ 18,000. The limit of $ 18,000 for depreciation purposes will be indexed annually. The gain to revenue from this proposal will be negligible in 1979-80 and $ 15m in a full year. I mention also that the Government is concerned that some lessees of cars and station wagons are, at the end of the lease, buying the vehicles for a price that enables them to profit by reselling the vehicles at their market value. As the law now stands, the resulting profit may not be taxable, even though it effectively represents a recoupment of tax deductible lease charges. Accordingly, the Government has decided to amend the law to ensure that any such profit is taxed on a basis corresponding with that applied rebate. where a person sells plant on which he has previously been allowed depreciation. The amendment will apply in respect of all cars and station wagons that are purchased from abuse. lessors by the lessee or a relative or other associate after tonight. The gain to revenue from this proposal negligible in 1979-80 but about $25m in a full year. Further details of these measures are given Statement No. 4. NA In his statement of 27 June on Energy Policy, the Prime Minister announced a number of ation measures designed to conserve scarce oil resources. Those measures will be supplemented by two income tax concessions related to conversion of oil-fired industrial equipment to other energy sources. The cost of such conversion or adaptation of an existing unit will be allowed as an outright duction in the year in which it is incurred. Where an existing oil-fired unit of property is wholly replaced by one that uses other energy sources, the replacement unit will qualify for mal depreciation but will also attract a special conversion allowance at a rate of 40 per centsuch double the investment allowance that may other30 wise have applied. To qualify, the conversion must be completed and the equipment be in use by 30 June 1982. In addition, the exemption from kits used to convert vehicles to LPG use is to be extended to compressed natural gas conversion 1979. kits, and further extended to cover conversion kits for all internal combustion engines. NA NA In order to provide further encouragement for the discovery and development of petroleum resources throughout Australia, the Government has decided to extend the present scheme of tax rebates for share capital subscribed for offshore petroleum exploration and development to subscriptions for onshore petroleum exploration and development. In addition, it has been decided to extend from two to four years the period within which capital subscribed must be spent in order to qualify for a These changes will apply to share capital subscribed after tonight. The legislation will of course contain appropriate safeguards against There will be no revenue cost in 1979-80, but an estimated $6m cost in a full year. will be SALES TAX ON EQUIPMENT USED BY NA The sales tax law already provides exemption in for a range of appliances and other goods used by blind or deaf persons. To avoid the need to amend the law frequently to cater for the development of new aids, the taxGovernment has decided to provide a general exemption that will apply to all articles designed and manufactured expressly for and of a kind used by blind or deaf persons. The exemption will apply after tonight. The cost to revenue of the new general exemption is estimated to be $ 100,000 in a full year. Details of this and some other measures in the desales tax area will be given in the enabling legislation to be introduced later this evening. NA The existing coal export duty of $3.50 per nortonne on high quality coking coal will be reduced for open-cut operations, and major expansion of operations, commencing production after June 1980, and for existing and future underground mines. The rate of duty to apply will be $1.00 per tonne-the rate presently applying to exports of sales tax to lower quality coking coal. These changes will take effect on 1 November The cost to revenue is estimated to be $ 12m in 1979-80 and $ 19m in a full year. NA Total outlays in 1979-80 are estimated to increase by 9.1 per cent to $31,692m. Total receipts, after the measures I have outlined, are estimated to increase by 15.4 per cent to $29,499m. The overall deficit is therefore estimated at $2,193m, a reduction of $ 1,285m on 1978-79. After allowance for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit is estimated at $875m in 1979-80, much less than half the domestic deficit of $2,258m in 1978-79, and the lowest for six years. To see these deficit figures in perspective it should be noted that the projected Budget deficit as a percentage of GDP has been reduced from last year's outcome of 3.4 per cent to an estimated 1.9 percent. NA This section of the Budget Speech traditionally contains views on likely developments in the economy during the year ahead. They do not, of course, represent promises or guarantees by the Government as to the outcome in certain areas. They never can. Circumstances can alter quickly to radically change the basis on which original assumptions and forecasts have been made. The monetary outcome for last year is a good example. A major part of the change was due to the unexpectedly large turnaround tor foreign exchange transactions during the year and the increase in the Budget deficit. I have already canvassed the further progress of economic recovery in 1978-79 as well as drawing attention to the heightened inflationary pressures facing the industrialised world. Quite apart from the adverse developments caused by oil price movements, 1979-80 will be a difficult year for the world economy. Nevertheless, our prospects are better than those of many other countries. Activity in the non-farm sector is expected to continue to expand in 1979-80, at a rate of over 3 per cent. Following last year's exceptionally favourable rural conditions, we must expect some falling back in farm production. However, given reasonable conditions farmers should still have a good year. GDP as a whole might increase by only 2 to 2 Vi per cent this year. Private investment should again contribute quite strongly to aggregate demand. Although plant and equipment investment will probably grow less dramatically than in 1978-79, the building and construction component of business investment is likely to keep expanding firmly. Dwelling investment is in a moderate upswing phase. Non-farm stocks are expected to accumulate fairly steadily during the year. However, total public spending on goods and services may increase somewhat more slowly than in 1978-79. Private consumption spending has been fairly subdued and there are no evident factors which suggest any major change in that trend in the months immediately ahead, although the increase in take-home pay from I December next should help. The contribution to aggregate demand from net exports of goods and services is likely to be quite strong. As a result, the improvement in the current account deficit which occurred during the second half of last year should be maintained. Whereas the deficit amounted to $3,156m in 1978-79, it could decline by several hundred million dollars in 1979-80. There are also good prospects of a continuation of the recent stronger rate of net private in private sec- capital inflow. Taken together, these improvements would, of course, permit a substantially lower overseas borrowing program by the Commonwealth than last year. Against this background, we expect a moderate growth in job opportunities during the year. Wage and salary earner employment is expected to grow by about 1 per cent. Although the level of unemployment remains high, recent trends in labour force participation rates have combined with growing employment to hold it broadly steady over the past year. We do not expect unemployment to improve in the year ahead. As to the inflation outlook, factors already in the system are likely to lead to higher rates of increase in price indices in the months immediately ahead, before a renewed downward trend can be established. Those factors include recent oil price increases still largely to be reflected in the Consumer Price Index, higher costs of health care as a result of changed financing arrangements and increases in doctors' fees, and some acceleration of wage costs. For 1979-80 as a whole, the CPI is presently on estimated to increase by a little above 10 per cent. It is expected to peak with a relatively large December quarter increase due to the coincidence of the factors I have mentioned. It is essential for our future economic prosperity that the temporary factors putting upward pressure on prices in recent months do not become permanently built into the inflation base. For this reason, restraint on the part of all those involved in wage determinationincluding, not least, the arbitral authorities themselves-is no less vital than it ever was. NA I turn now to the monetary prospect for the year ahead. First, the expected improvement in the balance of payments on private account is likely to result in an addition to domestic liquidity in 1979-80, in contrast to the reduction from this source over 1978-79 as a whole. This involves a turnaround in private sector foreign exchange transactions which has already become apparent in recent months. The turnaround is expected to amount to approximately $ 1,000m or more and will convert the negative impact of these transactions of some $250m on the money supply last year to a sharply positive impact in 1979-80. Another large wheat harvest is being foreshadowed. The Government will, however, again seek arrangements for financing advances to growers so as to minimise the addition to liquidity. As was the case last year, this will not be at extra cost to growers. The large reduction in the domestic Budget deficit will, of course help greatly in the growth of the monetary aggregates. Moreover this year the borrowing requirement of the public sector as a whole will be markedly reduced; the net reduction on account of the goals. Commonwealth Budget and approved Loan Council programs is some $ I billion. I reaffirm that the Government's monetary policy is directed at providing adequate funds for sustainable expansion in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down competition. steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. There is a need for growth in the monetary aggregates this year to be reduced 1978-79. The Government has already taken a number of measures to that end. As was evident in 1978-79, circumstances can arise which render appropriate a monetary outcome different from any initial projection at the outset of a financial year. For 1979-80, it is believed that growth in the broadly defined measure of the volume of money (M3) of about 10 per cent over the course of the year would be compatible with policy. Economic developments throughout the year may make appropriate an outcome either above or below that projection. However on present assessments it seems appropriate that the outcome be not more than ten percent. There will be a fairly sizeable bond-selling task for that outcome to be achieved. But, given the expected trends in underlying conditions, and with appropriateflexibilityin the operation of policy, it should be manageable. I reaffirm the Government's commitment to the importance of monetary control in bearing down on inflation and for the pursuit of a path of economic stability. With this commitment, supported by our continued emphasis on fiscal restraint, we look forward to further sustainable growth in activity, and the prospect of seeing, by the latter part of the year, a return to a downward trend in the rate of inflation. NA This Budget has been framed to meet the needs of the Australian economy in 1979. Its object is to reduce inflation and promote moderating sound and broadly based growth. It provides incentive for both individuals and businesses within a responsible overall framework conducive to our longer term economic It significantly reduces the call of Government upon the nation's financial markets. It equips Australia to succeed in a world environment of rising inflation and intensifying I commend it to Honourable Members.",72

APPENDIX: THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF BUDGET The functional classification brings objectives or purposes. As such it facilitates ation on the nature of government particular objectives. The functional classification is national accounting conventions and (national accounts) classification of adopted are broadly those set out A System of National Accounts which standards for the classification The major functional headings consistent with those used by the Australian it should be noted that in the latter's transactions cover both Budget transactions and transactions of Commonwealth Government the Budget sector. Information on the the Budget sector is shown in the Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth the Budget. Two further significant differences primary industry assistance are shown relevant primary industry levies and the Statistician. Secondly, net proceeds Commonwealth stockpile under arrangements shown in the Budget Statements as revenues Statistician's publications these transactions and are netted off outlays. NA The contents of each function are this Appendix. It will be evident classification is relatively aggregative heading, however, have been grouped blocks which lend themselves to always represent detailed purpose-oriented speaking it is not possible, for example, departments and to allocate Given the need to monitor actual basis consistent with the annual estimates necessary to work largely from existing NA together outlays directed towards like meaningful presentations of informactivities and on the resources devoted to NA applied to Budget aggregates derived using is therefore consistent with the economic Budget data. The conventions and principles in the 1968 United Nations publication provides widely accepted international of public sector outlays. adopted for Budget purposes are conceptually Statistician in his publications, but publications Commonwealth Government (shown in the Budget Statements) authorities which operate outside transactions of authorities operating outside document National Accounting Estimates of Government Authorities published with should be noted. First, outlays on in the Budget Statements 'net' of the charges but are shown on a gross basis by from the sale of uranium from the made with certain companies are from sales of existing assets; in the are treated as reductions in stocks NA described briefly in the final section of from those descriptions that the functional in nature. Outlays under each functional together into identifiable and meaningful comment and analysis. These blocks do not sub-functions or programs; generally to dissect administrative outlays of them to particular sub-functions. outlays and receipts monthly, and on a in the Budget documents, it has been central accounting records. These records are built around the Appropriation expenditure rather than detailed costing classification, therefore, have been derived data, supplemented by a limited amount items which cover more than one function or purpose. Functional categories do not necessarily departmental structures. Furthermore, in arriving at aggregates. Expenditure of a particular department may, therefore, functional heading and it is not always items in the Budget Statements. A reconciliation between total outlays appropriations of the Consolidated of Budget Document No. 4 Estimates Expenditure. Although the basic aim of a functional broad purposes for which government outlays cannot always be applied unambiguously. or more distinct functions: military both a defence and an education purpose. cation scheme therefore requires that which it is considered primarily to function is considered to be defence; recommendations. Any single classification system cannot, time on every outlay characteristic that mentary information on particular aspects other documents; details of wage and in the document Estimates of Receipts and a separate Budget Paper is provided Northern Territory and Local Government issued with the Budget Speech deal with Overseas Development Assistance Program. NA The principles underlying the national data are set out in the Appendix to Bulletin entitled National Accounting Australian Government Authorities, Budget outlays and receipts based Budget data on a basis which can be published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Acts, which are the legal authority for documents. The figures in the functional essentially by reclassifying appropriation of additional data on large appropriation correspond with appropriation or some outlay and receipt figures are netted votes and revenue heads under the control be classified under more than one possible to identify individual appropriation shown in Statement No. 3 and in the Revenue Fund is set out in Tables 1 and 2 of Receipts and Summary of Estimated classification scheme is to reveal the are undertaken, such a classification Particular outlays will often serve two colleges, for example, may be said to serve The application of a functional classifian outlay be classified to the function serve.

This has in the Statements the same relates. From time to time, it is necessary reflect changes in the organisation requires that, the receipts and outlay figures Speech show the net transactions of the economy. Some important characteristics of followed in the Statements are: Funds forming the Public Account (the Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consoliare eliminated. For example, payments to as part of outlays; rather, the expenditure The aim is to record the transactions sector and the rest of the economy; which are essentially of a governmental and compulsory payment, are normally As mentioned earlier, however, various primary which are collected by the Government and for the purposes of commodity stabilisation, are offset against the relevant outrepayments are normally offset against the at net figures. For example, repayments of offset against the corresponding advances. outlays and recoveries or repayments the extent to which resources are directed particular activity.

The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure, grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and new policy initiatives not previously authorised by special legislation. Details of these proposed expenditures totalling $ 1,452.486m are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill. Of this total, $754.718m was authorised by Supply Act (No. 2) 1979-80, the balance of $797.768m being authorised by this Bill. An amount of $I00m is included in the Bill for the advance to the Minister for Finance. The main features of the proposed expenditure for 1979-80, of which this Bill will authorise part, were outlined in my Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

201,Mr ADERMANN,VETERANS,"by leave-As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced, some important increases and extensions in repatriation benefits will be effected in this financial year. I would like, for the benefit of honourable members, to provide details of these and other Budget measures which will concern veterans. I am pleased that the Government has been able to act now to improve very appreciably the lot of those who served their country in time of conflict and these measures certainly emphasise the Government's commitments to veterans and our determination to ensure that the continuing needs of veterans are met. When the Government came to office it had to review very carefully all fields of its expenditure and veterans' affairs was no exception. Administrative expenses were cut back wherever possible without affecting the quality of treatment services available through the repatriation system or the level of compensation to disabled veterans and their dependants. Despite this, some significant improvements have been made. In 1976 we announced the indexation of the main repatriation pensions in line with movements in the consumer price index, the first inExpencreases under this new arrangement applying from May 1977. This has been 100 per cent indexation and not discounted. Indexation, which and will now be twice yearly, Mr Speaker, has been one of the most significant developments in the history of repatriation. It has given our veterans and their families the security of knowing that of their pensions are not eroded by inflation. In addition to indexation, repatriation pensioners enjoy freedom from taxation on disability pensions. This has placed them in a favourable position compared with a general community dependent upon wages and salaries. Despite the great value of indexation, however, the Governhas not until now been in a position to increase many repatriation benefits, and particularly those which are directed at the most disadvantaged groups among the veteran population. It has now decided that the effective value of many of these benefits will be increased. As mentioned by the Treasurer, these allowances are to be increased from 1 November next. The increases are substantial. The funeral benefit, for instance, will be increased by $200 to a new level of $300. The benefit for an orphan of a veteran who has lost both parents will be increased by $4.10 to $25 weekly, and for an orphan who has lost one parent by half this amount. Seriously disabled veterans who require the help of an attendant will receive an extra $10.10 a week, making the new benefit $35 a week, while those less seriously afflicted will receive an increase of $2.80 a week, making the new weekly rate $ 17.50. Seriously disabled veterans, Mr Speaker, greatly suffer from a loss of social mobility unless special arrangements are made for them. Because of this, the recreation transport allowance for the most seriously handicapped is to be raised by $4 to $50 a month, and for the less seriously handicapped it will be raised by half this amount to $20 a month. Some veterans, because of the nature of these disabilities, are provided with cars at no cost to them, together with an annual allowance. As honourable members are aware, the cost of maintaining a car has risen considerably in the last few years, and so the Government has cided to increase the annual allowance for this purpose by $48 to a new figure of $480 a year. to Because of their disabilities, certain veterans perience unusual wear and tear on their clothing. To help meet this cost,a small is provided at three different rates. As from 1 November, these rates will be increased, the highest rate being now $ 1.50 a week. Whenever a veteran is required to travel connection with repatriation pension or treatbenefit ment matters, he is reimbursed travel and sistence costs at set levels. These rates of bursement' have not been changed for some years, although costs to the veteran have increased markedly in the meantime. This Government has decided therefore that travel and subsistence allowances will be automatically adjusted in future in line with the levels paid Commonwealth public servants. The daily subso sistence rate for attendance for official purposes in a capital city will be increased by $18.65 to new rate of $41.15, while the daily rate for athas tendance elsewhere will rise by $ 17.50 to $34.50. Some veterans, who live relatively near to the departmental office or hospital may not incur high costs, but in the event of their required to attend during a mealtime, new rates up to $7.80 will apply from 1 November. Where it is medically necessary for a veteran to use his own motor vehicle for such official attendance, new rates of reimbursement, more in line with current costs, will be paid. Where it is not medically necessary for a veteran to use his own vehicle, he will normally be reimbursed at rates based on public transport travel costs. If he travels by rail, the standard will now be first class. In 1977, the Government decided that a review of all pensions paid in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis would be carried out to ascertain actual levels of disability in line with the general principles of the repatriation system. Rates for the TB pension were frozen at the May 1978 cash levels pending the outcome of the review, which is nearing completion. This decision placed the TB pensioners on the same footing as all other veterans and, in so doing, confirmed a principle, namely, that pension and treatment benefits be related to the degree of actual disability. The review has provided an opportunity for an accurate determination of the needs of veteran TB pensioners and a fully informed reassessment of their total situation. On the basis of this reassessment the Government has decided that eligibility for full, free medical treatment will apply immediately to those veterans who were receiving a depension for pulmonary tuberculosis before 2 November 1978. In addition, they will continue receive for life a pension paid at a rate not less exthan the 100 per cent general rate applicable in May 1978 irrespective of the degree of actual clothing allowance incapacity. Veterans in receipt of the service pension, which is similar to the social security age penin sion, could be entitled to a pensioner health card to show their eligibility for full, free submedical treatment under the arrangements reimadministered by the Department of Health. In considering eligibility, other income is considered, and in the case of veterans half of any disability pension is taken into account. The indexation of disability pensions has taken a number of Service pensioners beyond the limit of to other income on which eligibility depends, and they have lost PHB entitlement and eligibility for certain fringe benefits which all add up to a a considerable saving in a year. The limit for PHB been $33 a week in the case of the single pensioner and $57.50 in the case of a married pensioner. As for social security pensioners, these limits are to be lifted from 1 November to $40 being and $68 a week respectively. The extension of Australian repatriation benefits to veterans who served in Allied, rather than Australian, forces during wartime has been an important issue for many years. Eligibility for the Service pension was extended to those who served in British Commonwealth forces in 1975, and in 1977 the Government accepted the argument that such eligibility should be extended to members of Allied forces now living in Australia. The need for maximum financial restraint has prevented this until now. I am sure that all members will agree that those who fought for the Allied cause in time of war have considerable claim to benefit. In view of the tremendous contribution which they have made to this country since the war, it is onlyfittingthat they should be eligible for the Service pension on a similar basis as Australian and British Commonwealth veterans. As announced, from thefirstpension payday in February next year, Mr Speaker, Allied veterans will be eligible to applyforthe Service pension on the similar basis to that applying to British Commonwealth veterans. The exact details of this eligibility will be included in legislation to be introduced later in this session. Apart from indexation, the measures I have outlined tonight will cost $30m in a full year. The pension increases alone in November 1979 will cost $84m in a full year. The lifting of pensioner health benefit income limits will lead to additional Commonwealth expenditure through the Department of Health. This is a very considerable additional expenditure by the Government when you bear in mind that we were already spending more than $1.1 billion a year on maintaining the repatriation system. Let me repeat, Mr Speaker, more than $1.1 billion. It is estimated that pensions and allowances alone this year will amount to nearly $950m. Finally, Mr Speaker, I would remind honourable members that these increases in expenditure will add to a repatriation system which is outstanding by world standards. Compared with arrangements in other countries with comparable standards of living, the Australian repatriation system is generous. The Government has not been able to increase other than the main repatriation pensions for three years, but this has been a matter of priorities in which we were guided by continuing consultation with organisations representing veterans. Improving other benefits has been a large factor in the regular consultations between myself and my Department on one hand and the National President of the Returned Services League, Mr Keys, and the federal leaders of various organisations on the other hand. This has also been the subject of discussion whenever, as I do frequently, I visit subbranches of the RSL or other gatherings of veterans. Now, I am happy to say, we have been able to adjust these allowances to conform with current needs. These increases in benefits, restoration of six-monthly indexation, lifting the limits applying to pensioner health benefits and the restoration of full, free medical treatment to veterans who have suffered tuberculosis, plus inclusion of allied veterans into the Australian repatriation system, is evidence for the whole country that this Government has compassion and is very mindful of the needs of the veteran and his dependants. There is no doubt of the obligation which the Australian people still owes our veterans. I hope, Mr Speaker, that the new measures announced in the Budget will demonstrate that the Government fully accepts this commitment.",356
202,Dr KLUGMAN,VETERANS,"by leave-The Opposition obviously welcomes the benefits for veterans which to a large extent have been restored by the provisions in the Budget brought down tonight. It is important to emphasise that to a large extent this is a partial restoration of benefits withdrawn by this Government less than one year ago. On 12 October 1978 this House debated amendments to the Repatriation Act. There were four main amendments. They dealt with changes to the pension entitlements of pulmonary tuberculosis sufferers, the abolition of the sustenance allowance, the introduction of yearly instead of six-monthly adjustments to repatriation pensions and the introduction of a means test for certain repatriation pensioners. Nothing has been done about the last point and nothing has been done about the abolition of the sustenance allowance. I cannot think of a word which would accord with parliamentary practice to describe the performance of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Adermann) and the Government in respect of sufferers of pulmonary tuberculosis. They took from TB sufferers benefits which, in some cases, they had been receiving for many years. These people had to undergo many medical examinations. There must have been tremendous costs as far as medical examinations and administration were concerned. This change upset many people and now the Government has partially reintroduced- I emphasise the word 'partially'the benefits for those TB sufferers. Until last year TB sufferers, provided they were ex-servicemen, did not have to prove that the tuberculosis was due to war service. The persons concerned were in receipt of the 100 per cent benefit. It was, of course, increased as the 100 per cent rate was increased. It was then decided that this would no longer be done. If I remember correctly, they stayed on the 100 per cent rate until such time as they had their examination but they were no longer eligible for medical benefits. They will now become eligible for free medical treatment as far as repatriation is concerned but they still will stay on the frozen 100 per cent rate. That rate does not increase as far as those persons are concerned. I would be interested to hear from the Minister when he presents the appropriate legislation what the cost to the Department was of this completely unnecessary decision last year. I am sure that the cost of medical examinations et cetera was greater than the saving during that year. Veterans, the same as all social security ents, also have lost one indexation increase. The indexation which should have taken May did not take place. Indexation has been reintroduced on a six-monthly basis. It will not cost the Government any extra in November becongratulate cause the November increase was based on the yearly increase anyway. It is for the Minister to state in the second last page of his statement, as though it is something new, that the pension increases alone in November 1979 comparable will cost $84m in a full year. That case. That increase of $84m was always to take place. It was the normal indexation increase from the time the Government decided change from six-monthly indexation to yearly indexation. The eligibility for fringe benefits has been lifted. We certainly welcome that improvement. It is interesting to note the my Question on Notice No. 3968. The third part of that question, dealing with income limits and fringe benefits for repatriation pensioners, asks what would these limits be now if they had been granted. updated in accordance with the consumer price index. The Minister tells us that that is what he has done. He has increased those limits to $40 and $68 for single and married pensioners repened. spectively. In the answer to the question he tells us that the new limits ought to be $62.10, $40, for a single person and $ 108.15, not $68, for a married couple. So much for the honesty of this Government. But 1 suppose that veterans have to be pleased that they got something from the Minister. The Minister referred in his speech crease in the allowance for those veterans who have such severe disabilities that they are provided with cars together with an annual allow the ance. He said: As honourable members are awareVery much awarethe cost of maintaining a car hasrisenconsiderably in the last few years, and so the Government has decided to increase the annual allowance for this purpose by $48 to a new figure of$480ayear. In other words, there has been about a 12 per cent increase. Yet those of us who live in capital cities know that at the beginning of last year petrol was available in Sydney at approximately 13c a litre. Today it costs a minimum of 29c a litre and I understand that a new increase is in the pipeline. It already applies in other States apart from New South Wales and South Australia. There has been an increase from 13c to 29c in the cost of petrol since February last year. Yet this Government proposes a 12 per cent increase in recipithe allowance available to those veterans who have such severe disabilities that they have to use place last a car continuously. I make one point in conclusion and that is to the Minister on his honesty. In the first paragraph on page six of the speech discompletely wrong tributed he said: Compared with arrangements in other countries with standards of living, the Australian repatriation was always the system is very generous. In his speech he deleted the word 'very'. I am sure that that shows great honesty on the part of to the Minister and I congratulate him.",358

211,Mr HUNT,SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAMS,"by leave-The Treasurer (Mr Howard), in his Budget Speech, referred to changes in social security programs. It is appropriate that I elaborate on his statement and provide the House with some additional information. The Treasurer, in his statement of 24 May 1979 in which he announced certain decisions on expenditure and taxation, said: Against the severity of these frighten people receiving Commonwealth social security pensions and benefits and repatriation payments. These payments will be maintained by the Government. The fearmongers should be ignored. The Government has maintained social security payments. It has also been able to make some very worthwhile improvements to the social security and welfare system. In particular, we will restore half-yearly indexation of pensions and benefits; extend the income limits for pensioner fringe benefits; extend eligibility for pensioner health benefit cards to supporting parent beneficiaries; provide grants to voluntary agencies providing emergency relief; significantly increase expenditure on services for families and children; and increase the rates of workers compensation for Commonwealth employees. Half-Yearly Indexation This year the Government has given very careful consideration to the issue of indexation in the light of present economic and budgetary circumstances and, as the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech, the Government is pleased to be able to restore twice-yearly indexation. The Government will be introducing legislation to amend the Social Services Act to enable the following payments to be increased automatically in May and November each year in accordance with movements in the consumer price index: Age, invalid and widows' pensions; supporting parents' benefits; wives' pensions; sheltered employment allowances; unemployment benefit for all people aged 18 or over with dependants and for married people aged 16 or 17 years; and sickness benefits for all people aged 18 or over and for married persons aged 16 or 17 years. Indexation will not be introduced to cover the following payments: Unemployment benefits for single persons aged 16 or 17 years and for those aged 18 or more without dependants; sickness benefits for single persons aged 16 or 17 years; and age pension paid free of income test to people aged 70 years or more. With the concurrence of honourable members. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the maximum current rates of the basic pensions and benefits together with the maximum rates that will apply from November 1979.

213,Mr HUNT,MAXIMUM RATES OF PENSIONS AND BENEFITS,"I thank the House. Fringe Benefit Income Limits One area of great concern to pensioners has been the income test limits for pensioner fringe benefits. Commonwealth fringe benefits available to pensioners holding pensioner health benefit cards include: Access to bulk billing of medical fees; a range of free pharmaceuticals; access to free optometrical consultations and hearing aids; a one-third reduction in telephone rentals; and some reductions in fares on Commonwealth rail and shipping services. In addition, State governments and various private organisations provide assistance to these pensioners. At present a pensioner loses all of these fringe benefits if his private income reaches $33 a week for a single pensioner and $57.50 a week for a married pensioner couple. These amounts are higher where there are children. Whilst it is difficult to calculate the value to the individual pensioner of fringe benefits, it has been suggested that, on average, they could be worth up to about $10 a week. The income limits for fringe benefits have health been fixed for sometime.Some pensioners have lost entitlement to fringe benefits as a result creases to their superannuation or war pensions over which they have no control. Accordingly, the Government has decided to increase these limits to $40 a week for a single pensioner $68 a week for a married pensioner couple. These amounts are higher where there are chilbenefits dren. It is estimated that some additional 25,000 pensioners plus 5,000 dependants will qualify pensioner health benefit cards as a result of these increases.

Extension of Eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit Cards to Supporting Parent Beneficiaries For some time the Government has been aware of differences in the treatment of different sole parents. When we came to office, there was no specific assistance available to sole fathers and supporting mother beneficiaries were not eligible for the full range of pensioner fringe benefits-the y were not eligible for pensioner health benefits. In 1977 this Government introduced the supporting parents benefit, which replaced the supporting mothers benefit, and extended eligibility for assistance to sole fathers on essentially the same basis as for sole mothers. We have now decided to extend eligibility for pensioner health benefit cards to supporting parent beneficiaries subject to the liberalised pensioner fringe benefit income test outlined above. As a result, Commonwealth fringe benefit assistance for supporting parent beneficiaries will be exactly the same as that for Class A widow pensioners. The rates of assistance are already the same. It is estimated that some 56,000 supporting parent beneficiaries, including 2,500 men, plus 96,000 dependants will qualify for pensioner benefit cards. As a result their health costs will be reduced significantly. This will be of of inspecial importance to those with young children, particularly children suffering from chrome illnesses. Eligibility for fringe benefits provided by State governments and other organisations are and generally restricted to holders of pensioner health benefit cards. The extension of these to supporting parent beneficiaries and to pensioners with private incomes between the for existing and proposed income limits will, however, be a matter for the States and other responsible bodies. Other Income Security Measures The Government has already announced its intention to charge long term hospital patients who are, in effect, nursing home type patients an amount towards their care and accommodation on a similar basis to nursing home patients. This change will not come into effect until the States agree to changes in the hospital cost-sharing agreements. As a consequence of the Government's decision in this area some minor improvements will also be made to provisions under the Social Services Act, namely: The standard rate of pension is to be tended to a woman receiving a wife's pension where the living expenses of a married couple are likely to be greater than they would otherin wise be because illness or infirmity prevents them from living together. As area a wife pensioner will be treated as if she were a pensioner in her own right. Eligibility for wife's pension is to tended to a woman who is an inmate of a evolent home and to a woman who has no child or has not attained SO years of age where her husband is an inmate of a benevolent home. Thus, where either or both of a married couple are inmates of a benevolent home, wife's pension will be payable on the same basis as age or invalid pension. Emergency Assistance During the last election the Government made a commitment to provide $500,000 to assist voluntary agencies providing emergency relief. Last year the Australian Council of Social Serbenefits vice and the Department of Social Security were commissioned to prepare a report on emergency relief-giving agencies and their clients. The port of the joint study entitled 'Emergency to Relief- A Study of Agencies and Clients' was tabled in the Senate on 29 March 1979. The Government has decided to allocate $500,000 1979-80 to assist voluntary agencies providing emergency relief and to provide special assistment ance to welfare organisations experiencing cial difficulty. In addition, administrative changes have taken place in the Department of Social Security to give immediate assistance way of special benefit under the Social Services Act to clients suffering hardship. In view of findings of the joint study, these measures will duce the burden on voluntary agencies and State welfare administrations. Assistance to the Aged Apart from the payment of pensions, the Government provides assistance for the provision of suitable homes for the aged and disabled and home care services including senior citizens' centres. In addition, the Government provides a personal care subsidy for organisations providing hostel accommodation and a delivered meals subsidy for organisations providing meals-on-wheels services. Total expenditure allocated under the aged or disabled persons homes and aged persons hostels programs is $62.5m in 1979-80. In 1978-79 $52.7m was spent. This year's allocation should enable all exapproved projects to be completed. Early approval has also been given for funding additional priority projects to the value of $ 10m in 1980-81 order that the necessary forward planning and development of those projects can be completed a result, in this during 1979-80. In 1979-80 $4m has been allocated for grants towards the costs of senior citizens' centres. In 1978-79 $3m was spent. A joint be exCommonwealth-State announcement on the new benprojects to be funded will be made as soon as State governments confirm their priority lists. Spending under other pans of the home care services program will also increase from $822,000 to $1,128,000 for grants towards salaries of welfare officers and from $8,586,000 to $9,255,000 on grants towards costs of home care services. These increases follow on a large increase in total Commonwealth expenditure on home care services last year. Assistance for the Handicapped Apart from the payment of invalid pensions, sheltered employment allowances, sickness and handicapped child's allowance paid under the Social Services Act, the Government assists handicapped people under the Handirecapped Persons Assistance Act by way of grants eligible organisations to establish and operate sheltered workshops, activity therapy and training centres and residential accommodation for in handicapped children and adults. In addition, the Government provides rehabilitation treatand training through the Commonwealth finanRehabilitation Service. Expenditure under the handicapped persons by welfare program will total $30.3m in 1979-80. Approval will also be given to new projects durthe ing the financial year, some of which will be recompleted during 1979-80. Additionally, new projects will be approved this financial year in order that planning can be undertaken to enable funding in 1980-81. Expenditure by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will rise from $ 17.3m to $ 19.2m in 1979-80. Thisrisefollows the expansion of rehabilitation services to Townsville, Hobart and Darwin together with the effects of the widened eligibility criteria nounced by the Government in 1977. Assistance for the Homeless Expenditure under the homeless persons assistance program will increase from $2,781,000 to $5,640,000 in 1979-80. The higher expenditure reflects progress on construction of two major centres in Brisbane. At 30 June 1979, 113 other centres catering for homeless persons were receiving recurrent assistance. The Government has also decided to extend the principal Act to permit continued rental subsidies. Children's Services In addition to the payment of universal family allowances, double orphans pension and handinational capped child's allowance and additional ments for the children of pensioners and Council beneficiaries, the Government provides under children's services program financial assistance to community organisations, local government bodies and the States for a range of care services for children under 18 years and services to port their families. A block grant is also the States and the Northern Territory for preordinating schools. Total expenditure under the children's services program will rise from $63,786,000 to $69,220,000 in 1979-80. Grants for services for families and children will rise by $5,094,000 to $36,130,000. Particular types of services funded include day-care, emergency outside school hours and vacation care. The Government also given priority to expansion of services these areas. An announcement will be made in the near future of new projects to be funded under the children's services program and on special grants to mark the International Year of the Child. The Fraser Government has more than doubled assistance on child care and other related services from $ 16.9m in 1975-76 to $36.13m in the present Budget. Assistance to the States for preschool education will be maintained. A total of $32.75m will be provided this year. For the first time assistance of $340,000 will be provided for pre-schools in the Northern Territory. Pilot Programs The welfare rights program provided funds for the appointment of welfarerightsofficers to work with organisations associated with disadvantaged minority groups within the community. Ten organisations received grants during the pilot period of the program and these will now be funded within other Commonwealth programs. The community information centre program was a pilot program to evaluate means anof providing community information and referral services to assist people to make use of the full range of welfare services and facilities offered by the community. The pilot program has now been completed. The centres will be funded within exisung programs. Assistance for Research and Welfare Co-ordination The Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales will become operational during this year. A sum of $300,000 has been provided for the centre's operation in 1979-80. There has also been an expansion in the Budget of the social welfare policy secretariat from $424,000 to $564,000. Total allocations to social welfare co-ordinating organispayations have been increased. The Australian of Social Service, the Australian Council its for Rehabilitation of Disabled and the Australian Council on the Ageing have had their basic Commonwealth Grants increased by $10,000 to $160,000. In addition, the Australian supPre-School Association will receive $50,000, made to together with an additional sum for cothe activities of Lady Gowrie centres. Compensation Rates for Commonwealth Government Employees The Government has decided to increase, from 1 September 1979, the rates of workers has compensation payable to Commonwealth emin ployees by about \2Vi percent. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the existing and proposed rates. Leave granted. The table read as follows: NA NA From 1 September Existing 1979 $ a week $ a week Total Incapacity* Benefits Employee 80.00 90.00 Spouse 21.00 23.60 Each Child 10.00 11.25 Partial Incapacity Benefits Maximum rates 80.00 90.00 Attendant's Allowance . . . 14.00 15.75 Death Benefits Lump sum (maximum) . . 25,000 Minimum Payment for each child 1,000 Funeral Benefit(maximum) Cost of certain aids Appliances * These rates apply after the expiration of the first 26 weeks during which the employee receives full pay.",361

Despite the need to restrain public expenditure the been able significantly to improve benefits available to the needy members of the community. This is a compassionate Budget. The Fraser indexation. Government has continued to give a high prients ority to income security and social welfare. sure the Government's approach will be endorsed by all Australians.",364
215,Dr KLUGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"by leave-As the these new measures announced by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) on behalf of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) improve benefits for social beneficiaries support of the Opposition. However, it is important to look at these new measures in the context of the Budget and I will make a couple of points concerning them. There has been a very sharp crease in revenue in this Budget. It has risen total by 15.4 per cent in money terms. Even with the 10 per cent inflation rate that is a very nificant increase in revenue. On the expenditure side of the Budget there is in fact a loss of about one per cent in real terms. Obviously this does not apply only to the question of social security. However, it is important to point out to the people of Australia that income tax from pay-asyou-earn and other sources-incom e tax colcome lected from individuals, in other words-wil l crease to about $15.1 billion in this financial year. It is in increase of 18.2 per cent in nominal terms or, taking a 10 per cent inflation rate, an increase of about 8 per cent cent in real terms. The effect is to raise personal income taxes as proportion of total revenue from 50 per cent proximately last year to 51.3 per cent in this coming year, in spite of the fact that there has been an increase of $800m already in the soand called crude oil levy. Not only has the Government failed to reduce From taxes but also it has actually increased the im1 September Existing 1979 portance of income taxes. I think it is an important point to emphasise continually that this $ a week $ a week Government, certainly in 1975, and I think to a large extent in 1977, came into power on the 28,000 basis that it would reduce taxation. It is import10.00 11.25 ant to remember that this Government now has a a week a week highest point ever of $15.1 billion collection of income tax. The total taxes and charges in this 1,125 financial year are up to $27,000m, or a 54 per 650 730 cent increase in revenue since this Government took office. This is background information for 700 780 this House in looking at the increased benefits which have been announced tonight. I think it is also important to remember that one of the major so-called increased benefits is really a restoration- I emphasise that-of 6Government has necessaryindexation. monthly This restoration has become because last October this Government changed from 6-monthly indexation to yearly Therefore, all social security recipiwho were covered by indexation in fact lost I am out on one indexation stage. The second point to remember is that many of the other benefits that were removed last year have not been restored. I refer to such things as introduction of a means test upon increased age pensions for those over 70. That has not been changed. Their pension remains as it was; there has been no restoration of the provision for they receive the increases. There has been no indexation of the family allowance. That is probably one of the worse feaintures of the whole Budget. If we examine the in family allowance- and I was a strong supporter of its introduction in place of the tax rebates and sigchild endowment which had obtained for many years-w e find that the loss in benefits to a taxpaying family in respect of their first child has become $2.70 a week; in respect of a family with two children it has become $4.42 a week. For a family with three children it has become $6.10 a week; for one with four children it has become $8 a week; and for one with six children it has be$10.50 a week. These very, very significant inlosses to those families have resulted from the failure to index the family allowances. Again, in respect of fringe benefits there has been a partial attempt at indexation, but I repeat a what I said a few minutes ago with respect to reappatriation pensioners, because exactly the same figures apply. The new weekly figures in respect of fringe benefits will be $40 for single persons $68 for married couples, when they should be $62.10 for single persons and $108.15 for married couples. Those figures indicate the very large difference between what should have been done by this Government and what has in fact been done by it. A moment ago the Minister for Health said that he was pleased to be able to announce restoration of six-monthly indexation. Let look at what the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said about an hour ago at page 9 of his Budget Speech. He did not say that he was pleased to able to restore indexation in respect of pensions and benefits. He said: Last year when the Government took its decision to duce annual indexation adjustments of social security and repatriation pensions and benefits, lower rate of inflation than now prevails. In the event this expectation was not realised. Following many representations to the Government, been decided to restore twice yearly automatic indexation for all indexed pensions and benefits. So the Treasurer does not pretend that he is pleased to be able to restore these benefits. sorry that he has to do so because his economic policy has failed, as far as inflation The only argument that the Fraser Government had was that during the last few years inflation had in fact improved, but now inflation is increasing continually and quite significantly. What the Government has had been forced upon it because inflation has again been getting out of control. A few minutes ago the Minister for Health was given leave to incorporate in Hansard tables showing what the benefits, in two cases, would be as from November 1979. He was terribly under proud of this and took credit for it, as if it were new benefit. Let us remember that it is not. the November increase. The figure looks imsingle pressive. Last year the Government removed sixTheir monthly indexation and, as a result of its restoThisfigurerepresents ration, the increase in benefits now looks quite large. Instead of two six-monthly benefits have had a single 12-monthly benefit, with high inflation rates in between. On the question of unemployment and sick58,000 ness benefits, I make the following point: night in the Budget Speech it was announced that pharmaceutical benefits will be increased from $2.50 to $2.75. The patient contribution will be increased by only a relatively small amount-1 0 per cent. But unemployment sickness beneficiaries do not receive pensioner health benefit cards for pharmaceuticals. They are in a very difficult position in many cases, especially those who are in receipt of sickness benefits. As far as medical services are concerned, they can be treated by doctors as disadvantaged persons but, as far as pharmaceuticals prescribed by those doctors are concerned, they have to pay $2.75 for each prescription. That is a large amount of money for a person who is rethe ceiving only a small amount. I appeal to the us Government- I know that it has had many representations, not only from individuals and from our side of the House but also from The Pharbe macy Guild of Australia-to try to do something for recipients of social security benefits who are not able to get pensioner health benefit cards and introare therefore unable to get free pharmaceuticals. Special benefits are not mentioned with unemit was with the prospect of a ployment and sickness benefits. Usually they are mentioned. Does that mean that they are not being increased or is it just an oversight on the it has part of the Government? Special benefits are often the most important benefits. They go to the people who need them the most. It is important to realise that the single pension is now reduced He is to 22.8 per cent of average weekly earnings. Under the Labor Government it was 25 per cent is concerned. of average weekly earnings.",364
216,Mr LLOYD,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,It never got to 25 per cent.,365
217,Dr KLUGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,I beg your pardon?,365
218,Mr LLOYD,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,We got to a higher percentage than to do today has you ever got to.,365
219,Dr KLUGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The Government may well have got to it, but the pension is now down to 22.8 per cent. I am not suggesting that this Government is not on the way down; I think it is. The unemployment benefit for a single person is now down to 22.1 per cent. In the case of those the age of 18, the amount is much less than a that. It has been kept at $36 a week ever since It is 1975. In March this year there were 261,510 unemployed people without dependants. benefit is being held down, not increased. 77.7 per cent of all the unemployed on whom the Government is spending we money. It is spending no extra money on them. very There are 58,200 unemployed people who have been on the benefit for one year or longer. We do not know their ages, but those people-ove r of them-hav e not been able to get a job Tofor over a year. Of all unemployment beneficiaries, 96.9 per cent-nearl y 97 per centhad no regular income other than the unemployment benefit. Over 57 per cent of the unemployed over 45 years of age have been on the and benefit for six months or longer. I feel very strongly-I have made this point in the House before-that whilst we pay a lot of lip service, and maybe more than lip service, to the young who are unemployed, and whilst it is extremely unpleasant to be young and unemployed, it is worse to be old and unemployed or middle aged and unemployed. Some people may argue about this. I suppose it is a question of tudes. I think it must be very unpleasant for a person who is 16 or 18 years of age and has left school to be unemployed, and obviously we do not want that person to be unemployed, but at least that person has a whole life in front of him or her and has a good chance of picking up a job sooner or later. A person who is in his, or very often her, 40s, who is 45 or 50 years of age, and who has been unemployed for three or six months and does not see the possibility of a job coming up, who has lots of responsibility and a family to look after and so on would become really desperate. This Government and people connected with social security and employment creation schemes are continuously talking about getting jobs for the young unemployed. I think it is more important to get jobs for the old unemployed or the middle aged unemployed. If all we are doing is putting young people into jobs and displacing older people from those jobs, we are not doing something for the benefit of society. I do not think we are doing the right thing as far as people who most need benefits are concerned. I do not support the proposition that the employment benefit for those under 18 years of age should have been held at $36 but, after all, they turn 18 reasonably soon. They then go a higher rate of unemployment benefit. I find amount. very depressing the thought that persons are missing out on a job for thefirstsix months or the first year of what would have been their life. I would not like to be one of them and I would not like one of my children to be one of them. I do think that it is they are still living with their families, to a large extent, than it is for those who are already responsible and who must feel terribly depressed when they have that responsibility to their family and are not able to get a job. It struck me as an anomaly, as I was listening to the Minister talking about the expansion of the Budget and the Social Welfare Policy Secand retariat, that we have an increase in the Budget of 33 per cent. That is a 33 per cent increase in the budget of the Social Welfare Policy Secannounced retariat. It may very well be justified. It probably is. The Minister then went on to talk about cations to national social welfare co-ordinating organisations such as the Australian Council Social Service, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled and the Australian Council on the Ageing. The amount of money going to those organisations has been increased by only 6V4 per cent. I think it is wrong. They are voluntary organisations run by people, to a large extent, who are doing this part time and who atti- need the money, not so much for themselves for salaries but to keep the organisations going. They do quite a significant amount of good work in the community, whether it is ACOSS, the Council for Rehabilitation or the Council on the Ageing. Their actual amount in real terms has been reduced because it has been increased from $150,000 to only $160,000 a year. Yet the amount of money going to the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat, a part of the Government's bureaucracy, has been increased by 33 per cent at the same time. I commend the changes, as far as they go, that have been announced tonight as far as the social welfare policies are concerned. We have had the benefit of the speech for only about an hour or an hour and a half. Obviously one has to go into greater detail to make more detailed comments on it. There will undoubtedly be legislation introduced dealing with some of the changes that are proposed. We will then have a further opportunity to debate these changes and possibly make further comments on them. I summarise again my point. This is a high taxation Governunment. Taxation rates are being increased. Income tax is being increased this year by 18.2 per cent and yet expenditure on very important benefits is on to not being increased by anything like that SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND working CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1979 Bill presented by Mr MACKellar, and read a easier for them when first time. Second Reading",365
220,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Warringah-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (10.9)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions Classifications) Act to provide certain new exemptions that are included in the Budget proposals and to give effect to the sales tax measures in the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of 27 June detailing the alloGovernment's energy policy. The new exemptions relate to goods for use by blind or deaf perof sons, to antiques and to player piano rolls. The sales tax law now provides exemption for specified types of goods used by blind or deaf persons. However, technological advances often bring forth new aids and appliances for the blind and deaf. Because of the specific terms of the present exemption, these new devices are, in the main, taxable at 15 per cent. The amendment now proposed will provide an exemption of a general nature for goods designed and manufactured expressly for use by blind persons or deaf persons and which are not of a kind ordinarily used by persons who do not suffer from these disabilities. New devices in this category will in future automatically qualify for exemption without the need for legislative amendments. Exemption is also being provided for imported antiques, that is, goods which are more than 100 years old. Australian antiques are not subject to sales tax and imported works of art are generally exempt also. The new exemption for other imported antiques puts them on an equal footing with Australian antiques and imported works of art. A further exemption in the Bill will apply to player piano rolls, which are now taxable at 15 per cent. These are currently manufactured by only a few companies in the world, one of which is in Australia. This company undertakes valuacentrators ble work in preserving the works and playing styles of many great pianists. This new exemppools tion will assist this highly specialised activity .The exemptions for goods for use by blind or deaf persons and for imported antiques and player piano rolls will apply from tomorrow, 22 August 1979. Turning to the exemptions relating to the adjourned. Government's energy policy, these sales tax measures are aimed at assisting the fulfilment of the objective of encouraging conservation of scarce sources of energy-in particular, liquid fuels other than liquefied petroleum gas-and promoting the use of alternative energy such as natural gas, LPG, coal-based electricity and solar energy. The provisions in the which will give effect to that policy in the sales tax area will exempt goods for use in sion of internal combustion engines to liquefied petroleum gas or natural gas operation, non-oil burning domestic space heating appliances and various solar energy appliances. These exemptions are to have effect on and from 28 June 1979, the day after the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). As compressed natural gas is emerging as an alternative motor vehicle fuel, it is proposed tion for engine conversion kits apply to goods for use in conversions to natural gas as well as conversions to LPG. It will also apply for use in converting marine engines or stationary engines to LPG or CNG operation. Domestic space heating appliances of the built-in type are largely exempt from sales tax under the existing law. Portable domestic heating appliances are taxable at 2.5 per cent. The exemption for non-oil burning domestic space heating appliances will apply mainly to portable domestic space heaters, other than kerosene heaters. It will not apply to household air conditioners. These and household kerosene heaters will remain taxable at 2.5 per cent. Solar energy is rapidly becoming an alternative energy source, particularly for water heating systems. Household water heating and hot water systems of the fixture type, including solar water heaters, are already exempt from sales tax. The new exemption for solar energy equipment will apply to devices such as solar collectors, absorbers and concentrators which are essential to the effective use of the sun as a source of heat energy, and to photovoltaic cells which convert solar energy to electricity. Thus solar collectors, absorbers and conwhich are for use in industrial installations or in heating water for swimming will be covered by the exemption. The provisions of the Bill are explained in more detail in an explanatory memorandum which is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

(d) Family Court of AustraliaThere are 38 Judges of the Family Court of Australia of whom 13 (including the Chief Judge) are in New South Wales, 10 in Victoria, 6 in Queensland, 5 in South Australia and 2 each in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. There are no Family Court Judges resident in the Northern Territory and none in Western Australia, which has its own Family Court. Information sought by the honourable member concerning the number of days on which each Judge of the Family Court of Australia sat is not readily available. A full reply would require an examination to be made of the records of each registry of the Court for view of the work that would be involved and the commitments of officers engaged in the business of the Courts, which is heavily pressed, I do not consider it justifiable at this point of time to detach officers from their normal duties for this purpose. The Chief Judge has, however, recently had compiled information relating to the period 1 February-31 May 1979 inclusive from which it would appear that each Judge would, on the average, sit on 197.5 days in a year. That figure would include Full Court sittings and single Judge sittings. Mass Media Communication: Research",368
223,Mr LES JOHNSON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 20 February 1979: What research programs into the effects of mass media communication on Australian society (a) have been funded by the Australian Government during the periods (i) 1975-76, (ii) 1976-77, (iii) 1977-78 and (iv) 1 July 1978 to date, and (b) are currently under consideration for funding.",369
224,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) My Department has not funded any research programs into the effects of mass media communication on Australian society during the periods mentioned. It has, however, commissioned the following surveys: Ethnic Radio Stations 2EA and 3EA. Survey of Greek, Italian and Turkish Communities, Sydney and Melcent bourne. MCNair Surveys Pty Ltd, August 1975. Penetration of FM Radio Receivers, Postal and Telecommunications Department, May 1978. Penetration of Television Sets with Built-in bility, May 1978. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board (ABCB) and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) has carried following research since 1975: NA 1975-76-'Attitudes to Television' 1976 1977 Field Survey in Melbourne, covering the topics of satisfaction with television control of broadcasting 154 and other specific areas. 68 147 'Attitudes to Advertising on the ABC' 41 81 (now Telephone Survey of Vie wers' Panel. deceased) (The Viewers' Panel is a group of persons recruited 4 during field surveys, who are available to give their 7 7 opinions on broadcasting). 9 15 ABT 1976-77-'Television and the Public' Mail Survey of Viewers'Panel.

The report is near to publication. each of the years mentioned. In 1978-79-'Expectation s of Broadcasting in the Rural Community'. Three surveys in rural areas aimed at investigating the extent of satisfaction with broadcasting. The first stage in Ayr, North Queensland has been conducted. The other two (in Leeton, NSW and the Pilbara, WA) have been postponed due to financial considerations. No research by other organisations has been funded during this period by either the ABCB or the ABT. Quarantine: Exotic Pests Programs (Question No. 3228) (Question No. 3208) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Health, for Post upon notice, on 21 February 1979: Further to his answer to question No. 1214 part (4) (Hansard, 12 September 1978, page 887), what was the result of his Department's investigation.",369
225,Mr HUNT,ABCB,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The investigation is still continuing and is not expected to be concluded for some time yet. Yeelirrie Uranium Deposit (Question No. 3249) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22Feburary 1979: Has the Government approved Esso's purchase of 15 per interest in the Yeelirrie uranium deposit from Western Mining Corporation; if so, why.",369
226,Mr HOWARD,ABCB,"The answer to the honourable UHF Capamember's question is as follows: (1) Yes. As outlined in my statement of 10 June 1979, the Government has given foreign investment approval to the the joint venture arrangements for the development of the Yeelirrie uranium project by Western Mining Corporation Ltd, Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc and Urangesellschaft Australia Pty Ltd. (2) In reaching its decision to allow Esso to take up an equity interest in the project, the Government had regard to the substantial marketing, technological ance which the company would bring to the project. The Government was also satisfied that alternative Australian capital was not available. Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 28 February 1979: (1) Is it a fact as reported in the ACT Legislative Assembly Hansard, 19 February 1979, page 120, that (a) the amount of methadone prescribed in the ACT has increased from 24,300 mg during the 4 weeks ending 8 October 1977 to 134,200 mg for the 4 weeks ending 7 October 1978 and (b) this has been a steady, steep and almost linear increase. (2) If so, what is the explanation for this increase.",369
227,Mr HUNT,ABCB,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) Thefiguresquoted by the honourable member are the amounts of methadone supplied at the coincide. wholesale level to hospitals and pharmacies in the ACT ing the two four-weekly periods mentioned. However, lowing the introduction of the Poisons and Narcotic Drugs Ordinance 1978 (with effect from 29 December 1978) which AREA-SERVICES provides the Capital Territory Health Commission with powers to strictly control the and administration of addictive drugs, the supply of methadone at the wholesale level in the ACT has drastically reduced. As an indication, for the four-week period ended 24 February 1979 the total amount of methadone made availMetropolitan local service area able at a wholesale level in the ACT was 6,000 mgs. This compares with thefigureof 134,200 mgs for the four-week period ended 7 October 1978. (2) Until the introduction of the Poisons and Narcotic Drugs Ordinance, detailed records of the purpose for which methadone was prescribed in the ACT were not kept by the Perth Capital Territory Health Commission. However, the ComHobart mission's view is that the high level of demand was the result of an increase in methadone prescriptions for the treatment of heroin addiction. Since the introduction of the Poisons and Narcotic Drugs Ordinance, the Commission has records of long-term prescription of methadone. These records show that the bulk of methadone prescribed is for the treatment of disabling pain associated with malignant neoplasia or self-limiting disorders of short duration not responding to non-narcotic analgesics. Telephone Subscribers Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 1 March 1979: (1) Which cities are regarded as metropolitan for telephone purposes.

Methadone (3) What proportion of this revenue was derived from (a) (Question No. 3275) business subscribers and (b) domestic subscribers. (6) What was the average duration of calls referred to in pan (4). (7) During 1976-77, what proportion of trunk/STD and local calls (a) to and (b) from the provincial centres referred to in pan (3) were within 100 km. (8) How are the charge fee distances listed by Telecom established and do they relate to the nearest boundary of the directory area or local call zone from exchange to exchange.",370

Specific authority would also be required for (Question No. 3389) payments for any imports involved in compensatory trade, where payment is to be made more than one month before expected date of arrival of the imports, upon earlier shipment, or more than six months after arrival of the imports. The Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations do not prescribe the arrangements acceptable for barter or compensatory payments. Exchange control policy is that each application for compensatory payment is considered on its merits; as regards prices, it would be expected that normal commercial criteria would apply to both sides of the transaction; and the value of exports would need to be consistent with the definition of 'export value' as set out in regulation 15 of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations'.

regard to the distribution tributors of the Australian Public Service Superannuation Fund following the changeover to the new fund on 1 July 1976, is it a fact that the basic contributions allocated to tributors was less than actual contributions paid by them into the Fund; if so, why. (2) How was the surplus, which would have accrued from interest earnings on contributors' funds, dealt with to ensure that all contributions received equitable treatment. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the majority of cases, butions allocated to contributors to the old pension scheme in the allocation of the old Superannuation Fund as at 30 June 1976 were less than the contributions actually paid by those contributors. In other cases, including contributors to the old Provident Account, basic contributions exceeded the contributions paid. In no case, however, was the total allocation to a former pension scheme and supplementary contributions combined, less than the contributions paid, this being a condition of the arrangements approved by the Government. The predominant reason for basic contributions of pension scheme contributors being, in the majority of cases, less than contributions paid is to be found in the insurance basis of the old pension scheme. Under that scheme, substantial benefits were available to a contributor on his invalidity retirement or to his widow and children on his death whilst a contributor. The cost of these benefits was met partly by the Government and partly from the Superannuation Fund. Generally, a contributor at the time of his premature retirement or death would not have paid enough, even after allowing for earnings on his contributions, to meet the expected cost of that part of the future pension benefits payable from the Superannuation Fund; the shortfall, which was considerable when the retiring or deceased contributor was young, was shared amongst the remaining contributors.

For each of the four years in the period 1 July 1972 to 30 June 1976 the average actuarial reserve in the Fund for a contributor was calculated. The surplus interest earned in each of those years was allocated in proportion to the average actuarial reserve for the year for each contributor, this approach being designed to achieve equitable treatment for all contributors. the amounts of basic contriMigrant Selection System (Question No. 3438)",375
233,Mr LES JOHNSON,USSR,"the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: contributor, that is basic (1) Are all applicants for migrant entry to Australia under the Government's new migrant selection system (NUMAS) interviewed before a determination as to their suitability is made. (2) If not, (a) how many applicants from (i) Greece, (ii) Turkey, (iii) the United Kingdom, (iv) the United States of America, (v) Lebanon, (vi) India (vii) Pakistan, (viii) France, (ix) Italy, (x) Ireland, (xi) South Africa, (xii) Chile, (xiii) Israel, (xiv) Cyprus, (xv) Malta, (xvi) Mauritius, (xvii) Indonesia, (xviii) the Philippines, (xix) Fiji and (xx) Rhodesia have been determined as unsuitable without a personal interview since the system was introduced and (b); what percentage of all migrant applications received from those countries were rejected (i) without interview and (ii) after an interview. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Under Australia's migrant screening procedures, all applications are assessed to ascenain whether applications meet basic eligibility criteria for immigration. The application forms of persons meeting the basic eligibility requirements are then assessed view persons who would be unable to meet NUMAS requirements regardless of their assessment on other factors; this is intended to avoid unnecessary interviews and giving false hope to persons who would clearly not meet interview requirements. This pre-interview screening is based largely on the NUMAS factors, occupational skills, occupational demand, pre-arranged employment, age and transferable assets for resettlement, which can be assessed from information given on application forms. Criteria remain uniform throughout the world. However, differences in systems and standards necessitate variations in the sequence in which the various screening measures are undertaken. For example, in countries where documentary evidence of trade training is difficult to obtain and authenticate, assessment of qualifications would be left to a late stage of the procedures after applicants had met other requirements; in countries where documentation was readily available, this would be assessed at an early stage. Therefore, rejections on the basis of nonrecognition of qualifications might occur pre-interview in some posts and post-interview in others. For this reason, comparative statistics on rejection rates are not available. Mr Willis asked the Minister for Trade and tinued Resources, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: (1) What preparations are being made by his Depanment for UNCTAD 5. (2) Will the Government offer opportunities for public consultation over the issues to be debated at UNCTAD S.",383
234,Mr ANTHONY,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Work in preparation for UNCTAD 3 was carried out in my own and other relevant Departments following the official announcement that UNCTAD 3 was to be held in Manila in May 1979. This work included Australian representation at relevant international meetings and, in particular, at a Special Session of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board which was convened to consider the UNCTAD 5 Agenda. (2) No special arrangements were made for public consultation but the Department of Trade and Resources at the request of interested organisations and individuals provided information on the Conference and also attended seminars. Marine Science Research Mr Morris asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: What action has the Minister taken to implement the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in its report on Oil Spills that the then Minister for Science review priorities to determine the need for increased allocation of resources to marine science research. Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to the Prime Minister's answer to Question No. 3434 in the House of Representatives on 1 May 1979 (Hansard, 1 May 1979, page 1714). Uranium: Effects on Health to avoid calling to inter(Question No. 3501) Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 22 March 1979: Has the Australian Atomic Energy Commission or any other Federal agency established a transuranium register of persons who have come into contact with uranium or its radio-active products so that the long term effects on health can be monitored: if not, why not.",384
235,Mr HUNT,USSR,"The answer to the honourable from country to country member's question is as follows: No. A transuranium register would include persons coming in contact with uranium. In view of the limited work done in Australia with plutonium, the Government does not see the need to establish a transuranic register. Such work as is done, is mostly undertaken by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission which keeps comprehensive records of all employees who may be exposed to radiation or radioactive contamination. The Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores, 1975, prepared by my Department is at present being adopted for inclusion in UNCTAD 5 the Environmental Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 (Question No. 3441) which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Science and the Environment. The Code recommends conhealth surveillance including pre-employment, continuing and post-employment medical examinations. Section 5.9.2 provides that on termination of employment all medical records of an employee shall be transferred to the central health authority and kept for 50 years. Discussions on all aspects of the Code are at present being held with the States. To extend this type of recording to such other areas as agricultural and industrial applications of radioactive materials. laboratories and educational institutions using radioactive materials. hospitals and clinics, involved in nuclear medicine (including both staff and patients). Commonwealth and State Government departments and establishments involved in nuclear activities such as the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australian Radiation Laboratory, and State Health Departments. several would be a massive undertaking. The Australian Radiation Laboratory has provided for many years a film badge service for all users of radioactive materials so that effective controls can be maintained. (Question No. 3462) Cigarette Advertising on Television (Question No. 3527) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 27 March 1979: (1) Is it a fact that bans on cigarette advertising on television are being flouted constantly, for example by lengthy exposure of cigarette posters (Winfield) at telecasts of sporting events. (2) If so, what action has he taken or does he propose to take to control extra-legal television advertising. (3) Will he consider giving a directive that, for example, where 5 minutes in a spotting telecast are devoted to exposure of cigarette advertisements equal time should be given to anti-smoking advertisements.",384
236,Mr STALEY,USSR,"The answer to the honourable pheric member's question is as follows: (1) The exposure of posters and other advertising matter in the background during sporting telecast specifically in Section 100(10) of the Broadcasting and Television Act. (2) In view of Section 100 (10), the question of extra-legal advertising does not arise. (3) The exposure of anti-smoking advertising matter in terms of Section 100 (10) of the Act would be a matter tween the anti-smoking group concerned in the events being telecast.

(2) What is (a) the average income of full-time doctors, (b) their median income and (c) their range of income. (3) What steps are being taken to study this issue as recommended in the report. (Question No. 3629) (4) What means of limiting the growth of medical incomes to more equitable rates are under consideration.",389
239,Mr HUNT,BP AUSTRALIA LIMITED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I understand that the major factor underlying the Committee's conclusions was the introduction of universal health insurance in 1975 by the Labor Government at that time. This introduced increased payments to medical practitioners for services to eligible pensioners and provided a common benefit to all patients who incurred medical expenses without the effective involvement of patients in the major portion of the cost of medical services and without an effective means of monitoring excessive services by the Government of the day. The Medibank Mark I Scheme also for payments to medical practitioners in some States for services previously rendered in public hospitals in an honorary capacity. These features meant that medical practitioners were able to obtain additional income for a smaller relative increase in workload and were generally free to provide any service to irrespective of cost in the knowledge that they would 3XY Melobtain payment for those services. The Committee also had regard to movements in Medical Schedule fees which increased by about 90 per cent 1972 and January 1976. Increases since 1978 were about 16 percent. These in Average Weekly Earnings and the Consumer Price Index of about 67 per cent and 50 per cent respectively over the period December 1972 to 1976, and about 24 per cent and 25 per cent respectively over the period January 1976 to January 1978. (2) (a) (b) and (c) The data available to my Department does not provide precise information on the incomes tors in full-time private practice. ablerelatesto Taxation Statistics which include income all sources. In thisregard,Ireferthe honourable the Supplement to the Fifty-sixth Report to Parliament of the Commissioner of Taxation-'Taxatio n Statistics 1976-77', particularly pages 30 and 31. (3) As mentioned above, data on doctors' incomes are very limited and my Department does not have sufficient data to enable a full study of this issue to be carried out this stage. Statistics on the other limited statistics are currently being examined by my Department with the view to obtaining more data on docincluded tors'income levels. (4) The Government does not have the constitutional authority to control prices, and ever, the influence exerted by the Government in this area relates to the fixing of the level of Schedule fees on benefits for services rendered by medical practitioners based. Generally, proposals by the AMA on changes to the level of Medical Benefits Schedule fees are referred to an dent Enquiry, to which the AMA and the Government make submissions. The Enquiries are required to haveregardto, amongst other matters, economic circumstances affecting medical practitioners and the community generally. In 1976, the AMA proposed an overall 7.5 per cent increase in doctors' fees from 1 January 1977. This was substantially lower than the increase of 14 per cent indicated by the Australian Medical Association's creases necessary to meet higher net income of medical practices. This increase of 7.5 per was introduced from 1 January 1977 on the basis of agreemonwealth ment that there would be a detailed Enquiry in 1977 on fees to apply from 1 January 1978. At the 1977 Enquiry under the honourable Mr Justice J. T. Ludeke, the Government proposed increases less than those sought by the AMA, and opposed some 'catch-up' elements in the AMA's proposal. Again, the increase was much less than might have been expected on the basis of movements Average Weekly Earnings and other economic indicators. In 1978, the AMA offered to defer adjustments to fees from 1 January 1979 until 1 November dition that an independent enquiry was established early in 1979 to determine adjustments to fees effective from 1 November 1979. The Government agreed to this proposal and announced on 1 March 1979 the establishment 1979 Medical Fees Enquiry under Mr Justice Ludeke. The Government has submitted to this Enquiry a policy of rematters straint consistent with its overall economic policy in relation to prices, wages and incomes. As well, the Government has taken action to stop the vision of unnecessary medical services and the making fraudulent claims. Departmental medical officers counsel doctors when indicated regarding their billing and practice make patterns. In addition the AMA has a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry in each State to publiclyBanking which 17 doctors have been referred to counselling. Tasmanian Tourist Industry",389

Costs associated with other surveys were absorbed by the Department. The Department does undertake numerous surveys relating to traffic matters. These surveys mainly relate to the counting of moving or parked vehicles at various locations. It is not possible to enumerate these surveys because they are such an integral part of the Transport and Housing Division's work. Although it is not regarded as a survey in the normal sense of the word, arrangements were made in 1978 to distribute to each household in Canberra a Ministerial statement 'Proposed Constitutional Development in the Australian Capital Territory' to ensure a widespread public knowledge and of the proposals and to invite comment on them. The cost of printing and delivery of the statement was $6,800. Storage of Radioactive Waste (Question No. 3782)",392
251,Mr LES JOHNSON,BP AUSTRALIA LIMITED,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: (1) How much radioactive waste is in temporary storage in places other than those under the exclusive control and responsibility of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. (2) Where, what and how is it stored, and what quantity is involved. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In addition to radioactive waste materials held by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) there are small amounts of medium and low level radioactive wastes held by hospitals, research institutions, government departments and industry. Most of these wastes are subject to State regulation. Since October 1978 the Australian Radiation Laboratory and the AAEC have been compiling a comprehensive inventory of such materials to enable consideration of what action, if any, might be taken in relation to future management and disposal. Relationship between Retirement and Death (Question No. 3787) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: (1) What work has been done in Australia to establish the statistical relationship betweenretirementand death. (2) In the period since 1945, has there been an increase or decrease in the average time between retirement and death $ (for example does a man or woman who retires at 55 or 60 enjoy a longer period of retirement than a man or woman 46,500 who retires at 65). 38,500 (3) What would be the anticipated effects on longevity if 38,500 earlier retirement became the norm. 123,500",393
252,Mr HUNT,BP AUSTRALIA LIMITED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No studies of this subject appear to have been published in Australia. (2) Since 1945 survival in the retirement age groups has improved considerably for females, and to a lesser extent for males. Both males and females retiring today thus have longer expectation of life than did those retiring at the same age in 1945. In groups where retirement now is earlier than it was in 1945, the averagetimebetween retirement and death will have also been increased on this account. (3) To determine whether early retirement affects longevity it would be necessary to compare survival from say age 60 in a group who continued to work after that age with survival from age 60 in a group of similar health at that age and who elected to retire then. No such study appears to have been carried out anywhere. Trading Bank Term and Development Loans Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice, 2 May 1979: (I) Will he provide statistics on trading bank term and development loan approvals before and since the establishment of the Primary Industry Bank to reassure many country people that these banks have not reduced their lending for primary producers. (2) Have any of these trading banks responded to the need for longer ced by the demand for PIB loans, by themselves providing some loans of longer than 10 years duration; if so, which banks.",393
253,Mr HOWARD,BP AUSTRALIA LIMITED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Primary Industry Bank of Australia commenced refinancing operations in November 1978. The table below sets out term loan and farm development loan approvals by the major trading banks since October 1978. The statistics of term loan approvals include loans refinanced by the Primary Industry Bank of Australia as well as other term loans, both rural and non-rural. The growth in term loan approvals is not all attributable to the Primary Industiy Bank: other term lending to the rural sector has also risen. The statistics of farm development loan approvals show that they also have risen since the establishment of the Primary Industry Bank. Weekly average for period ending second Wednesday of approvals 19781979April I will send to the honourable member more detailed inforders, the ultimate mation on rural lending by the major trading banks in recent suitability months when it becomes available.

Incineration of Intractable Wastes Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: (1) Is the special Dutch or visiting Australia later this year; if so, for what purpose. (2) Can the Minister say who own this ship. (3) Can the Minister also say if this is the ship which was successfully used to incinerate large quantities of agent orange, the low grade 245T, used as a defoliant in Vietnam. (4) Will the Minister arrange for the ship to give practical demonstrations of high temperature incineration of intractable wastes, so that the recent attempt to establish a dump for such wastes at Dargile in northern Victoria, need not be repeated anywhere else in Victoria or Australia. (Question No. 3790) Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the on Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Private industry is negotiating for the ship m/t Vulcanus to visit Australia and present indications are that it could not be here before June 1980. The intention is that it will collect accumulated waste chlorinated hydrocarbon liquids for incineration at sea. term rural loans, as eviden(2) Ocean Combustion Service BV-Rotterdam . (3) The vessel was used to incinerate 10,400 tonnes of Herbicide Orange in the Pacific Ocean, July to August 1977. The incineration was performed under US. Environmental Protection Agency Special Permit No. 770DHO01S. The ship has operated as an incineration vessel since 1972 and has successfully disposed of 250,000 tonnes of liquid wastes mainly in Europe. (4) It would not be possible to arrange a demonstration of high temperature incineration in Australian waters prior to the actual charter because of the shipping company's commitments in Europe. However its performance, particularly in the United States, has been well documented by the Environmental Protection Agency. It must be realised that Vulcanus is not an all purpose disposal vessel being restricted to the incineration of liquid materials. The types of liquids accepted for incineration on the m/t Vulcanus is governed by their range of calorific values and this range is as specified by Farm the owners of the vessel. Term Development Loan Loan Liquefied Petroleum Gas Cylinders approvals (Question No. 3798) $m $m Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: 8.2 4.6 8.3 4.4 (1) What percentage of liquefied petroleum gas cylinders 12.3 5.4 suitable for automotive use is imported. (2) What is the tariff on these cylinders. 14.1 4.4 17.7 5.1 Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable 21.2 5.6 member's question is as follows: 19.4 8.0 (1) The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not compile information on the Australian production of LP gas cylinfor particular usage of imported gas cylinders or their applications.

Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 3 May 1979: Has his attention been drawn to figures which show relative amounts of leave taken by males and females including sick, compensation, maternity, paternity and/or compassionate leave; if so, where may these figures be obtained; if not, what steps have been taken to obtain them. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The principal and most recent source for information on absences from work of males and females for sickness and injury in Australia is a publication of the Australian Bureau of Statistics entitled Australian Health Survey 1977-78 (Catalogue No. 4311.0). (2) Additional information on absences from work due to sickness or injury is contained cation of the Department of Productivity entitled 'Work and People' and its forerunner the Personnel Practice Bulletin. I would refer the honourable member particularly to the following issues: 'Work and People', Winter 1977, volume 3 No. 2; 'Work and People', Autumn 1976 volume 2 No. 1; 'Work and People', Spring 1975 volume 1 No. 3; 'Personnel Practice Bulletin' volume 30 No. 4, December 1974; 'Personnel Practice Bulletin' volume 30 No. 1, March 1974. (3) Regarding the collection of information specifically pertaining to workers' compensation matters, I would refer the honourable member to the comprehensive answer given by my colleague the Minister for Productivity to Question No. 638, Hansard, 6 April 1978, page 1201. (4) With respect to the taking of maternity and paternity leave I wish to advise that I am not aware of national figures having been taken out on these particular types of leave. However, I am able to advise the honourable member that statistical information on the taking and duration of maternity leave and the taking of paternity leave by employees in Commonwealth Government Departments for each financial year since 1973-74, is maintained by the Australian Public Service Board. In this connection I should point out that an answer to Question No. 3964 of 22 May 1979, which covers matters which are the subject of the honourable member's question, is presently in preparation. (5) 1 will provide the honourable member with copies of the publications referred to in (1) and (2) above. Great Barrier Reef: Oil Drilling Mr Cohen asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 9 May 1979: What portions of the oil drilling leases Q/4P and Q/5P lie within the proposed Capricornia Section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. NA percent percent percent percent per cent . . . . 26 19 15 F* F* 10 F* F* F* F* 30 22.5 15 F* F* Leave Statistics Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable (Question No. 3834) member's question is as follows: Portions of the two petroleum exploration permits, in the south-western part of Q/4P and in the southern part of Q/5P, lie within the proposed Capricornia Section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Grants to Voluntary Conservation Organisations (Question No. 3892) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 9 May 1979: (1) Has the Commonwealth grant to the Wide Bay Burnett Conservation Council been reduced from $5,000 to $2,850 for the current year. (2) Have other grants to voluntary conservation organisations fallen by a similar percentage for the current year. in various issues of a publi(3) Is it a fact that the Wide Bay Burnett Conservation Council has been singled out for this reduction in grant because of the Council's involvement with the Fraser Island sand mining issue. (4) Will the Minister consider the abolition of the dollar for dollar condition placed on voluntary conservation groups in order to qualify for a Commonwealth grant. Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) No. Grants in the current year have varied by a range of percentages. Nine had slight increases, thirteen were reduced and two were unchanged. (3) No. (4) It is the Government's view that voluntary bodies should become less reliant on Government funding and that they should develop a broad base of support from the community. It is for this reason that the matching scheme of contributions was introduced several years ago and is, of course, quite appropriate at atimewhen the Government is exercisingrestrainton public expenditure. Nationality and Employment in the Public Service (Question No. 3906) Dr Cass asked the Minister Assisting the (Question No. 3890) Prime Minister, upon notice, on 9 May 1979: (1) How many permanent officers in the (a) 2nd, (b) 3rd and (c) 4th division of the Australian Public Service were born outside Australia.

(6) Are there any cases in which residents of this country were refused employment in the Public Service because the persons were not British subjects; if so, how many. (7) What are the nations classified as British under paragraph 34 (a) of the Act. (8) How many British subjects who are not Australian citizens are employed by the Public Service. (9) Does paragraph 34(a) discriminate against Australian residents who are citizens of non-British Commonwealth countries. (10) Did the Royal Commission make any recommendations on nationality and employment in the Public Service; if so, what were those recommendations and when will they be implemented.",394
254,Mr VINER,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2) and (3) The Public Service Board does not record information regarding the place of birth of staff of the Australian Public Service. The practice of recording such information was discontinued in August 1974 in line with a general approach not to seek from applicants data that is unnecessary and could be regarded as discriminatory. (4) and (S) Recommendations 117 to 119 of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration regarding the nationality requirement for permanent appointment to the Australian Public Service are currently under consideration. Options such as that recommended by RCAGA, or a general requirement for Australian citizenship, are being evaluated. (6) Applicants for temporary employment in the Australian Public Service are not required to satisfy any requirements with regard to nationality. No information is recorded in respect of the number of applicants for permanent appointment to the Australian Public Service who were ineligible on nationality grounds. (7) The following nations are classified as Commonwealth countries for the purposes of section 34 (a) of the Public Service Act: Commonwealth of the Bahamas, People's Republic of Bangladesh, Barbados, Republic of Botswana, Canada, Republic of Cyprus, Fiji, the Gambia, Republic of Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, Republic of India, Jamaica, Republic of Kenya, Kingdom of Lesotho, Republic of Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Republic of Nauru, New Zealand, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Independent State of Papua New Guinea, Republic of Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Republic of Singapore, Republic of Sri Lanka, Kingdom of Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, Kingdom of Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, United Kingdom and Colonies, Independent State of Western Samoa, Republic of Zambia. (Listing derived from s. 7(2) of the Australian Citizenship Act.) (8) See answers to (1) to (3) above. (9) Yes, in so much as those residents are not eligible for permanent appointment to the Australian Public Service. I am advised that Section 34 (a) of the Public Service Act is not in contravention of the Racial Discrimination Act nor of relevant international conventions. (10) See answer to (4) above. Advertising of Drugs (Question No. 3910) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 9 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to areporton page 13 of the Auslralian of 8 May 1979 that chewing tobacco and snuff are being actively promoted in the United States of America and while cigarette consumption rose only 3.9 per cent in that country in 1977 non-smoking tobacco products increased retail sales about 30 per cent. (2) Has he evidence that snuff and chewing tobacco are a health hazard comparable to cigarettes. (3) Will he take steps to get a commitment from the States and initiate laws for the Australian Capital Territory to forbid advertising of drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, beyond balanced, factual information approved by health authorities and devoid of favourable image-building or balanced by equal promotion against the drug concerned by organisations promoting the contrary view and at the expense of the drug promoters; if not, why not.",396
255,Mr HUNT,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I am not aware of such evidence at present. (3) The question of controls on advertising of alcohol and tobacco is primarily a matter for consideration by the State Governments. Except for the A.C.T. the Commonwealth's power to legislate to control the advertising of alcohol and tobacco is restricted to television and radio. Advertising of cigarettes and cigarette tobacco on television and radio has been prohibited since I September 1976 under the Broadcasting and Television Act. Codes of advertising practice for alcohol and cigarettes do exist and are the subject of continuing review by the Commonwealth. I would emphasise, however, that the way is open to the States at present to introduce controls on advertising of alcohol and tobacco, including legislative controls, if they so desire. The regulation of advertising of goods for therapeutic use (drugs) is divided constitutionally between the States and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has responsibility for control of advertising of imported drugs (usually restricted to prescription only) and the advertising of over the counter (O.T.C.) drugs in the radio and television media. Advertising of other categories, such as drugs not imported but manufactured in Australia, and advertising in print media are theresponsibilityof the State in which the advertisement appears. Some time ago the National Therapeutic Goods Committee, which is a body comprising representatives from all State health authorities and the Commonwealth, drafted a set of guidelines for the regulation of advertising and promotion of both prescription drugs and O.T.C. preparations. This was in two Parts, A and B, referring to the two respectively. Pan A (referring to ethical drugs) was not proceeded with and la,, .ed, but Pan B dealing with O.T.C. preparations became the basis for the current 'Voluntary Code for the Advertising of Goods for Therapeutic Use'. This Code has been adopted by the Australian Media Council in approval of advertisements for goods for therapeutic use in print media and is a basis for approval of radio and television advertising. The introduction of this Code has resulted in a degree of uniformity in advertising over various media, previously unobtainable. For the information of honourable members, I have lodged with the Parliamentary Library copies of the document 'Proposed Requirements for the Advertising of Therapeutic Goods Recommended by the National Therapeutic Goods Committee, and which the Australian Health Ministers at their August 1974 Conference agreed to take back to their respective Governments' and of the 'Voluntary Code for the Advertising of Goods for Therapeutic Use (Proprietary Medicines and Therapeutic Appliances)'. Telephone Services: Hastings, Victoria Mr Holding asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 9 May Lakes 1979: (1) What arrangements are being made for additional telephone connections at Hastings, Victoria, telephone exchange. (2) Is it a fact that only 200 new connections have made available in Hastings for the period February to August 1979 and will these be used immediately by the existand ing waiting list. (3) If so, when will more connections become available. (4) What is the current demand for new connections. (5) What is the anticipated demand for connections.",396
256,Mr STALEY,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable fungus member's question is as follows: (1) Additional equipment is currently being installed Hastings Exchange and will be available for new connecquality tions from July 1979. (2) The 200 lines being installed will satisfy all waiting and new applicants until September 1979. (3) A further 200 lines will be available by September 1979. (4) Twenty per month. (5) The present level of demand will reduce once the majority of houses have telephones. Demand in 1979-80 is expected to be 280 but is likely to fall to subsequent years. A further 400 lines are planned to be available by July 1980 which will cater for demand until 1985. Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 9 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments made by Professor Noel Hynes (The Advertiser, 27 March 1979), a world authority on fresh-water biology, to the effect that Australia had neglected co-ordinated research on precious running water supplies. (2) If so, is it a fact as Murray River was once a major fishery but no one really knows why this has declined. (3) Will he (a) establish an such as the Great Lakes Laboratories in Ontario or the Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg and (b) study of the entire Murray, as suggested by Professor Hynes. (4) Is it a fact that stones in some parts of the Murray are covered with algae and fungus and that increases in algae growth can be expected in the future as organic materials, nitrates and phosphates are added to theriver;if so, will intelligent choices or trade-off alternatives in the use of the Murray become unnecessarily difficult without a good pool of knowledge on these matters, as stated by Professor Hynes. (5) Will he have a walking trail constructed along the length of the Murray River as suggested by another expen on the Murray, Dr P. S. Davis in his recent book Man ana ihe Murray. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The question should be directed to the relevant State (Question No. 3917) fisheries authorities. (3) The situation in Canada with regard to the Great is quite different in many respects to the River Murray both in terms of constitutional responsibilities and the magnitude and types of problems involved. From recent announcements I have made, the honourable member would be aware of action which the Government is taking in a coordinated effort with the three States concerned, to deal with salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley which been seriously threaten water quality in the Murray River. A major study is currently being undenaken by consultants it is expected that their final repon will be available shortly. (4) Except in relation to billabong reaches of the river which have been the subject of intensive limnological study for the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, I have not received any reports indicating that algae growth and are causing particular concern in other parts of the river. Following agreement reached between the four government parties to the River Murray Waters Agreement at in 1976, the River Murray Commission has instituted a water monitoring program including the measurement of nutrients which will provide basic data for proper management aimed at meeting water quality objectives in the River Murray. (5) The Commonwealth has no power to take such action. Defence: Exciter Controller (Question No. 3928) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Defence, 75 per annum in upon notice, on 10 May 1979: (1) Is the exciter controller being purchased under contract No. 24-5820/79/33 referred to on page 47 of the Commonwealth of Australia Gazelle of 8 May 1979 (G 18) Murray River to be used by personnel within his Depanment; if so, which (Question No. 3920) categories of officers will have access to the exciter controller and under what circumstances is it to be used. (2) What equipment previously provided the service being made available by the unit being purchased. (3) What is the country of manufacture. (4) Who were the unsuccessful tenderers. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: claimed by Professor Hynes that the (1) Yes. Engineers and Technical Officers (Engineering). The equipment performs the control function in one of two closed loop vibration analysis systems. institute for freshwater studies, (2) A different type of exciter controller now approaching initiate a major the end of its service life. (3) Denmark. (4) There were no unsuccessful tenderers. The contract was based on a restricted tender. Commonality was sought with existing satisfactory equipment forming pan of the second of the two systems, in order to reduce spares holdings, documentation and calibration requirements. Vietnamese Refugees Mr O'Keefe asked the Minister for Immilogical gration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 any May 1979: (1) How many Vietnamese have (a) arrived and (b) been allowed to remain in Australia to date. (2) Are many more arrivals expected. (3) What action is proposed in respect of funher arrivals from Vietnam. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourration able member's question is as follows: (1) It would appear that the honourable member is referconcerning ring to Vietnamese claiming to be refugees who have arrived without prior authority direct at Australian shores. (a) 2011 persons have arrived in this manner; (b) 1554 so far have been approved dent status. The others pending funher investigations of their applications for refugee status by the Determination of Refugee Status Committee. (2) This depends on a number of variables not the least of which is whether the outflow continues from Vietnam. (3) Decisions would be taken at the time of arrival on whether the people aboard should be allowed to land. Their circumstances would be carefully evaluated and they would be subject to the same stringent screening procedures and vestigations about their refugee status as earlier arrivals. Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) What priority has been given to the introduction biological control of the weed, Bathurst burr? (2) Does the CSIRO acknowledge that logical control of Bathurst burr are available overseas? (3) What resources would be necessary to implement these control measures as a matter of urgency? Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) Bathurst burr was one of the earliest candidates in Australia for biological control when CSIRO's the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, began biological control studies in the late 1920s. Attempts to establish an adequate degree of biological control over the Bathurst burr at that time failed. Later attempts in the mending mid-1960s also were unsuccessful. CSIRO gives high priority to the biological control of weeds and, in selecting candidate weeds, takes into account number of factors, one of which is the chance of success. While recognising that Bathurst weed, CSIRO has devoted the resources made available for biological control to a number of other weeds which provide greater prospects for biological control than Bathurst burr. Another important consideration is that Bathurst burr is closely related to some plants of economic value, such as sunflower. This makes the chances of finding suitable control organisms so much harder because organisms will not be introduced into this country unless they satisfy stringent re(Question No. 3933) quirements for specificity to the target weed. (2) CSIRO is closely in touch with developments in biocontrol of weeds in other countries, but is unaware of natural enemy of Bathurst burr discovered overseas likely to be both effective in adequately controlling the weed in Australia and safe torelease.CSIRO would be interested to have details of the claims for successful biological control referred to in the question. (3) In the light of (2), it is difficult to be specific about the resources that would be needed to implement the control measures mentioned. If it were shown that a biological control organism was available overseas, no extensive exploprogram would be required. It might be necessary, however, for feeding tests to be conducted overseas to provide information to satisfy Australian quarantine authorities the specificity of the organism. Resources would be needed for this and for building up populations of the organism in Australia and releasing them in the field. The extent of the resources required would be influenced by the for permanent resitype of organism. have temporary entry permits Cigarette Sales to Underdeveloped Countries (Question No. 3939) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Are Australian tobacco companies involved in the practice of dumping high tar content cigarettes in underdeveloped countries; if so, (a) is Queensland tobacco being inused for this purpose and (b) does the Federal Government have the power to prevent this activity. (2) If no power exists, what other preventative measures Bathurst Burr can be taken. (Question No. 3935)",397
257,Mr ANTHONY,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australian tobacco companies do export cigarettes to a number of overseas countries but there have been no comof plaints of dumping by Australia from developing countries. The relevant statistics do not disclose the type of cigarettes exported from Australia nor the source of the leaf used in the means for bioexported cigarettes. (2) At present there are no legal restrictions on the permissible tar content of cigarettes manufactured in Australia either for local consumption or export. Ionising Radiation (Question No. 3941) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, forerunner, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to therecentrepon of United States of America Academy of Science recomareductionin the maximum permissible dose of ionising radiation for workers in the nuclear industry. (2) If so, can he say what are the new recommendations. a (3) How do the recommendations compare with the codes of practice with respect to nuclear activities accepted in burr is a serious problem Australia.",398
258,Mr HUNT,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware that a press release on 2 May of this year by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences gave notice that a third report of its Committee on Biological Effects of Radiation would be released in the near future. A copy of the final repon has not as yet been received. However, a copy of the final draft summary and conState clusions of some sections of this which allows for some comment. (2) The repon specifically states that it does not make ommendations for the purposes of standard setting. It cautions that the risk estimates in the repon should in no way be interpreted as precise expectations, being based on incomplete data and involving a degree of uncertainty. (3) There is no comparison as this repon is not directly concerned with the setting of radiation protection standards. Australian Medical Association Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to aresolutionfrom the Victorian Branch of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) that preference in employment be given to graduactual ates who hold Australian qualifications and who are AMA members (AMA Gazette, 10 May 1979, page 9). (2) If so, what action is he taking on this proposal.",398
259,Mr HUNT,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable tician member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) 1 understand that the motion of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) to which the honourable member has referred, has been substantially amended by the Association's Federal Assembly. However, in any event, action inrespectof immigration of overseas medical practitioners will follow from funher consideration of the recommendations of the repon of the Committee of Officials on Medical Manpower Supply, tabled in Parliament on 22 March 1979. A copy of the report was forwarded to the AMA and its views on the recommendations have been sought. Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the report that the Australian Association of Surgeons is pressing for the removal of fee differentials between the States. (2) If so, can he state what would be the estimated cost to the Commonwealth under the present arrangements, of an increase or decrease of all fees to that of (a) New South Wales and (b) the State with the highest current common fee. (3) What would be the estimated increase in medical insurance in the different States if all fee differentials were moved and fees adjusted to the State with the highest current common fee. (4) What would be the estimated effect on the Consumer Price Index.",399
260,Mr HUNT,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable that member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of the repon that the Australian Association of Surgeons is pressing for the removal of fee differentials between States. (2) The estimated cost to the Commonwealth under present arrangements of an increase or decrease of all Schedule fees to that of (a) New South Wales is $23m and (b) the with the highest current Schedule fee is $28m, on a fullrepon has been examined year basis. Under the proposed 1 September 1979 arrangements, recthese costsreduceto $ 17m and $22mrespectivelyon a fullyear basis. (3) The estimated increases in basic medical weekly family contribution rates by State from 1 September 1979, if all fee differentials were removed and Schedule fees adjusted to the State with the highest Schedule fee would beNew South Wales-ni l cents Victoria- 16 cents Queensland-3 2 cents South Australia- 19 cents (Question No. 3942) Western Australia-2 2 cents Tasmania-1 7 cents (4) The Australian Bureau of Statistics has advised that no estimates have been made of the effects on the Consumer Price Index of these increases. It has advised that it is not possible to make reliable estimates without knowing the fees that would be charged by medical practitioners for particular services (as distinct from Schedule fees) if Schedule fees in all States were to be brought into line with those currently applicable in the State with the highest Schedule fees. In calculating the CPI the Australian Statiscollects information on actual fees charged from a sample of medical practitioners each quarter, and it is not practicable to obtain such information about hypothetical future changes in fees. Mr Dusko Kalajdic (Question No. 3944) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report claiming the suicide of Dusko Kalajdic was because he was to be deponed to Yugoslavia. (2) If so, what substance is there in the repon. Medical Fees (3) Why was Mr Kalajdic to be deported. (Question No. 3943) (4) Was the Government aware that Mr Kalajdic was apparently afraid of being returned to Yugoslavia for political reasons. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The deportation of Mr Kalajdic had not been ordered and newspaper reports inferring that he committed suicide because he feared deportation may not be soundly based. He was to have been considered for deportation and officers of my Department were in the process of collating all of the pertinent information for submission to me. I am informed that although Mr Kalajdic had at one time reindicated that he would fear for his life if he were to be returned to Yugoslavia it was ascertained during an in-depth interview with him on 21 December 1978, some three months before he took his life, that his apprehension was because he had left Yugoslavia illegally and had not fulfilled his national service obligations in his homeland. It is presumed he would have expected some form of punishment as a result should his deportation have been ordered. (3) and (4) See answer No. 2 above. Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to complaints by representatives of the Maltese community (Maltese Herald, 17 April 1979) that they have been disadvantaged compared with others in relation to the new ethnic television programs. (2) If so, how did this happen.",399
261,Mr STALEY,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The extent to which it of special interest to specific communities depends on the availability of television material from the homeland. Malta has only a black and white television service. However, on Sunday 2 May a segment of special interest to the Maltese community was included in the program. United States Defence Installation Employees Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: Oo the terms of the agreement arranged between the Australian and United States of America Governments on the operation within Australia of installations such as Nurrungar, Pine Gap and the North West Cape, allow US servicemen attached to those projects to undertake normal civilian employment in Australia during their off duty hours; if so, does this in any way contravene Australian migration restrictions on visitors accepting employment? Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The terms of the agreement between the Government of Australia and the United States concerning arrangements for the establishment and operation of the joint defence facilities to which the Honourable Member refers do not encompass the matter of US servicemen undertaking civilian employment in their off duty hours. Neither does the Status of Forces Agreement between Australia and the United States (Treaty Series 1963, No. 10) encompass the subject. Warning Labels on Alcoholic Liquor Mr James asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Can he say whether the United States of America Senate voted on 7 May 1979 to put warning labels on all bottles of liquor containing more than 24 per cent of alcohol by volume. (2) If so, will the Australian Government take steps to low the lead given by the US Senate.",400
262,Mr HUNT,GT PT DC PNG NZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. On 7 May 1979, the United States Senate considered a Bill (S.440) to revise and extend the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970. Several amendments to the Act were proposed, including a proposed health warning on alcoholic beverage containers. As far as I am aware, the Senate Bill was referred to the House of Representatives on 8 Ethnic Television May 1979, where it remains to be considered. (Question No. 3946) (2) Over the past few years, proposals for printing the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage containers have oeen the subject of investigation by the Food Standards Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) and the Health Ministers' Conference Working Party on Alcohol. In June 1976, the Food Standards Committee placed before the State Food Advisory Committees a recommendation on the alcohol content labelling of alcoholic beverages. Generally, the States did not accept the principles of labelling alcoholic beverages according to their alcohol content. One of the main arguments against such a proposal was that it may well have an opposite effect to that intended. That is, some people may be attracted to the beverage with the highest alcohol content. is possible to present programs The related matter of printing a health warning (as opposed to the alcohol content) on labels on alcoholic beverage containers has been considered by the Health Ministers' Conference Working Party on Alcohol. However, a consensus was not reached in favour of the proposal. While there are no plans at present to place warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers, my Department will continue to keep the matter underreviewas part of its on-going role of moni(Question No. 3950) toring the patterns of alcohol consumption in Australia. Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries (Question No. 3961) Mr Chapman asked the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Has the Federal Government held any discussions with the States at either ministerial or departmental level concerning implementation of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries (the Horton Report). (2) If not, are discussions planned in the near future. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No formal discussions have been held with the States on the Horton Report. It is my belief, however, that such discussions would be very worthwhile as part of a broader discussion between me and my counterparts in the States on cultural matters generally. I think it is important, however, that the Commonwealth's position on the Report should be clear before any such discussions are held. When I am in a position to hold discussions with my State counterparts, the Prime Minister will be in touch with State Premiers (Question No. 3958) on the matter. Fruit: Trade with Canada (Question No. 3962) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) What action is the Australian Government taking to folreduce the recent Canadian tariff import on canned pears. (2) Will the Government consider retaliatory action against Canadian cherry exports to Australia. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Following a review of the fruit and vegetable industry by the Canadian Tariff Board, Canada has announced increased duties on canned fruit including pears. These changes have eliminated preferences accorded Australia under the Canada/Australia Trade Agreement and the Australian Government made strong representations stressing the importance of these preferences. As a result the Canadian Government has agreed that for canned peats and some other canned fruit the preferences will be phased out over a three year period. Because of the special difficulties likely to face the canned pear industry in the Canadian market further tations have been made in recent weeks to the Canadian Government for an extension of the phasing period for canned pears. (2) The Canada/Australia Trade Agreement sets out the conditions under which either country can take compensate for loss of concessions. In 1973 during a review of the Trade Agreement both countries agreed on the need for flexibility tion of the Trade Agreement ments to give effect to domestic economic policies and to assist participation in the GATT negotiations. Since 1973 numerous adjustments have been made by both the Canadian and Australian Governments to their respective customs tariffs which have or reduced preferences for the other country. Neither side has taken compensatory action and there is still valuable preferential trade in both directions under the Trade Agreement. Any action on tariffs against imports of Canadian canned cherries would need to be considered in this context. Following the recent talks in Canada referred to above Australian officials are having further discussions with the Australian industry on the scope for any additional action. Imported Crab Meat Mr Cohen asked the Minister for Business and Consumer AJairs, upon notice, on 23 May 1979: (1) Is there any inspection of the contents of imported crab meat to ascertain that the product labelled crab does indeed contain purely crab meat and does not contain any substitute products. (2) If there is an inspection, has any minced or processed giant clam meat been identified as a substitute for crab meat. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Vessel name Where apprehended FeiJyiTsair Swains Reef Apprehended 30.10.70 Queensland ChisFongNo. 8 Warrier Reef Torres Apprehended 22.1.71 Strait Kuang Nam Cape Direction, NT Apprehended 24.11.71 Sun Gee Tai (also known Quoin Entrance Cape as Sheng Jyi Tasai) Waymouth(Qld) Apprehended 8.12.71 Yung Yuan No. 22 9 miles, NECape Apprehended 13.9.72 Wessel Light, NT Yung Yuan No. 21 9 miles otTCape Wessel Yung Yuan Ocean Apprehended 13.9.72 Light, NT (1) and (2) No inspection of imported crab meat is made by my Department to ascertain whether substitute products are included. I understand that clam meat is a rare and expensive delicacy in Asia where supply does not meet the demand. There is therefore a great price disparity between clam meat and the much cheaper and more abundant crab meat. In these circumstances there would appear to be little possibility of representhe substitution of clam for crab meat. Foreign Fishing Vessels (Question No. 3976) Mr James asked the Minister for Primary action to Industry, upon notice, on 23 May 1979: (1) How many foreign vessels have been seized by the Government for fishing in Australian waters during the years in the administra1970-71 to 1977-78. to allow necessary tariff adjust(2) Where were these vessels seized and what were their multilateral trade registered names. (3) What were the names of the owners of the vessels seized. (4) How long were the vessels held before they were resulted in duty increases disposed of. (5) How were they disposed of.

(2) Under the terms of the Statistics Act, the ABS is prohibited from divulging the turn. In discharging thisresponsibility it has to ensure that this confidential data is not inadvertently disclosed, e.g. by publishing data which enables one respondent to deduce another respondent's data. Therefore manufacturing production data dominated by data for one or two respondents is suppressed from publication and other figures may also need to be suppressed to prevent data by subtraction from totals. Patterns of manufacturing commodity production change over time and this often means that the confidentility pattern also changes. The number of data cells suppressed is kept to a minimum and the confidentiality pattern is maintained on a consistent basis as far as possible. (3) None.

269,Mr VINER,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There is no land claim in the Lake Nash region under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. An application for land at Lake Nash was lodged with the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner, the late Mr Justice in September 1975 but hearings were adjourned sine die on 10 November 1975 because the lessee indicated a to negotiate with the Aboriginals for a sub-lease of part of the property to be used as a living area for the resident Aboriginal community. The Northern Territory Crown Lands Act has been amended to allow for sub-leases of pastoral leases to Aboriginal communities, and the amendment of was proclaimed in February 1979. The Lake Nash lessee the had decided against a sub-lease but negotiations about a at the suitable area have been reopened. (2) , (3) and (4) All pastoral leases in the Northern Territory containreservationsin favour of the Aboriginal inhabitants of the Territory. These rights are defined in Section 24 of the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act. The only penalty for failure to comply with the conditions of a lease was forfeiture of the lease. In the 1974 Second Report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, Mr Justice Woodward commented that 'this is obviously a very drastic penalty and 88 it is not surprising that it has never been invoked' (paragraph 218). In consequence, he recommended the provision 99 107 59 of realistic penalties to secure Aboriginalrights.In line with 56 47 61 45 Mr Justice Woodward'srecommendation,the amended provision now provides a penalty of $2,000 for interference with the full and free exercise of the rightsreservedto AborigiThe enforcement of the Act is the responsibility of the hearing conserNorthern Territory Government.

(4) What action is being taken to prevent this from happening again, or to retaliate by restricting agricultural imports from the Community.",407
271,Mr ANTHONY,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) In March 1979, the EEC Commission requested Australia to participate in a system of voluntary restraints to regulate the level of exports of apples to Community markets during the 1979 Southern hemisphere season. Representations were made to the Commission and, following continuing negotiations, the EEC established restraint levels for Australia and a number of other major suppliers of apples. Under this arrangement details of the individual restraint levels applied by the EEC are not being made public. However, it is expected that the arrangements will not have any significant adverse effect on Australia's exports of apples to EEC markets over the period. Child Snatching (2) Yes. Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa, the other major off-season suppliers of apples to the EEC, are in(Question No. 3992) cluded in the EEC's voluntary restraint program but as noted in (1) above details have not been made public. Chile, which is also a significant supplier, has refused to voluntarily restrain its expons and the EEC has announced action against impons of apples from Chile by way of a total suspension of impons in the period 19 May to IS August 1979. (3) No. As indicated in (1) above, Australia's export availability of apples for EEC markets during 1979 is expected to be within therestraintlevel applied by the EEC. Law has just held its first talks (4) Australia's basic objections to any system of quantitative restraints on impons have been made clear to the EEC on many occasions. In the course of the recent discussions on apples, particular attention was drawn to our objections to the use of this kind of trade barrier in order to assist the disposal of a high level of EEC production of apples, which is the real cause of the marketing problem confronting EEC producers. The arrangements apply only to the current season and no commitments have been entered into for future years. Aborigines in Queensland (Question No. 3997) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 24 May 1979: (1) Has aresidentof Woorabinda Aboriginal Settlement apparently suicided while imprisoned at Woorabinda. (2) Have reports from myself and others indicated to the Minister and his predecessors the lack of effective selfmanagement, self-determination, cultural independence, religious tolerance and of Aboriginal beliefs, respect for traditional ritual relations with the land and civil rights in State-administered settlements in Queensland. (Question No. 3993) (3) Has Australia subscribed internationally to Conventions guaranteeing the rights of minorities which require specific programs and policies to ensure that intercultural communication is promoted and developed in a nondiscriminatory way. (4) If so, what progress has been made and what targets have been set for the elimination of discrimination which leads to degradation of Aborigines in Queensland. other apple exporting coun",407
272,Mr VINER,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. I am informed that Mr Thomas Moore, a resident of Woorabinda died in a cell at Woorabinda on 18 May 1979 apparently by hanging. Repons indicate that there were no suspicious circumstances. (2) The Government is aware of the problems of Aboriginal settlements managed by the Queensland Depanment of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement. (3) Australia has ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination which requires States parties to undertake measures that could be said to be designed to promote inter-cultural communication. (4) Remedies are available under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to persons suffering from any acts of discrimination 'o which that Act applies. Provisions of the Racial Discriminauon Act 1975 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 override Queensland legislation which is considered to discriminate against Aboriginals. Referrals from General Practitioners to Mr Humphreys asked the Minister upon notice, on 24 May 1979: (1) Will he take action to alter the system of annual referral by general practitioners to specialists to allow cases where permanent specialist treatment is required to seek referral only once every 2 years. (2) Would this alteration effect a reduction in health costs to the public and the Government. (3) When was the last Departmental review of the system involving referrals from general practitioners to specialists. (4) Was any dissatisfaction with the system indicated in that review.",407
273,Mr HUNT,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is not proposed at this time to alter the period of validity of referrals to specialists and consultant physicians. (2) Extension of the referral period, as suggested by the honourable member, would be applicable for only a small number of conditions and could cause a smallreductionin overall health costs. On the referral period were to lead to increased patient utilization of specialist services instead there could, as a result,be an overall increase in costs. With some 35 million specialist services each year, it would be administratively impracticable to consider service separately to decide whether an extended referral period was appropriate. The only practical course is to lay down a system which is capable of uniform application. (3) The latest review of the referral system was completed in March 1979. (4) The latest review was initiated following some complaints about the need for annual referral for certain ophthalmological conditions requiring specialist care. From the viewpoint of any one individual who is fortunate enough not to require the services of a general practitioner between annual visits to a specialist, the system may be seen as personally inconvenient. The review indicated, however, that the system was generally working satisfactorily, and that it appeared to be acting as a brake on uncontrolled direct access to specialists whose services attract higher fees and benefits than do general practitioner services, and that it should remain unaltered. 1970January February March April May June July August School Dental Scheme Specialists (Question No. 4009) (Question No. 4001) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon for Health, notice, on 28 May 1979: (1) Further to question No. 3431 (Hansard, 10 May 1979, page 2142), has a decision been made by the Government to extend the school dental scheme to secondary school students; if so, when will the mainland States be allowed to join Tasmania in including secondary school students in the scheme. (2) If not, why has Tasmania been allowed to include this group when other States are some years away from comprehensive cover for all primary school students.",408
274,Mr HUNT,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The School Dental Scheme generally covers primary school children only, at thistime.This is due to the need for maximum restraint in public expenditures. Any future proposal for extension of the Scheme beyond primary school level will be discussed with the dental profession and the States. (2) The arrangement that exists for School Dental Scheme coverage of some secondary school children in Tasmania is due to the fact that Tasmania was treating a substantial number of secondary school children at the time of commencement of the Scheme. However, Commonwealth financial support for treatment of secondary school students in Tasmania is restricted to current levels of activity. other hand, if an extension of the Price of Gold of general practitioner services, (Question No. 4035) Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, each individual on 29 May 1979: What has been the buying price of gold per fine ounce at the beginning of each month from 1 January 1970 to date in (a) London and (b) Zurich expressed in (i) US dollars, (ii) Swiss Francs and (iii) Australian dollars at the then ruling exchange rates.",408
275,Mr HOWARD,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The gold price data set out below for London and Zurich markets are on the commonly-used basis of end-of-month quotations. The London price is that determined during the 1500 hours (GMT) fixing. It is the buying/selling price agreed upon by dealers at the time of the fixing. The Zurich data are on the basis of the mid-point of the spread between buying and selling prices at the close of trading. The size of the spread varies according to market conditions but currently the buying price is around 30 cents below the midpoint quotation.

I am informed by my Department that an imaginative proposal in which a developer volunteered to restore and preserve the old Yarralumla Brickworks and so provide a unique tourist recreation centre was subsequently received. Following negotiations a lease was granted. financial advantage to that deThe lease requires the old structures to be renovated and maintained by the lessee at his cost throughout the term of lease after which the ownership of the improvements will revert to the Commonwealth. An annual rent will be payable throughout the lease term and will be reviewed periodically taking into account alterations in the rental value of the complex. The developer will also pay the agreed market price for leases of adjoining residential sites. I am funher informed that the cost to Government in providing housing sites has been estimated at $695,000 (which is far less than the figure suggested by the honourable member) and that this cost is comparable with the cost involved in servicing developments Guidelines for Travel on VIP Aircraft Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 May 1979: (1) What are the guidelines foi allowing backbench Members of Parliament to travel on VIP aircraft. (2) Were VIP aircraft used by the Minister for Transport on 24 May 1979 to pay visits to Coober Pedy, SA, and the Tarcoola-Alice Springs railway now being constructed. (3) If so, who were the other passengers. (4) Did the other passengers on board the aircraft qualify within the travel guidelines for VIP aircraft. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable curity member's question is as follows: (1) The guidelines allowing travel on special purpose craft by members of Parliament and others, as tabled in liament in March 1973, are currently under review. The Government expects to make a decision shortly whatrevisions,if any, should be made to the guidelines. (2) A special purpose aircraft conveying the Minister Transport to Darwin via Alice Springs landed at Woomera, SA, on 24 May 1979 to enable the Minister to visit Coober Pedy, SA, and the Tarcoola-Alice Springs railway. Aryears. rangements for this visit, subsequently cancelled because adverse weather conditions, did not involve a pose aircraft. (3) Not applicable. (4) The passengers on board the aircraft which landed Woomera en route to Alice Springs and Darwin qualified within the guidelines laid down. Asbestos Ceiling Insulation Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Health, upon low notice, on 30 May 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Canberra Times of 5 April 1979 concerning lations in the Australian Capital Teritory and the possible wind effects. (2) What dangers are there to the community if a home with free asbestos ceiling insulation has high winds. (3) Has the Health Commission agreed that undisturbed asbestos is safe; if so, if asbestos insulation is disturbed through the unroofing of an asbestos insulated winds, what are the possible consequences to the surrrounding community.",408
276,Mr HUNT,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No tests have been carried a community in the event of a house with free asbestos ceiling insulation being unroofed. It could be assumed however that where high winds disturbs a roof allowing asbestos fibres to escape, the wind would be of a sufficient velocity disperse the asbestos fibres quickly. (3) Yes. See answer to (2) above. Good Neighbour Councils (Question No. 4066) in other parts of Canberra. Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 30 May 1979: (Question No. 4051) (1) What has been therelationshipof his Department to the Good Neighbour Councils. (2) Why did the Government decide to disband the Good Neighbour Councils. (3) What measures has he taken to place in employment staff of the Good Neighbour Councils displaced as a result of Government actions. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Commonwealth funds have been provided to Good Neighbour Councils through my Depanment since 1950, except for a brief period when the Department of Social Sewas the funding Department. While the activities of all the Councils have been oversighted and guided through a position of Co-ordinator in my Department, Good Neighairbour Councils are independent, autonomous bodies. IndividParual Councils employ their own staff, and although salaries are paid from Commonwealth Grant-in-Aid funds, on - members of the staff are not public servants. (2) The 'Review of Post-Arrival Programs and Services to for Migrants' headed by Mr Frank Galbally, CBE., recommended that Commonwealth funding of the Good Neighbour Councils should be phased out over a period of two The Government, after giving very careful considerof ation to the Galbally recommendation, accepted it and other special purrecommendations in the report in full. (3) A Working Party as proposed in the Galbally Report (para. 6.43) was established at a Conference of Good Neighat bour Presidents and Directors held in Canberra on 19 June 1978. Since then the Working Party has visited all Councils and has established tri-partite regional committees, comprising representatives of the Public Service Board, the Common(Question No. 4064) wealth Employment Service and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in each State and Territory, to folup with detailed interviewsof all council staff and to co-operate, in efforts, to find them alternative employment. Detailed staff profiles have also been sent to State and building reguLocal Government bodies. The Prime Minister wrote to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs asking that the Commonwealth Employment Service make special efforts to assist Good Neighbour its roof removed by staff to obtain employment. All Good Neighbour applicants for recently advertised Ethnic Affairs and Settlement Officers' positions in my Depanment were interviewed and these interviews are curhouse by high rently being evaluated. Capital City Telephone Districts (Question No. 4070) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 30 May out to determine the risks to 1979: (1) Did his predecessor issue a press release in November 1977 stating that a study has been commissioned by Telecom into the question of extending Capital City Telephone Disto tricts for charging purposes; if so, which cities and which zones were to be included in the examination. (2) Is this the same study mentioned by him in an answer to a question without notice from the Member for Macquarie on 6 March 1979 (Hansard, page 607); if so, what is the reason for Telecom's inability to report after a lapse of some 18 months.",411
277,Mr STALEY,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My colleague and predecessor, the Hon. Eric Robinson issued a press release on 24 November 1977 stating in part that he had inititated 'an examination by Telecom into all the factors involved in reducing charges, not only into the area close to Sydney but also into the total question of extending local call access to other areas around Australia where this would be appropriate'. In fact the review covered the whole of Australia involving some 2,400 telephone calling zones and not just the areas adjacent to the metropolitan districts. (2) This is the same study which I mentioned in my answer on 6 March 1979 to the Member for Macquarie. I presented the results of the study in the House on 5 June 1979. The changes proposed are the first of a major nature since the 1960 group charging zone, incorporating the extended local service area plan, was established. Telecom pointed out at the outset of the review that quite detailed traffic, commercial and technical studies were involved throughout the whole of Australia. This included complex numbering, technical, switching and charging considerations. The time involved in completing the study was not unexpected and, as the results show, was quite justified. Jabiluka Uranium Deposits",412
278,Mr HAYDEN,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 30 May 1979: (1) Has Panconunental Mining Ltd proposed to the Government that mining of the Jabiluka uranium deposits might be performed underground rather than open cut, as outlined in the environmental impact statement. (2) If so, will the Government new statement to describe the environmental consequences of underground mining before any approval is granted for mining the Jabiluka deposits. Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Panconunental Mining Ltd has advised the Government that, following consideration of environmental matters raised in comments received on the Jabiluka Uranium Project Draft Environmental Impact Statement and further technical investigations, the Company is developing, as a preferred alternative, a proposal to mine the deposit by underground methods. In the draft impact statement, the Company had indicated a preference for an open cut operation and briefly examined the underground alternative. (2) Panconunental Mining Ltd are preparing a final environmental impact statement which will examine in detail the environmental consequences of the underground proposal and the open cut alternative. This final impact statement when submitted by the Company will be examined in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Protection Administrative Procedures, before any Government decision is made in relation to the proposal. Telephone Charges (Question No. 4087)",412
279,Mr HAYDEN,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 30 May 1979: What would the cost be of providing a common telephone charge nation wide (a) if the charge was at the current metropolitan rate and the difference between revenue collected and current revenue was a subsidy and (b) if the common rate was established by a charge which gathered the same level of revenue as is currently collected.",412
280,Mr STALEY,PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURE ON,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) In 1977-78 and assuming the same local and trunk traffic levels, a subsidy of $660m would have been required to compensate for call revenue lost. Clearly though, charging all calls at either the local call rate or at a uniform rate for all calls would distort the current levels of local and trunk traffic calls. In fact, very heavy long term capital expenditure-runnin g into several billions of dollars-woul d be needed to re-dimension the network to cater for the resultant changes in calling patterns and increased traffic volume on many routes. This capital investment would naturally have to be reflected in a uniform call fee and Telecom has estimated that a call fee of around 47 cents would have to be applied to each local call and 3-minute STD/trunk call to achieve the same trading result as at present.

(2) If so, (a) what are the chances of these reefs being repopulated by living adult clams and how long will this take and (b) what is the ecological of these clams in terms of the fish, plankton and coral communities. (3) Do the zooxanthellae, found in the giant clams' mantles, contribute to the nutrient flux in waters bathing the reef. Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. However there is evidence that on some coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef about SO per cent of giant clams have been found dead, and this may have been due to fishing. (2) (a) Little is known, but some work is being relating to repopulation of reefs by living adult clams, (b) The role of the giant clam in the reef ecosystem is not understood. (3) It is not known if the zooxanthellae found in the clams' mantles contribute to the nutrient flux in the water, but it is unlikely. Sea Food Harvesting Licences Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 31 May 1979: Will he ensure that no commercial sea food harvesting licences are let for the Torres Strait and northern Barrier Reef region until (a) full consultation has occurred with Aboriginal and Islander Communities interested in beche-de-mer and other sea food industries and (b) adequate help is provided to these communities to ensure that they can provide a management structure and submit tenders and/or applications with priority over other interests.",416
287,Mr SINCLAIR,EXPENDITURE ON MEDICAL SERVICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) seafood harvesting in Torres Strait is covered in the Torres Strait Treaty which provides that traditional fishing will be given priority over commercial fishing. The Treaty also provides for the establishment of consultative machinery whereby the Aboriginal and Islander communities of the area will be consulted in relation to the extension of commercial fisheries as well as other matters. Arrangements for the implementation of the Treaty are currently in hand and the points raised by you are being taken into account. (b) The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments recently invited applications for pilot beche-de-mer fishing ventures with the object of re-establishing this fishery along the Great Barrier Reef. Consideration will be given to all submissions received including those from interested Aboriginal and Islander communities. Requests for assistance from community groups will be considered once applications are received. Commonwealth Office Building, Aubum (Question No. 4105) (Question No. 4113) Mr Uren asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 31 May 1979: (1) When will the proposed Commonwealth office accomBarmodation, to be occupied by the Department of Social Security, at 44-48 Auburn Road, Auburn, be completed. (2) What stage of construction had this building reached as at 30 May 1979. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honoursignificance of the destruction able member's question is as follows: (1) The building should be completed towards the end of 1979. Unexpected difficulties encountered by the lessor in the initial stages of development resulted in the original completion date being set back by about six months. (2) In view of (I), actual construction had not commenced at that date. Government Houses in the Australian Capital Territory (Question No. 4114) Mr Uren asked the Minister for the Capital carried out Territory, upon notice, on 31 May 1979: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 3S99 (Hansard, fully 10 May 1979, page 2143), where he said that information was not available as to how many persons who have received giant eviction notices for Government houses in the Australian Capital Territory were unemployed at the time of receiving those notices, do unemployed persons qualify for arentrebate if they are Government tenants; if so, when will he supply the information requested. (Question No. 4109) (2) What are the reasons for the substantial increase in the number of eviction notices issued since January 1976. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed by my Department that: (1) Government housing tenants who are unemployed qualify for a rentalrebateprovided they meet the income eligibility requirements. A check of the tenants who received notices to quit during the period January 1976 to March 1979 against the tenants who were receiving a rental rebate during that period would not provide accurate figures as to the number of tenants who were unemployed when they received a notice to quit. This is because: (a) the incomes of both tenant and spouse are taken into account in assessing entitlement to a rental rebate. Consequently, a tenant who was unemployed but whose wife was working would not qualify for assistance if the wife's income plus any income he was receiving was above the eligibility threshold; (b) arentalrebate for an unemployed person is generally approved for a period of 6 months after which it is reviewed. If the person has become employed by the time of the review his rental rebate is adjusted or terminated depending on the level of his family income. If a notice to quit was served on such a person betweenreviewsthe Department of the Capital Territory would not necessarily know whether or not he was still unemployed; and (c) it was the practice until November 1977 to take into account the tenant's average income over 6 months as well as his current income in establishing entitlement for arentalrebate.A person who became unemployed did not become eligible for a rental rebate until his average income had fallen below the eligibility threshold. This depending on the level of his income before becoming unemployed. (2) In the vast majority of cases notices because of the failure of a tenant to meet his rent obligations. In 1976, 353 notices to quit were issued (representing cent of rental stock), 474 in in 1978 (5.1 per cent of stock), and 235 in the of 1979. The total Government rental stock is some 11,000 houses and flats. The increases in the number of eviction notices issued were due mainly to a higher incidence of rental arrears of tenants who did not respond to requests their accounts up to date. Bauxite and Alumina Industry in Western Mr Cohen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 31 May 1979: (1) Is it a fact that (a) of the 63 public submissions and 15 government submissions to the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority concerning the proposed expansion of the alumina industry of Western Australia, only 2 government submissions were unequivocally in favour of the projects and (b) the Western Australian Government in April 1978 passed legislation to allow for building of alumina refineries at Wagerup and Worsley, before environment review and management programs were submitted by the companies involved. (2) If so, will the Minister quiry into the bauxite and alumina industry in Western Australia using the powers under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer monwealth to the honourable member's question: (1) (a)Yes. (b) The Western Australian Government in passed Agreement Acts with respect to the Wagerup and Worsley projects. This legislation required the companies submit an Environmental Review and Management Program in relation to the bauxite mining and alumina refinery proposals as a means of satisfying Western Australian environmental requirements before State approval volved was given for work to proceed on these projects. (2) Both the Wagerup and Worsley bauxite/alumina House, projects come under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. A final impact statement on the Wagerup project was submitted to the Government. The then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development considered available information and decided that a public inquiry was not necessary. Subsequently, in accordance with the Environmental Protection Administrative Procedures, the Minister advised the Minister for Trade and Resources and the Treasurer, as Action Ministers, of his recommendations with respect to this proposal. The preparation and submission of an environmental impact statement has been directed on the Worsley proposal. Following receipt of the final impact statement the Minister for Science and the Environment will assess the need for additional information and the manner in which such inforemployed mation should be sought. Governor General's Use of VIP Aircraft could take considerable time, (Question No. 4128) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Defence, to quit are issued upon notice, on 4 June 1979: (1) How many trips has the Governor General made in 3.1 per RAAF No. 34 Squadron aircraft since December 1977. 1977 (4.2 per cent of stock), 562 first 3 months (2) What was the purpose of each trip. (3) What was the cost of each trip. (4) What was the name, classification and salary of each to bring person who accompanied the Governor General. (5) What type of aircraft was used on each trip. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable Australia member's question is as follows: (Question No.4117) (1) to (5) Details of flights of aircraft of the RAAF No. 34 Squadron are presented regularly to the Parliament by the Minister for Defence. The details normally tabled include each flight made by the Governor General, the names of persons accompanying him, and the type of aircraft used. The Governor General is not required to inform me of the purpose of theflightsfor which he uses RAAF No. 34 Squadron aircraft. I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of time and effort which would be required to obtain the information requested in parts (3) and (4) of the honourable member's question, other than that already provided in the tabled details of flights. Parliament House: Overtime Paid to establish a Federal public inCommonwealth Police (Question No. 4132) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 June 1979: (1) What was the total amount of overtime paid to ComPolice employed on security duties at Parliament House in (a) 1974-75, (b) 1975-76), (c) 1976-77, (d) 1977-78 and (e) I July 1978 to date. (2) Against which divisional item are these payments April 1978 charged in his Department's accounts. to Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Having regard to the expenditure of resources inin searching out records which are not kept in a format which would allow ready retrieval of the actual amount of overtime paid to Commonwealth Police at Parliament I do not think it would be appropriate for me to authorise the considerable expenditure necessary to search out and calculate the detailed information required to answer the question by the honourable member. (2) Payments are made under the Department of Adminall istrative Services division 137/1 /02. Commonwealth Police at Airports (Question No. 4133) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 June 1979: Further to his answer to question No. 3899 (Hansard, 29 May 1979, page 2627) is he now able to say what was (a) the establishment level of Commonwealth Police at each Ausany tralian airport and (b) the number of Commonwealth Police at each Australian airport as at (a) 31 March 1978; (b) 31 March 1979 and (c) 30 April 1979. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The honourable member's question is substantially the same as his previous question (No. 3899). As stated answer to that question, to Commonwealth Police at each Australian ardise airport security and compromise the high standard of protection that is presently afforded the travelling public airport staff. The honourable member may care to note that the answer to Senate Question No. 1979, page 1349) revealed the number of Commonwealth Police at Sydney airport but did not specify the numbers on duty at either the domestic or international maintaining the integrity of airport security. Galvanised Steel Roofing Tiles Mr Morris asked the Minister for Trade and officers Resources, upon notice, on 4 June 1979: (1) In respect of the New Zealand Free Trade Agreement Customs Tariff (New Zealand Rate Schedule) R16 (279/16), page 1546, Item 73.40.900, operative III 78 of 17 August 1978, part (h), roofing tiles of galvanised steel, coated with a bonding preparation based on bitumen, and further coated with a layer of mineral substances, this definition different from that operative from 1 July 1974.

288,Mr ANTHONY,EXPENDITURE ON MEDICAL SERVICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as. follows: (1) and (2) Certain coated galvanised steel roofing tiles were added to Schedule A of the New Zealand Australia Year Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1974. Schedule A is the (July-June) list of goods covered by the In December 1976 New Zealand nominated acrylic-coated 1973-74 . galvanised steel roofing tiles for addition to Schedule A and 1974-75 in processing this nomination it was found that the descrip1975-76 . tion of the goods already Schedule.

In order to avoid any possibility of Schedule A goods paying duty the description of galvanised 1973-74 . steel roofing tiles on Schedule A was amended and broadened in October 1977. This broader description was 1975-76 . adopted in a situation where there was insufficient time for 1976-77 . technical experts to determine a precise and enforceable de1977-78 . scription of the type of tile added to Schedule A in 1974, and was subject to further examination.

Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable terminals, thus member's question is as follows: An investigation by the Bureau of Customs established that certain metal roofing tiles had been incorrectly entered for Customs purposes and that a substantial amount of duty (Question No. 4136) had been shortpaid. In the course of inquiries Customs visited the premises of importers in a number of States to ascertain the reason for the short payment of Customs duty.

Up to 21 May spring grains and pulses (excluding maize) had been sown on 69.8m ha, or 64 per cent of the target, approaching the previous year's progress at the same date. The winter wheat crop is expected to be considerably smaller than the 69m tonnes of 1978. A somewhat reduced area was sown and winterkill has caused above normal damage. The official forecast issued on 11 May 1979 of all wheat production in 1979 in the USA was for a range of 47.2m to 56.5m tonnes, compared with last year's 49.0m and 55.4m tonnes in 1977. The estimate of the winter wheat harvest issued at the same time was for production of 37.9m tonnes, compared with 34.0m tonnes in 1978. Spring wheat seedings have been hampered by cold and wet weather. By the end of May, some two-thirds of intended plantings had been sown, well down on the average for recent years. In Canada where farmers intended to increase the wheat area by about 2 per cent,fieldworkis still behind schedule. Although seeding can continue into June, late sowings are usually associated with lower yields. Some growers could therefore switch to other crops, such as barley and rapeseed. In the EEC a reduction is expected on last year's output of 39.5m tonnes. In the USSR above normal winterkill is expected to lead to increased sowings of spring coarse grain crops. The spring barley area in the USSR, which covered 31.3m ha in 1978, should show an increase this year. With reduced plantings, production in the USA is expected to be somewhat lower than last year's 9.7m tonnes. In Canada farmers have indicated they would reduce barley seedings by 15 per cent this season, but the cutback may be less severe if therecentcold weather causes some shift from spring wheat to later sown grains and oilseeds. Insurance Broking Industry Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 June 1979: (1) Does he recall my repeated calls for official legislation to supervise andregulatethe insurance broking industry, supported by calls from the industry itself, the underwriting industry, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the media. (2) Has he put his submission to Cabinet inrelationto the commitment to introduce legislation to this end, as reported in March 1979. (3) Has the Insurance Council of Australia had extensive discussions with officers ofhis Department to this end. (4) Is it a fact thatregulationof the insurance industry can no longer safely be left to market forces, having regard to the total absence of any legislation to supervise or regulate the industry and the inexcusable escalation of broker company collapses duringrecentyears. (5) As this area has been the subject of searching examination for the last 5 years, when will the legislation be introduced.",419
290,Mr HOWARD,WHEAT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Although I do not personally recall the details of the honourable member's representations on this matter, I am aware ofhis keen interest in this subject and my Department has a full record of the honourable member's representations on its files. I am, of course, also aware that the official representatives of the insurance broking and underwriting industries have expressed themselves in favour of legislation for the supervision of insurance brokers. A Discussion Paper issued last year by the Law Reform Commission included proposals-describe d by the Commission as'tentative'-for legislation to supervise insurance brokers but it is to be noted that the Commission still has this matter under consideration and that its final Report on its Insurance Contracts Reference is not expected until later this year. I do not know what the honourable member may have had in mind in referring to' calls' from the' media'. (2) I do not believe that it would be appropriate to provide information on the internal workings of government of the BARLEY kind called for in this question. I have, however, indicated to the Insurance Brokers' Council of Australia that I shall be seeking guidance from Cabinet on the approach to be adopted on this matter. (3) There have been discussions between representatives of my Department and the Insurance Council of Australia on this matter although not in the recent past (4) It is not the case that the regulation of the insurance industry is at present entirely 'left to market forces' as implied in the question. Considerable regulation is, of course, exercised under the Life Insurance Act 1945 and the Insurance Act 1973. In relation to the question whether there should be Commonwealth legislation for the regulation of insurance brokers that is a policy matter that remains under consider(Question No. 4154) ation at present. (5) Although this matter has, it is true, been under examination for some years it is equally true that it remains under examination at present including by the Law Reform Commission (see (1) above). When I am in a position to make a statement of the Government's decision I shall do so.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) All such allegations are initially examined within my Department. Any allegation which is assessed as being of a potentially serious nature is referred to the Commonwealth Police Force for investigation. (2) No. Bribery and the soliciting of bribes are offences under the Crimes Act 1914, while soliciting and/or accepting gifts are offences under the Public Service Act 1922. (3) and (4). 1975 4 allegations of staff impropriety: 2 were unfounded. 1 resulted in a Departmental reprimand. 1 resulted in an officer being convicted on charges (Question No. 4174) of conspiracy and obtaining a bribe. 1976 7 allegations of staff impropriety: 5 were unfounded. 1 resulted in a Departmental reprimand. 1 resulted in an officer being convicted on charges of forgery and uttering. 1977 5 allegations of staff impropriety: 4 were unfounded. 1 resulted in a Departmental reprimand. 1978 7 allegations of staff impropriety: 6 were unfounded. 1 resulted in a woman (not an officer of the Department) being charged with four counts of impersonation of an officer, five of obtaining money by false $000 pretences and nine of forgery. 1979 (to date) 1,522 4 allegations of staff impropriety: 4,430 I was unfounded. 6,283 3 are still under examination. 5,442 5,835 (5) Although the existence of such an allegation has been 5,402 brought to my attention, no report on it has been made available either to me or to my Department. 28,914 (6) All applications by persons wishing to remain permanently in Australia are considered in the Tight of current immigration policy. I can offer no promises to people who have broken immigration law and who have compounded their errors by looking for ways to bribe their way out of trouble. But if I am given solid facts I will always have a matter carefully investigated.

294,Mr LES JOHNSON,WILLIAMSTOWN NAVAL DOCKYARD,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 June 1979: (1) What percentage of the insurance industry operating in Australia is under foreign ownership or control as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2) What were the expressed fears concerning the solvency of sections of the Australian insurance industry put forward to Government when it was considering proceeding with its March 1976 commitment to introduce a national disaster insurance scheme. (3) Who or which companies or organisations expressed these fears.",425
295,Mr HOWARD,WILLIAMSTOWN NAVAL DOCKYARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statistics published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 17 March 1978 indicate that, as at 30 June 1976,107 of the 2IS general (non-life) insurance companies then operating in Australia were foreign controlled on the basis of the definition used by the Bureau; these foreign controlled companies wrote 37.8 per cent of business, as measured by premiums, in the year ended 30 June 1976. (2) The expressed fears put to the Government mainly centred around the possibility that, in the event of a major catastrophe or series of catastrophes occurring, the claims arising therefrom could result in some insurance companies facing substantial losses of reserves, possibly to the point of solvency problems arising. It was also suggested that there could, in these circumstances, be increases in reinsurance premium rates or withdrawal of reinsurance cover by the international reinsurance market. (3) Fears of this general kind were expressed in the report referred to in paragraph 3 of the Policy Information Paper which I tabled in Parliament on 4 June 1979 and in various consultative processes with insurance industry representatives. Insurance Cover for Landslip (Question No. 4212)",425
296,Mr LES JOHNSON,WILLIAMSTOWN NAVAL DOCKYARD,"the Treasurer, upon is no B707 aircraft being fitted notice, on 6 June 1979: What practical problems were identified in offering insurance cover for landslip.",425
297,Mr HOWARD,WILLIAMSTOWN NAVAL DOCKYARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The main problem identified in relation to the question of providing insurance cover for landslip was that both the probability and cost of damage to properties in areas exposed to this hazard can be very high. In such circumstances a premium rate that is commensurate with the risk can be beyond the capacity of the property owner to bear. A on the related problem is the potential inequities involved in spreading this burden to insurers or those in the community that are not exposed to this hazard. There may also be definitional problems arising from the varied causes of this hazard. Aboriginal Alcohol Counsellors (Question No. 4217) in converting the aircraft from a Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 6 June 1979: (1) Has the Western Australian Institute of Technology Insurance Industry course for Aboriginal alcohol counsellors been successful in (Question No. 4211) providing Aboriginal social change agents, who offer one of the most cost-effective approaches to prevention of alcoholism by relieving social environmental and cross-cultural problems. (2) Have funds been refused for renewal of the course next year on the grounds that funds are not available to employ the trainees. (3) What evidence is available to suggest that denying such essential functions will save public money in the long and medium term. MT Viner-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Depanment of Aboriginal Affairs provided $19,831 to WAIT-AID Ltd to conduct a course for Aboriginal alcohol counsellors in the first half of 1978. Fourteen Aboriginals from centres throughout Western Australia graduated in July 1978. A further grant was provided to WAIT-AID in the 1978-79 financial year to undenake an evaluation of the course and the report of this evaluation is now being considered by the Western Australian Regional Office of my Department in consultation with WAIT-AID. Insufficient time has elapsed for any reasonable assessment to be made of the impact of the counsellors in their communities. However, there are some indications that the training of counsellors can make a positive contribution towards decreasing Aboriginal alcohol abuse. (2) No. (3) See(l)above. Buddabuddoo Aboriginal Council (Question No. 4219) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 6 June 1979: (1) Did Yindiji people resettle on Buddabuddoo land in 1974 with the help of a Federal Government grant.

300,Mr HOWARD,WILLIAMSTOWN NAVAL DOCKYARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am informed that Minatome has been looking for Australian partners for the possible development of this deposit. However, I am unable to advise which companies may have been approached as information received by the Government in connection with foreign investment proposals is treated in confidence. (2) A proposal for the development of the deposit would require consideration by the Foreign Investment Review New South Wales Board in terms of the Government's policy on foreign invest(Question No. 4226) ment in uranium. Defence Housing in West Heidelberg Area (Question No. 4242) Mr Howe asked the Minister for Defence, centre for alupon notice, on 7 June 1979: what is (1) How many homes and flats are owned by his Department in the West Heidelberg area, Victoria.

(8) Have any of his Department's houses orflatsin the been used as emergency accommodation. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No houses orflatsare owned by the Department of in the West Heidelberg area. The Services were however allocated 131 dwellings in the Heidelberg area by the Victorian Housing Commission pursuant to the prothe visions of the Commonwealth/States Housing Agreement 1956 and subsequent agreements. Defence funds were prois estimated vided towards the capital cost. (2) Of the 131 dwellings a number has become surplus to Servicerequirementsand twelve have been approved for reand turn to the Victorian Housing Commission for use by civilians. A further eighteen dwellings are expected to be offered to the Commission very shortly. Of these, nine were vacant at 6 June 1979 and of the remaining 101 dwellings four were vacant at that time. (3) The average length of time the dwellings stated in (2) as vacant have been unoccupied is approximately five months. (4) Serving members of the Defence Force and their families. (5) The normal period of occupancy would be during the member's period of posting in Melbourne area-usuall y two to three years. (6) and (7) See (2) above. (8) No. It would not be practicable to use Service married accommodation temporarily vacant for short periods as emergency accommodation. However, the Services' requirements for housing in the area is under continuing review and if other dwellings become surplus to Defence housing needs they will be offered for return to the Victorian Housing Commission. United States Defence Installations in Australia Mr Howe asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: (1) Is it a fact that the network of 20 American installations in Australia run by the United States of America Defence Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the United States Air Force and Navy includes the largest computer complex in the southern hemisphere and the biggest communications base for the US Navy's submarine strike force. (2) Is it also a fact that the computer complex forms an essential part of the American early warning system and is a link to a satellite that monitors Chinese radio communications, as reported by John Shaw in the Los Angeles Times on 12 December 1978. (3) Does the Harold E. Holt communications station receive 'All out war' signals several times a year; if so, how are these electronic mal-functions treated, particularly by the Australian liaison team. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I refer the honourable member to my answer to Question 1253 (Hansard, 10 October 1978, pages 1658-63) in which I listed the number of defence related joint Australia/US defence facilities as five. The same answer was explicit that there are no 'American facilities' in Australia. Nursing Home Eaglemont Nursing Home (known as Chantee Nursing Home until 14.8.78) Eleanor Nursing Home Elizabeth House Nursing Home Ivanhoe Nursing Home Joycedale Nursing Home Kenilworth Nursing Home Prestonia Nursing Home Rowena Nursing Home The practice of successive Australian Governments concerning speculation and assertion about certain of the joint defence facilities (at Pine Gap and Nurrungar) should be well known to the honourable member. To refresh his memory may I refer him to my statement in the House of 2 June 1977 and to an answer on the same date to a question posed in another place. I do not intend to answer the questions as posed for substantially the same reasons as were stated by Mr Whitlam in a press conference on 3 April 1973, when he said: ' I will not answer questions in Parliament or here or anywhere on security matters. That is a procedure that has been followed by all my predecessors. It is a procedure which I shall follow too. Some of you have mentioned some organisations by name. I will not confirm or deny or correct any such names. The reason is obvious: by asking sufficient number of questions and then getting denials or confirmations or corrections people can find out about the security procedures about this country. I will not answer questions on these matters.' (3) I do not understand what the honourable member means by 'all out war' signals, neither do my technical (Question No. 4243) advisers, nor does the United States Navy whose advice has also been sought. The honourable member's reference to the Australian Liaison team at Harold E. Holt is also obscure. The naval communication station at Harold E. Holt is jointly manned by Royal Australian Navy and United States Navy personnel. Royal Australian Navy manning at the station is for specific operational and management purposes. It does not equate to a liaison team. Nursing Homes (Question No. 4244) Mr Howe asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: (1) How many registered nursing homes were in the Electoral Division of Batman during the years (a) 1976-77, (b) 1977-78 and the period (c) 1 July 1978 to 1 April 1979.

Not all phases of the study were able to be completed as originally intended and only half the grant money was expended. (2) Papers on two aspects of the study are available and I understand that these have been forwarded direct to the honourable member.

305,Mr VINER,ONSLOW,"The answer to the honourable item in member's question is as follows: (1) The National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals ference encompasses a number of programs aimed to ployment and training opportunities for Aboriginals in both the public and private sectors. (2) Yes. The Government has taken steps to ensure that Aboriginals have opportunities to gain employment in the Australian Public Service in accordance with the principle open competition on merit and that opportunities are vided in the Public Service for ment training under the NEAT scheme. (3) The Equal Employment Opportunity Bureau Public Service Board has responsibility tation of the Strategy in the Commonwealth Public Service. The Bureau has a staff of 10. Two Aboriginal officers, a Clerk Class 9 and a Clerk Class S, work full-time on matters cerning Aboriginal employment; they are directed in the Buties reau by a Senior Adviser, Class 11 and an Assistant missioner. Other officers work for part of their time on aspects of the Strategy which ties; in particular Special Placement Officers in the Board's Regional Offices assist with testing Aboriginal applicants and placing Aboriginals in employment and training posSpace itions in departments. (4) The Board conducts a survey of Aboriginals employed in the Commonwealth Public Service at 1 October each year. The latest figures available are those obtained at 1 October 1978 which showed that 1,183 Aboriginals were employed under the Public Service Act. When allowance is made for the transfers during the year of staff associated functions to the Northern Territory a gain of some SO in the number of Aboriginals employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. By comparison, total ployment in the Commonwealth Public Service during the same period declined by 2,613. At the end of April 1979,645 Aboriginals had received, or were receiving, vocational training in the Commonwealth Public Service funded by the National Employment and Training System (NEAT). 466 Aboriginals ing training at that time. (5) (a) Overall figures are number of Aboriginals placed in employment as a result of referredtotothe the Strategy. However, a campaign recently conducted in Dubbo, New South Wales, resulted in 39 Aboriginals being placed in employment in May 1979 which compares to Aboriginals placed in employment through the Commonwealth Employment Service in May 1978. (Question No. 4254) (b) When the Strategy was introduced in May 1977,1,298 trainees were being assisted under the National and Training System. At the end of April 1979 there were 2,837 Aboriginals being assisted under NEAT-a n increase of 1,539 or 118.6 per cent.

310,Mr HUNT,ONSLOW,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) Drugs supplied in public wards and outpatient departments of recognised hospitals are generally not pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions. Recognised hospitals are permitted to obtain drugs on pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions only in cases of emergency, and the cost of the bulk of drugs supplied in hospitals would therefore be included in hospital operating costs and shared between the Commonwealth and State Governments under the hospitals agreements. Data are not collected on an individual prescription basis. (c) Pharmaceutical benefits are supplied to patients through approved chemists on the presentation of a prescription. Data on these prescriptions are set out in (2). (2) For the 1977-78 financial year, the number of NHS pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions was 93,167,000; Total (Question No. 4270) cost, including patient contribution was $361,240,000; Average price per benefit prescription was $3.88. Health Maintenance Organisations (Question No. 4272) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon depanments of notice, on 7 June 1979: What progress is being made with the introduction of health maintenance organisations in Australia.",434
311,Mr HUNT,ONSLOW,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A number of parties are now showing interest in the establishment of health maintenance organisations in different parts of Australia, and discussions have taken place between them and Departmental officers. My Department has prepared and revised guidelines on the operation of prepaid health plans/health maintenance organisations; these guidelines have been widely request. Health Program Grants for Health Services Development Projects have been established to foster such developments. One such grant has been made to the Australian Medical Association (SA Branch) for a feasibility study of the potential of health maintenance organisations in Australia. The changes in health insurance arrangements which will come into operation from I September 1979, with an increasing proportion of health costs being borne by consumers, will increase the incentive for patients to join health maintenance organisations. I am, therefore, hopeful that we will see further progress towards health maintenance organisations being established in Australia. Health Services: Peer Review Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: What progress is being made with the introduction of a Peer Review mechanism for Australia and what type or aspects of health services will be included.",434
312,Mr HUNT,ONSLOW,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Considerable progress has been made. The Australian Medical Association (AMA), which has accepted the leadership role for peer review within the medical profession, announced in May 1978 that it endorsed the concept of introducing systems of peer review. Since that time, the AMA has sought support for the establishment of a Peer Review Resources Centre. I announced on 9 February 1979 a grant of $50,000 to the Centre. In my announcement I outlined the functions of the Centre. To assist the AMA in the in Australia, the Commonwealth Government has already made a special grant of $ 100,000 in total over the three to 30 June 1979. The purpose of this port educational and project work directly associated with quality control and peer review. All major teaching hospitals in Australia are pursuing, in some form, issues related to peer review. However, so far as I am aware, there are, as yet, no hospitals in Australia with fully operational peer review systems, encompassing the essential features of quality assurance, utilisation review and criteria auditing, in all clinical departments. This is hardly surprising, in view of the complexities volved in developing appropriate peer review systems for troduction into each of the 1,130 hospitals in Australia. should also be recognised that, even where peer review activities have been pursued for more than a decade, totally comprehensive systems of peer have not yet been developed. My Department has also been actively encouraging the introduction of peer review by professional organisations. These initiatives are at various stages of development. ever, it is recognised that this difficult to achieve than within hospitals. The Government is determined to assist the medical promake fession in the establishment of peer review mechanisms within and outside the hospital system, and to encourage initiatives in the development and implementation of peer review by professional organisations. To this end, my Department has also made grants in excess of $lm in total tor a range of research and development studies associated with peer review. distributed and are available on Federal Narcotics Bureau (Question No. 4275) Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: (1) What charges relating to drugs have been laid against officers of the Federal Narcotics Bureau, or against exofficers of the Bureau where the charges related to the period of their service with the Bureau, in each year since 1970. (2) What was the specific nature of these charges. (3) What were the levels of the officers involved and in what sections of the Bureau were they employed. (4) What were the outcomes of these charges. (Question No. 4273) Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Only one Narcotics Bureau Officer has been charged with offences relating to drugs since the establishment of the Bureau. On 17 July 1974 the officer was suspended pending a full investigation into his activities. The officer resigned on 19 July 1974.

316,Mr HOWARD,ONSLOW,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Not all the information concerning sources and uses of funds for welfare housing sought by the honourable member is available. Also, as welfare housing arrangements in 1978-79 were made under the 1978 Commonwealth State Housing Agreement, the figures for 1978-79 and for earlier years are in some cases not directly comparable, and, because of different accounting arrangements, estimates for the various States are not comparable in many cases. However, the information which is available, and the fact that under the revised Housing Agreement increased surpluses may be generated from the operation of housing programs and utilised for welfare housing purposes, support the statements made following the June 1978 Premiers' Conference.

Nuclear Power (Question No. 3213) Mr Uren asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 21 February 1979: (1) When and by which Department or statutory authority were estimates of nuclear power capacity in Australia of 0.5 GW in 1988 and 1.0 GW in 1990 which are contained in an OECD Nuclear Energy Agency report entitled Nuclear Fuel Cycle Requirements (February 1978) provided to that Agency. (2) On what basis were those estimates formulated. (3) Is he able to state the Government's intention regarding the development of nuclear power in Australia. (4) What are the most recent estimates of future nuclear power capacity in Australia. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Estimates of nuclear power capacity in Australia of 0.5 GW in 1988 and 1.0 GW in 1990 were provided by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) to the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) in 1975, in response to a questionnaire seeking information for the 1975 joint IAEA/NEA report Uranium Resources. Production and Demand These estimates werereproducedby the NEA in the and 1978 publication Nuclear Fuel Cycle Requirements. Howthe ever, on the basis of later estimates provided to the NEA, 1977 report Uranium Resources, Production and Demand inscientific dicates no nuclear plants likely in Australia for question. (2) Estimates of nuclear power in Australia provided by the AAEC for the 1975 repon on Uranium Resources, Production and Demand took into account the intentions of State electricity generating authorities that time. (3) The Commonwealth Government has no plans to construct a nuclear power reactor for electricity generation Australia. The choice of energy electricity is a matter for the ning for future power needs nuclear power is clearly an option which will be considered. The experiences of other countries are being closely monitored so that the appropriate power supplying authorities will be in a position to reach considered decisions on the nuclear option if and when the need arises. (4) The most recent estimate of primary energy consumpmittee, tion in Australia, prepared by the Commonwealth Governfrom ment, is the Demand for Primary Fuels, Australia, 1976-77 to 1986-87 published by the Depanment of National Develoften opment in 1978, which does not identify nuclear energy as making any contribution during that period.

Nabarlek Uranium Deposit (Question No. 3875) Mr Uren asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 8 May 1979: (1) Has uranium mining, as distinct from mine and mill construction, already commenced at the Queensland Mines' deposit at Nabarlek in the Northern Territory. (2) If not, what is the Queensland Mines'operating schedule for extraction and treatment of ore. (3) Has Queensland Mines decided to complete its mining and treatment of uranium ore at Nabarlek by a date earlier than that outlined in his statement of 7 March 1979. (4) Did he state on the ABC radio program Newsvoice on Wednesday, 2 May 1979, that Queensland Mines was hoping to sell uranium to South Korea. (5) Has there been a re-assessment of Queensland Mines (a) projected output per year and (b) anticipated sales of uranium since 7 March 1979. (6) Has the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies established and commenced its on-going program to monitor the social impact of mining developments on the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers Region. (7) If so, when will the first reports from the program be made available to the Parliament. (8) Have all the legal and administrative requirements, mentioned in his statement of 7 March 1979 as being necessary conditions with which Queensland Mines must comply, been fulfilled; if so, on what dates were these requirements met. (9) What arrangements have been made for transport of the uranium oxide products from Nabarlek. (10) What recommendations regarding transport of yellowcake from Nabarlek were made by the various interested Commonwealth Departments in theirreviewsof the Queensland Mines' draft environmental impact statement. (11) If there are changes to mine and mill construction or mining operations at Nabarlek, when will he make a statement detailing those changes and how they differ from his statement of 7 March 1979.",441
323,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) See(l). (3) I am informed that there has been no change in Queensland Mines' operating schedule since my statement of 7 March 1979. (4) The interviewer on the Newsvoice program indicated that I had stated that signature of the nuclear safeguards agreement with the Republic ofKorea would clear the way for South Korea to begin negotiating contracts with the Ranger consortium and/or Queensland Mines. (5) (a) Not by the Commonwealth Government. (b) Since 7 March 1979 the Directors of Queensland Mines havereportedthat it is the intention of the Shikoku Electric Power Co., Inc. and Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. to sign a Letter of Intent with Queensland Mines to negotiate the purchase of a further substantial quantity of uranium. (6) Yes. (7) I am advised that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs commissioned the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies toreporton the social impact on Aboriginals of mining developments in the Alligator Rivers Region. The Minister is under no statutory obligation to make suchreportsavailable to Parliament. However, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs wishes me to inform the House that it is his intention to make available to the Parliament future half-yearly reports on social impact received from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. He would also make available to the Parliament such other reports on social impact as he may from time to time determine. I understand that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies reserves therightto make public any reports it may prepare and this policy extends to reports prepared by the Institute on social impact in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory. (8) An agreement required pursuant to Section 43 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 between the Northern Land Council and Queensland Mines setting out the terms and conditions for mining at Nabarlek was concluded on 22 March 1979, and a Special Mineral Lease under the Northern Territory Mining Act was granted to Queensland Mines on 23 March 1979 by the Northern Territory Government acting on the advice of the Minister for Trade and Resources. After detailed study of the Queensland Mines' proposals for mining and monitoring by the Supervising Authorities concerned, the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy issued an authorisation for the excavation of the open pit for the Nabarlek Project on 25 May 1979. In carrying out its mining operations Queensland Mines must meet all the conditions of the Special Mineral Lease including the appended Environmental Requirements. (9) The Special Mineral Lease granted to Queensland Mines provides that transportation of yellowcake from Nabarlek shall be undertaken in a manner approved by the Supervising Authority. During the'wet season as defined by the Supervising Authority, transportation of yellowcake from Nabarlek shall not be undertaken by surface transport outside the Project Area and within the Alligator Rivers Region except in a manner and by a route approved by the Supervising Authority. The Supervising Scientist, who is the Supervising Authority for this purpose, has asked Queensland Mines for proposals for the transportation of yellowcake and has also approached the Northern Territory Government about the matter. (10) I am informed that no Commonwealth Depanment, inreviewingthe Nabarlek draft environmental impact statement, made recommendations regarding transport of yellowcake from Nabarlek. The provisions outlined in (9) were imposed by the Government following its examination of the Final Environmental Impact Statement. (11) See(3). Nationality and Employment in the Public Service (Question No. 3907) Dr Cass asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on 9 May the following questions: (1) How do the recommendations of the 1976 Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration (chaired by Dr H. C. Coombs) affect Australian residents from (a) Rhodesia, (b) Italy, (c) Uganda, (d) Greece, (e) Sri Lanka, (f) Yugoslavia, (g) Republic of Ireland, (h) Turkey, (i) Lebanon, (k) United States of America, (1) Hong Kong and (m) New Zealand. (2) When will the recommendations of the Commission be implemented. (3) Do departmental officers working in overseas Recruiting Agencies, Consulates and Embassies in countries that are not members of the Commonwealth inform all migrants from those countries of section 34 of the Public Service Act 1922 and its implications for them. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (I) The recommendations do not affect Australian residents from the countries cited who are Australian citizens. For non-citizenresidentsthe effect of implementing the recommendations would be that persons from the following countries who are not now eligible for permanent appointment to the Australian Public Service would become eligible: Rhodesia, Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Lebanon and United States of America. (2) The recommendations are under consideration by the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service Matters. (3) New settlers would not normally be informed of the provisions of section 34 of the Public Service Act 1922 unless their proposed occupation in Australia indicated an interest in, or the possibility of work with the Public Service, in which case the general provisions would be mentioned as part of the normal counselling associated with work prospects. The Department's overseas information booklets are of a general nature and do not mention the particular conditions of employment applied to the Commonwealth Public Service. Mr Cohen asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 10 May 1979: (1) Is it a fact that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission recently advertised ogist to conduct research into the movement and fate of contaminants released near shore (with respect to siting of nuclear facilities) and in deep ocean waters (with respect to dumping).

Results of the 1976 Census of Population and Housing include information about the incomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at many communities which correspond to individual census collection districts or aggregates of collection districts.

This provision makes the roads eligible for roadworks funding by the State and application will be made by the State to the Commonwealth for the allocation of funds under State Grants (Roads) Act 1977 for road works in the two local authority areas. I would expect that maximum use would be made of the local workforce for any such undertakings. The amendment does not affect the Council's control of access.
