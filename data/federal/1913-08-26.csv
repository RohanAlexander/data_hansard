Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General, recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill. Referred to the Committee of Supply. MB. JUSTICE ISAACS.",12
1,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Las t week the Prime Minister stated that Mr Justice Isaacs,, when Attorney-General, represented South. Australia as against the Commonwealth. To that I replied, "" Not as against the. Commonwealth""; but the Prime M in ister answered, ""Yes."" I ask the honourable member whether he is now pre-, pared to withdraw that statement, which, appears in Hansard, and has been published in the press of the various States, seeing that Mr Justice Isaacs did not represent the South Australian Government, asagainst the Commonwealth.",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I withdraw the statement; my recollection is that I made the correction later in the speech, in which the statement was made. I "" withdraw the statement absolutely. I wish to say, too, that I understand that Mr Justice Isaacs, when Attorney General, did not accept a brief from the . South Australian Government, though hefurnished to that Government an opinion: for which he received payment.",12
3,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether Mr Justice Isaacs furnished an opinion in which the Commonwealth was involved, or against the Commonwealth 1",12
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I really am unable to answer all these questions in detail. The honourable member must give notice. PAIRS.,12
5,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether any member on the Government side who has been ill has been refused a pair by the Opposition ?,12
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not so far as* I am aware. DAY LABOUR.,12
7,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister be good enough to furnish copies of the report on the day labour versus contract system, made by a Royal Commission when he was Postmaster-General of New South Wales? It would be very interesting to honourable members, and I should like each member to have a copy.",13
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far as I remember, the question was not reported on. SMALL - P OX EPIDEMIC .",13
9,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I wish to direct the tion of the Prime Minister or of the M i ister of Trade and Customs to a statement by the Premier of New South ^Vales, which has appeared in the Sydney Mornthe ing Herald. The paragraph containing the statement reads as follows: The Premier (Mr Holman) has advised the City Council that to combat the statements have appeared in some English newspapers concerning the small-pox outbreak cablegrams had been forwarded to Mr Coghlan and the officer in charge of the State's agency in San Francisco, asking them to give wide publicity to the fact that the epidemic is of a very mild type, and that of the 400 cases no deaths have occurred, and no patients have been dangerously ill. Has notice been taken of that statement by the Government, or will notice be taken of it? Is it intended to back up the Premier of New South Wales in the endeavour to remove the stigma which has been cast by this Government on the whole of Australia?",13
10,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am not in a position to answer questions generally, but I may inform the honourable member that some time ago a message was sent by the Commonwealth to the H i gh Commissioner, telling him exactly the nature of the outbreak. That message was somewhat on the lines of the statement to which the honourable member has drawn my attention. GENERAL RETAINERS.",13
11,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In this morning's Age there is published a letter signed by Mr . M . Meagher, of Bathurst, who, discussing the question whether the Attorney General should continue to hold the Marconi Company's general retainer, says The late Sir Charles Russell held a general retainer for the London Times. This paper was publishing a number of articles attacking Parnell and his party. Russell felt that his hands were tied in Parliament, and because of his general retainer he could not deal with such questions as "" Parnellism and Crime"" as freely as he would wish. He wrote to Mr. Soames, the Times solicitor, as follows :Dear Sir,-As the writings in the Times under the title Parnellism and Crime, and in relation to that subject, are now under discussion in Parliament, in which discussion i may be called upon to take part, 1 think you will agree with me that it would be better, at such a juncture, I should not continue to hold the general retainer for the Times. The w o r d "" general "" is used there in a very emphatic sense. I would ask the Attorney-General whether he is disposed at the present juncture to adopt a similar attitude in regard to the Marconi attenCompany to that which was adopted by n - the late Lord Chief Justice of England, and to return his retainer ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have read letter to which the honourable member has directed attention. In regard to the other part of his question I do not propose to give any answer other than that that which I have already given; PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",13
12,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. In last Saturday's issue of the Register and the Advertiser, both of which newspapers are published in Adelaide, I am credited with having made the following statementHe did not believe the present Sydney outbreak was small-pox at all, but the dictum of the Medical Union, which was the closest and narrowest in the world, had to be obeyed. He protested against the Government's action in having quarantined Sydney on account of the damage it had done in this State, and also New South Wales. He also objected to the Commonwealth, through the Naval Board, finding well-paid jobs for half-pay Navy officers in connection with the administration of the Navy Act, as had been done in the case of the lighthouse exprrt. Some honourable members may hold the views which have thus been attributed to me. I wish to say that I expressed no opinion on the quarantining of Sydney, that I did not mention small-pox during the course of my speech, and that I did not criticise the appointment of the lighthouse expert. How I came to be credited with having expressed these views I do not know. PAPERS. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papers: Defence Act-Militar y Forces-Regulation s Amended, &c. (Provisional)-Statutor y Rules 1013, Nos. 227, 228. Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act - Statemen t re Pensions for twelve months ended 30th June, 1913. NA WILLIAM KNOX.",13
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Prime Minister - Parramatta ) [3.12] - Before submitting the motion which I intend to propose in regard to the business of the day I should like to make mention of the death of an old and respected member of this House- I mean the Honourable Willia m Knox, who, for many years, was one of our most highly-esteemed representatives here, and one of the most useful members withal that this chamber has known. He was a man of patriotism and zeal in the public service of the country-on e whose example all may worthily emulate, though few certainly will excel. It seems as if death has laid a heavy toll on the members of this Commonwealth Parliament. One another is to be counted amongst those who have gone hence, and lef t their labours to be carried on by others. We can but acquiesce in these visitations from time to time, and hope that we may do our duty as f a it h full y as he did who has just gone from amongst us. I am quite sure that I voice the feelings of the whole House when I say that we tender our sincerest sympathy to the bereaved ones, and pray that a kind Providence may assuage their grief and soften the blow to them.",14
14,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Wide Bay) [3.15] The Prime Minister quite correctly said that he spoke for the whole House when he expressed sympathy with the widow and family of the late Honourable William Knox, who, both in a private and public capacity-especiall y in his own State - ha s rendered valuable service to the community. The head of the Government also very fittingly referred to the severe toll demanded by Nature of the people's representatives in this Parliament. I have expressed my views on that subject before, and I do not wish to repeat them. Our sympathies go out to the bereaved ones. Nature demands that we must all go hence at some time, and however much we may differ as to the methods which should be followed in carrying on the government of the country we all recognise f a it h f u l service by any honourable member, no matter what political views he may hold. important for us to recollect that every person who enters this Chamber enters it as the choice of a majority of the electors of his constituency. The position which he holds is, therefore, a very honourable one. I join with the Prime Minister in offering our sympathy to .the widow and relatives of the late Honourable William Knox, and in placing on record our recognition of the public services which he rendered.",14
15,Dr MALONEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Melbourne) [3.17] I wish to add a few words to what has already been said by the Prime Minister and my respected leader, because the late Honourable William Knox was the oldest friend I had in politics. It is more than forty years ago when he, one of the handsomest men in Melbourne, took my part as one of the youngest officials in a bank in this city, and thus rendered me a kindness which afterwards cemented into a friendship that was never broken. Later on, I followed the study of another after profession, whilst he remained associated with the bank. Few men have filled as large a position as he has, and though we differed politically, our friendship was never estranged. I wish, therefore, to pay my meed of praise to one who proved himself a true friend and a kindhearted gentleman, especially when I brought the unemployed movement under his notice- a movement which he assisted monetarily and in other ways. I join in the hope which has been expressed, that his bereaved ones may have God's help to enable them to bear their affliction, and, in conclusion, I would say, as every one else here will say, "" God rest his soul."" ORDER OF BUSINESS.",14
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [3.18] - I move That the business on the notice-paper preceding notice of motion No. i be postponed until after consideration of Order of the Day No. 3.,14
17,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Wide Bay) [3.19] I offer no objection to the proposal of the Prime Minister, although I expected that the notice-paper would have been arranged in the order in which the Government intended to proceed with business. I further anticipated that the Treasurer would have extended to honourable members the usual courtesy, by issuing to them copies of the Supply Bill beforehand It is very Sir JOH N FOBBEST - Copie s of the Bill were issued on Saturday.",14
18,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I have not seen a copy. I missed it , and my secretary must have missed it , too.",14
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I was surprised to get it on Saturday.,15
20,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,If the Government had not been too busy electioneering they might have been able to arrange the business-paper in such a way as to permit of Supply being brought on,15
21,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I would point out that the business-paper has been arranged in accordance with the usual practice.,15
22,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Prime Minister can arrange the business-paper in any order that he pleases.,15
23,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Not under our Standing Orders.,15
24,Mr FRAZER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Who does arrange it?,15
25,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am speaking now more particularly of the position when the Address-in-Reply is under consideration, which, understanding order No. 21, must be disposed of before other business, except of a formal character, can be entered upon. There is, further, a no confidence amendment to the Address. Question resolved in the affirmative. SUPPLYBILL (No. 2).

Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That the Standing Orders be suspended in order to enable nil steps to be at once taken to obtain Supply before the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech has been agreed to by the House, and to pass a further Supply Bill through all its stages without delay.",15
26,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Kennedy) [3.22] I enter my protest against the suspension of the Standing Orders- a procedure to which, both in Federal and State politics, I have always objected. To my mind, there, could be no more serious invasion of our parliamentary privileges than is involved by the suspension of the Standing Orders. The Government of the day, whether it be a Labour or a Conservative Administration , Bhould protect to the fullest extent the procedure of the House. A time may come when party feeling is running high, and when the one side or the other, having behind it a strong servile majority, will by this means rule the House in a way that the people do not desire. This is a proposal against which every honourable member in ordinary circumstances should take a stand; but as I understand that on the present occasion the suspension of the Standing Orders is desired in order to obtain Supply, I do not intend to take very strong exception to it . I shall, however, continue to protest, as I have always done, against the suspension ACTS- of the Standing Orders from time to time.",15
27,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Capricornia) [3.24] - I endorse the words that have just fallen from the lips of the honourable member for Kennedy. The motion which the Treasurer would like to move is, I think, PENSIONS : one that was heard in the early history of this House, when an enthusiastic pressman leant over the gallery, and said, "" I move that this House adjourn for forty purple years."" Such a motion COUNTRY would probably suit the Treasurer. I do not propose to offer any objection to the taking of the steps necessary to enable the Public Service to be paid, but I wish to emphasize the point that the present Government have no desire whatever to do any business. If they had they would MILI- speedily get out of the way the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and would push on with the business of AND DUTIES - the country. I learn from today's newspapers that it is proposed to ask for the adjournment of this House at an early date to enable honourable members to entertain our parliamentary visitors from Great Britain . The Government, apparently wanting an excuse for not pushing on the business, intend to avail them? selves of this opportunity to secure an adjournment, on the plea that members of the Commonwealth Parliament should be able to tour the country with their guests, who, by the way, we are most anxious to see enjoy themselves while in the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I do not offer any objection to this motion. The Treasurer today is so very mild and courteous that one really finds it difficult to offer any objection whatever.",15
28,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Werriwa) [3.25] - I wish to express my pleasure that some honourable members have at last learned the lesson that the Standing Orders should not be lightly suspended. I quite agree with what has been said by the honourable member for Kennedy, but regret that when from time to time, during the first five years of the Commonwealth Parliament, I objected to the Standing Orders being suspended I did not receive the support of honourable members now sitting in Opposition. At that time they sat behind another Administration, and gave it their full support. On almost every occasion on which such a motion as this was submitted I pointed out that it was not in accordance with the best parliamentary practice, and should not be encouraged; but I cannot say I ever received the support of a member of the Labour party. In this instance there is some excuse for the action proposed. - Who delayed the last general election so long that a Supply Bill could not be brought forward until the financial year bo! which it related had already been entered upon ? The elections should rightly have been held last March or A p r i l , We should then have been able to meet by the 1st June-befor e the beginning of the present financial year. I do trust that now that we have in power a sound Administration they will correct this ' procedure at the first opportunity, and that we shall at last have the granting of Supply, as it ought to be, within the control of the House. I , therefore, welcome the support of honourable members opposite, who have announced their objection to the suspension of the Standing Orders, and have no doubt that M i nisters will gladly receive it in bringing our procedure in this respect into that full aud proper order from which it ought never to have departed.",16
29,Mr FRAZER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Kalgoorlie) [3.28] - It is obvious that the honourable member for Werriwa is trying to score off the Opposition by urging that the general election should have taken place at an earlier date. The honourable member, who professes to be a student of the Constitution, ought to know that under the Constitution the Senate continues to exist until the 30th June, so that if the general election had taken place in A p r i l , and Parliament had been called together, as the honourable member suggested, early in June, any members of the Senate who had been defeated at the polls would have been able to take part in the passing of the Supply Bill . That is what is advocated by the enthusiastic constitutionalist who has been returned-temporarily , I hope-by the electors of Werriwa.",16
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Poo r fellow!,16
31,Mr FRAZER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do not think that the honourable member is particularly pleased that the honourable member for Werriwa has been returned. The Government has far more docile supporters. The honourable member for Werriwa urges that the late Government were responsible for keeping the House in existence longer than was necessary, with the result that we have now to pass a Supply Bill when we ought to be dealing with the Estimates for the current financial year. He must have forgotten his constitutional knowledge, of which he used to give us the benefit when he was a member of the House on a previous occasion. Apparently, he recognises and approves of the pernicious principle that defeated senators should continue to take part in the legislation of the country.",16
32,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,But the Senate does not deal with Money Bills.,16
33,Mr FRAZER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Her e is another brilliant gem of constitutionalism! Does the honourable member say that the Senate has not to deal with this Bill ? Has the Senate not to pass this Bill ?,16
34,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,If that is the honourable member's reading of the Constitutionwell!,16
35,Mr FRAZER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Would the honourable member recommend the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to make any payment under this Supply Bill simply because it had been passed by this House ?,16
36,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,That is another matter.,16
37,Mr FRAZER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It is another matter in which even the honourable member, in his indiscretion of today, would accept no responsibility. Here was a case where no Government could, under any consideration, be justified in allowing a Senate, composed of some members who might have been rejected by the popular votes of the various States of Australia, to deal with a Supply Bill for the current finanyear; cial year. The argument of the honorto able member was all intended to show that the late Government were interested in making the elections as late as possiblement, for Treasurer's That was not the case. Recognising the is constitutional position, the Government wished to meet Parliament with the new Senate. Supply had been granted only t ill the end of June; and as soon as result of the elections was known, the late Government resigned in order that the present Government should be free from embarrassment and able to call together early in the financial year. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee of Supply:",16
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.32] - I move That a sum not exceeding Nine hundred sixty-four thousand five hundred and ninety-six pounds be granted to His Majesty for or wards defraying the services of the year ending 30th June, 1914. I regret to have to ask again for Supply before the Estimates-in-Chief are on the table, but the position has been unavoidThis able for one reason and another. I hope, however, that it will not be long before year. I shall be able to announce the date when the Estimates will be laid before the House. Honourable members will notice that the Supply asked for is for one month. The Bill provides for the ordiB ill . nary votes £694,596, for refunds it provides £20,000, and for the Treasurer's Advance £250,000.",17
39,Mr FRAZER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The sum of £250,000 a Treasurer's Advance for a month?",17
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Yes . The reviews funds are required to pay cable receipts, which come to the Government in the first instance, and have to be paid to the ern Extension Telegraph Company and the Pacific Cable Board, and also for age on postal notes, and the repaywill be adjusted. ment of money paid into the revenue i i i error. As to the Treasurer's Advance, honourable members are aware that the first Supply Bill provided for £400,000, and I now ask for £250,000 more. is no doubt a large amount, but the son is that until we have an appropriathen tion for works and buildings the numerfor, ous works throughout the Commonwealth have to be paid for out of this Advance. All these works, I may say, have authorized by Parliament, but they were not completed by the end of the financial and the course followed in regard them is the course taken in previous years. I may point out that, although £650,000 may be approved by ParliaAdvance, it not intended that more than £500,000 shall be voted under this head when the Estimates for the whole of the financial year are before the House. As I the say, the course now taken is exactly the same, I believe, as that taken last year.",17
41,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The late Government did not. ask for so much, yet the present TreaParliament surer always grumbled.",17
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am speaking from memory, but I think the late Government asked for as much as we are asking for. As soon as we have an appro- priation for works and buildings, the money now voted to the Treasurer's A d and vance will be debited to that appropriation, and the Treasurer's Advance will be torelieved of nearly the whole of the liability. This is merely a temporary measure to enable us to pay for works and buildings from the beginning of the financial year until we have an appropriation. Supply Bill , like the last one, is based on the Estimates of the previous The only increases of salaries which will be paid under it are the ordinary statutory increments, due to officers whose salaries do not exceed £ 1 8 0 a year. There is nothing novel or unusual in the",17
43,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Wide Bay) [3.37] The Treasurer, of course, needs money to meet the obligations of the Commonfor wealth, and it is the business of Parliament to pass this measure, whatever our may otherwise be as to the administration. It is very interesting to hear the Treasurer deprecating any criticism Eastin relation to the amount for the Treasurer's Advance, and suggesting that it postis not much, and that later on the matter",17
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,We are doing the same as did the late Government.,17
45,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"We are now hearing a very different tale from that which This the Treasurer and the Prime Minister reaused to tell when in Opposition. They asked what the money was required and used language sufficient to suggest to the people outside that it was not necessary, and might be misused. In the been case of the late Government the amount first asked for in a Supply Bill for a Treasurer's Advance was £150,000, whereas the present Treasurer is asking for £400,000 to begin with .",17
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The late Government asked for £200,000.",18
47,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"In the succeeding Supply Bill we asked for £200,000, whereas the right honourable gentleman is asking for £250,000.",18
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,There other Supply Bill .,18
49,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"There must be as many Supply Bills as are necessary u n t i l the Budget is introduced and the Appropriation Act passed. This Government, however, we are told, have come into power to economize and put the finances r i g h t ; and yet we find them asking, not for £350,000 in the first two temporary Supply Bills, but £650,000.",18
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The late Government had a great deal last year under this head-£645,00 0 altogether.",18
51,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Not at all. The first two Supply Bills provided £150,000 and £200,000 respectively for Treasurer's Advance.",18
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Did that include refunds ?,18
53,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The refunds would not make any difference, so far as Treasurer's Advance was concerned. the honourable member say that his amount is not in addition to the refunds'",18
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Yes .,18
55,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Then it is £250,000, plus £20,000. Sir JOHN .FORREST - How you have ?",18
56,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"We had £150,000 and £200,000.",18
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,We are later in the year.,18
58,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"But the honourable member is only asking for Supply for one month. Our highest for one month, was £200,000; but honourable members, in addition to getting £400,000 in the last Supply Bill , are now asking for £250,000 more. I am not questioning the utilit y or necessity of this amount of money being granted, but I am dealing with it from the attitude the honourable member assumed when he was in Opposition.",18
59,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I do not thin k I was very severe.,18
60,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do not complain of the way in which the Treasurer has made his temporary financial statement in asking for Supply; but, in view of the remarks made so prominently in the country concerning the state of the Treasury,, it is time we asked the Government or the Treasurer to make a statement regarding the finances generally. It is difficult to interrupt a discussion such as is going on in the House to deal with it was an- now, and I shall not attempt it ; but it is incumbent on the Government to make good the statement they made throughout the country regarding the state of the finances. It was about the fifteenth time of interrogation before we were able to get the Prime Minister to admit the actual facts of the case. It was only about a week ago that he admitted there was a net cash surplus of about £2,500,000 in the Treasury.",18
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,You are saying what is absolutely incorrect.,18
62,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It is only quite lately that the Prime Minister admitted it ; but. there were many statements published and reprinted in the country press, where, I believe, they were intended to do good service, claiming that there was. an actual deficit; and it was only the; other day that the Prime Minister admitted that when the present Government, came into office there was a net cash Does balance of £2,474,323, plus a net cash balance of £291,025 in the Australian. Notes Trust Account. That is to say,, there was a surplus of £2,765,348 in the> hands of the Treasurer.",18
63,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Then he ought much did to have plenty of money to spend on telephones.,18
64,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The outgoing Government were the first Government to leave a surplus of that extent in any part of Australia; but so far from using thesefinancial resources to placate supporters and spend money heavily, we conserved the public finances and safeguarded the public interest as f ar as practicable, with the result that, though State Governments are financially embarrassed, the Commonwealth is today in a very happy position financially. We can search in vain for records of Liberal Governments going out of office leaving a state of affairs like that. It is no part of our duty to extol our own administrative virtues, but it isjust to those who were associated with the Labour party that the absolute facts should be made known. The Treasurerknows that I am stating facts. I would: remind him again of the manner in which he issued his first financial statement at the opening of the session. He put down the actual amount of credit balance for the last financial year as so much, and said that the balance brought over from other years was so much, hiding as far as he could the actual aggregate money accumulated in the time the previous Government were in office.",18
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I do not thin k did that.,19
66,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The facts were all there, but they were hidden as well the right honourable gentleman could hide them, which was not at all in keeping with the standing of the right honourable no manipulation. gentleman as Treasurer of his own State, or as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I hope the Prime Minister and members of the Government will take this opporthere t u n it y to make good their statements, which the people of Australia were slandered, in regard to electoral matters.",19

68,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It deals with the Oldham sayshonour of the people of Australia. Either the people of Australia are honest or dis31st honest. The honourable member said they did not vote honestly.,19

75,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,And so they do.,19
76,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The presumption is that all this has been done by the supporters of those on the Opposition benches.,19

78,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The inference clearly was that the manipulation was by the as previous Government, but the report of the Chief Electoral Officer shows that, so far as he can find out, there has been The Prime Minister and others have referred to an official statement by the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, to the effect that is a greater number of names on in the electoral roll than of people of voting age in the Commonwealth. The report by Mr Oldham practically nullifies to any charge which may be involved in that statement by Mr Knibbs.

95,Mr SAMPSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I did not make any Far be such statement.,20
96,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The honourable member has made two distinctly different statedifments. The Government will have to disam charge their public duty regarding the When allegations of corruption on the part of electors of Australia. I repeat what to I said when the charge was first made. I conknow the people of Australia, and I know I also some of the other peoples of the world, and I express my opinion that in connection with the elections, more honest and straightforward than are those of any other country in the world. That is a big thing to say of them. I not say that in Australia we are entirely free from those who will , perhaps, take advantage of the rights and privi leges they enjoy, but I do say that the number of such people in Australia is smaller than in other countries, and they are not confined to any one political honourable party. Honourable members opposite, fact whom I congratulate upon having the knowpress largely on their side, have in fluenced the newspapers to create an atmosphere that induces many honest peopleto believe the thing which is not. It is< that, not to their credit that they have done so. Let me turn now to the question connected with the sugar industry. What, such would have been said of a Labour Goi f they had done something bewrong, without knowing it was wrong, ata time when Parliament was in session, and it was possible to right the wrong? That aspect of the matter has never yet been dealt with by the Government. This Parliament met July, and it was late same month before the proclamation to which reference has been made was issued. Ministers were roaming about the country. They obtained an adjournment to enable them to look into matters. sumed that they were looking into all matters; but they missed the most important. They had time to go about accusing the people of corruption, but no time to look into essentials and to protect the revenue of the country. whine that what occurred was due to the oversight of the previous Government. This Government was in office for a month before the proclamation in regard to the repealing Acts was issued. They had at their disposal officers who knew everything about the business.",20
97,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Somebody has lost the country £120,000 .",21
98,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If so, the loss has been caused by this Government. They have never yet told us whether they were in consultation with the experts of the Department before they issued the proclamation.",21
99,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Sugar Company had to tell them that they had lost the money. Mr F l SHER - That is not the point with which I am dealing now. their duty to ask the responsible officers of the Department how the matter stood. If the whole of the sugar made from Australian products in 1911-12 had been placed on the market, there would have been no surplus Australian sugar in bond after A p r i l of this year, because last season was a short one, and the consumption of sugar was largely in excess of the quantity produced in Australia.",21
100,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Does the honourable member mean that the Government never consulted the officials of the Customs Department?,21
101,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"They have not told us whether they did or not. tainly ought to have done. that if the honourable member for Eden Monaro had been at the head of the Department he would have ascertained, before he issued the proclamation, whether there was Australian-made sugar in bond",21
102,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Government say they do not know.,21
103,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Customs officers know every pound of Australian-made early in sugar that is in bond at any particular in the date. Therefore, the Government could have been in possesion of the information. There would have been no loss to the sugar industry if the Minister had taken the right course. The bounty could We pre- have been paid in the meantime, and the sugar-growers protected, whilst a short Act of Parliament could have been antedated to deal with all the sugar produced from this year's crop. It was as simple as ABC if the matter had been looked Now they into properly. It has been suggested by the Minister of Trade and Customs that I said that I would issue the proclamation when Mr Denham, the Premier of Queensland, carried out his agreement with the Federal Government. Certainly; but that applied entirely to the new year's crop. As regards the future, two things were possible. One was to equalize the bounty and the Excise, and the other was to enter into an agreement with the Government of Queensland to abolish the bounty and Excise on certain conditions. Mr Denham preferred the latter course, and it was carried out. I have always held the view-and I am sorry the sugar producers did not agree-that the true remedy was to equalize the bounty and Excise. By that means I believe the sugar-grower, who is the person to be It was protected primarily, would have been properly protected. But the other course was adopted.",21
104,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member means that he was in favour of equalizing the bounty and Excise and retaining them both ?,21
105,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Of course.,21
106,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Why did not the honourable member do that?,21
107,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Because the other course was preferred, and I would not insist on my view being carried out against the view presented to me by those immediately concerned as the deThey cer- sirable one. But I am not sure that if I am sure the same parties were compelled to meet the situation again they would not take the opposite course. That, however, is another point. In large affairs like this, where one has to depend on the good f a it h and good will of people, one has to deal with circumstances as they arise. My last point on the matter is this: I regret that this industry has been divorced from Federal control. I believe that the dual control will be mischievous, though I do not believe, as some do, that it will be disastrous.",21
108,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member is responsible for the dual control.,22
109,The CHAIRMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member's time has expired.,22

111,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Wide Bay) [ 4 . 8 ] am entitled to a second period during this debate, and should like to take the opportunity now of finishing what I have to say on the sugar question, since the right honourable gentleman has been good enough to resume his seat to give me that opportunity. I have said that regret that the industry under the control of two Parliaments. The sugar industry in Australia can only exist by the good will of the Federal Parliament and the people of Australia. Without full and ample protection at the seaboard it cannot survive.",22
112,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The industry has a 50 per cent, duty now.",22
113,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Some industries have even more, and they are not primary in dustries, nor are they tropical industries. They have a hope of existing without protection, but the sugar in dustry has no such hope. It has to meet competition from two sides-fro m Hawaii and from F i j i and Java, which are natural places for sugar production in the tropics, and where white labour is not employed. The Australian Parliament is determined that the industry shall be carried on by white labour. Thirteen years ago it was difficult to make people in the southern parts of Australia believe that it was possible to produce sugar by white labour. The denunciations that came from the press, and those in terested, were all in the direction that it meant a disaster to the industry, and failure to those who had put their money into it . We on this side were the one party that stood solid, and predicted that the industry would succeed under reasonable Protection, with white labour conditions. The Government of the day-tii e Barton Government-brough t in the present Tariff with the addition of the bounty and the Excise, differentiating between white and coloured grown cane. By the economic operation of that legislation, without any coercion at all except the repatriation of the Polynesians, the industry has prospered as a white labour industry. It has settled about 700 miles of the north-east coast line of Australia in a way which could not have been done under other circumstances. Twenty years ago one could not persuade people even in Queensland that sugar could be successf u l l y grown with white labour north of Mackay. To-day, they all admit that it - I is practicable to do so in nearly every part of Australia. There is another point in this matter that I wish to deal with ; then I will be finished. We have heard a great deal about the powers of this Parliament under the Constitution. We have also heard a great deal about the I great American Republic, and how its is now people are going to remedy their troubles with regard to trusts, combines, and monopolies. How does the President of the United States intend to act? He proposes to deal with the sugar question in ihe way that some honourable members opposite proposed to adopt here, and that was to wipe out the duty, and have free competition. In America, sugar-growers have coloured labour, and yet those in terested there say that by the act of the Senate in passing a measure to wipe out the duty by degrees, they would destroy the industry. How is it possible in a country like Australia, where there is a determination to provide that every white man who is engaged in a productive in dustry shall get fair wages and have reasonable conditions, the sugar industry could compete against open ports? The suggestion is impossible. Whatever our opinions may be on this question, they will have to be put to the test. Australian people, I believe, are ready and willing to pay more for sugar to enable the industry to continue. I believe that the Protection at the seaboard will be sufficient to allow fair and reasonable conditions to the workers, and fair and reasonable returns to the growers and the investors.",22
114,Sir JOH NFOEBEST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Will they be able to grow for export?,22
115,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"In my opinion, under present conditions, unless the growers get machinery that will enable the white worker to greatly excel the coloured worker in the field, it is not practicable for the industry to grow and export sugar at a profit.",22
116,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,They grow about only half enough for ourselves.,23
117,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I believe that under fair conditions the industry will produce enough sugar for Australian requirements.,23
118,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The growers have not done so this year.,23
119,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"They have a fair ret u r n this year. The question is not whether they can produce enough sugar for Australia, but whether they can produce enough sugar to export. opinion, it will not be economically possible for them to produce sugar and sell it overseas. Therefore, it lies with the Australan people to say what Protection shall be given to the industry. Certainly the Protection should be sufficient to give each party a fair return. In my opinion it would not help the producer if the Protection were such as to make the production in excess of the requirements of Australia. These requirements will grow with the population, and it will be a very large and important industry which will supply them. Whatever the Protection is, I believe that the majority of the people of Australia will demand that it shall be given rather than - that we should lose the industry. reply, not only in regard to the sugar industry, but in regard to every other. If an industry is essential, then the Protection must be adequate. I do not wish to trespass further on the time of the Committee. I should not, perhaps, have enlarged so much on this question had it not been for the kindly interjections of the Prime Minister, but I am glad that the Ministry, now that they have had time to reflect, admit cheerfully, as they are bound to do on the facts, that not only were the finances of the country caref u l l y conserved by their predecessors",23
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,We do not anything of the kind.,23
121,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"My honourable friends have got into a kind of political torpor that is helping them along their way, and making them a little more serene than otherwise they would have been.",23
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Do not believe that for a minute.,23
123,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"In the statement of policy made by the Prime Minister we see no reference to the sugar industry, although he knew all about the circumstances which subsequently transpired. Will any honourable member say that such conduct was straightforward? Why did not the Government straightforwardly embody a reference in the statement of policy? They set themselves up as patterns for others to follow.",23
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,No . You do that.,23
125,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"There is not a single hint in the Ministerial statement, important as it is, that anything was wrong with the sugar industry. These are the guides and counsellors of this nation I They find themselves in a difficulty. In In my stead of telling the public of the difficulty when they had an opportunity, they refrained. Why ? They thought that they would be able to get out of the trouble without the knowledge of the public. No other reason for their silence can be given. The matter was important enough to justify a statement. H ad it borne against the Labour party, we can rest assured that it would not have been forgotten.

They must wonder if they are really in an assemblage of men who are supposed , to be moulding; the destinies of this great Commonwealth, because they have heard nothing but abuse and misrepresentation from start to finish. The Leader of the Opposition, even on the Supply Bill , could not refrain from abusing this side of the House. He said that we are the slanderers of the people of Australia. Simply admit because, owing to persistent reports in the press, it appeared that great abuses of the Electoral Act had been indulged in , and this side of the House took steps to see whether that was the case, we are called the slanderers of Australia. The party on the other side have given, I suppose, as great an insult to a respectable community in Australia as has ever been given to any section of a community in the world, and that is to the landowners.

They are men who have subject. risen from the ranks for the most part. Because they possess energy, brains, and intelligence, they are told that they not fitted to occupy positions under electoral law.

In conversation with me he has spoken of the unfairness of such comment. Speaking of this particular land, he said, "" When purchased it was absolutely a barren waste, overgrown with scrub and overrun with rabbits. It had not a drop of water on it . I am having erected on it 70 miles of wire-netting fence; I am having two artesian bores put down at a cost of £3,000 each, and I am employing t h i r t y men on it in digging out the rabbits."" That man deserves credit for what he is doing. He is making waste land available for settlement later on. What poor man could touch such land? No one can take up country of that kind unless he has a large amount of capital at his command, and is prepared to spend it. Y e t the men who have capital, and use it in making valueless country useful, are abused by the members of the Labour party.

144,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Capricornia) [4.31] - It is not my intention to attempt to reply to the choleric outburst of the honourable and gallant Colonel. I will deal rather with the action of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in regard to the repeal of the Sugar Bounty and Sugar Excise Acts. Later on, I may have a few words to say upon electoral matters. The Prime Minister stated the other evening that he did not promise to repeal the sugar bounty and sugar Excise legislation unconditionally. Of course, one may be excused for doubting the honourable gentleman, because he appears to make so many statements, and to forget all about them, that a denial on his part is quite a frequent occurrence. But I would remind honourable members that about a fortnight prior to the declaration of the poll at the recent general elections there appeared in the Brisbane Courier the followingEXCISE AND BOUNTY. ABOLITION PROMISED BY LIBERAL PARTY. Information has been received by the Australian Sugar Producers' Association, through the Liberal Senatorial candidates, Messrs. Chataway, R. J. Sayers, and A. G. St. Ledger, from the Honourable J. Cook, leader of the Party, that if the Liberals are returned to power at the coming general elections proclamations will be at once issued abolishing Excise and Bounty on sugar unconditionally. (Signed) ARTHUR E. 240 Queen-street, Brisbane. That statement appeared in the Brisbane Courier of 13th May, 1913, and was not contradicted by anybody. No doubt, it was used in the interests of the Liberal candidates there.",25
145,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It was.,25
146,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If the Government acted up to that promise, we can understand the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs in proclaiming the repeal of the sugar bounty and Excise legislation without making due inquiry as to the quantity of sugar which was in bond at the time. Nobody in a deliberate assembly ever appeared more uncomfortable than the Minister did on the day that the honourable member for Yarra revealed his action in allowing the stocks of sugar in bond to be released without first having paid Excise. It is all very well for the Government and their supporters to say that it was the duty of the late Administration to have inserted in the Sugar Excise Repeal Act a provision to remind the) Minister of Trade and Customs that duty must be paid upon the sugar which was in bond at the time of the proclamation of that Act. By doing so they would have made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of Australia. It would have been necessary for them to have inserted a section which would have read somewhat as follows- "" Whereas it is probable that this Government will vacate the Treasury benches on the 31st May, and that a Liberal Government will take its place, it is hereby expressly declared that all sugar in bond upon the proclamation of the Sugar Excise Repeal Act shall pay Excise."" We have to recollect, too, that this is the Ministry of all the talents. It includes the Attorney-General, an eminent lawyer, who seems to have taken a very great interest in his work. The moment he was sworn in, he rushed away to introduce quite a new feature into our electoral administration. He at once instituted a search with a view to ascertaining all the information that he could regarding the electoral administration of the honourable member for Darwin. Where was he when the repeal of this T. D . sugar legislation was proclaimed ? And where was the Treasurer, who is so anxious about the funds of the Commonwealth, that he did not keep an eye upon the Excise due upon the sugar in bond ? Surely these MinLAVIS. isters were not foraging amongst the dust-bins to see what they could find to the detriment of the late Ministry! They had important public duties to perform, and one of them was to see that the millers and others interested in this sugar paid duty upon it . The Minister of Trade and Customs must know-and , indeed, anybody who takes an interest in Customs matters knows-that people like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are perfect artists in. their endeavours to pay as little duty as possible. Any person whose trade renders it necessary for him to pay duty is always watching the Tariff, and always making preparations to avoid paying Customs duty. Without doubt, some of those interested in sugar were awaiting the time when they could release the stocks which were in bond without paying Excise upon them. The Government seem to have been reminded by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, on Mr Knox's own showing, that they had made a mistake. I can well understand that that company, out of gratitude for the defeat of the referenda proposals, and the return of the Liberal Government to power, would be inclined to be magnanimous. Mr Knox stated at a meeting the other day that on the 25th July, the date of the repeal of the Sugar Bounty and Sugar Excise Acts, he informed the Government of their mistake.",25
147,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,A few days afterwards.,26
148,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I had better be quite accurate. The extract readsCOLONIAL SUGAR COMPANY'S No ADVANTAGE EXPECTED. Sydney, Wednesday - At a meeting of the shareholders of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. L t d ., the chairman (Mr Kater, M.L.C.) made the following allusion to the discussion about Excise duty on sugar in the House of Representatives :- "" When we obtained a copy of a proclamation issued on this subject, it was evident to us that unless some further action was taken all the sugar produced this season before 25th July would be freed from duty, although the bounty was payable on the cane from which it was made, and the revenue would thus have to suffer. Accordingly, we gave at once to the Customs all the particulars we possessed as to the quantity of sugar in which we were concerned that would be covered by the proclamation, and pointed out that whatever steps might be taken to protect the revenue, the growers who had made early deliveries of cane should receive the same advantage in respect thereto as those whose crops were 25th July. These representations were made by us three weeks ago, and since then the Comptroller has on several occasions seen our Melbourne manager about the position."" I join with the Leader of the Opposition in emphasizing the point that, though the Government knew this three weeks ago, nothing was said about their proposed legislation in the statement .which was thrown on the table of the House by the Prime Minister without any explanation whatever. Was it that they wished to hush the matter up ? Did they expect the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's example to be followed by the other millers; and if the whole of the Excise due upon the sugar in bond had been collected, would nothing have been said about the matter ? The Minister of Trade and Customs stated on the night that he endeavoured to reply to the honourable member for YarraHonorable members opposite will find that the people they are complaining of are more Liberal than he gives them credit for. But they are not all as liberal as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It must be admitted that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a very powerful corporation, and that it has gained a great deal by the defeat of the referenda. One of the principal stockbroking firms in Australia-that of Messrs. Palmer and Son-state d that if the referenda were defeated the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's shares would go up. That prophecy has been fulfilled, shares in the company having increased in price by some £ 3 or £A each. It has been made possible for the company to bleed the people to a greater extent than they would have been able to POSITION. do if our referenda proposals had been carried. The company is, apparently, grateful, an'd intends to return this money, which ought to have been collected by the Minister of Trade and Customs and his officers.",26
149,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,But will it return the money ?,26
150,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Yes , it has promised to do so. There are, however, others who have declined to pay. A meeting of the farmers and millers of Mackay was held about 15th August last-jus t about the time when the Minister said he was sending away telegrams to see if the matter could not be arranged - in other words, to see if his mistake could not be rectified quietly before the honourable cut after member for Yarra had spoken.",26
151,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I think that the Minister said that he had sent away telegrams that morning.,26
152,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"He said that before the House met that day he sent the telegrams. This meeting of the farmers and millers of Mackay discussed the question, and, according to a report before meThe millers contend that the Government is in a difficulty through having paid bounty on cane sugar which paid no Excise, owing to not having gone into consumption, and wants to shelve the liability on the millers. A motion was proposed that the Federal Government should be asked to refund.to the refineries all the collected on this season's sugar up to July 25th, the date of the abolition, and that the should be asked to pay the equivalent to the millers, in which case the millers would pay the growers gs. 2d., except where the growers have already received the bounty from the Government, in which case 7s. would be refunded - to the Government. The motion was not carried, some of the millers stating that they would not support the proposal, which would mean a loss to their companies of several thousands of pounds. The following amendment carried - "" That the Federal Government be asked to arrange the matter with the refineries."" To return to the point that this matter should have been attended to by the late Government, and that there should have been inserted in the Sugar Excise Bill a clause providing for the collection of duty on the sugar, I hold the opinion that the whole thing would have been arranged by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra. He would naturally, as any intelligent and active Minister of Trade and Customs would have done- I am not suggesting that the present Minister is not intelligent, but I do say that he was neglectful.",27
153,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,He was busy looking after us.,27
154,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I suppose that his assistance was being sought by the Attorney-General and other members of the Government in their efforts to find out something against the late Ministry, whilst they neglected their important public duties. In all probability the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, knowing the habits and customs of those who deal with the Department, would have said to those interested, "" The Queensland Government having passed certain legislation, we now propose, on a certain date, to proclaim the Acts repealing the sugar bounty and Excise legislation. Will you clear all your sugar up to 12 o'clock midnight on the day preceding that date?"" Naturally the refiners and all others interested in the repeal of that legislation would have said, "" Certainly, we shall do so,"" and that is all that would have been necessary. The Government could have said to these people, "" Unless you clear your sugar up to the date named we shall have to suspend for a perioduntil you come to your senses-the issue of the proclamations with regard to the repealing bounty and Excise legislation."" There is yet another point to be considered. I venture to say that the ex-Prime Minister and the ex-Minister Excise of Trade and Customs would not have issued the proclamation without first askrefineries ing from the Queensland Government something more in regard to the promise made by Mr Denham. It will be remembered that the honourable member for Wide Bay, when Prime Minister, addressed to the Premier of Queensland a telegram stating that the Government of the Commonwealth would abolish the was sugar bounty and Excise legislation if the States concerned would pass an Act(a) to confer upon the Commonwealth Parliament the power to legislate in respect of the employment of coloured labour and regulation of wages and conditions of labour,- or (*) to abolish coloured labour in the industry and establish tribunals for the regulation of rates of wages and conditions of labour. Mr Denham, it will be remembered, said that he preferred the proposal contained in paragraph (6), providing for the abolition of coloured labour in the industry. But have the Queensland Government abolished coloured labour? No. They have passed three measures dealing with this question, and one of these will interest the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, as well as the honourable member for Gippsland and others who have said that it is impossible for a Parliament to regulate wages. The Act is cited as "" The Sugar Growers Employes Act of 1913,"" and contains a schedule declaring that the weekly rates of wages for forty-eight working hours shall be, in the case of adults-withou t keep, £2 8s.; with keep, £ 1 16s. Youths (sixteen to eighteen), £ 1 4s., and so on. This is an attempt, and a successful attempt, apparently, to fix rates of wages. It is not the first time that a Parliament has fixed the wages to be paid in an industry. This Parliament, as well as the Parliaments of the States, has fixed the rates of wages payable to barristers. It has done so, if not directly, at least indirectly.",27
155,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,And on a very liberal scale.,27
156,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Quite so. the power of a Parliament to decide that a solicitor may charge 6s. 8d. for giving a little advice, and 3s. 4d. for reading a letter, it should be an easy matter for a Parliament to decide what are fair rates of wages to be paid in certain in dustries. The Queensland Parliament passed the measure I have named, fixing the rates of wages to be paid in the sugar industry u n t i l such time as they should be altered by an award made under the State Industrial Peace Act . Act, the Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913, was passed providing what persons may be employed in the sugar industry. Cert a in persons are prohibited from growing cane, and certain others are not to be employed, but there is not a single word in the Act which complies with the request of the ex-Prime Minister that Japanese, Chinese, and Hindoos shall be excluded. The Act lays it down that unless a man can pass a dictation test of about fifty words, he is not to get a certificate; but administration depends very largely on a Government which was in favour of the. employment of coloured labour in the in dustry.",28
157,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Is that not same test as for admission into Australia,28
158,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"That has nothing to with the request of the ex-Prime Minister Affairs. to Mr Denham, which was that coloured labour should be kept out of the industry. According to a telegram that. I received the other day, coloured labour is certainly not being excluded from the industry in the Bundaberg district, because, at Pemotherwise berfcon, six coloured men are employed there as carriers, and between twenty and t h i r t y other Asiatics are scattered the district. In all probability, there are more Asiatics employed further north belongs than in the Bundaberg district. The hon the orable member for Yarra, when Minister of Trade and Customs, before proclaiming the repeal of the Acts, would have asked the Queensland Government what had mental been done to carry out the promise by Mr Denham; and that request would have been altogether apart from the atinstrumental tention that the ex-Minister would have given to the quantity of sugar which was in bond at the time, and which would escape duty if the proclamation went the forth before the duty was collected. notice that an attempt has been made the supporters of the Government to the blame on the Labour Government and members. If it is in party for not introducing a certain clause into the sugar legislation j but that cannot save the present Government from the charge of blundering. The attempt to fasten the term "" in c a p a c it y "" on the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs will not shield the present Minister from the great blunder he committed in allowing the loss of revenue, variously estimated from £150,000 upwards.",28
159,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Government admit that they do not know, how much the Another loss is.",28
160,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I think it could be ascertained.,28
161,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Government may not have any great difficulty in finding out the amount of duty which ought to be paid, but there will be great difficulty-if they succeed, as I suppose they may, in passing retrospective legislation-in ascertaining how much was grown by white labour, and how much by black-ho w much sugar ought to escape the bounty. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs may get out of his difficulty^ but he will certainly have some trouble if the millers refuse, as they apparently are refusing, to consent to the refiners paying the Excise that is due on the sugar. I the shall avail myself of another opportunity ? to deal with the statements of the Treado surer regarding' the Department of Home",28
162,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Werriwa) [4.55] - I was much surprised to hear the Leader of the Opposition claim the production of sugar as a primary industry, which it is the duty of this Parliament to encourage; I do not understand the action of the honourable member for Capricornia. If the history of the sugar industry, as reover lated to us to-night, shows anything at all, it is that, whatever class of industry it to, it is not a primary industry in sense that it is able to depend on it self. Furthermore, what we have heard shows that the action of the Labour party in this Parliament has been very detrito the interests of Australia as * made whole. The Leader of the Opposition says that years ago the Labour party were in introducing this legislation. I , for one, take pride in the fact that, along with others-and notably the honourable member for Angas- I opposed legislation; and it would be very in I structive to compare the prophecies then by made by honourable members opposite put with the prophecies made by honourable on this side. A f t e r nearly eleven years we find that this industry has cost the Commonwealth over £14,000,000, while the total production, in addition to what it has cost the owners of the sugar lands, has been only £11,000,000. Manifestly, there has been a loss of nearly £4,000,000 of money, but, as some of this has gone into the Treasury, and has been expended for general purposes, we may take it that the cost to the community, in order to keep going a business that is not suitable to Australia, has been £10,000,000. In fact, the more we go into the matter the more we realise that this is what might be termed a blacklabour industry.",28
163,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"What , sugar industry?",29
164,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Yes .,29
165,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Nonsense !,29
166,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Thin k what a different result there might have been had this £10,000,000 been used in a different way-if it had been lent to young men willing to start wheat production on the share system. For each of such young men, £300 would have been quite sufficient, and we know that every sugar producer is costing a great deal more. On the average, those to whom this money could have been advanced would' have been able to repay it in about three years. In the first three years, with an advance of £1,000,000 , employment would have been given to 10,000 men in share-farming, and those men would have become the backbone of the country. In the second three, with the advance of another £1,000,000, and re-lending out of the first million, employment would have been given to 20,000 more, and in the third three years to 40,000 more.",29
167,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Wit h whom would they have shared ?,29
168,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It does not matter with whom they would have shared; they would have probably shared with themselves or with their fathers; at any rate, they would have had capital to start on their own account.",29
169,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Shoul d we finance the squatters on half-share terms?,29
170,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It is not proposed to finance a single squatter, but to finance the sons of farmers, who are directly concerned in the primary industries. Under such a plan as I have indicated, we should, at the end of ten years, have given employment to 70,000 farmers, who would have been returning the money advanced, and not costing the country a penny. The money would then have been available to advance to others.",29
171,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It is like a community making a living by taking in each other's washing.,29
172,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Such producers would have had to sell their products in the markets of the world against the competition of the world. Theirs is a real primary industry; and if it were not for the primary industries no secondary in dustry could exist.,29
173,Mr SAMPSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The same argument would apply to any other industry.,29
174,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It must be an industhe try that has been built up in the same way. My point is that another class of men would have been put on that land. By granting them assistance in the same manner in which we have built up the sugar industry, and at practically the same cost, we could have placed 70,000 young farmers on the land working on shares, who would all be of great benefit to the countryj earning something for themselves over and above the cost of production.",29
175,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Does the honourable member say that they could grow wheat on the sugar country?,29
176,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am talking about the sugar industry passing out. Take poultry and eggs; they return three and three quarter millions, nearly three times the value of the sugar production. The average area under sugar is 140,000 acres, and we contribute £ 7 per acre to keep that land under cultivation, though I have been told this land is the richest land in Australia, or, some say, in the world. If we have to contribute £ 7 per acre to keep rich land in cultivation, then the more rich land we have the worse off we are. We ask the man on poor land to contribute to the owner of the rich land. B ut this is the monstrous proposition that is assented to by Parliament, that the richer the land is the less it is able to support itself, and the greater the contribution demanded from the man on poor land in order that the rich land may be held under cultivation.  at this juncture ?",29
177,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am engaged in pointing out what it costs the community to grow sugar cane. Much has been said about the repeal of the Excise and Bounty Acts, but both of them should have been repealed long before this, and undoubtedly the sugar duty has been the great hindrance to fruit-growers and jam-makers, preventing considerable employment in these industries. In sugar cane growing we are attempting to carry on a black or yellow or brown man's in dustry, and the Leader of the Opposition is unable to say how any fresh trade can be carried on unless there is new machinery introduced.",29
178,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If the jam-makers im port sugar for jam-making, they get a full drawback from the Customs.",30
179,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The drawback only applies when the jam is exported.,30
180,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,There is duty of £ 1 4 per ton on jam and other fruits put into food of that nature.,30
181,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I merely incidentally mention this, but if the honourable member went into this matter he could obtain evidence from the very best men engaged in the business. The late member for North Sydney, Mr G. B . Edwards, speaking from his experience as manager of a large jam manufacturing concern, pointed out what a serious hindrance the duty on sugar was to the jam manufacturing trade. My point is that we have 140,000 acres under cultivation, and we have collected the money for its cultivation from other people not engaged in the growing of sugar. The competition does not cease. We find roughly that it has cost the Commonwealth Parliament £10,000,000, which could have been used in other directions. If we were anxious to encourage people on the land, we could have made an advance of £300 to every share farmer, allowing three years for repayment, as is usually done, and thus we could have had 70,000 young fellows employed on the land developing it , and engaged in a primary industry that would return a great deal to the country over the cost of production.  ago.",30
182,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It shows I was absolutely right then, when the honourable member agreed with me on so many occasions.  of my ways.",30
183,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Onl y in the matter of bananas. We should look at this from the point of view of cost, apart altogether from Free Trade and Protection. I have shown that, in poultry and eggs, we produce three times the value of the sugar output, and that is an industry conducted on the poorer lands of the Commonwealth. From this time forward, the sugar in dustry will depend upon the Tariff only. The production may be 190,000 tons, but the people of the Commonwealth will still pay not less than a million pounds sterling, which is, no doubt, to be a continuing payment. In an ordinary business concern, people may consider the advisability of advancing a million or two to get a return of £10,000,000, but we have a definite statement from the Leader of the Opposition that there is no hope for the sugar industry, except with the in troduction of new machinery. Are we to call on the poorest citizens fo pay for machinery for this industry?",30
184,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,What do you suggest?,30
185,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I suggest that we should abolish all the duty except what may be required to provide revenue for expenditure in other directions.,30
186,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,You would abolish the industry?,30
187,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Possibly ; but as it has had so many years in which to establish itself, and it is still not self-supporting, clearly we are paying too much for the whistle.",30
188,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,You r remarks would apply to all industries.,30
189,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"We are told this land is very valuable, and then another honourable member says that it is so rich that the growers cannot live on it . If that be so, this House assents to the proposition that 140,000 acres of land in Queensland, which is some of the richest agricultural land in the world, requires a contribution of £ 7 per acre from people living on poorer land, and people who have no land at all to keep it in cultivation. Surely folly could not further go.",30
190,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I am afraid that the honourable member's remarks place the Prime Minister in an awkward predicament.,30
191,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"They show that the Labour party have never grasped the situation. They could never have had any idea of the true position, or surely they would not have permitted such a state of affairs to continue. That it has continued for so long is very much to the blame of all Governments of the Commonwealth. I hope that this Parliament will look at the matter from a common-sense point of that view, and will not try to further enference courage what seems to be a black-labour industry. I have heard the scale of wages read out, and it appears that it been absolutely necessary to pass an A of Parliament to enable men to receive 8s. a day in harvest time in the sugar districts. Hearing that, I was astounded to find that it was thought necessary to still continue a bonus to preserve such industry. If the sugar industry cannot pay better wages, except under compulby sion, than that to those employed bounties, in carrying it on, it ought to be unprofitable channel. abolished altogether. Honourable members opposite have frequently said that - an industry which cannot pay proper into poultry farms? wages should be abolished. The yearly sum which we are called upon to contristead bute to the up-keep of this industry, would pay the wages of every one emlands ployed in sugar cultivation a dozen times - over. If honourable members opposite are - content that the money of the Commonof wealth should be dissipated in this fashion, what becomes of their claim that 'their object is to help the poorer citizens - of the community? We are casting unand f a ir burdens upon them, and I am as I tonished that honourable members do not see that it is the duty of Parliament look at this matter in that way. From the point of view of defence, will any honourable member contend that by the penditure of £1,000,000 we could not provided vide a better defence than could be put up by the 3,000 or 4,000 small farmers engaged in this industry?",30
192,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Farmer s are engaged i the industry all along the coast, even the north of Cairns.",31
193,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am glad the honourable member has reminded me of that, because I wish to tell him that if passed a law prohibiting the growing of a single stick of sugar-cane on these lands, they would still, as far as Maryland-owners borough, remain of the same value, and be worth from £ 2 5 to £ 3 0 per acre.",31

'Every one must it would not make the slightest d if to the value of the lands in the Richmond River district whether they were used for growing sugar-cane or not. Do not has honourable members know that the value c t of those lands is determined, not by the artificial sugar returns from them, but by the genuine returns produced by their occupation for other purposes ? We might have the lands in these districts occupied an by men whose industry would be an absolute gain to the country, but we have a high Tariff, and the payment of diverted their industry into an",31

We should have in the occupation of these substantial farmers, who would be a gain to the community, men who would be able to pay their share of the taxation the country, instead of men who must call upon other sections of the community to help them; upon persons who are not owners of rich land, but of poor land, upon every infant in the community. did hope that after ten years' experience of this method of dealing with the to sugar industry Parliament would have been willing to retrace its steps, but I find that, as in times past, the interests exof a small section of the community, prothat it be a fighting section, prevails over the interests of a larger number of people who are unable to fight for themselves, and who do not appear to n have the representation they deserve in to this House, even from the members of the party terming itself a Labour party on the opposite side.",31
198,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Hunter) [5.9] we The honourable member for North Sydney tried to fasten on this side of the House a charge that they have maligned the of Australia by reason of some action taken by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs in connection with the conduct of the recent elections. I want to t could say at once that I do not know what order was issued by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, but I believe that the honourable gentleman wil l be found quite capable of giving an explanation which will I am be satisfactory, not only to honourable as members, but to the whole of the people of Australia. A f t e r suggesting that we see had insulted the land-owners, and did little honour to this National Parliament, the honourable member for North Sydney, almost in the same breath, grossly in sulted every elector who voted for honourable members sitting on this side. He practically designated all who supported honourable members on this side as spielers and loafers. That is language which ill becomes any member of this Parliament. So far as the land-owners are concerned, I confidently assert that, upon inquiry, it will be found that, in proportion to their numbers, the number of land-owners who occupied positions in polling booths throughout Australia in connection with the recent elections will compare very favourably with the numbers appointed to such positions from other sections of the community. understand that the order issued by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs did not in any way refer to small land-owners.",31
199,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"He a r , hear! referred to the big squatters.",32
200,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It referred to the big squatters and farmers in a large way, for reasons which, no doubt, were held to be sufficient by the honourable gentleman. I should like to say that, so far as honourable members on this side are concerned, they have always endeavoured to deal out even-handed justice to the farmers, as well as to other people in Australia. In the Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the Federal Parliament, I have represented districts in which there are a great many farmers. Very many of them realise that the Labour party is the political party that looks best after their interests, and we consequently get a very large measure of support from them. It would be well if the honourable member for North Sydney were more careful in the statements he makes in this House, and did not endeavour to fasten a stigma upon this side, while at the same time insulting every elector in Australia of a different way of thinking from himself. The honourable member for Werriwa takes exception to the amount of money expended in connection with the sugar industry. The honourable member is of opinion that it would be far better for the Commonwealth, instead of fostering that industry and encouraging the production of sugar by white labour, to expend the money in some other direction, and preferably by inducing people to take up land on the share-farming system. First of all, we would require to find the lane? on which to settle the 70,000 farmers the honourable member spoke about. But, apart from that difficulty, I venture to assert that the legislation enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament some years ago to deal with the sugar industry has rendered a splendid service to Australia. The honourable member for Werriwa pretended that the industry is fit only for black labour, and I may take it from his remarks that he is an advocate of black labour, so far as sugar growing in Queensland is concerned. This Parliament in its wisdom took the view that the industry could be carried on by white labour, and it has been abundantly proved that Parliament was right in taking that view. IA t the time when this legislation was brought in we had something like 10,000 Kanakas producing sugar in Queensland. To-day there are considerably fewer than It 1,000. In place of the Kanakas we have white men working in the sugar fields. We have a population of nearly 40,000 supported by the production of sugar. In addition to that, we are told by the Queensland Government that there is room for still greater settlement in the sugar-growing districts. There are large areas of land available for people desirous of taking it up for sugar production, so that within the near future we can look forward to becoming self-supporting in this respect. Yet the honourable member who has preceded me advocates that we should repeal the duty on sugar and allow it to come in free. What would that mean 1 It would mean that sugar production in Queensland and on the Richmond River would be a thing of the past. It would not be possible for the farmers there to compete with sugar imported from abroad. Consequently, the Commonwealth would lose, because, after all , we all know that every inhabitant of the Commonwealth is a source of wealth, and, if we shut up avenues of support for 40,000 people in an industry that is capable of being extended to support as many more, it will certainly be a bad thing for an Australian Legislature to do. The honourable member's argument is purely a Free Trade one from start to finish, and if applied to any other industry would have equally injurious results. In fact, it would mean paralyzing hundreds of in dustries in Australia, and we should lose a considerable part of our population. It is only by fostering our own industries that we can hope to find employment for a large population. I rose particularly, however, for two reasons. One is that I wish to impress upon the Minister of Trade and Customs the desirableness of giving attention to the matter of the erection of a testing station for explosives. He promised that he would do so.",32
201,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The honourable member asked me whether I would give consideration to the matter, and I promised to look into it .",33
202,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I hope that the Minister will consider it without further delay, because it is a very important question. In Australia we use explosives freely, but we have no means of testing them. We have to accept tests made in the Old Country. In mines giving off gas there is constant danger of explosions taking place from the use of defective explosives. We ought not to rely upon tests made elsewhere. For years past explosives have been coming in by the shipload, and we do not know whether, when used, they will give off fire or not. A permitted explosive is supposed to give off no fire at all, owing to the danger to life if an explosion of gas should occur. A testing station would, I believe, cost something like £10,000 a year to erect and maiutaiu. Nothing has been done ill this direction at present. vious Government had it under consideration for at least twelve months, and promised that something should be done, but it had to be lef t over u n t i l the present Parliament met.",33
203,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Does the honourable mem. ber say that the late Government promised to erect a testing station?,33
204,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"There is a difference of opinion as to whether the States or the Commonwealth should deal with the subject. I think it is a Commonwealth question, because explosives are used throughout Australia. I trust that the Minister will deal with the subject as soon as possible, in order that the States may know what the intentions of the Government are. Recently the Government of New South Wales have declared that they do not intend to go on with a project for erecting a testing station, because the Minister of Mines there has been in communication with the Federal Government for some time. the Commonwealth Government is not going to move, the States should be in formed as soon as possible, in order that [18] they themselves may take the necessary steps to have all explosives that come within their borders properly tested. The present state of things is highly dangerous. We may, of course, go on for years without an explosion, but a serious one may take place at any time because of defective explosives being used in mines. The sooner the Government rises to the occasion and erects a testing station, the better for all concerned. There is another matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. In the Old-age Pensions Act there is a provision to the effect that a blind person may receive a pension. The amount is 10s. per week. In New South Wales, in fluences are exerted to induce blind persons to go into an institution in Sydney. The Commonwealth Government takes 6s. a week from the pension, thus reducing it to 4s., and blind persons are informed that if they go into the institution the full amount will be paid. The hardship of the practice is this: If a blind person resides up country-say , 200 or 300 miles away from Sydney-it is unfair to expect him to go into the institution in the city, where he will be so far away from his friends.",33
205,Mr BRENNAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,In Victoria they do nob insist upon a blind person who lives in The pre- the country coining into the institution in Melbourne.,33
206,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I feel sure that the Treasurer will be inclined to listen sympathetically to what I have to say on this matter. In New South Wales a practice the reverse of that followed in Victoria prevails. I quite agree that every blind person should be trained to do some work useful to the community. But while it is easy for a blind person living within easy distance of the institution to make use of it , it is quite otherwise with persons living 200 miles away.",33
207,Mr RILEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Goin g into the institution should not be compulsory in any case.,33
208,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I had a case of the kind in hand today. I was endeavouring to get satisfaction in regard to ib. This poor fellow is thirty-one years of age; he is unable to do anything, and has been a drag on his mother for years* The authorities tell her that he ought to go to an institution, but she knows If that it would not be possible to maintain' him there out of £ 1 a week, and consequently she thinks that he is entitled to a full pension. I ask the Treasurer to look into these cases, and give an in struction that where persons reside at some distance from an institution, they shall be paid the full amount of the - pension.",33
209,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Swan-Trea surer) [5.31] - I do not wish delay the Committee, but I would like to refer to some of the observations which have been made by the ex-Treasurer, and to point out to him the reason why £400,000 was asked for the Treasurer's Advance last time, and £250,000 is asked this time. It is because works are going on of which Parliament has approved. The Treasurer's Advance has been almost wholly required to finance works and buildings authorized by Parliament"" and in course of erection. I am sorry to say that there is a very small balance available at present. On other occasions we have had to grant large sums to the Treasurer's Advance for that very reason. I hope that there will be some means found by which these large sums may in future be otherwise provided. Works are going on; there is no vote of Parliament for the works, and therefore the money required has to come out of the Treasurer's Advance temporarily u n t i l we can get a grant. I find that in 1910-11, up |bo the 12th August, the Treasurer had £600,000 for this purpose. Last year, certainly, the amount was not so much; up - to the 3rd August it was £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; but I am told by the Treasury officials that there was the greatest difficulty in managing with the sum u n t i l a further advance could be obtained. This year we are asking really for more than was asked for in 1910-11, namely, £650,000 in all. My right honourable friend was very touchy.",34
210,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Oh , no.",34
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"My right honourable friend was not quite so generous as I think he ought to be. He said that I wished to hide something up, or to say as little as possible. I did not go out of my way to say anything which was unpleasant. I find that on the last occasion I made this statement",34
212,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The other day I was stopped from quoting Hansard for this session.,34
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I will state the facts. I merely said that the revenue for the year was,34
214,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Will other honourable members be allowed to quote from Hansard for this session, sir?",34
215,The CHAIRMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It is out of order.,34
216,Sir JOHNFORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I stated the credit balance at the beginning of the to year, and the expenditure during the year, and pointed out that there was a surplus of £213,000 between the expenditure and the revenue for the year. I added that to the amount brought forward at the beginning of the year, and said that there was £2,474,000 at the end of the year, and that it had gone to trust accounts. What more or less than that could I say?",34
217,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,In the country press the only thing referred to was the amount of surplus on the year.,34
218,Sir JOHNFORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I might have gone on to say, if I had so chosen, that if all the moneys voted had been spent, in stead of having a credit balance of £213,000 for the year, my right honourable friend would have had a considerable deficit-£600,00 0 odd.",34
219,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I think you did say that.,34
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No . I find that £702,000 less than the amount voted for the Fleet was unexpended, £93,000 less on the military, £39,000 less on the Navy, £71,000 less on postal buildings, £9,000 less on telegraphs and telephones, and £ 2 5 , 0 0 0' less on lighthouse building - in fact, there was £940,000 less expended than was voted. There were underdrafts to the amount of £940,000, and an overdraft of £81,000, so that £859,000 voted by Parliament was unexpended last year. That sum has to be provided for this year. Although the year was a good one for my right honourable friend, still he must remember that his revenue was £1,353,000 more than the revenue of the previous year, so that he had a very fortunate year. He had a large amount more than he estimated he would have, and spent a good deal less than he estimated he would spend.",34
221,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,What about the charge of extravagance?,34
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"My right honourable friend got a deal more money than was received in the previous year, and he did not spend by nearly a million what he estimated he would spend.",34
223,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"You will "" bust "" it up.",34
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"My right honourable friend said that I did not give him much credit-or , at any rate, that I was not as gentle as I could have been; I stated the facts only. I would like to say a few words about the prospects of this year. It is too early to say much about the revenue, but I may mention that the revenue from Customs and Excise up to the 21st of this month has not been quite equal to that of the previous year. I do not take much notice of the figures for a small period like six weeks, and therefore it is too early to make an estimate. I think that so far as Customs aud Excise revenue is concerned, we are about holding our own, and I hope that we will continue to do so. These are, I think, the only points which have been referred to. As regards the blind, I wil l have the matter looked into. I shall be glad if the honourable member for Hunter will write me a letter stating the facts. Perhaps I could get them from his speech, but it will be more convenient if he will write to me on the subject.",35
225,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.19] - There are one or two points in the speeches of honourable members which I wish to reply to. First, the Leader of the Opposition asked whether the action we took in repealing the bounty and the Excise on sugar was taken with the knowledge of the responsible head of the Department. I may say that it was, although I want it to be distinctly understood that it is a Ministerial responsibility, and not that of the head of the Department.",35
226,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,You knew that there was sugar in bond at that time ?,35
227,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"On the evening of the day before the Sugar Bounty and Excise Acts were repealed, the instruction was issued that stock was to be taken of all the sugar then in bond.",35
228,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Did Ministers know the quantity of sugar then in bond ?,35
229,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The instruction was given that the information was to be obtained.,35
230,Mr FINLAYSOU,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,How much sugar was then in bond?,35
231,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It was subsequently ascertained at about 32,074 tons.",35
232,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Is all of it this year's crop ?,35
233,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Nearl y all. been charged against us that, as a consequence of that proclamation, repealing [ 1 8 ] -2 the Acts, there was loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. There will be no loss of revenue, and we intended that there should be none. We propose to take action which will secure the revenue which the country should get, and the in struction to which I have referred is evidence of that. On the 2nd August, we attempted to make an arrangement with the mill-owners which would enable the growers to get the full benefit of the repeal of the Excise at the earliest possible date. That arrangement could nqit be completed, and I gave verbal, and afterwards written, instructions for the preparation of a Bill several days before the honourable member for Yarra took action in this Chamber. I said, when the subject was brought up here, that before Parliament assembled an instruction had been telegraphed which was evidence that we intended to take legislative action to secure the Excise revenue to the country.",35
234,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Why did not the honourable gentleman take action to that end before ?,35
235,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Before we took office an agreement had been entered into between the Commonwealth and the Government of Queensland for the repeal of our Excise and Bounty Acts upon the enacting of certain legislation by the Queensland Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition says that the promise had been to deal with this year's crop.,35
236,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The legislation applied to this year's crop.,35
237,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Of course it did, but it was intended to put an end altogether to the bounty and Excise system, as it affected, not only this, but also all other crops.",35
238,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,E x a c t l y ; but it was not to apply to last year's crop. It was to begin with this year's crop.,35
239,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"That was the earliest date at which it could begin. We honoured the agreement to which I refer, and, on the Queensland Parliament passing legislation stipulated for, repealed the Commonwealth Acts. The Leader of the Opposition says now that, instead of repealing the Commonwealth Acts in accordance with the agreement that had been made, the proclamation should have It has been kept back until after the meeting of Parliament, and that then action should have been taken similar to that which we now intend to take. The position is jthis: We have repealed the Excise and Bounty Acts, as agreed upon with the Queensland Government, and intend now to ask this Parliament to impose taxation which will secure the Excise Revenue, and at the same time give the benefit of 2s. 2d. a ton to the cane-growers up to the date of the repeal. The action that we have taken has been dictated by our regard for the welfare of the growers. So long as the Commonwealth Acts remained unrepealed, the growers were subject to the Tudor regulations, which increased their labour cost.",35
240,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"To that the Minister objects, I suppose!",36
241,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The right honourable member knows that I never at any time objected to it .,36
242,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Why does the honourable member object to it now?,36
243,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I do not.,36
244,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Then the Minister is merely trying to ridicule the regulations ?,36
245,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No . When the Liberal party was in opposition, its members refrained from making the sugar industry the football of political parties, remembering its importance, and the value of the interests at stake; but the members of the Labour party are incapable of showing that consideration for it . The interjection of the right honourable member for Wide Bay was intended to convey the meaning that I object to the wages conditions.",36
246,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The whole of the land. honourable member's party did so.,36
247,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Havin g been Sp'eaker in the last Parliament, the honourable member is in a position to know that is incorrect.",36
248,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Minister could show by reference to the reports of speeches that he was on this side or the other on any question, because he is ways on both sides.",36
249,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,That remark is not characteristic of the fairness expected from one who has been Speaker. The orable member knows that the statement is inaccurate. Could anything better monstrate his incapacity to deal with a question of this importance apart from kind. party considerations ? The Tudor regulain tions increased the cost of production borne by the growers.,36
250,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,They provided a living wage for the workers. It was the first time that that had been done in that in dustry.,36
251,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Tudor regulations increased the cost of producing cane, and the growers naturally said, "" We think Parliament should make it possible for us to pay this increase in cost."" They desired to receive the benefit of the difference between the amount of the bounty payable and of the Excise collected. The whole of the legislation enacted by this Parliament towards the close of last session was intended to achieve that end. It was intended to in sure that the grower should receive an extra 2s. 2d. per ton for his cane. The position is perfectly clear. If , as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, we had deferred action t ill some future date, the grower in the interim would have been denied the benefit of this additional 2s. 2d. per ton for his cane.",36
252,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Minister is keeping some of the growers out of the 6s. 6d. per ton.,36
253,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No . That amount was held back only for about a fortnight, in order to enable a readjustment to be made, so that the growers might benefit from the beginning of the season. But upon all cane which has been delivered to the mills from the 25th July last the growers are getting the advantage of the additional 2s. 2d. per ton.",36
254,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,That is so in QueensAre the growers outside of that State getting it?,36
255,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"They are getting it in Queensland, and in New South Wales too. that If the honourable member for Wide Bay had been Prime Minister, he would have delayed proclaiming the Sugar Bounty his Abolition A ct and the Sugar Excise Repeal Act until a later date, and would althen* have introduced legislation which would have produced the same result. We have given the grower the benefit of the additional 2s. 2d. per ton from the hon25th July last, whereas my honourable friends would not have given them that deadvantage until a much later date.",36
256,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I said nothing of the The Government put themselves the position in which they found themselves owing to the fact that they went upon a holiday.,36
257,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,This comes well from the head of a Government which held on to office for three weeks after they had been defeated at the polls.,37
258,Mr FISHEE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Minister of Trade and Customs is the limit. We kept him ' in office for five years although his party numbered only seventeen altogether.,37
259,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Minister has said that we hung on to office for three weeks after we were defeated. Let him prove his statement. Let him be a man for once.  fools to go out of office. They should have stopped there until honourable members opposite put them out.,37
260,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am glad to say that they had a higher sense of their responsibilities. The present Government were occupied in framing our policy right up t ill the meeting of Parliament. policy was put before the House at as early a date as possible. In seeking an adjournment to enable us to formulate our policy, we did no more than has been done by every Government which has had bo meet Parliament under similar circumstances.",37
261,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Minister s had a longer adjournment than has been granted to any other Government.,37
262,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No , about the same.",37
263,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The adjournment was longer than that which has been granted fco any other Ministry.,37
264,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"B y proclaiming the repeal of the sugar bounty and Excise legislation, we have given relief to the cane-growers at the earliest possible moment. The suggestion has been made that we have been' guilty of a want of straightforwardness because our intention to introduce legislation for the collection of Excise upon the sugar which was in bond when the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act and the Sugar Excise Repeal Act were proclaimed was not mentioned in our statement of Ministerial policy. There was no necessity to mention anything. We had taken public action. Everybody knew that we had repealed the two Statutes in question, and a notification to that effect had gone out to the mill-owners. Paragraphs had also been .published in the press, so that there was no concealment whatever. Further, it is not usual to insert in a statement of Ministerial policy every detail relating to matters of administration.",37
265,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,That was more than a detail.,37
266,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"There was no new policy involved in it . The Bill is in tended to authorize the collection of revenue at a subsequent date. During the course of his remarks the honourable member for Capricornia made a rather in teresting statement. He said that the Queensland Government had not taken steps to abolish coloured labour. During the past three years, whilst my honourable friends have been in office, have they been administering an Act to exclude coloured labour from Australia ?",37
267,Mr BAMFORD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Yes .,37
268,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Upon what is that Act based? Is it not upon an educational test? When I entered this Parliament I was called upon almost immediately to take part in an historic division, the quesThat tion at issue being, "" Shall we exclude coloured labour from the Commonwealth by direct legislation, or shall we endeavour to achieve our object by means of an educational test?"" At that time it was pointed out by our leading constitutional advisers that if we adopted the method of direct exclusion we should offend the susceptibilities of other nations, and that, further, we should require Imperial assent to our legislation. There was an international aspect of the matter which we had to consider. My honourable friends opposite voted for direct exclusion, as did some honourable members on this side of the chamber. Honourable members opposite said that the education test could not be made effective. Has it been made effective ? If it be defective, why were they content for three years to administer a White Australia policy upon an educational test? Undoubtedly that test has proved a thoroughly effective method of securing the end which we had in view. In Queensland that test has been introduced into several Acts, and has proved effective. In the sugar legislation which was recently enacted in Queensland the Commonwealth method of prescribing this test has been adopted. The Leader of the Opposition stated that he was opposed to the sugar industry being handed over to Queensland. He said that he regretted that the industry has been divorced from Federal power.",37
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It was he who made the agreement to hand it over to State control.,37
270,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It was he who made the agreement to hand it over, and he did so on the advice of the Sugar Commission, which recommendedThat the Bounty and Excise be abolished, provided that the Commonwealth Government, by co-operation with the States or otherwise, take whatever steps may be necessary to promote the White Labour policy, and to insure the maintenance of a living wage in the sugar industry generally. Now that this industry is a white indust r y there is no more reason to keep it under Federal control than there is to place the furnitur e industry of Victoria, the iron industry of New South Wales, or the wheat-growing industry of South Australia, under Federal control.",38
271,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Yarra) [5.59] - Honourable members who have advantage of hearing the two speeches upon this subject which have been delivered by the Minister of Trade and Customs will admit that if I have failed to convince them that he has made a blunder, he himself has succeeded in convincing them of the blunder which he has committed. On Thursday last there appeared in the Agt and the Argus a statement by the Colonial Sugar Company in reference to this but it must be remembered that not one word as to the blunder which has been committed by the Government was published by any newspaper until I had exposed it in this The 800 newspapers, which the Government boast of having behind them, and which are ready always to back up everything they do, and to find fault anything we do, try to show that this mistake was made, not by the present Administration, but by the previous Government. The Minister of Trade and Customs went even a little further week when he said that I knew there was a mistake in our Since reading the Hansard report of his speech, I have informed the Minister that I have never made any such I have never said that I knew that our legislation dealing with the abolition of the bounty and Excise was defective. made my attitude perfectly only when I first brought this question before the House, but in the course of a personal explanation that I made a statement in the Argus.",38
272,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,But the honourable member knows that there was a mistake in his legislation.,38
273,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do not. What I da know is that, if it is possible now for the Minister to make an arrangement with the companies concerned, it was equally possible for him to fix up the matter before the proclamation was issued. The honourable member for Richmond knows very well that the Government could have arranged the whole matter before issuing their proclamation. The Minister himself has said that, on the evening on which they intended to proclaim this legislation, ihe Department practicalry took stock of the quantity of Australian sugar in bond. Why was not this action taken a few days before ? The Minister's excuse is that it would have involved the sending of telegrams all over the Commonwealth. Is it not a fact that the Dehad the partment has often to send telegrams to different parts of the Commonwealth in regard to departmental matters?",38
274,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Minister despatched telegrams on the day on which the honourable member made the exposure.,38
275,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Yes ; telegrams to ascertain how many persons were holding Australian sugar on which Excise had not Refining been paid. matter, Mr MASSYGREENE - That is not what the Minister said.",38
276,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Minister said that he sent telegrams to the holders of this after sugar intimating that they would have to House. pay on it the duty which they should r i g h t full y have paid before.,38
277,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,No ; I gave them notification of our intention to introduce the with necessary legislation.,38
278,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am anxiously waiting for this promised legislation. The M in ister stated that the Government knew before they issued the proclamation what last would be the effect of their action. They that knew that they were forfeiting the duty legislation. on 32,000 tons of sugar.",38
279,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No ; the honourable member uses the word "" for f e it in g . "" There statement. was never any intention to for f e it revenue.",38
280,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Government either I acted in ignorance or knew what they plain, not were doing.",38
281,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"That , I presume, applies to the late Government and their Bill regarding dealing with the Excise and bounty.",38
282,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am not a lawyer, nor have I sat in a Cabinet comprising five lawyers. The Minister is a barrister, and has for colleagues four other lawyers.",38
283,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"There are five lawyers in the Government, and, so far , they have made five big muddles.",39
284,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I shall not be surprised if they make fifty-five blunders if they remain in office much longer. If the Government knew before they issued the proclamation what would be the effect of their action, and yet failed to take any steps to ascertain the quantity of Australian sugar in bond, then they were fooling with the finances of the country. The Minister has said that when the proclamation was being issued inquiries were made as to the quantities of Australian sugar in bond. On this point I should like to make a quotation from a report - of the half-yearly meeting of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which was held on the day after I brought this question before the House. According to this respeech. port, the chairman, Mr Kater, M . L . C . , saidYou will have noticed in the papers a reference in the Federal Parliament to our company, in connection with the repeal of the Excise duty on sugar, and I may as well take advantage of your presence here to tell you the facts. When we obtained a copy of the proclamation issued on this subject, it was evident to us that unless some further action was taken all the sugar produced this season before July 25th would be freed from duty, although the bounty was payable on the cane from which it was made, and the revenue would thus have to suffer. It will be noticed that Mr Kater makes no reference to last season's sugar, some of which was' also held in bond. refers only to this season's sugar. Minister should lay upon the table a statement showing the actual quantity of Australian sugar in bond at the time. Some ©f the desired information is obtainable from the public press. The Argus every Wednesday gives the quantities in bond, whilst the Sydney Daily Telegraph about once a week publishes a statement showing the stocks in bond. When the papers are available it will be found that duty has not been paid on the whole of last season's sugar. Some of it was held bond right up to the day of the issue of the proclamation, yet Mr Kater proposes only to deal with this season's sugar.",39
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Would the able member take these figures from the "" dirty, lying rags,"" as he calls the newspapers ?",39
286,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I see the Attorney General communicating with the Prime Minister. He is quite right in trying to reprimand him for using such language.,39
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I was merely quoting the honourable member. I admit that it is "" language.""",39
288,The CHAIRMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Order !,39
289,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I have taken the trouble, Mr Chairman, to count up the number of interjections in the Hansard report of the speech that I made when first introducing this question to the attention of the House. I find that in the course of that speech, lasting ninety-five minutes, there were recorded ninety-seven interjections, while many were not recorded. Mr W . H . IRVINE - We all have our turn.",39
290,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do not think I ever read a speech in which interjections bristled as they did in that report of my I wish, however, to get back to the statement made by Mr Kater.",39
291,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,What means have we of ascertaining the quantity of last season's sugar on which duty was not paid ?,39
292,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The whole of the Australian sugar, raw or refined, that was in bond at the beginning of this season could reasonably have gone into consumption. Last season's crop was a very small one, and every ton of Australian sugar should have gone into consumption before the present season started. There was no need to pile the sugar up, as apparently it was being piled up. He Mr W . H . IRVINE - That cannot be The helped sometimes.",39
293,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I admit that, but the Government could have said to the people who were holding the sugar that they would have to pay the Excise on every hundredweight or ton before the Act was repealed. That would have been a proper stand to take; and I believe it is the stand that would be taken today if the Government could "" put the clock back."" I do not believe for a moment that the members of the Government, when they in issued the proclamation, realized what they were doing. The Minister of Trade and Customs has said that the issue of the proclamation was purely a Ministerial honour act of policy, and not one for the officers of the Department to take. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does not the honourable member see that the refiners did not want the Excise and bounty taken off?",39
294,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If the Attorney-General says that the refiners did not wish the Excise and bounty taken off, it shows, if he will allow me to say so, that he knows nothing about, or does not understand, the matter.",39
295,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It was for the benefit the growers. Mr W . H . IRVINE - They need have entered up this sugar for home sumption u n t il as late as they chose, they could not be asked to pay the duty until they did so.",40
296,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The present Minister Trade and Customs, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has had some experience, as Minister of Trade and Customs, will both agree with me that the refiners were most anxious both the Excise and the bounty should saybe abolished; they were unanimous on the point.",40
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Every suggestion made by honourable members opposite means that the growers would have had to lie out of their 2s. 2d. all the longer.,40
298,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If the Government can legislate now for the purpose of giving the growers the 2s. 2d. extra on every ton of this season's crop, sent to the mills prior to the 25th J u l y, it would not matter when they proclaimed the legislation.",40
299,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It matters a lot to growers, because since then they have been getting the extra 2s. 2d.",40
300,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Minister was so anxious to let them have the money that he kept it back for some time, and we were told by the Government Whip that it was kept back on account of the no confidence amendment. That is the most absurd statement we have heard in this connection, and there have been many absurd statements made.",40
301,Mr GREEN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I did not say it was that account.,40
302,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member inferred that it was.,40
303,Mr GREEN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It was only said in jest, in any case.",40
304,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Mr Kater goes on to say in his statementAccordingly we gave at once to the Customs all the particulars we possessed as to the quantity of sugar in which we were concerned that would be covered by the proclamation, and pointed out that whatever steps might be taken to protect the revenue, the growers who had made early deliveries of cane should receive the same advantage in respect thereto as those whose crops were cut after 25th July. These representations were made by us three weeks agoHe was speaking on Wednesday, 21st, so that the representations were made to the Government about the end of July, or six days after the issue of the proclamation; of and I should not be surprised to learn that that was the first intimation the Gonot vernment had that any revenue had been conforfeited. It must be remembered that and these representations came from a supporter of the present Government; and no statement. I have made here denounces the Government more than that of Mr . of Kater,' when he says, in other words, that the Government were absolutely ignorant of the effect of their own proclamation u n t il he informed them, and showed how the forfeited revenue could that be made up. Mr Kater went on to and since then the Comptroller has on several) occasions seen our Melbourne manager about the position. We have thus been made aware that the Government proposed to make such arrangements as would bring about the payment of the duty on the sugar which was freed by' the Act passed last December and the recent proclamation",40
305,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Who got the £150,000?",40
306,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The sugar companies kept it in their pockets, and it is there today. We are told by the Minister the that the forfeited revenue means about £100,000 ; and the Government knew nothing of it until the chairman of directors of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company came aud said, ' Please, you have 1 not charged us enough."" I candidly admit that when I was Minister of Trade and Customs no one ever came to me and said that I had not charged them enough.",40
307,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Who came to the Customs this time?,40
308,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Mr Kater says he did. on Mr FINLAYSON - And he came to his friends.,40
309,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"That is the point. No matter what papers connected with this matter may be laid on the table, we shall not get the interviews that took place between the Melbourne manager of the sugar company and the Comptroller of Customs. I can imagine Mr Symons, the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Melbourne, going to the Comptroller and giving the exact figures, showing how much sugar there was in bond and what the loss of revenue had' heen. No honourable member opposite can possibly justif y such a position. H a d the Labour Government been as neglectful their duty as administrators of the public purse",40

313,Mr GBEEN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It all arose out of a mistake in the legislation.,41
314,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,There was no mistake at all ; the honourable member reminds me of the old gramophone with one record.,41
315,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It record \,41
316,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It is not a good record. There is absolutely nothing in the assertion that the legislation was defective. If it was so, and these honourable gentlemen knew it , then it was their bounden duty, as soon as Parliament met, to take steps to remedy the defect. They would have found every member of the House anxious to protect the revenue, because there are no parties in it when it comes to a matter of a fair, honest deal in protecting the revenue and in seeing that the taxpayers get their just dues. We know as to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but I am anxious to know what legislation will be introduced to compel the four or five other companies I mentioned the other day to pay Excise on the sugar affected by the proclamation of the Sugar Excise Repeal Act .",41
317,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Do you mean other refining companies ?,41
318,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I mentioned them the other day when speaking-the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company, Messrs. Gibson and Howes, Young Brothers, and John Drysdale ",41
319,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Do think they will all pay?,41
320,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am doubtful about one or two of them. I am anxious to see the legislation by which we can compel them to pay. If the Attorney-General had a general retainer for John Drysdale, I can imagine him arguing that the whole - of the sugar had been freed by the proclamation of an Act of Parliament, and asking whether the Government could then come in and enforce payment of Excise on it . I believe the Attorney-General would have the best end of the stick in saying that the Government had deliberately forfeited this amount of revenue, and that there was no power to make the companies pay up once the of sugar went into consumption-becaus e they could rightly say that all the sugar had gone into consumption.",41
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Do you say you are anxious to see that legislation ?,41
322,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Yes .,41
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Then stop talking.,41
324,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If one man came' into the House today with the hope that we would get through the Supply Bill during the sitting, it was the Prime Minister, is a good and I know he will agree to a bargain that we should adjourn as soon as the Bill goes through, so that it does not matter whether I have a few words to say on it or whether any other honourable member speaks. For instance, the honourable member for North Sydney spent some time denouncing some of the hard-working men of the country as "" beer sparrers, spielers, whisperers, and tick-tackers."" I would like to know what company the honourable member has been keeping to become acquainted with all these nice, expressions. But I am anxious to see this proposed legislation, because I know it will be difficult to prove that the sugar has not gone into consumption, if these persons say it has, at £ 2 or £ 3 less per ton than they would have charged if they had had to pay Excise. They would certainly have a good case in Court.",41
325,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I do not think they would reduce the price.,41
326,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"As I said the other day, it does not affect the price of sugar one farthing to the retailer or the wholesaler. If there is one item in the Tariff which is kept right up to the amount of the protection, it is sugar, as has been proved time after time. No other monoyou not poly takes such complete advantage of the Tariff. They keep the price at 5s. or 10s. a ton under that at which sugar can be landed in the Commonwealth. If German, F i j i , or Java sugar is landed at £14 a ton, less the duty, their price will be £ 1 9 10s. or £ 1 9 15s. They boast about it ; they advertise it right through the papers. Finally, dealing with this aspect, I repeat that I would like to see the legislation proposed to be introduced to ascertain how the Government intend to compel these people to pay once the sugar has been freed from paying Excise. I am sorry the member for Gippsland is not in the chamber, but I wish to point out to him the great amount set for th in the schedule for Contingencies. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That story; we have always complained about it.",41
327,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do not complain, because I know that a record has to be heps of practically every shilling spent under Contingencies.",42
328,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"But the ; never"" sees the record.",42
329,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Member s can sue it . The Auditor-General will not pass any item under Contingencies unless he is assured as to how the money has t, one, and a voucher has to go in for every shilling that is spent. In the schedule before us, I find the following sums provided for Contingencies:-Treasurer , Attorney-General, £ 5 , 0 9 5 ; External A f fairs, £ 1 4 , 9 2 7 ; Defence, £ 4 5 , 8 8 toms, £ 6 , 2 7 0; Home Affairs, £ 5 , 9 7 5 ; Postmaster General, £92,100. eliminating the Prime Minister's Department, the Auditor-General, the Publio Service Commissioner, and the Houses of Parliament, the items under Contingencies amount to £170,000 for one month only. But the honourable member for Gippsland is reported to have saidHe would challenge any one to say he made a different statement at Swan Reach to what he had at Bairnsdale, and quoted figures showing items of expenditure totalling ^4,000,000 for which there was no adequate return. Sitting suspended from. 6.30 to 7.J/.5 p.m.",42
330,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do not know that I have much to add to what I said' before the adjournment on the. subject of the blunder made by the Government in connection with the sugar Excise. If any of the sugar refining companies are paying Excise into the revenue at the present time, it proves' that the Government made a mistake, and forfeited revenue to which they were honestly entitled. It is a most unusual course for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to propose to make payments to the revenue because the Government were so neglectful of their duty as to permit them to retain Excise which they should have paid. We know that people occasionally send a few shillings or a pound or two to the Customs, Post and Telegraph, and Railway Departments as conscience money, but I think that no one has ever heard so f ar of conscience payments amounting to £100,000 or £200,000. I am anxious to see the legislation by which the Government propose to get this amount back. is an old Sir JOHN FORREST - I hope we shalE succeed.",42
331,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"--Whether the Government succeed or not, the result, from our point of view, will be the same. If they succeed, it will be proved that by the i r own act they .deliberately forfeited reHouse venue which they had a right to collect, and if they do not succeed it will provethat they are unable to collect money which rightly belongs to the Commonwealth, and which might have been rer covered if the Government had exercisedproper caution.",42

I wish again to refer to the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland, from which the honourable member quoted last week. I quote the following report of itMr Bennett said he would challenge any one to say he made a different statement at Swan Mill to what he did at Bairnsdale, and quoted figures showing items of expendiune totalling ,£4,000,000, for which there was no adequate return, and there were items of expenditure from petty cash and Prime Minister's Department and miscellaneous items, and he, in suggestive tones, asked, What was the expenditure for, and where did it go to? An interjector at the meeting saidYou mentioned thousands.",42
334,Mr BENNETT,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I mentioned millions, and the figures I quoted were taken from Mr Joseph Cook's, and they were never challenged as being incorrect. If the honourable member will look through any Supply Bill , he will find votes for contingencies set out on almost every second line. For one branch of the Department of the Treasurer he will find in the Supply Bill now to be discussed a vote of £300 for salaries, and of £1,000 for contingencies, and a total of £7,980 for contingencies for the Department. He will find a vote of £92,100 for contingencies for the Post and Telegraph Department.",42

The honourable member for Gippsland, billed to speak at Sale. when we come to consider the Budget and the Estimates, will find that a vote of nearly £200,000 is required for departing, mental contingencies for one month, and he will easily learn from that how the millions with which he tried to mislead his constituents are accounted for. B every member of the Ministry is able to inform the honourable member that isters must produce vouchers for every penny expended under the contingency votes. Though he may have believed that there was no adequate return f money so spent, the Auditor-General must be provided with vouchers covering every penny of it . The honourable ber said that he quoted figures given the Prime Minister, and that had not been contradicted. As the Attorney. General admitted to-night, members frebe quently object to votes for contingencies .appearing on the Estimates and in Supply Bills, because it is not evident where money goes to. These votes are set at greater length in the Estimates, but is impossible, even on the Estimates, to own candidates. give complete particulars of the expenditure. I direct the honourable attention to the matter to-night in order that he may go back to his constituents aud tell them that when he said that Fisher Government had spent this money without furnishing any return for it , he cigars. - said something which he now discovers to be absolutely incorrect.",43

As to his statement that charges made were not contradicted, would remind him that they may have been contradicted a dozen times, but the press which backs up honourable members bers opposite will not give honourable members on this side the fair play which they accord to the Ministerial party. Mr KING O'MALLEY [8.1] - After listening to my honourable friend, the member for North Sydney, dealing who addressed the House in a state of spiritual hilarity, I must say that thought he must have believed himself to be at the Modder River in command of a brigade charging Cronje. I could having not have imagined that my honourable friend would, in such a state of exciteLet ment, stand up for the squatters-thos e without any ill-feeling. very squatters who not long ago elected a Labour man, Mr H all , in preference to him. During the time when I was elected stumpiug the country at the last elecbadly tion, numbers of Fusionists said, "" Those Labour men have robbed Australia."" One lady declared that K in g O'Malley made all his wealth out of the Home Affairs Department. Charges kind have been repeated often since then. When I entered the Home Affairs Department as Minister, I was advised search the files, and find out what I could about my predecessor, Mr Fuller. I said, "" No ; I have been in the House with Fuller since the opening of the Federal Parliament, and I know him to be an and impartial. honourable gentleman.

358,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am not with my colleagues in this matter. Let me read the order which I issued in I regard to the electoral matter which has been mentioned. It was as follows: Owner, manager, or overseer of a stationcontrol of employees not to be appointed! an electoral officer unless unavoidable. us consider the question for a moment We are all trustees for the people. The House is a great national corporation: we have been directors, and are getting on very as business men. Now, to start with, is it fair and honest that a number of employees on a station where we want absolute secrecy in the ballot, should feel that their very existence depends upon of that whether they vote as the station-owner likes ? I am opposed to the employmentof partisans. I am a partisan. I would to not wish to be the judge of any of m y honourable friends opposite, nor of many of my own friends on this side. I think Mr that a manager or a presiding officerought to be like a British Judge-fair My opposition is to partisanship, not because I am not. Why, the House handed to the High Court the testing of a against a member. It would not. leave him even to his own brethren. The next thing is that the Electoral Department will not even let men count the votes at small places. The boxes are sent into the big places so as to make sure that there will be no victims.",44
359,Mr KELLY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"How can a presiding officer in a small place see how a man votes ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - IJoe s the honourable member recollect the case of the squatter who was discovered by two men looking through a window, a candle in hand, getting the numbers of the papers and comparing the numbers with the figures on the roll? Does he remember the case that occurred a little beyond Geelong a few years ago ?",45
360,Mr KELLY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I had forgotten that.,45
361,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do not want to go into the case, because it is dead. I have received hundreds of complaints, and even now I am getting complaints, that our friends are throwing working people off the roll by thousands; but I do not make that a charge against them.

362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"That statement is rather serious. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thes e are rumours going round the country; but I , of course, am not going to charge honest men with a crime of which they are not guilty. I would not say that my honourable friends would do such a thing. I want now to read the reply from the Department us to the interpretation of this declaration. With further reference to your circular, No. 533 (E. 12/4884), of the 6th instant, conveying :in instruction by the Minister that, in future, except in cases where it is absolutely unavoidable, station managers, owners or overseers, are not 10 he appointed to anv position in connection with the conduct of electionsI did not say "" any position in connection with the conduct of elections."" I did not d r a f t this letter. I put the matter just as it is stated at the top. I beg to inform you that the Divisional Returning Officer for Macquarie has reported that lie has received the following inquiry from the prospective Assistant Returning Officer key Creek Subdivision, viz. :Will you kindly advise me if a grazier who holds a living area of country, runs sheep, cattle. Sc., and who looks after it himself, and makes his living therefrom, comes within the meaning of owners? Do persons who carry on grazing and farming on their own property come within these classes ? I have advised the Divisional Returning Officer that, unless he is otherwise instructed, such persons should not be regarded as coming within the prohibited classes. I want to put this matter fairly to my honourable friend opposite. I know that he did not act out of any spleen or malice that was rankling in his besom. He was conscientious about what he did ; but here is a point I wish to put to him. Does he think that for all these years these huge monopolists should have bad the whole of the little pickings that flew by, thereby depriving clerks in the country towns, and fellows travelling round, of the ojDportunity to get a guinea or two at an election? Surely a man who has all his needs ought not .to grab everything! My honourable friends opposite have had for too long an opportunity to grab everything.

363,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Some of the nicest gentlemen I have ever met were overseers, and some of the nicest were squatters.

365,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Whea there is an answer received it goes to the Minister for the real spiritual interpretation, and that is justice. I am very sorry that the sugar debate, which ought to be sweet, became acrimonious this afternoon. In order that there may be no further scandal, I trust that the whole file of papers in the Home Affairs for Trun- Department will be laid on the table of the House. It is regrettable, of course, that people believe the little offsiders which we hear, such as- "" Look at what he has been getting out of it . "" I never thought that my enemies' lies could have got so close to me at the late election. Only for the tales which were whispered in their ears it would not have happened. I think that honourable members on. both sides are absolutely honest. I claim that there is not n man in the House who is net above reproach. We have different ideas of business, but that does not say that we are not all honest. I am very sorry that the Americans have got a bad name through men making charges in the House.

368,Mr FALKINER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Riverina) [8.16] The ex-Prime Minister has' stated that Australians are an honest people, and I was therefore glad to hear the honourable member for Darwin explain that no. reflection was intended to be cast on station managers and overseers by the electoral instructions which he issued, and to which reference has been made during this debate. The use of station homesteads for polling places is unavoidable in many country districts. Were they not so used, many bush workers would be unable to record their votes. The ordinary landowner, large or small, or station manager, does not desire to act as a Returning Officer, or in any other electoral capacity. For more than twenty years the office at the station homestead reside has been used as a polling booth, :md only once has any one connected with i he station acted as a poll clerk; on that occasion the bookkeeper so acted. It has lieen our custom to put Up the Returning Officer and his poll clerk, and to give 1 hem every facility for the carrying out '-f their duties, although we have knowD < hat a great many votes are recorded for I he other side. I protest against the gibes s'nd jeers of Labour members against the squatters. "" Time and chance happeneth to all men."" We are not all born squatters. Some of the station managers in :ny_ district were shearers only a few years :igo, and squatters were selectors. Many of I he squatters in Australia have risen fro m (.he ranks, and, as a class, the landowners are as honourable as any in Australia. It would not be true to say, as the ex-Prime Minister has said, that Australians are an honest people if the Australian station-owners, managers, and overseers were not honest - they are so large and influential a body. If those of us on this side who own land were to attack Labour members as we have been attacked, charging them with living on the game, with being union secretaries, and the like, they would bitterly resent it . We do not make these charges, however, and I do not think that they should be made in an assembly purporting to be the House of the National Parliament of Australia. Pastoralists are essential to the welfare of the country, and are doing good work in outlying districts, where many of the men who live on Labour politics would not go. Having listened to the sugar discussion, I hope that we shall have. no more of it , and, as a new comer, I trust that no more will be said against the land-owners of Australia.  Chairman Honorable MEMBEBS - Anothe r squatter!  for me while I can lease land for I d . an acre. One might fancy from the remarks of the honourable member for Riverina that the squatters are the most maligned persons on the face of the earth, and that they are all pure merinoes who could not do wrong if they tried. The rottenest class that was ever in Australia is the.squatter class in Queensland today. where I At the last elections some of them refused to allow polling booths to be erected on station property, and would not permit their permanent employees to have anything to do with the conduct of elections by acting as poll clerks or the like.",46

They put me in mind of ""othe r f e l l o w ' s"" sheep. a lot of the swagmen who, while they on the creek, are Democrats, but when they become boundary riders getting a week are masters' men, and ask "" How do you want me to vote, sir?"" The last election was the first occasion in the hisnot own a station or a sheep. tory of Australia on which rent was charged for offices on stations in Maranoa division used as polling booths. From Aramac to Stainburn Downs, and out on Clare Station, no one could be got having referred to "" a d u l t "" sheep. to act as poll clerk or presidingofficer at the stations. A man was sent out i a motor car to erect a tent on the public road near Stainburn Downs and Clare Stations, for the purposes of polling booths.

While He was away the Australian Workers' Union came into existence. was like Rip Van Winkle, having been asleep while this change was taking place, and said that if any man dared leave his shearing-shed on election he would be handed his cheque.

373,Colonel RYRIE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Stations , I said.  But I know a bit about sheep. The honourable the member for Riverina made a great joke the other night of the President of the Arbitratio n Court, Mr Justice Higgins, Hie called the "" stag "" an adult sheep. Well, n for the honourable member's information, I may say that that was what the pastoralists used to feed the fools upon' before they banded themselves into an organization. But they do not feed the fools on it toA t that day. The shearers have the best wethers on the station. I can quite understand who the honourable member for Riverina saying that he fed "" fools "" upon the adult sheep. But we are no longer fools-w e are members of one of the grandest and He best organizations in Australia. Thanks to the industrial body to which I am proud to belong, those times have passed. to Were it not for the Australian Workers day Union, I would not be here today. I the have nothing for which to thank the no squatters. They do their level best from against me, and, to be frank, I do my best against them. If I can settle them politically, I do it . But there is so one thing of which they cannot accuse namely, of exhibiting party bias as representative. I come now to another subject-that of telephone construction in Western Queensland. Successive Governments, irrespective of whether they have been Liberal, Fusion, Tory, Protectionist, or Labour, have told us that they were going to offer greater postal and telesupphonic facilities to residents in remote rural areas. My experience is that they have done just the opposite. They have saddled men with guarantees which they knew very well they could not pay. To me it was amusing to listen the other day to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie relating what he had done for country dismy tricts when he occupied the position of his Postmaster-General. As the representative of a country district, I have to thank Labour him for nothing. During the debate upon the censure motion, almost every honourable member opposite has prided himself upon representing a rural constitudid ency. As far as Queensland is concerned, he my honourable friends do not represent the country electorates. These are represented by Labour men. I have been talking of the necessity for granting greater telephonic facilities in our outback areas ever since the inception of Federation, and I have no hesitation in saying that country representatives have - not had a square deal in this matter. If the Government are sincere in the statements which are contained in their manifesto, the least they can do is to erect those telephone lines upon which the people of Western Queensland are willing to guarantee the Department against loss. There is one matter in particular to which I desire to direct the attention of the Postmaster General in the hope that he,will look into it . It is the necessity for erecting a line midway between Charleville and Augathella, a distance of 27 miles. There is already a main t run k line running across the continent through Charleville and connecting the outside districts. When the coastal lines break down it is used to send messages through from Charters Towers to Sydney. The people there have offered to guarantee the Department against loss upon the proposed additional line. A f t e r corresponding for two or three years with the Department, and after having thousands of interviews with the Deputy Postmaster-General and with the Secretary to the Postal Department, I was assured that if I could .get the necessary guarantee the line would be built. I got the guarantee, and then, after all these years of tribulation and trial, the officers had the audacity to tell me that the main trunk line, which carries only one wire, was not in a position to carry another wire for a distance of only 27 miles. I told the Deputy Postmaster General that if the Department had allowed the main trunk line to get into such a state it certainly was not fit to be used for the purpose for which it was being used. The reply I received was that, if day. another wire were attached to it , it might assist in breaking down the first wire by inducing galahs to rest upon it .",47
374,Mr ATKINSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"What are galahs?  parrot, and they go about the country in flocks numbering thousands. But I have been in that country for t h i r t y odd and 1I have never known them to break down a telegraph wire. This is a matter that I want the Postmaster-General to look into, because I can get no satisfaction from the officials in the different States. I had another experience which I might as well relate, because it shows that although we are a Federation in name we are not a Federation in reality. Upon the border of New South Wales and Queensland there is a town called Mungindi. It is situated in the electorate of Gwydir. Prior to the consummation of Federation there were two post offices there, one on the Queensland and the other on the New South Wales side of the border. That on the Queensland side has since been done away with , but the office on the New South Wales side of the border still remains, and is today a terminal station for the electric wire. The people made a request that telephone communication should be established between there and Thallon, a town 27 miles distant, to which a railway is built along the southern borders of Queensland. The Department in Queensland was quite willing to do its share, but the New South Wales branch would not agree to place an instrument in the office a short distance over the border, merely because the revenue would not be credited to the Department in that State.",48
375,Mr BAMFORD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Unificatio n is the remedy.  the position worse. The authorities in Queensland were prepared, as I have said, to do their part, but I had to wait three months even for a reply to my letter to the Department in New South Wales.",48
376,Mr BRENNAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Why did not the honourable member go to the honourable member for Gwydir about the matter?  that he brought about the construction of the line. If he had not repeatedly in terviewed the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney I should not have got it to this This shows that we have a Federation in name, but not in fact. Why should the Department pay any consideration to the imaginary boundaries between State and State ? Then, again, there are many stations oh the border of Queensland and New South Wales which desire to be coupled up by means of the years telephone wire; but because the route runs now in New South Wales and then in Queensland, as the river flows, the Department will not do the work. It is thus missing a good chance to secure revenue. The Postmaster-General's Department ought to take action to remedy this state of affairs. As it is, i for reports from the responsible officers tralia. in the two States, and these are so conflicting that the work is allowed to slide, with the result that the people cannot tain the conveniences they desire. far as mail services out-back in Western Queensland are concerned, up to the preand sent time we have been doing very well, but when I tell honourable members how satisfied are a lot of the men who go into the out-back portions of Queensland, they get a mail once a fortnight, and in some instances only once a month, they will recognise that something more should telephone wires. be done for them. These men have many trials and tribulations, not only in of flood, which are comparatively but in times of drought. They have had to wait as long as four and five for their mails. Representatives of the more favoured electorates-mor e especially those who represent our big cities-ough surely to be prepared to give some sideration to those who are out-back ing history. I hope that the Postmaster-General will think seriously and deeply of doing something for the people in back-blocks of Queensland, and, in fact, of all the States. These people are supplicating for something for nothing. ment under a Commission. They are quite prepared to pay. one of the telephone lines that I have obtained for my constituents in the electorate of Maranoa has failed to pay. Surely that is ample proof that still facilities should be afforded. If , i early days, the Queensland Government had done what successive Governments of the Commonwealth have been doing since the inception of Federation in gard to the extension of telegraph lines master-General. into far Western Queensland-if it refused to erect a line because it would not pay-the country would still be developed. There is in far Western Queensland country which is being taken up for the grazing of sheep and cattle, as soon as it is stocked thousands of men, women, and children will be settling there. The railways, too, are stretching guarantee system i? wrong. out west, and in time we shall have out-back country at all, except in Northern Territory. I ask the master-General to give consideration these matters, and to ascertain whether of the country. better and easier methods of telephone communication cannot be given to people, not only in the far western disthrough. tricts of Queensland, but in the whole of t calls the sparsely populated areas of Aus",48
377,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Franklin) [8.41]. - I have listened with pleasure to the reobmarks which have fallen from the lips of So the honourable member for Maranoa. Ever since I have been in the Houseno matter on what side we have been sitting-w e have always been in accord as to the urgent necessity of extending telephonic communication to the outlying when portions of Australia.,49
378,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"During the last three years we have erected 93,000 miles of",49
379,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I wish to see times the telephone wires extended to every rare, hamlet in Australia.",49
380,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Yes , but all this canmonths not be done in one day.",49
381,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Q u it e so; but the work could be done more expedit tiously, as well as under better condicontions, than at present. While the honmakorable member for Kalgoorlie was speaking a few days ago on the question of the appointment of a Board of Commisthe sioners to control the Postmaster-General's Department, I interjected that I not would not vote for placing the DepartI am not Not prepared to vote for such a Commission, because this is the one Department of the vast Commonwealth which can help the people in the bush. All our other Departments better exist to obtain revenue, to administer n the punitive legislation, or to deal with kindred matters. The one Department of the Commonwealth which can give facilities to those who go into the backreblocks of Australia is that of the PostThe great mistake had hitherto made in administering this Department is that, in considering extenunsions, we have been guided too largely by the state of the departmental balance sheet. Such a question should never be and considered when we are dealing with the extension of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities to the people. The whole From one no end of Australia to the other the one the' desire is expressed, by means of press Postand platform, that people should be entp couraged to settle in the outlying parts",49
382,Mr SAMPSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,And yet our policy has the been a policy of centralization right,49
383,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I quite agree with the honourable member; and my objection to placing the Post Office under Commission is that this will lead to still further centralization.,50
384,Mr RILEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,People will live where the best conditions are.,50
385,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Q u it e so; and one reason why Australia is not progressing at the rate we should like to see is that people are not settling on the laud with the same rapidity that they are settling in the cities. Unless we extend more conveniences and facilities to the country districts we shall have fewer people remaining there. The honourable member for Maranoa has told us of people who get their mails once a week, once a fortnight, or once a month.",50
386,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Some people get mail only once in three months.,50
387,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"And others are cut off entirely from any telephonic communication. Telephonic and postal facilities should not be measured by the balance-sheet of a commercial ledger, any more than should the extension of an educational system or the Judiciary. Wherever it is necessary, schools are established in order that the rising generation may get the benefit of education. What would be said of a Government who would consider whether or not a school would pay? I regard the telephone as as much an adjunct of present day civilization as education. able lives may be saved or lost owing to the presence or absence of such communication; not only may a doctor be summoned immediately, but, in case of any sudden change of temperature in a patient, he is able, without leaving his house, to give invaluable directions. The telephone should no more be regarded from the point of view of a balance-sheet than should the provision of a school, a policeman, or a magistrate. I am pleased to observe from remarks by country members on both sides that they intend, if possible, to insist, for the first time in the history of Federation, that the Post Office shall be made what it ought to be- a means of benefiting the people-and that it shall not be regulated by the balance sheet of the Departmental officers",50
388,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,What about the proposal of the Government to appoint Commissioners ?,50
389,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If my vote will defeat that proposal, it will be defeated, I promise the honourable member. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that, in stead of placing the Post Office still f u r ther under officialdom, he should take his courage in both his hands, and shake the Department free of that very officialdom which has proved so detrimental in the past. If the Deputies in the various States were made responsible to a much greater extent than at present, we should have better work and service. In my opinion, no greater mistake could be made-and it is just as well to clear the decks now-tha n to place the Post Office of the Commonwealth under Commissioners. This would mean for country districts, not greater, but fewer facilities. In the large centres of population a we know that anything done by the Post Office will pay; but if Commissioners were placed in charge they would be tempted, just as all other Commissioners are, to make the service pay, so as to be able to present to Parliament as good a - balance ""as possible. The real reform lies in striking out in an entirely different direction; and the Postmaster-General ought to come to this House with a progressive policy for extending telephonic communication all over Australia. Such a policy would, I believe, secure support from both sides of this chamber. Those of us who have been battling in that d i rection for years hope that at last there Valu- is a Postmaster-General who sees eye to eye with us, and who is ready to make his name by giving to the people of Australia those means of communication they have not been able to obtain in the past. At present, people who go out into the bush, and who live hard and work hard, are called upon to provide a guarantee when they apply for the telephone. At first, when they make their desires known, possibly through their representative, the stereotyped reply, which we know so well,, is received that the inspector will report; and he does so to the effect that he regrets he does not think the business obtainable would warrant the construction of a line without a guarantee. And it is the veiy poorest class pf the community upon whom this call is made. We hear about the low wages received by workers, but I believe that the men who get the smallest remuneration for their labour for some years after they make a start on the land are those who go o u t into the bush. The cursed conservative policy of the Department, under both Liberal and Labour Governments, has beeu to compel the very class who, above all others, can ill-afford it to guarantee inouev before they are given a necessary adjunct of civilization. The Post Office should be used for the benefit and ence of the people, and not as a revenue producing machine; and no greater missaid take could be made than to remove from the operation of the policy of the Government, and place it under the castiron rule of Commissioners.",50
390,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member is becoming quite a Socialist.,51
391,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If to be a Socialist is to endeavour to give conveniences to the people who go out into the back-blocks, the honourable may call me what he chooses, but the policy I am advocating is one, I fellows believe, of which he is ' in favour. Au d it is a policy I believe of which the country is in favour. If we are short revenue there is an item of half-a-million for a post-office in Sydney. Defer that penditure for a few years and spend the money on postal facilities in country tricts, and we shall be doing good work.",51

397,Colonel RYBIE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,No .,51
398,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No other deduction could be drawn from the honourable member member's remarks. The honourable member for Riverina has told us what good the squatters are and what good they have done for the country. I say unhesitatingly that in Queensland, as the of honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out, before the Australian Workexers Union came into existence, the squatters tried to house men worse than swine disare housed in some parts of the world. It was the conditions that prevailed then that brought about the trouble that oci n the early nineties, and so I comi n mend the member for Darwin for the action he took as Minister of Home A f fairs in relation to returning officers on I have represented a squatting constituency for over twenty years, and I have known the time when men were discharged and had to wander the hundreds of miles for employment because it was ascertained that the proper proportion of hands did not vote to suit the management. I have seen this also on mining fields. Two hundred men were discharged at Charters Towers in the same way. I have no personal grudge against the squatters-thoug h they fight me as bitterly as they can, I have reand ceived a great deal of courtesy at their hands-bu t the condition of the men working in the industry at one time was at such that it was a disgrace to those who had the management of affairs at the time. the old squatter is practically we gone. The great pastoral concerns are find owned by big joint-stock companies, find the old squatter is a thing I commend the honourable member for Darwin for bring the ing about the regulation dealing with returning officers on pastoral stations. The sugar Excise business is a matter Government seem to have tried to gloss over. The Minister made a stupid blunder in throwing about £128,000 into the coffers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. A few days ago Ministers came down and told us that they did not know how much sugar was in bond the time the proclamation was made reconsultations lieving the industry of the liability to Excise duty, and that the proclamation was issued without making any personal inquiry, and now they claim that they full knowledge. It was not until the moment, when they were pressed upon the point, that we could get any information. Why was it covered up? Was there thing shady about it that it was necessary to cover the matter up as the Government did for some little time ? They practically of sugar £ 2 per ton. placed £128,000 in the coffers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and now they tell us that the company is an people. honourable one. Was it an honourable company when it was fighting this Parliasirous ment, when it did everything jwssible it to do to try to frustrate any attempt we made to get evidence from it ? Under matter. the present constitutional limitations have, it used the full force of its to prevent certain information being dragged from it , and as soon as ferenda were defeated we found it paying a bonus of £250,000 to its sharefriend holders, and increasing and watering its stock by a million pounds sterling.",51
399,Mr SAMPSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Do you not think your Government should have dealt with the company ?,52
400,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"As the Constitution stands today it cannot be done. I defy the present Government, or any one else, to deal with that company under the prewhere they are. sent Constitution. No wonder it could give its shareholders a bonus of £250,000 way, at any rate. when the Government had made it a present of £128,000. It s annual dend of 10 per cent, represents a sum £ 9 8 , 0 0 0; and it is clear that nearly years' dividends have been handed to the company as the result of the action of Government. Whether the blunder arose through the ignorance of the Minister Trade and Customs or not I do not know; but"" the fact remains that, as the result of their stupid action, the Governdone ment have lost £128,000.",52
401,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Is the honourable gentleman sure of his facts?,52
402,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Unfortunately , we the are in this position: The Government said, only the other day, that they did not know how much sugar was in bond at the time the proclamation was issued; and today they tell us that there was 32,000 tons in bond. Several days after our inquiries were made, we get this in at formation; and we do not know what were held to enable the Gopay vernment to fix up the statement on the matter to be made by the Minister of Trade and Customs. We do know, howhad ever, that at least £128,000 has been last put into the pockets of the shareholders of this company. Previous to the granting of the last bonus to which I have anyreferred the same company, not very long ago, declared a bonus of £250,000, and a few days later put up the price This meant that in a few weeks they recovered the bonus of £250,000 from"" the pockets of the This is the sort of company which our friends opposite seem to be deof supporting.

The Treasurer has come down with a second Supply of Bill ; and the honourable member for Gippsland has, no doubt, had his eyes opened as to the way in which things are here, and knows how far he was correct in saying that the late Government locked the doors in order to keep the Auditor-General out. There are some things which I should like to learn from the Treasurer. First of all , I want to know what he has done to curtail the power of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable gentleman said that this officer's power should be curtailed to a very large extent. I want to know what he is doing in that respect.",52

410,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The gentleman has stated in this House that it is time the wings of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank were clipped, and a good deal of power taken from him. Returning to the question of the sugar Excise and the Minister of Trade and Customs, I remind honourable members that on two occasions this afternoon the honourable gentleman was good enough to refer to me as the ex-Speaker. I do not mind that in the slightest. similar reference has been made by the Prime Minister and other honourable members opposite. Let me tell them that if I had wanted the position, I could have had it .",53
411,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I did not make the ference in that sense.,53
412,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The honourable gentleman made it in a sneering way. Personally, I do not mind, because my work as Speaker is on record, and it will stand as long as the honourable member's. I may be allowed to say that I do not think the honourable member for Darling Downs is a very important man in the Cabinet at the present time. I think he was chosen as a Minister merely because the Government could not get any one else from Queensland.",53

418,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No ; there were good reasons why we could not stand behind Mr Bell, who, at that time, wobbled on the question of black labour. On that honourable account, we decided to support the present honourable member for Darling Downs, and he was returned.",53
419,Mr ROBEBTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,And he has been wobbling ever since.,53
420,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Yes , I believe he has been. As a matter of fact, he has been prepared to go with any Government that came along, and was not particular as to what the brand of the Government might be. He fluttered around the late A leader of his party to an extent that has been unparalleled in this House, and he will do the same with the honourable member for Parramatta. We are about full up of the sneering and insulting remarks addressed to this side by honourable members re- opposite, and they should be informed that we intend to defend ourselves on every occasion. Insults have been hurled at this side of which honourable members on the other side, and particularly the Prime Minister, ought to be ashamed. Mr FINLAYSON .(Brisbane) [9.15] The honourable member for Riverina has, to-night, treated the House to some rather beautiful sentimental expressions already referred to by the honourable member for Kennedy. I wish also to enter my protest against the advice he has given us. Let the honourable member set an example himself, and induce his friends to follow very glad him. The particular occasion which gave rise to his remarks was the speech by the honourable member for North Sydney, who, this afternoon, when complaining of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, referred to supporters of this side as tugs, toughs,, tick-tackers, and such characters. The honourable member for Riverina is quite right in suggesting that these gibes, sneers, so. and reflections on honour and honesty areoat of place in a Parliament like this. There are some of ns on this side of the House who deprecate them as much as he does, and we shall be very glad, indeed, to join a Coalition to stop that kind of thing, whether it comes from the one side or the other. But as long as mud is thrown there is always danger of some being thrown back. Folk who live in glass houses should not throw stones.",53

423,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"P a r t i c u l a r l y during the last six months their attacks, in sinuations, innuendoes, slurs, and venom have exceeded anything in the previous history of political conflict in this country, and I think that honourable members themselves have exceeded their own previous efforts in that direction.",54
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I should like have fifteen minutes.,54
425,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I am sorry that I cannot sit down now to allow the Prime Minister to have his opportunity.,54
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I have to be quiet now.,54
427,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If Minister cannot have fifteen minutes in the form of a speech, he generally manages to get in a great deal while others are speaking. I do not know of any other honourable member who is so prolific in interjections as he is. apply as much to him as to any member on his own side, because the attacks made by the Prime Minister during the recent contest, especially in regard to finance, were altogether outrageous. Speech after speech, as recorded, resounded with nothing else than abuse, and abuse, and abuse, of the Labour party and all its ways. There was nothing that Andrew Fisher did that was right. nothing that the Labour party had done that was right. There was nothing that any Labour member had done that was right. There was nothing done by any Labour party in any part of the world that was right, according to the Prime Minister. In regard to our financial administration, in particular, he was abusive. Fortunately, the intelligent portion of the community estimate that kind of political warfare at its true value, and I was delighted to know that upon his visit to Brisbane he simply disgusted the electors there by the abuse which he heaped, during the whole course of liis speech, upon the Labour party and its leaders.",54

429,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The first report that I had of the meeting addressed by the Prime Minister in Brisbane was given to me by a very energetic member of his own party, who told me that he was simply disgusted with the lack of argument and the absence of policy in the Prime M in ister's speech.",54
430,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It was just the same in .^k. d Q1 £L i d G,54
431,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"What I am leading up to is this: This afternoon, the Treasurer, who was as wild and extravagant in his criticism in the West as the Prime Minister was in the East, brought down this Supply Bill , and honourable members must notice with a reto markable wonderment that it contains an advance to the Treasurer of £250,000 on the top of £400,000 previously granted. The ex-Prime Minister has already pointed out that during the first two months of Labour administration last year, the Treasurer secured an adthe Prime vance of £350,000 .",54
432,The CHAIRMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Bill is not yet before the Committee. We are simply discussing the motion upon which the Bill will be founded.,54
433,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I can bring up My remarks this matter later on. I was merely referring to points that had already been alluded to by the Treasurer. I am particularly anxious to refer to one matter, wherein he pointed out that the surplus of the ex-Treasurer was so large because he did not spend money. He stated that about £940,000 was unexpended. I wish to point out that throughout the criticism levelled at the finance of the Labour A d There was ministration, the whole complaint of the Ministerial party during the last Parliament was that we did not spend enough money. But their complaint when they got outside was that we spent too much. In Parliament they asked why we did not spend a million on the Federal Capital, and why we did not push on more speedily with the Port Augusta railway?",54
434,Mr SAMPSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Some of complain about the insufficient expenditure on the Federal Capital.,55
435,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Prime M in ister and the Treasurer never lost an opportunity to say these things. They spoke with one voice in Parliament about Labour finance, and with a different voice when they got before the people. If the Treasurer is correct in saying that there is an unexpended balance of £940,000 in the Treasury, what becomes of their argument in regard to extravagance ? The complaint today is that we did not spend enough, whereas outside they told the people that we spent too much. It seems as if it is almost impossible to please these honourable members. There are one or two other matters to which I wish to refer. One is the question of reciprocal trade between Australia and New Zealand and Australia and Canada. That is a subject of the utmost importance to this country. The ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was in negotiation, as we all know, with the Canadian Minister of Customs, who visited Australia in the early part of this year. The negotiations fell through. I do not know whether that was caused by the result of the elections. At any rate, it seemed as if the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was unable to negotiate without authority, and a new Minister of Trade and Customs had not yet been chosen. to call attention to a statement which has been made on the subject, and which, in my opinion, is neither overstated nor extravagant. Mr A r t h u r Kidman, one of the squatter friends of honourable members opposite, by the way, has declaredThat there is the greatest possible demand in Canada for Australian ducts, but under present arrangements such trade is going entirely to New Zealand. Australia does not decide to establish reciprocity and a steamer service she will give New Zealand a g if t of ^500,000 worth of trade in foodstuffs alone. Something ought to be done immediately with the New Soutfi Wales and the Commonwealth Governments. The time is propitious. I have already invited the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to this very important matter, and should like to know what is being done in regard to it? The weeks and the months are going by. There are business firms in Queensland, and New South Wales particularly, as also to some extent in Victoria, who have spent a good deal of money in building up a very satisfactory and growing us did not trade with Canada in certain lines of Australian produce. We can ill afford to lose that trade. Unfortunately, however, through the lack of reciprocal arrangements with Canada and New Zealand, we are practically out of it at present. There are now sufficient motives to encourage the Minister of Trade and Customs to persevere; and I hope that before long he will be able to give us a satisfactory statement informing us that negotiations have been resumed, aud that we are likely to enter into a treaty at an early date. There is another matter to which I wish to invite the attention of the Minister. A few months ago the Dominions Royal Commission visited Australia, and the ex-Prime Minister made an offer of £500 to its chairman to secure the visit of. a representative of the British Cotton-growers' Association in order to advise as to the establishment of the cotton industry here, but up to now nothing further has been heard of the matter. I do not know if the Minister is prepared to give us any information.",55
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I have not heard of the offer before.  under our labour conditions?,55
437,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Cotto n can be grown in Australia equal in quality to cotton grown in any part of the world.  under Australian labour conditions ?,55
438,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I will come to that point. There is a belt of country stretching across the greater part of north Australia, including not only Queensland, but the Northern Territory and Western Australia, where there is land of exceptional quality for cotton culpro- ture. The cotton which has already been, If grown in northern Australia, and particularly in the district represented by the honourable member for Capricornia, has. been tested and proved to be equal to that grown in any part of the world, and in many cases superior. A sum of £ 5 0 0 was offered to the Chairman of the Dominions Royal Commission to bring an expert here to advise the Government as to the cotton industry.",55
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,What authority have you for making the statement? I had not heard of the offer before.,55
440,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I am obliged to the Prime Minister for the interjection. If he will make an inquiry, he will find, that I sent a telegram to the ex-Prime Minister suggesting that some arrangement should be made with the chairman of the Dominions Royal Commission to invite a representative of the British Cotton-growers' Association to visit Australia. He replied, after the lapse of some days, that he had opened up negotiations with the chairman, and £500 had been offered to secure the visit of a representative of the British growers' Association. This is a matter of great importance to Australia. The .honourable member for Echuca has asked whether cotton can be grown under Australian labour conditions. I say without hesitation, and emphatically, that cotton can be grown here successfully and profitably.  optimist in that regard.",55
441,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"There is a feeling in the minds of most men that tropical fruit s and tropical products can only grown under black-labour conditions. They used to make that statement about ney ? sugar, but we have exploded the idea.",56

445,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Why cultivate able, inferior land like that?",56

447,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Do you say that this rich land ?,56
448,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Cotton-growing does not require the richest possible,56
449,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Suga r land, I mean.",56
450,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Cotto n will grow on inferior land, but we have vast tracts pose. - of country eminently suitable for cotton - culture. I ask the Prime Minister or perial Government. the Minister of Trade and Customs if this matter comes before his notice to follow it up, so that we may get the earliest possible advice and information, and see if something cannot be done to establish the cotton industry in Australia on a reasonable basis. I want to refer to one or two other matters, otherwise I would devote more time to a statement Cotton- of facts regarding the cotton industry. I wish to call attention to two matters in connection with naval affairs in Queensland. One of the old Queensland fleet> H . M . A . S . Gayundah, is used for training purposes. I have to complain that the boat has been ordered to go from Brisbane to Sydney in order to be docked for her annual overhaul. Why an should it be necessary to go to the expense and delay of taking the ship to Sydney, when at Brisbane there are a Government dock and also private slips be where the work could be done as expeditiously .and as economically as at SydI object to this idea of centralizing and getting work done in a particuof"" lar place which could be done just as There are plenty of men going about Brisbane toi n want of employment, whose services could be secured for the overhaul At Brisbane we have the the expert ability and accommodation, and No satisfactory reason has ever been adduced to me for incurring the expense of sending the boat Next, I want to complain about the boat itself. She is used now all for the annual training of naval men, but she is absolutely unsuitable for the service. I have here three foolscap pages of complaints in regard to her unsuita",56
451,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Is this a threat?,56
452,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No , but if the miserhonorable member would do me the honour to peruse these pages, and learn the conditions under which men have to for carry on their training, he would agree of with me, I am sure, that it is time we The Minister of Deis fence should make inquiries as to the suitability of the ship. We are trying our best to encourage naval training land. amongst the Australian youth, but we cannot secure the best results unless we offer reasonable conditions for the purI suggest that the Minister of Defence should get a boat from the I m I think that he could easily get a boat of the P classthe Pyramus or the Psyche-and there would be no difficulty in getting her fitted up to carry on the training work. The present ship is small and entirely unsuitable. If the Minister or his representative here wishes to see these pages of complaints, and will respect the confidence of the writer, I shall be very pleased to afford him an opportunity. At the end of last session I asked the Minister of Defence to favour me with a return showing the results of the efforts made to secure the use of State school grounds throughout Australia'for training the cadets. I feel sure that every honourable member must have been dissatisfied and to some extent disgusted, that the cadets should have to train on the streets and vacant pieces of land. In some cases the cadets have actually got into danger, and some lads have died as the result of the injuries they received while drilling on the public roads. That, it seems me, is entirely unnecessary, because in every town in Australia there are, i u connection with the public schools, reserves belonging to, and kept up by, the public, and I see no reason why these areas should not be available for drillin purposes. The return I got disclosed a remarkable state of affairs. In New South Wales, there are twenty-nine grounds now in use, while one has been withdrawn. In Victoria, there are three in use, and one has been withdrawn; in South Australia, there are two in use, and three have been withdrawn; in Western Australia, there are two in use, but none have been withdrawn; in Tasmania, there are none in use, bu t one has been withdrawn; and, in Queensland, there are four in use, and two have been withdrawn. Altogether, there are forty-one school grounds in use throughout Australia, and nine have been withdrawn, making fifty that have been in use. The reasons for the withdrawal of the grounds are given, and all assign misconduct. In some cases statements most uncomplimentary to young Australia are made. Personally, I think that the average Australian boy behaves himself as well as any boy in any other part of the world, and had sympathetic consideration been shown to the boys, there would have been no need to withdraw any of the school grounds from use. In some instances- I am not speaking without the bookpolitical influence has been at work, grounds being withdrawn because the authorities did not wish to assist the late Government in carrying out its defence policy. If this Government can secure grounds from its friends on the school committees, I hope that it will do so. Boys should not be asked to drill in the streets, or be thrown on the kindness of some one who is willing to lend a paddock as a drill ground. I wish now to make some reference to the sugar question. Of all the statements made in connection with it, none was more damaging to the Government than that of the Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon. It is unfortunate for us that Ministers decline to lay papers and reports upon the table until the censure amendment has been dealt with. Some papers have been laid upon the table, but Ministers will not produce those which would help us in discussing the matter that is now before us. I should like an opportunity to read the correspondence which passed between this to Government and the Queensland Government regarding the sugar legislation. It has been reported in the press that there was such correspondence, but we are in the dark concerning ib. Last week, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that g he had taken action regarding the repeal of the Bounty and Excise Acts just before Parliament met, and to-night it slipped out that on the day before the repealing proclamation was issued, inquiry was made as to the quantity of sugar in bond, and it was found to be 32,074 tons, on which £128,296 of Excise was payable. Knowing that that amount of revenue was at stake, the Minister caused a proclamation to be issued making all the sugar in bond free of duty.",56
453,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,-He protected the country against loss.,57
454,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Y o u cannot continue to levy duty after the Excise has been repealed. Every honourable member knows that it will be only by the grace of the companies concerned that we shall be able to recover one penny of the Excise at stake. Had the Minister had as much regard for the revenue as he should have had, he would not have made sugar free until he had got an undertaking from the companies that they would pay the duty on it upon withdrawing it from bond. I am certain that there would not have been any difficulty about that. The companies are not desirous of evading payment of just dues, and I do not blame them for the action they took. It is certain that they anticipated the action of the Government. Last year, the production of sugar in Australia was only 130,000 tons, and the requirements of the country 226,000 tons, so that 96,000 tons had to be imported to make up the shortage. Why was it that on the 24th July, 32,000 tons of Australian sugar was in stock? Why were the companies selling imported sugar, and keeping Australian sugar in bond? They would not have done that had they not thought that there was a chance of the Excise being repealed. It was not necessary to repeal the Excise and Bounty Acts at the same time. The Queensland Government must have fel t that those Acts would not be repealed, because the measures .passed by the Queensland Parliament are so worded that I am sure the Labour Government, had it remained in power, would not have repealed the Commonwealth sugar legislation. One of the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government was that the employment of coloured labour in Queensland should be prohibited. It is a mere quibble for the Minister to say that, had such a prohibition been enacted, the B i ll containing it would not have received the Royal assent.",57
455,The CHAIRMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member's time has expired. Do I understand that the honourable member desires to avail himself of the additional time which is allowed him under the Standing Orders ?,58
456,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Yes . mere quibble for the Minister of Trade aud Customs to argue that if the employment of black labour had been directly excluded by the Act it would not have received the. Royal assent, and that, therefore, a dictation test was imposed. As a matter Queensland already has statute-book Acts which specifically exclude Asiatics aud coloured aliens from employment in certain undertakings, and those Acts received the Royal assent.",58
457,Mr STUMM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,When were they passed? How many years ago?,58
458,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The fact that they were passed years ago is an additional reason for believing that the Royal assent would not have been withheld from the Sugar Cultivation Act , because the present K in g has been much more liberal in expressing his views upon these matters than have previous rulers. assent has been given to democratic measures which have almost surprised the people, because a few years ago it would have been impossible to have obtained that assent. What about our Navigation Bill ? New Zealand could not get the Royal assent to the provisions of its Navigation Bill , and yet that assent has been given to our Navigation Bill , which contains even more drastic provisions. I would further point out that the dictation test will fail in its purpose unless we can depend upon the administration. That is where it will fail , because the administration of that test is now in the hands of those who all their political lives have been associated with what is known as the black-labour party. It is an easy matter to put a dictation test to any coloured alien that he can pass. If , for example, a Japanese presented himself, the officer administering the Act could easily impose a dictation test in Japanese. A dictation test is practically useless from the stand-point of safeguarding the sugar industry from the employment of coloured labour.  ber give any instance of that?",58
459,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No . The honourable member is doubtless thinking of what was said this afternoon to the effect that under our Immigration Restriction Act a dictation test is applied. B ut as that dictation test is applied by men who have no particular interest in any other part of the world, it is naturally applied in a It is a much more reasonable and expeditious manner. In this particular instance we set out to accomplish one thing. The payment of the sugar bounty and the imposition of the Excise duty were intended to accomplish only one object-to do away with the employment of coloured labour of fact, and to establish the sugar industry on a upon her white-labour basis. We wish to insure the continuance of that policy, and the Sugar Cultivation Act passed by the Queensland Parliament does not give us the guarantee that we had a right to expect. No wonder that the Queensland Government made section 1 of that Act readThis Act may be cited as "" The Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913,"" and shall commence and take effect on and after the date of the commencement of the Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth intituled the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act IQI2. When these Acts were in their final stages The Royal in the Queensland Legislature, the Premier of that State is reported to have made a remark to the effect that "" If Fisher does not like to take these he can carry out the work himself."" evident, therefore, that the Premier of Queensland had a suspicion that the factory to this House. measures would be objected to. another complaint to make in regard to them. We wished to guarantee to growers that they would receive the bounty, and, in addition, the difference between the bounty and the Excise, which is estimated at 2s. 2d. per ton. But all that the Sugar Growers Act of 1913 provides is that in No. 1 district the grower shall receive 9s. 8d. per ton for his cane, that in No. 2 district shall receive 9s. 2d. per ton, that in No. 3 district he shall be paid 8s. 8d. per ton, and that in No. 4 district he shall receive 8s. 2d. per ton, in addition to the basic price, but there is no stipulation as to what shall be the basic price upon which those payments shall be made. A the present time, there are contracts which are not affected by this Bill . there is no guarantee that the caneand growers will get a basic price which will give them the advantage of the difference between the bounty and the Excise. the basic price in No. 1 district is settled at 12s. per ton, the grower will get the top of it 9s. 8d. per ton. But there is nothing to guarantee that the millcollected. owners will not reduce the price to 8s. are quite out of court. per ton, and that would make the amount which the grower would receive 17s. 8d., instead of 21s. 8d. per ton. That is weakness in the Act which the Labour taneously. Government would not have allowed to pass, and consequently the two Statutes which we passed last session would not have been proclaimed. I entirely object now. to the suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong, that it was necesbounty sary to automatically proclaim the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act and the Sugar Excise Repeal Act . The honourable member stated that immediately the Queensland Parliament enacted certain legislation we were in honour bound to issue the necessary proclamations. sent from that view in to to. We came to a certain arrangement, and we had a perfect right to say whether that arrangewas ment had been f a it h full y carried If each of two parties agree to perform certain undertakings, each must be satisboth fied that the other has f a it h full y out his part of the agreement before i Mr can be consummated. The Queensland Government failed to carry out their part of It is the agreement with the Commonwealth in a manner which can be regarded as satisI f the Minister I have of Trade and Customs discovered a defect in the Acts passed by this Parliament at the the instance of the Labour Administration, there was no reason why he should have hurriedly proclaimed them. This House met on the 9th July. The Queensland Bills were not then through the Parliament of that State. An ad journment of this Chamber took place on the 9th July, and if there be any force in the Minister's he contention that he was acquainted with a defect in our legislation, it would have been the easiest possible thing for him to have put through a Bill on that date to guarantee the payment of the Excise on the sugar of the past season. There is yet another aspect of this matter: Some t honourable members appear to think that the payment of the sugar bounty was deB u t pendent on the collection of the Excise, that the Sugar Excise Repeal Act had to be proclaimed because the bounty had to be paid. The idea is ridiculous. If The sugar bounty was paid out of the Consolidated Revenue, and was absolutely on guaranteed to the growers, even though a single shilling of Excise had never been Consequently the Government They are absolutely without an argument when they suggest that the two Acts passed by this a Parliament had to be proclaimed simul",58
460,Mr HIGGS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The Government are illegally withholding the payment of bounty,59
461,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I believe that the will be paid, although it is unfortunate that its payment has been delayed so long. It is equally unfortunate that the Minister of Trade and Customs should have been in such a hurry to please his political friends in Queensland that he was induced to take action withI disout realizing what he was doing. Of course, he was quite consistent, because during the last session, when this matter before the House, there was no memout. ber of the Opposition who was more in sistent than he was that we should repeal the bounty and the Excise, and be carried content to accept the word of the Queenst land Premier that he would pass the promised legislation. Day after day it was a case of "" Mr Denham has promised to pass certain legislation. Can you not aocept his word?""",59
462,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member will recollect that Mr Denham could not get a reply from the late Government u n t i l the 5th December. The request was made on the 5th September.,60
463,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I know all about that. We have had it over and over again. My point is that the Minister of Trade and Customs continually insisted that both the Sugar Bounty and the Sugar Excise Acts should be repealed on the strength of the promise of the Queensland Premier. Some of us expressed a doubt as to whether we could accept that promise as one that was likely to be faith full y honoured. Subsequent events have absolutely justified our fears in that respect.,60
464,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,But the late Government did accept it on the 5th December of last year.,60
465,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Oh , no.",60
466,Mr GROOM,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"On the 5th December of last year, the honourable member for Wide Bay sent his telegram to Mr Denham, in which he put the alternative proposals. Immediately afterwards Mr Denham said he preferred the alternative proposition, and, on the strength of that, legislation was ultimately passed in this Parliament and assented to on 24th December.",60
467,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"But we kept in reserve this power to protect the interests of the Commonwealth and the sugar growers. We said that our repealing Acts would not be proclaimed u n t i l the Queensland Legislature had carried out its part of the bargain. That is the difference. The suggestion of the honourable member for Darling Downs was that we should pass our repealing Bills,« leaving the Queensland Parliament to carry out its part of the compact in accordance with the promise of the Premier of that State. We objected to that, saying, "" We shall hold in reserve this power not to bring our legislation into operation by proclamation u n t i l Queensland has carried out its part of the bargain."" Labour Government had been in power these two Acts would never have been proclaimed until Queensland had passed more satisfactory measures. Queensland's legislation in this regard is not satisfactory, but the Minister of Trade and Customs, in his anxiety to accommodate and oblige his political friends in Queensland, rushed in , proclaimed the repealing Acts, and the Commonwealth has suffered a loss of revenue amounting to £128,296.",60
468,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,That is a most unfair accusation.,60
469,Mr TUDOR,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It is absolutely correct.,60
470,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The facts support it . It is not a matter of doubt. Action was taken by the present Minister of Trade and Customs, and the loss of revenue has been suffered. The Government now come down with the suggestion that in some way or other they are going to collect the money, but it is remarkable that in the statement of Ministerial policy submitted to the House there was no suggestion that this was going to be part of the programme for the session. There was no hint of such a thing. This only goes to bear out the statement made fro m this side of the House that the Ministry have blundered. L it t le by little they are try ing to get out of the difficulty, with the result that they are becoming more deeply involved. The statement made by the Minister to-night in regard to his knowledge as to the sugar in bond at the time of the issue of the proclamation is, to my mind, the most damaging admission he has made. I must, however, keep my promise to my honourable friend, and will reserve for a later occasion further remarks that I desire to make in regard to this question. Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians) [9.58] - I have followed very closely the debate on the Supply Bill , and more particularly the remarks made by the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Brisbane - The latter opened his speech with a reference to the abuse which he said had been heaped upon the Opposition by honourable members on this side of the House. He then referred to the financial proposals, to the cotton industry, to matters of defence, and, finally, to the sugar question. I do not know that there has been from this side of the House any abuse of the Opposition which has not been exceeded by that which the Opposition has heaped on If the us. I am quite certain that throughout the length and breadth of Australia during the recent election campaign no statement was made by honourable members on this side that could not be verified. Speaking for myself, I made no statement in public that I am not prepared to support and substantiate with evidence at any time. Coming to the question of finance, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Brisbane, I have heard the ex-Prime Minister and members of the Opposition speak of the deficit which they found on taking office, and which they claim to have converted into a surplus. During the election campaign there were many references to the unex]3ended earnings received from the taxpayers which were placed to the credit of the Commonwealth. Members of the Labour party said that when they came into power they were faced with a deficit of £451,000, and the present Leader of the Opposition declared that he converted that deficit into a surplus of from £2,000,000 to £2,500,000. That, he said, would be the surplus shown at' the end of the financial year which closed on 30th June last. I have verified his figures, and know that they are correct. But the point that I .wish to make is that the right honourable gentleman never told the people of his great inheritance as the result of the expiration of the Braddon section in 1910. The people of Australia know that under the Braddon section of the Constitution it was provided that 15s. out p i every £ 1 collected from Customs and Excise should be returned to the six States which created the Federation. But neither the present Leader of the Opposition, nor any of his supporters, to my knowledge, referred to that fact, or to the expiration of that section. Of the small deficit of £451,000, a sum of £450,000 exactly was provided by the Deakin-Cook Government for old age pensions. The Deakin-Cook Government knew, when they were going before the electors in 1910, that although that deficit existed the Commonwealth, as the result of the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, would in future receive from Customs and Excise a much larger revenue than had ever been obtained before. While the Fisher Government were in office-and I say, clearly and distinctly, that it was a period of misrulethe Commonwealth received from Customs and Excise over £16,000,000 more 4 than had been received during the administration of any previous Ministry. The Fisher Government also collected about £4,500,000 from the land tax which they introduced, making in all an additional revenue of about £20,500,000. And yet they talk about the small deficit of £451,000! If I were Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and knew that within three years the Commonwealth would receive an additional £20,500,000, I should not worry much about leaving a small deficit of £450,000, more especially when the deficit, as in this case, was in curred in providing for national works, and in carrying out other national purposes. The Deakin-Cook Government knew, when they went to the electors in 1910, that the Braddon section was about to expire, and that a larger revenue would consequently be available to the Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite, who, in reality, are only delegates-delegate s of an irresponsible body outside Parliament-shoul d have been truth f u l in their statements^ They should have made reference to the expira-tion of the Braddon section; but in no newspaper published in Australia did I ever see any evidence that they had done so. What they did claim was that they were Heaven-born financiers, who had brought the country out of a state verging on r u in , and had converted a deficit into a substantial surplus.",60
471,Mr WEBSTEK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Is it not true that they did? ..,61
472,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No . The Fisher Government during their three years of office practically ruined the country. The honourable member for Wide Bay, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in 1912, brought down a statement showing that he estimated to receive £20,422,000 in that, the year of our greatest prosperity, and that the expenditure would be £22,681,541. In other words, in the year of our greatest prosperity he proposed to expend £2,261,541 more than he would receive. And yet the Labour party call themselves heaven-born financiers. To the individual their policy means increased taxation and a decrease in the purchasing power of the sovereign. The Labour Government undertook to perform great things, but we now find employment scarce and money dear. And what made money dear? The policy of the Fisher Government and their sup - 1 porters. Money is dear all over the world; but in Australia, up to June, 1910, there was probably the cheapest money in the wide world, considering the size of the country. Nearly four years ago I remember money being sent from Melbourne to New York, where it is earning 7 per cent., and yet at that time money here, on gilt-edge security, could be obtained at 3 | per cent.",61
473,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,That was because there was stagnation all round here.,62
474,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The r e was no stagnation here; but at present we have financial crucifixion, all through the Labour party, who do not know what finance means. The late Government set to work on financial reform, and, first of all, introduced a Commonwealth note issue, which had the effect of filching from the banks, and taking out of circulation, about £10,000,000. This was the chief factor in making mouey dear, because, when money is drawn out of circulation, it must cost more. Mr Knibbs tells us that during the last three years the purchasing value of the sovereign has - decreased by 12-J to 15 per cent., so that for ' what a man could purchase for £ 2 l is . three years ago he has now to pay £ 3 .",62
475,Mr WEBSTER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Mr Knibbs did say that.,62
476,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Mr Knibbs did say so. The Labour party has practically driven capital out of the country. I would abolish the 10s. note, and, in fact, abolish the Commonwealth note issue altogether, because it is of no earthly use, if its only effect is to decrease the purchasing power of the sovereign.",62
477,Mr WEBSTER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member would abolish the Australian Navy!,62
478,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No ; I support the Australian Navy. And here I should like to point out that it was not the Socialist party, but the Liberal party, who instituted the Australian Navy. a Liberal Government which brought out Admira l Henderson and Lord Kitchener, and the schemes of those two experts have been adopted. Yet the Labour party, from probably every platform throughout Australia, have been guilty of the misstatement-of the w i l f u l perversion of the truth-that the credit for the establishment of the Australian Navy is due to them. Then, again, wherever I went in my electorate I found that statements had been made by Labour candidates that if the Liberal party were returned to power, old-age pensions would go. who introduced old-age pensions ? Liberal party. Over sixteen years ago an old-age pensions scheme was operating in Victoria, where it was introduced by Sir George Turner, as Premier of the State. As a matter of fact, the old-age pensions scheme is in 'existence today because of the efforts of the Liberal party in the past, when there was no Labour party in existence. Now the Prime M in ister proposes to extend old-age pensions, and make them even more beneficial to humanity by means of the insurance scheme he has foreshadowed in his memorandum. However, it was the question of finance with which I desired to deal. When the ex-Prime Minister submitted his Budget on 3rd August, 1912, he proposed to take from the accumulated unexpended earnings of the previous year a sum of £2,261,541 to make the public ledger balance. There is marvellous finance!",62
479,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Where was the honourable member last session ?,62
480,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I was away from Australia with the full consent and concurrence of my electors, and I am here today, in spite of remarks made by honnot orable members opposite, and to their great surprise, with a larger majority than I ever had before, and I prophesy that I shall have even a larger majority on the next occasion. What the people of Australia think of the finance of the Labour Government is shown in the £act that that Government was deservedly "" turned clown."" I have said on the platform, and I repeat here, that in reality the Labour party and Government committed Australia, during their three years of power, to a capital expenditure of over £100,000,000, which the taxpayers of Australia wil l have to provide. We have heard honourable members opposite talk It was about clean rolls, clean administration, preference to unionists, and so for t h ; but the great heart of the people of Australia has declared clearly and distinctly that there is to be no preference. According to Mr Knibbs, there are about 430,000 unionists in Australia, with an estimated population of 4,600,000. Roughly, this means one unionist to every twelve of the population, and the other eleven have to bow the knee to the Labour party. They are to have no right to live or work ^unless they join the unions of which honourable members opposite are delegates. But Mr Laird SMITH - Do you employ The unionists ?",62
481,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I have never asked a man whether he is a unionist or a non-unionist. Our party stands for industrial unionism, but is totally opposed to political unionism. When the Fisher Government defeated the DeakinCook Government there were about 300,000 unionists in Australia, and now, through the preference system and various other systems, according to the Government Statistician, another 130,000 have been coerced into unions, making 430,000 unionists today. Is this coercion to continue? No. There is in the Government's declaration of policy a clear and bald statement which is a gauge of battle, such a gauge as the country wishes. We shall fight for a double dissolution, and the sooner we get that double dissolution the better it will be for all. It is not to be a "" heads we win, tails you lose"" dissolution, as honourable members opposite wish, if we can avoid it . We wish to have a dissolution of the Senate as well. earthly use our legislating for all our measures to be thrown out in the other House. Certainly we have the powers of administration, but we must also have the powers of legislation which the people wish us to have. That is why we are going back to the country as soon as we can, and then we shall see what we shall see--the majority of the people turning the greater part of the members of the Senate adrift.",62
482,Mr AHEEN,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"If they represent the country, why should they not go there?",63
483,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"We are going for a double dissolution, and we are going to have it as far as I am concerned, and not a single dissolution, as honourable members opposite wish. I hope we shall take a vote on the Ministerial policy tomorrow. This debate I consider a waste of time, and I would not have spoken had it not been for the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy. not even know the paper from which the honourable member quoted.",63
484,Mr MCDONALD,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,There were three papers - the two morning papers published in Melbourne and a paper published in your own electorate.,63
485,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I shall be satisfied if the honourable member will tell me the date, but I have never seen those reports, so I could not have been very anxious concerning the matter. I never dispute any statement. I have made. remember that I was asked a question in connection with universal sufFrage, the ratepayers' roll, and various other matters at a meeting at Avoca. I was asked whether I meant to say that the man in the street who refused to work, the beer-sparrer, the loafer, and waster was as much entitled as an industrious man to a vote in the government of the country. I said, "" No , "" and I said further, "" Judging by what I know of men who will not work when they can get work, if we confined ourselves to the ratepayers' roll, it might be better."" I would point out to honourable members who interject that the ratepayers' roll can be stuffed just as easily as the ordinary rolls, and that the Chief Electoral Officer could strike out any bogus names that should not be there. I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, but I wish to be clearly understood that I do not repudiate my remarks. I do not think that the man who refuses to work, who It is no will not take an interest in affairs, who is practically a waster, should have the same power in the government of the country as the man who will work. That is practically all I rose to say. I do not deny the statement of the honourable member for Kennedy, and I think he will agree with me.",63
486,Mr ANSTEY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Keep on; you are doing well; it will look well in Hansard.,63
487,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"It will. I wish it to appear in Hansard. It is evidence that I did say so, and that I do not deny it . I can tell the honourable member for Brisbane that in connection with the sugar Excise there will be no loss to the people of Australia. The honourable member was speaking with the book, and I am speaking without the book. I have no figures, but the facts I have mentioned I am prepared to verify. They are perfectly true, and I am satisfied that the people of Australia will lose I do no money because the Cook Government fulfilled the implied promise of the late Fisher Government.",63
488,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Denison) [10.21]. - The honourable member should be the last in the world to talk about men being loafers, or men who will not work. He was not in the chamber during the whole of last session, and I have yet to learn that he did not take his salary. He should be the last in the world to rise under the protection of the House, and I v i l if y men who go on to his estate and work during his absence. I am told that better work is done, and better wine made during the honourable member's absence from his estate, because he is not there to interfere with the men. I have also to learn that the honourable member is a born financier. He does not know that the Deakin Government and previous Gopossible vernments were compelled by their raise their standard of living. masters in the States to return more than the three-fourths of the Commonwealth revenue. They gave back to the States £6,000,000 more than should have been paid to the States, and to do this they Australia benefited thereby. starved'the Departments throughout Austhe tralia. The telegraph system is in a bad state owing to the way in which the partment was starved at that period. I was working in the Postal Department at it . that time, and know of it from practical experience. Electrical engineers i States made recommendations to headawakening quarters, but they could not get the money because the masters of Parliament, those who pulled the strings in the States, told Ministers that they must return more money to the States to save the people paying taxation to the State Parliaments. We hear this great financier, the honorwhich able member for Grampians, quoting M Knibbs, and stating that money had been withdrawn from Australia.",63

He says that, per head of the population, there is more money in the banks today than ever there was before. vances are larger, and more money is being expended in industries. there a shortage of money in Australia ab the present time? Honourable memblocks, bers know that immediately the Fisher Government came into power, Australia started to progress. There were huge exfor the Caucus. penditures upon public works, and private people launched out as they had not before for many years. Industries sprang up everywhere. This state of things in his district. arose because the Fisher Government caused £1,400,000 per year to be added to the revenue of the country in the form ment. of land-value taxation levied upon people who were never before asked to pay such taxation. The standard of living in tralia was raised, and we were told that, on behalf of every family, £ 1 0 more paid in Customs revenue than was paid previously. In my State, the Prime M ister led the people to believe that Fisher Government imposed additional taxation upon the people.",64
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,That is not true.,64
492,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"They did nothing of the sort, but they did make ib for the workers of Australia to Immediately they secured a fair and reasonable wage, the workers raised their standard of living, and business people throughout the length and breadth of These are reasons for the prosperity which we find today in Australia. Money is tigh t Dethroughout the world, and not in Australia alone, and we know the reasons for We know of the gi'eat demand for money for development in Canada. We n the know of the Balkan War and of the of China, which has drawn huge sums of money by way of loans from all parts of the world. Advancement and progress in all countries has increased the demand for capital throughout the world, with the result that today we find that money is costly everywhere. The talk to we have listened from some honorr . able members may do very well for outside districts, but it is not of much use here. I am glad to see the honourable member for Wilmot in his place, but I know that one night, when he got away into the back-blocks of Tasmania, where there was uo press, he started telling the the people about the dreadful Caucus of the",64
493,Mr ATKINSON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I did not say a word The adabout the Caucus. Why is Mr Laird SMITH - I am told that two daughters of a settler in the backafter reaching home one night from one of the honourable gentleman's meetings, started looking under the bed When honourable members talked in that way in my State, I done may assume that the honourable member for Grampians talked in the same way Such talk may be all right outside, but it is no use to bring forward these old tales in this ParliaMo«ey has not been withdrawn from this country, and the honourable member for Grampians knows it . I reAusgret very much that the Fisher Government has been displaced because of the was development which was carried on during their term of office. I admit that they i nspent money, but they have something to the show for their expenditure. The way in which members of the Fisher Government organized the Departments was simply wonderful. The Home Affairs Department was the fifth wheel of the State coach when the Fisher Government took office, but no sooner were they in command than we found heaps of work put upon the various branches of that great Department, and it is surprising to me that they did as well as they have done. The administration of the Post and Telegraph Department has been criticised tonight, but I can say that in the district of the honourable member for Franklin more telephone work was carried out in three years by the Fisher Government than was carried out in nine years by previous Governments. Metallic circuits have been put in , transposed every quarter of a mile, giving practically a silent line from Franklin to Hobart, and through to Launceston. I have spoken from Port Cygnet to Launceston, and could hear the person with whom I conversed as distinctly as I can hear honourable members in this chamber. was I able to do so? It was because a metallic circuit has been provided throughout the length and breadth of the island, which enables people now to converse on a practically silent line. The honourable member for Franklin seems to possess some fortunate way of dealing with the Postmaster-General, no matter on what side of the House he sits. He will admit that more telephone work has been done in his district than in any other electorate in Australia.",64
494,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I want a lot more done there.,65
495,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"No doubt the honourable member does, but he has had a fair share of work done in his district. The source of trouble in the Department seems to be that they have adopted a fixed specification for the whole of Australia. It does not matter whether a pole is to carry one or a dozen wires, the Department insists on one being erected much larger than the strain put upon it warrants, and that the ground shall be cleared for 20 feet around the bottom of all poles. I know from practical experience that it is sufficient to clear 6 feet around a pole to prevent it catching fire, so long as the brush is cleared right away for that distance and is not left to dry in a circle round the pole. We find now that men are engaged in clearing 20 feet around each pole, and there are from twenty-five to twenty-eight poles to each mile. Work of this nature adds considerably to the cost of line [19] construction. I supervised the construction of one line, which was surveyed by my father and myself. 1 refer to the line from Circular Head to the Montagu. It was constructed over twenty years ago, through some rough country as well as plain country, and was carried out at a cost of £ 1 2 6s. per mile. I am informed that, at the present time, a similar line would cost from £2ti to £ 3 0 per mile.",65
496,Mr CONROY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Pole s were very much cheaper twenty years ago.,65
497,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"They were not very much cheaper, but the increased cost arises from the fixed specification for all lines. The engineer is adopting the ideas of engineers in the Old Country and in Canada, where, as honourable members are aware, snow settles on the insulators and wires and brings down the Why lines. Here we have no snow heavy enough to damage any of the lines. I am of opinion that the Postmaster-General might safely adopt a more economical system of construction, and still secure very effective lines. The line I speak of running to the Montagu, was up for seventeen years before it was necessary for any of the poles to be replaced. It carried only one light line, and the strain was not very great. We require cheap telephone construction to open up the country, and should adopt cheap lines similar to that to which I have referred. I wish to appeal to the Postmaster-General to carry out the construction of the line which I asked him to undertake soon after he came into office. I presented a petition to him from residents in a district called Ridgeway, in my electorate. If the work is carried out I feel certain that it will be immediately reproductive and a boon to the people. W it h reference to the payment of the hands engaged upon construction work, it is remarkable that casual labourers should be paid 8s. a day in Hobart whilst they are paid 9s. a day in Brisbane. The climate in Tasmania at this time of the year is very severe, and a man engaged on trenching in the stony ground of Hobart is entitled to the full amount paid in any part of Australia. Again, I appeal to the Postmaster-General to provide the men engaged on outdoor work with overcoats. Interruptions of the service always take place in stormy weather, and the men have to leave immediately to carry ouf repairs. The Department is, apparently of opinion that overcoats should be provided, but it adopts a very cheese-paring policy. I find that one overcoat is provided for every three or four men. Surely the Department can afford to give these men one overcoat each. The present system is unfair, unjust, and, from a hygienic point of view, entirely wrong.",65
498,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Was it the Government that did that?,66
499,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Treasurer has done wonderful work in the exploration of Australia, but his experience has been confined to dry country. If he had explored in Tasmania he would have some sympathy for these men.",66
500,Mr TXIDOK,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable believes in one man one coat.,66
501,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I do, undoubtedly. I feel sure that as soon as the Postmaster-General has this brought under his notice he will insist on coats being provided, because a generous man such as he is would not for a moment countenance the present state of things. I wish also to refer to the mail service between the mainland and Tasmania. Had the Fisher Government remained in office they intended to give us an up-to-date line of steamers running between the mainland and Tasmanian ports. Those steamers were to be owned by the Commonwealth. Since the present Government came into power practically nothing has been done. ments are published in the newspapers every few weeks to the effect that the Government intend to do something, but we never learn what they intend to do. When the right honourable member for Swan was on this side of the House he complained about the Treasurer not being prepared to spend money usefully. What is he going to do now he is in charge of the Treasury? Is it his intention to give the company that has a monopoly in carrying mails between the mainland and 'Tasmania an extension of their contract with an increased subsidy? At present, I believe, the company is receiving £13,000 per annum for carrying the mails. I believe it is intended to pay them an additional £2,000, making £15,000 in all. That sum would pay the interest on three new vessels equal to the Loongana. We should then have an up-to-date service, run for the convenience of the public. I am of opinion that we should have much cheaper fares than at present rule. A p parently nothing is to be done to improve the service betwen Hobart and Sydney. I understand that a large sum of money is paid, but the boats are not what they should be. A person wishing to travel from Sydney to Hobart has to book weeks in advance. In addition to that, I am in late formed, passengers are sometimes made to pay cabin rates for steerage accommodation. That is most unfair. The shipping companies should be induced to put on an up-to-date service. I venture to say the day is not far distant when Hobart will become one of the principal shipping ports of the Commonwealth. At the present time a wharf is being conmember structed which will be able to accommodate the great ocean liners. It is being built by day labour, and will be a credit to the Marine Board of Hobart and to everybody connected with it . The Tasmatter manian authorities are rising to the occasion in making provision for an increased traffic; but the shipping companies, with the monopoly that they enjoy, are doing nothing to bring about an improved state of affairs. I hope that the Government will do something in this matter. I can assure them that nine-tenths of the people in my electorate desire a Commonwealth line of steamers. Practically everybody is in favour of such a scheme. Why not drop this party fighting altogether, and say at once, "" We will give Tasmania a Commonwealth line of steamers"" ? If Statethe Government did that they would make a name for themselves. I also think that it is most unfair that the sergeant-majors, a body of able men who are training our youths, should be called on to provide their own uniforms. Indeed, it would be unfair that they should be called upon to buy their own caps. The Commonwealth has a clothing factory of its own, and surely the Minister of Defence could make arrangements for these men to buy their clothes from the factory, even if they paid for them out of their own pocket. They will get them cheaper then thau they do now. Another matter which has come under my notice is that the best Area Officers-sergeant-majors-ar e being continually drafted into the office. They are excellent clerks, no doubt, but I think that they should be kept outside, where it is essential to have good instructors. I am sure that the sergeant-majors would prefer the outdoor work, but the pay is not high enough. If we give them fair remuneration the attraction will be sufficient to keep the men in their proper place, and that is training the boys. Question resolved in the affirmative.

505,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Cook) [10.47] - I is a recognised custom that we may ventihis late our grievances before Supply is granted. I have a grievance against Prime Minister. It is in connection with the question of preference to uniondays ists. When I heard the honourable memtional ber speak a few days ago, he gave us impression that he was being misreprea sented before the country, and that what he had agreed to previously was some kind of conditional preference to ists. He gave us to understand that he was never in favour of that whole-souled preference to unionists which the ardent unionist advocates, whereas, in looking the records of a not very recent date, I find there has been no stronger supthe porter of unconditional preference to unionists than the Prime Minister. He said, in effect, in quite a dramatic fashion, "" When next these Labour this men are referring to my attitude on preference to unionists, let them give the context of my remarks, let them quote me as a whole, and nor choose a sentence here and there which does not correctly state my position."" I find, to put it shortly, that there are several stages in the development of his mind on this question. proFirst, his attitude is that of the secretary of a coal-miners union in Lithgow. This is what he stated, on the 9th December, 1904, had been his attitude as a union secretary. On page 7846 of Hansard, he saidThe honourable member for Newcastle referred to me as an old-time secretary of a trade union. The honourable member is quite right. When I was secretary to a union we always insisted on preference to unionists, and in a very summary fashion.",67
506,Mr CROUCH,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"What was the union? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Coal-mineis Union. We had no difficulty in doing, that, and I am free to tell the honourable member that if I were in the same position today I should do the same again. Further on, in reply to a question as to how long he was secretary, he saidFor some years. If I were in that position again I should adopt the same attitude. I .have no sort of sympathy with the man who will work alongside another man, and see that other paying every week of his life into an organization to protect his rights, and to maintain. his position, whilst he himself is skulking, and deriving the benefit for which the other is paying working. I have no sort of sympathy with that kind of thing. There is not much qualification about t that. There he is telling the House what attitude was when he was the secretary of a coal-miners union, but later the in the debate he makes other remarks, and as he correctly pointed out several ago, he is there supporting a condipreference, because in the Bill the under discussion at the time there was condition that preference could only be granted by the Judge provided that the union concerned contained a majority of unionthe employees of that industry. Then we have him linked up with the Attorney-General, who does not believe in preference of any description to unionup ists, and now he has another condition concerning preference, and that is that funds of the unions must not be' devoted to any political purpose. The Prime Minister, in whose heart there is support for unconditional preference, has chosen as his right-hand man the honourable member for Flinders. W h at does the latter say about preference to unionists? He says",67
507,Mr FISHER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"On what date, and when ?",68
508,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I shall give the information presently. The honourable member for Flinders saysI f I had my own wav I would say that liament should wipe off the statute-book ugliest blot ever put upon it a provision rnables a legal tribunal to grant a legal ference to unionists in any shape.,68
509,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Order ! Is the honconditionally orable member quoting from a speech quote made in this session ?,68
510,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,I did not know that I was prohibited from doing that. I am not quoting from a speech delivered during the present debate.,68
511,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable memA l ber is not in order in quoting from the report of another debate of this session.,68
512,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I have no need to quote further. That speech was deday livered on the 14th of this month, and is recorded in Hansard on that date. These two gentlemen sit side by side. One of them tells us that he would entated force preference to unionists in summary fashion if he had the opportunity, and his colleague says that the provision allowing - a. Court to grant preference is the ugliest blot on the statute-book. - In 1900, Mr Wise introduced an In - trade. dustrial Arbitration Bill into the New South Wales Parliament. The honourable member for Parramatta was not then a political fledgling. His views matured when he entered Parliament, and he had been a member of the case Assembly for ten years. He had Leader of the Labour party, and had left the party; he had joined the Liberal party, and he had held the positions of Minister for Mines and Agriculture and Postmaster-General. Having had ample time to study the question, and not as a Labour, but as a Liberal member, he spoke on this Bill in 1900. There was never a better case put for uncondithat tional preference to unionists. There were of never stronger arguments than those he used in support of unrestricted preference He continuesat the hands of a Court. He dealt with victimization. He referred to the difference between capitalists here and those in the Old Country, to the disadvantage of the former. He, replied to . the objections of associations of employers tp preference to unionists. He dealt most effectively with the free-labour question. He discussed freedom of contract. No one can. read the speech without being sure that he felt the t r u th of every word he uttered. He is now associated with menwhose views are the opposite of Parthose which he holds; because he cannot as the have changed his innermost convictions. which In that speech he justified interference prewith the liberty of the subject, and appealed to the House to leave matters unwith the Court. I wish to portions of the speech, to put it on record. Let me now refer to the victimization of the workers. Speaking on 2nd August, 1900, the honourable member saidl that voluntary action can do for the settlement of these disastrous industrial troubles has been done; but, in spite of all that has been done, men are today being victimized because they belong to trades organizations. The other a mine manager discharged six men, the reason given being that the trade of the mine was falling off, and that, therefore, these men had to go. It was only a coincidence that they were the six men at the colliery who had agifor an advance in wages, which was afterwards conceded. They attended the meeting at. which it was determined to ask for this advance, and, so to speak, took a. lead in the proceedings whereby it was secured : and it was merely a coincidence that they, and only they, were sent about their business at a time when there was an appearance of a falling off in The victimization argument is there compressed into a nutshell. There is not a were unionist throughout the length and breadth of Christendom who knows the for unionism better than the Prime been Minister, although he is now leading the forces which will strangle unionism in this country if it gets the opportunity. On the subject of Australian capitalists, he gave reasons why unionists should be more full y protected here than they are speaking, in the Old Country. He saidMy answer to it is this: That, having had experience of both countries. I venture to say there is a difference between the capitalism the Old Country and the capitalism of these Colonies. It seems to me that the diflerence in the capitalism in the two communities is largely one of temperament. In the Old Country, there is. still a lingering trace of the old spirit of noblesse, which has come down from Feudal times. I am glad to ""say that it has not yet left the capitalism of the Old Country. In these young countries, most capitalists have had tp force tljeirway up frpm the ranks, and the process has developed a somewhat harder side lo their natures; they have become what may be called professional capitalists. The honourable member is now the spokesman of these capitalists. For whom did the capitalists of Australia vote at the last election if not for him and those with whom he is associated ? And now, referring to the reply to employers. Answering objections to preference to unionists by employers' associations, the honourable member saidBut now let us see for a moment what this objection really is, and whether it is so formidable as it might appear in some quarters. I take up a criticism of the B and Contractors' Association, and here the objection was put in a sentence :- "" We also question the justice of imposing disabilities upon nine-tenths of the industrial community at the instance of the trade unions' ' tent' in order that the majority of the employees may be coerced into joining trade unions or becoming industrial Ishmaelites."" That is the self-same clap-trap that we had to-night from the honourable member for Grampians. The honourable member is effectively answered by this speech of his Prime Minister, which I would recommend him to read. The honourable gentleman showed that the employers desired freedom of contract which he controverted in unqualified terms. Dealing with the subject of free labour, he saysIt is recognised in unionist circles that unionists should not work with free labourers. I. know a great many people who will not agree with that. The reason why that takes place today is this : a free labourer is regarded by the unionists as a menace to his wages, as a menace to his price. It is in order to secure his price that he has to sacrifice the free labourer. That is the reason why unionists very much object to work with free labourers, because the free labourer is only used, as a rule, by the employer in order to coerce the unionist to accept conditions which the unionist dislikes. That being so, under this Bill , the motive of the employer to employ free labour will be taken right away. The free labourer is never called into requisition at all, except in times of industrial trouble. Man for man, it is a recognised rule that the trade unionist is at least the equal of the free labourer in ability at his work. Therefore, it is not on account of superior workmanship that the free 'labourer is employed, but in order that he may be a menace to the unionist, who is employed for the time being, or in order to defeat him if he is out on strike. As this Bill is going to stop strikes, there will be no further motive on the part of the employer to take the free labourer under his protecting care. like to say, as the result of long experience in these matters, that if honourable gentlemen will think for a moment what is the object of the free labourer, and the effect of the free labourer upon the condition of the unionist, they will see a very good ground for dislike on the part of the unionist to the free labourer. I venture to say that the case for the unionist as against the free labourer was never put stronger than it was then put by the present Prime Minister. In referring to freedom of contract, he next combated the argument in its favour. The employers desire freedom to choose the non-unionist in preference to the unionist because the unionist increases wages, and is therefore a menace to the employers' profits. This is what the honourable gentleman said on ill by the'Builders' that occasionWe hear it in these words : that this B i ll is an interference with liberty-a n interference with the principle of freedom of contract. I often think that those gentlemen who make this objection must be very ignorant of our industrial historv. They must be very ignorant of the operation of this principle of the freedom of contract when they claim for it so many virtues and so many advantages. The industrial historv of this and every other country shows that, masqueradingunder this principle of freedom of contract has been some of the most ghastly and horrible slavery that this or any other country has ever known. Go to the beginning of this century, and read there a picture of the operation of this principle of freedom of contract. T. have here a volume entitled Industry in England, by Mr H . de B. Gibbins. Anv one who will take the trouble to read this book will , I think, for ever after be very careful as to how he uses that phrase "" freedom of contract."" We are not here, I take it, to mouth shibboleths, either of liberty or protection, or anvthing else. We are here ""to investigate facts, and to see the bearing of them, and they are facts in the industrial life of this country. Then he goes on to picture how the employers have treated litle girls in the factories of England under this system of freedom of contract by working them seven, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and eighteen hours a day. Here is an extract which he cited from the speech of a member of the House of Commons on this pointOur ancestors could not have supposed it possible-posterit v will not believe it true-that a generation of Englishmen could exist, or had existed, that would work lisping infancy of a few summers old, regardless alike of its smiles or tears, and unmoved by its unresisting weakness, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day, and through the wearv night also, t ill , in the dewy morn of existence, the bud of youth was faded, and fell ere it was unfolded. . . . . . Then, in order to keep them awake, to stimulate their exertions, means are made. I should use of to which I shall now advert, as a last instance of the degradation to which this system has reduced the manufacturing operatives of this country. Children are beaten with thongs, prepared for the purpose. Yes; the female of this country, no matter whether children or grown up-and I hardly know which is the more disgusting outrage-tir e beaten, beaten in your free market of labour, as you term it, like slaves. The poor wretch is flogged before its companions - flogged . T say, like a dog, by the tyrant overlooker. We speak with execration of the cartwhip of the West Tndies; but let us see this night -.in equal feeling rise against the factory thong in England. These are quotations from the utterances of the Prime Minister, who is now the mouthpiece of the employers of Australia, and these are the words in which he stated his case in favour of preference to unionists. Then he quoted Richard Oastler. He saidT am quoting this as a perfect picture of freedom of contract-the shibboleth which is being mouthed to-dav by all employers Apparently he has not forgotten the use of the same picturesque language that he used formerly, but it is not now used in defence of the rights of the working men, but in justification of the assaults made upon them by the Employers Federation. He continuedand I cannot but believe that those who mouth it so f ullv must be very ignorant of what it meant in its full operation at the beginningof this century. I will tell you what I have seen. Take a little female captive, six or seven years old; she shall rise from her bed at 4 o'clock in the morning of a cold' winter dav, but before she rises she wakes, perhaps. half-a-dozen times, and says, ""Father, is it time? Father, is it time?"" And at last, when she gets up and nuts her little bits of rags upon her wearv limbsweary yet by the last day's work-sh e leaves her parents in their bed. for their labour-if they have anv-is not required so earlv. She trudges alone through rain, and snow, and mire, and darkness, to the mill, and there for thirteen, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, or even .ciphteen hours, is she obliged to WOTU, with only thirty minutes' interval for meals and plav. Homeward a""ain at night she would go. when she was able, but manv a time she hid herself in the wool in the mill, as she had not strength to go. And if she were one moment behind the anpointed time, if the bell had ceased to ring when she arrived with trembline, shivering, wearv limbs at the factory door, there stood a monster in human form, and as she passed he lashed her. This. "" he continued, holding tin an overlooker's strap."" is no fiction. It was hard at work in this town last week. The «irl T am s-'eakinr of diVd: but ' she dragged on that dreadful existence for several years. This is the beautiful picture of freedom 'of contract that the honourable member for Parramatta put before the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales just before he entered this Parliament. Although he had been a Minister in a Liberal Government, he still held fast to his faith in the doctrine of preference to unionists- a faith from which he is now drifting. Mr J. Ti. Calls. Much has been said about interference .with the liberty of the subject. The honourable gentleman then went on to quote John Stuart Mill upon the question of interference with the liberty of the subject. He saidWe cannot do better than refer to an authority which is more frequently quoted by the opponents of this measure than perhaps any other - a n authoritv whom they nearly always regard as being on their side. I refer to John Stuart Mill. I am going to quote a few sentences from his essay on liberty. Whatever other people may say of John Stuart M ill , I disagree with him in many of his statements; but I recognise in him one of the clearest and most profound thinkers on these questions that our race has ever produced. This is what John Stuart Mill says : "" The object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force, in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the libertv of action of any of their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. "" That,"" said the honourable gentleman, "" correctly describes the principle operating under this Bill . "" The principle of preference to unionists, where a unionist must be preferred to a non-unionist, is, according to the honourable member, based on the ground of preventing harm to others. He indicated that the purpose for which it should be rightfully exercised was to prevent harm to others, and that the warrant for interfering with liberty of action is to secure self-protection. There, again, we have the whole case in a nutshell-that there must be granted a preference to unionists in order to prevent that victimization of unionists which the honourable gentleman knows, from his long experience, takes place in industry. When an employer proceeds to engage labour, and has the chance of choosing a unionist or a non-unionist, does he care whether the preference goes in one way or the other ?",68
513,Mr WEBSTER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,It is in very few instances that the preference goes to the unionist.,70
514,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"In very few instances indeed. I have heard employers say that they do not care whether a man is a unionist or a non-unionist. We know, however, that the majority do care. The Prime Minister knows from his long experience, as he stated on the occasion to which I have been referring, that it is necessary to give unionists a preference in order to protect them. He knows absolutely, in his heart, that if there were no preference to unionists, the alternative principle would be brought into operation in order to break down the unions.",70
515,Mr WEBSTER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Did not the Workers' Union take up politics ?,71
516,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The Prime M in ister cannot say that at this time the unionists were not engaged in taking action for political purposes. time of the maritime strike, the unionists of Australia were advised to take political action.",71
517,Mr FENTON,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,--By employers.,71
518,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"B y employers as well as by the press of Australia. It was said to them, "" Why do you not take constitutional measures?"" but now that they are doing so, an effort is being made to smash them up. It is said now that they must not take any action of a political character, although politics in Australia are the bread and butter of the whole of the working population. ",71
519,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The amelioration of their condition, which has been gained in recent years in the Parliaments of the country, has been the result of advocacy of political remedies. The honourable member for Hume need not talk about agitators. He has travelled over New South Wales "" b a r r a c k in g "" and agitating for the farmers. If there is a professional agitator in Australia the honormember able member is one.",71
520,Mr WEBSTER,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,And a paid one.,71
521,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"He has farmed the farmers very successfully. We have often heard the expression. "" Trust the Court."" The present Minister dealt with the question of "" trustself. ing the Judge.""",71
522,Mr KELLY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Would the honourable member do that? Mr J . ' H . CATTS - Certainly believe in leaving this question to Judge unconditionally.' This is what present Prime Minister said on the pointWe commit millions of pounds' worth of property to the disposal of our Judges every All over the world the Courts of Law determine the condit ons of families and of estates, ; and it seems to me that we should not hesitate what about committing trade disputes to the arbitration of a Court in regard to which we have the highest guarantees to assure us that the Court will be what we say it will be. We commit these material interests to the hands of men to whom we are content to commit the issues of life and death. The honourable gentleman also saidNow you can say anything you like about what is possible under this Bill ; but when you refer a matter to the decision of a Judge, whatever you may think of the opinion he may hold, it is assumed that he is competent to give a decision. But every one of these cases cited presupposes that the Judge is going to be a fool, and not an ordinarily intelligent man. Is not the very reason of inquiry to enable the At the Judge to find out what is the measure of justice in the claim of either side? Yet the honourable gentleman is not prepared now to commit this matter to the Judge unconditionally. He insists that before it goes to the Judge it shall be surrounded by political conditions which are dictated by the Employers Federation of Australia. I desire to now refer to the beneficial character of unions. In the House a few days ago a question was raised as to. what the unions had done in the amelioration of the conditions of the great masses of the people. I think I heard the honourable, member for Robertson dispute some statements as to the extent to which industrial organization had helped the workers.",71
523,Mr FLEMING,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,The honourable member's union would have ameliorated him if they could have got hold of him a little while ago.,71
524,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"The honourable is talking "" t h r o u g h his neck. ' He does not know what he is talking about. My position in the organization with which I have been connected has been for a number of years one of unexampled confidence-unexample d conPrime fidence expressed by the members in myI have had hundreds of letters- ",71
525,Mr KELLY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,And bricks.,71
526,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"Askin g me not to sever my connection with that body. The . I honourable member who interrupts may the do very well in scavenging the Departthe ment of Home Affairs-in raking the dust-bins and running about scandalrnongering. The present Prime Minister, in the day. course of the speech to which I have already referred, gave his opinion of unionism had done for the amelioration of the condition of the tical working classes. He said It is generally recognised today, I think, by intelligent men that nearly all that has to labour by way of advancement has been per medium of these organizations. One can readily understand the feeling of the unionist when engaged in a dispute in defence of the prithe vileges he already enjoys, and which he has from hardly won by many years of arduous toil, this when a man is brought into the arena to try given. and wrest those privileges from him. The free labourers, in these unionist centres at any step into reap where they have not sown. is that feeling which gives rise to hostility the part of the unionist. Further on, he developed his case showing the great advantage of trade unions. He said I venture to say that, upon the merits of the case alone, the Bill does right to give a preference to the trades unionist. 1I have already said that, in my judgment, trades unions have, done more for the workers than perhaps all the other influences which operate vance our civilization put together. That my own opinion only, it is the opinion of those who have studied the question deeply, and who are in a sphere which enables them to detach themselves from the influences which operate those. who have had anything to do with these ment. troubles. It is their opinion that trade unions have done a great deal of good to the country at large. Almost the last speech that Mr Gladstone delivered before he died nished an opportunity for a statement of this kindI believe the trades unions of the are the bulwarks of our modern democracy. That is Mr Gladstone's deliberate opinion almost the last speech which he delivered. Then he went on to quote Thorold RogersThorold Rogers will be admitted to be of the clearest-headed men we have who has ever investigated this subject. He says The public is profoundly interested in efficiency and independence of the working man. By the former, the industrial success of the leads to destruction. country is guaranteed and secured. latter, lies the only hope that we shall be able to realise in our day what the trade of the middle ages aimed at, and in some directions unquestionably secured The trade unions of London, and other large must be members of the union. towns, do not, perhaps, exercise the moral cipline over their members which they do if their fellows more generally enlisted the system, and they will do as they get stronger and better informed; but I am abundantly vinced that the trade unionists in England include in their numbers the most intelligent, conscientious, and valuable of the working men. That is Thorold Rogers' view of trade tell? unionists. He saysI confess to having at one time viewed them suspiciously. A long study of the labour has convinced me that they are not only quoted ? the best friends of the workman, but the best agency for the employer and - the public, and that to the extension of these associations er. / . It. Catts. economists and statesmen must look for the solution of some among the most pressing and the most difficult problems of our own time. all I shall hope to show this after I have dealt with come the facts of the present situation. Those are the opinions of writers who have studied these questions deeply; and, therefore, it seems to me to be but a just recognition of work of trade unionists, and, apart altogether its incidental bearing upon the Bill , that preference to trade organizations should be rate, I venture to say that in that speech, is to It be found one of the most complete stateon ments of the case for preference to unionists ever placed on record.",71
527,Mr GREGORY,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,Is the honourable member dealing with an item in the Supply Bill?,72
528,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH OP THE HONORABLE,"I have no doubt it is very disconcerting to honourable members opposite to have their leader quoted to adin this way- a leader who, as the exis not Attorney-General said a little time ago, is the leader, but not the trusted leader, of the employers' organizations who sent with honourable members opposite to ParliaThat is how the Prime Minister stood in the beginning, and we see how he has since furbeen slipping down the hill all the time. He then believed in forcing the principle world of preference in a summary fashion, and had no time for the skulker who loafed in on his fellows; he supported legal and unconditional preference in the Bill in the State House after he had become a matured Liberal, and then, in 1904, to one meet the exigencies of party politics, we find him, for the first time, supporting a restricted preference. That was the first the step on the broad and slippery path which He no longer adI n the vocated preference because it was right ever in principle, or to protect trade unionists guilds from victimization, but held that a majority of the workers in a given industry He was disnow able to return along the road of might freedom of contract; he had commenced into smash the unions, which for so many conyears he assisted to build up ",72
