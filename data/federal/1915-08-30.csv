1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Havin g regard to the serious nature of the European ouf> look, the rapidly-mounting casualty lists, and the desirability of enabling the wholepeople to concentrate their united energies on the prosecution of the war, will the Prime Minister reconsider the decision to submit the referenda with a view to their postponement u n t i l the war pressure has been relieved ?",4
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Government is of opinion that the referenda will not weaken, but will strengthen, Australia in its attempt to make good in this war. and for that reason-althoug h we do not question the bona fides of those who are opposing what we propose-w e cannot comply with the suggestion. TELEPHONE RATES.",5
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Is it proposed to in crease the telephone rates by regulation before the question of an increase has been submitted to Parliament?,5
4,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The telephone rates will be adjusted by regulation, and I shall presently lay on the table a schedule of the proposed new rates. EXPORTATION OF MUTTON .",5
5,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Is it a fact that the vernment have prevented the Government of New South Wales from dealing with its meat as it wishes ?,5
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Some New South Wales mutton- I do not know that it is State owned, and have reason to believe that it is not, but is being held by the Meat Exporters Association there-is being treated in the same way as all mutton has been treated in Australia during the past eight or ten weeks, the exportation of mutton being prohibited at present.",5
7,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that beef was taken away by the Changsha? If so, what quantity was exported, what was the destination of the beef, and on whose account was it shipped?",5
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The prohibition covers only the exportation of mutton and lamb. Beef has been exported from Australia on account of the Imperial authorities, and to a place to which the Imperial Government asked us to allow it to be sent. INTER - STA TE PIGTRADE .",5
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Has the Attorney General noticed that pigs have been declared by the New South Wales Government a necessary commodity, and is he aware that the effect of this declaration is to stop any Inter-State trade in pigs between New South Wales and other States ? For years past a large proportion of the pigs raised in the Northern Rivers district have gone to Queensland. Will the honourable gentleman give the people of that district assistance in establishing their right to maintain their trade with the markets of Queensland 1",5
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am not aware of the declaration referred to, which is in violent conflict with the Mosaic law; nor am I aware that it will have the effect of stopping the trade in pigs between New South Wales and other States. It certainly should not have that effect. I shall be glad to assist the honourable gentleman's constituents in maintaining that steady and progressive flow of pigs to Queensland markets which seems to be necessary for the prosperity of the Northern Rivers district. PAYMENT OF RECRUITS . Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - I continue to receive letters from parents who complain that sons who are their only means of support, and have been accepted for service abroad, are being sent Goback for a fortnight or so after enlisting, and do not receive any pay for that period. Do I understand that it is the intention of the Department to pay all volunteers from the date of enlistment, and not from the date on which they are sent into camp, if that date be somewhat remote from the date of enlistment?",5
11,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The Minister is having the matter inquired into. The Commandant of New South Wales is said to have taken action without the Minister's instructions, and has been asked to report on the subject. I shall be pleased to answer the question as soon as the M in ister is in possession of the necessary in formation. WHEAT CHARTERS.",5
12,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Has the Attorney-General given further consideration to the question how the 5 per cent, charterers' commission shall be dealt with ? Does the Government still intend to grab the greater part of it , and pay it into the public revenue?",5
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman refers to that part of the commission which has hitherto come out of the pockets of the farmers, and gone into the pockets of the charterers. Henceforth this 3£ per cent, will go into the revenue of the general community.'",5
14,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,When may we expect that portion of the wheat charter agreement which covers the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States in reference to the liability for charters pending the requisition of the ships by the actual wheat shippers'?,5
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Such liability has been regarded as contingent. rate, it has not been reduced to writing. The whole liability is borne by the States in proportion to their exportable surplus. Has the honourable member any particular and concrete case in mind ?",6
16,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Yes ; very often charterers cancel their charters and pay penalties. Has any agreement been arrived at denning the relationships of the States and the Commonwealth in that direction?,6
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Where there is liability, it is shared by the States on the basis of their interest in the venture, and is determined by the amount of their exportable produce. If there is no liability, of course, neither the Commonwealth nor any State is interested. NEWZEALANDMILITARY CAMPS .",6
18,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Has the Minister for the Navy noticed that a report has been made on the military camps in New Zealand by a Commissioner appointed to make inquiries and recommendations concerning them ? Will the honourable gentleman communicate with the Government of New Zealand with a view to obtaining a copy of the report, so that, should any »of the recommendations be applicable to our conditions and of value to us they may be adopted ?",6
19,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I have not seen the report to which the honourable member refers, but if it deals with military matters I shall make inquiries and bring it under the notice of the Minister of Defence, with a view to complying with the honourable member's request. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr FISHER ) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. NEW HEBRIDESMAIL SERVICE.",6
20,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister tell us when the complete report of the Commission on the New Hebrides Mail Service will be laid on the table ?,6
21,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I admit it is convenient to have the report printed before it is presented, but it will be distributed to honourable members within a few days. PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS : RETURNED SOLDIERS.",6
22,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"It was recently announced, on the authority of the Prime At any Minister, that the policy of preference to unionists was not to apply to returned soldiers; and I should like to know whetlier it is a fact that, for some weeks, District Militar y Orders have contained an instruction that preference is to be given to returned soldiers on condition that, if they are not already unionists, they immediately join a bond fide union. If that is a fact-and whether it be so or not-wil l the Prime Minister be good enough to announce definitely what is the policy of the Government?",6
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I have not seen the orders referred to ; but the policy that I announced stands.,6
24,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,What is it? DEFENCE QUESTIONS: CONFLICTI NG ANSWERS .,6
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like to have some information regarding the conflicting answers given by the Ministers who represent the Department of Defence in the two Houses. Honourable members w i ll recollect that the other day the Minister of Defence definitely told us that Dr Barrett was returning.,6
26,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I do not thin k so.,6
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is so reported in Hansard. Tho Minister told us, in the most definite way, that Dr Barrett was returning, while his colleague in another place said that, so far as he knew. Dr Barrett was not returning. Which of these answers is the correct one ? Then the other day, in connection with the proposal for camp visitation",6
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member ask one question at a time?,6
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"it is the same question. My question is not as to anv particular case, but as to why there is this frequent conflict between the answers. We are repeatedly getting contradictory answers concerning the same subject.",6
30,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Was I replying to a question on notice ?,6
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know whether there was notice or not, and I do not see that it matters. The Minister for the Navy said that the War Committee has charge of camp visitations, and all matters concerning the administration of the camps, whereas the reply of his colleague ,in another place was that it is not correct to say that the War Committee, or any Committee, has control of ths arrangements at the camps.",6
32,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,The War Committee has power to inquire and recommend.,7
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is not,7
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is developing a kind of debate upon the honourable member's second question, and it cannot be permitted, unless the idea of asking questions is to be altogether put aside.",7
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I desire to may come. know what is the reason for the contradictory answers given by two Ministers representing the same Department?,7
36,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"As to Dr Barrett, do not remember having given the answer indicated, unless it was by way of intersold, jection, or in reply to some statement the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. So far as I recollect, it was honourable member who brought the questerioration tion up, and I think I put a qualification on my answer, because I knew nothing of the matter at the time. I think I said, "" If it is so "" ; but whether or not appears in Hansard I cannot say.",7
37,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Minister for Navy said that Dr Barrett was to take charge of the Red Cross arrangements.,7
38,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I do not think that I said that. However, with regard the other question, I think - I have advised-that the Committee appointed from both sides of the House is matters submitted to it by the Minister of Defence; and, so far as I am one of those matters is recruiting, so forth , in connection with war purposes. I do not know but that even the concensaying tration camps may not come within their purview. I may have been misled with regard to the latter point, but I tain that recruiting has been left to Committee by the Government. ENEMYTRADER S' STOCK-IN",7
39,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Is the Attorney-General prepared to consider his decision under which enemy companies and persons beinsr permitted to dispose of their in-trade and assets, to the detriment our suppliers and traders?",7
40,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am perfectly prepared to reconsider my decision, but I am not ready to make any rule that is not general-if it applies to one firm it must apply to all. In view of the importance of the interests involved, I have written the State Governments, the Federal Departments, and the municipal corporations of the great cities, who are so. very much interested in the matter, to show cause why these importations of supplies should not cease. If they make out a case, well and good. If not, I shall be in favour of such a policy as will stop all consumption of German goods, no matter from what source they",7
41,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"As the Continental Tyre Company has been given permission to I dispose of its very large stocks on the ground that they would deteriorate unless I ask the Attorney-General whetlier of he has taken into account the time those stocks have already been held, in order that to ascertain whether already such dehas taken place, as to render their sale to 'the public unadvisable ?",7
42,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have made no further inquiries into the Continental Tyre that Company's stocks. Statements have been made in regard to the position of stocks the held by the Australian Metal Company, Siemens Brothers, the Continental Tyre Company, and other people, and the whole question has been looked into, and all the to circumstances reviewed. I do not say been that the question of whether they should have permission to sell their gcods is having not arguable, but I do say that there cannot and should not be one aware, rule for one company and another and rule for another company. I am not prepared to accept the responsibility of that the Victorian Government must not go on with its railways electrification scheme, that the Federal Governam cerment must not go on with the various the works that it has now in course of construction, or that the Sydney Municipal Council must not go on with its different undertakings which involve the use of material from these firms, unless and TRADE. until all these bodies have been heard. The firm of Siemens Brothers is a large concern, but it has no more right to conare sideration than the Continental Tyre stockCompany, or any other firm. I am waitof ing until I receive replies from these public bodies before I make any rule upon the matter. I ask honourable members to realise that we have no principles for our guidance. To refer to international law helps us very little, because, in the face of the Lusitania and Arabic outrages, international law at the present time is a dead letter, ancl, in any event, is in applicable to the circumstances of modern war?",7
43,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The Attorney-General last week promised that he would ascertain for the information of the House the quantity and value of the goods held by the Continental Tyre Company. Is the Minister in a position to give the House any information on the subject?,8
44,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"As far as I remember, the value of the goods held by the Continental Tyre Company was £122,000. WAR CENSUS.",8
45,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the great expense that will be occasioned by taking the war census, and in view of the fact that it has already been announced that there is an insufficient staff of confidential officers, will the Government consider the matter of issuing an invitation to a body of men already bound to secrecy, namely, the sworn valuers under the Supreme Court rules of each State, who, although unable to go to the front , would willingly offer their services for bare expenses?",8
46,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Statistician, who has the administration of the War Census Act , has been given carte-blanche in regard to his staff. No l i m it has been placed upon him except that he has been told to get the work done well artd speedily, and that he must pay the market rates for the labour employed. I have not been informed, and I do not know, that there is any shortage of labour of the kind desired, but I shall bring the suggestion of the honourable member before the Statistician in order that he may express an opinion upon it . ALLOWANCE POST-OFFICES",8
47,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General a question in regard to a number of notices which haye been sent out fro m his Department in cases where there have been reductions of a few pounds, or a few shillings, in the allowances for small allowance offices, and where the people conducting these offices have said that they cannot carry on for the amounts offered. I ask the Postmaster-General does he intend to carry out the threat of the Department to pull down the telephone wires and close the offices in such cases?",8
48,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I am not aware that there is any such proposal.,8
49,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,There are hundreds. I shall quote them to you directly.,8
50,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"When the honourable member does, we can have the cases in vestigated. PAPERS.

MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT .",8
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"May I ask the Prime Minister if he is aware that provision is made in the Murray Waters Agreement for the appointment of a Board, and that such Board cannot be appointed until this Parliament has ratified the agreement arrived at between the States concerned ? Will the right honourable gentleman, therefore, in order to avoid delay in this matter, endeavour to secure the passage of a Bill ratifying the agreement before Parliament adjourns ?",8
52,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I do not think there will be any delay in the creation of the machinery required to carry out the agreement. The adjournment will be only a very short one. It will not extend over more than a month. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES.

He left an order that his wife should receive 9s. 6d. a day out of his pay of 10s. 6d. per day, but the representatives of the Defence Department in Western Australia have declined to pay the wife more than 4s. a day, stating as their reason for doing this that under the regulations a greater sum than 4s. cannot be paid u n t i l word is received from Egypt. Will the Minister for the Navy have the matter looked into and rectified promptly?",9
56,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,T he honourable member's question shall be brought under the notice of the Minister of Defence.,9
57,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have received a communication from a parent, who states that he received a cable from Malta on 14th August, informing him that his son. had been wounded, yet he has neceived no notice from the military authorities. This parent's excuse for making this in quiry is that on a previous occasion another son was six weeks in hospital, and that he has not yet received any notice from the military authorities. In view of circumstances like these, will the Minister for the Navy bring the matter forward in order that strong representations may be made to those responsible, in order that some improvement may be brought about in the notification of cases like those to which I have referred ?",9
58,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Simila r cases to that referred to by the honourable member have been brought under my notice, and also under the notice of the Minister of Defence. Unfortunately, these complaints do occur",9
59,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I would point out that the man referred to in the case to which I have drawn attention is in hospital.,9
60,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I will bring the honourable member's query under the notice of the Minister tomorrow morning.,9
61,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"On Saturday and Sunday I was waited on by men from Seymour Camp, who complained that the food is often undercooked, and that, even when it is properly cooked, there is not enough of it . I was also informed that a man has to nearly succumb in liis tent or on parade before he receives medical attention. Will the Minister for the Navy make investigations in order to ascertain whether these allegations are correct ?",9
62,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Yes , I shall.",9
63,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"In view of the many allegations made in regard to the conduct and administration of the various military camps, I should like to know whether the Minister for the Navy or the Minister of Defence ever visits the camps with a view to ascertaining whether these allegations are well founded or otherwise.",9
64,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I am quite sure that the Minister of Defence has on several occasions visited the camps, and has expressed himself, more than once, as well satisfied with everything tliere. Of course, things may change from time to time, and, according to reports, have changed. I myself have visited the camps on three or four occasions in Queensland and Victoria.",9

He offered not the slightest objection. If it is a "" d i r t y flank movement"" now, it was a "" dirty flank movement "" then, and he agreed to it . If this is to be the result of making arrangements with the Prime Minister in regard to the conduct of business, I am wondering whether it is auy use to try to make an arrangement with him about any matter. able arrangement having been'deliberatelv made, to which the Prime Minister offered not the slightest objection, I object to liis now cliaractsrizing it as a dirty flank movement.

Department of the Treasury, £279,770. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON (Lang) [3.47] - I take it that I shall now be in order in dealing with the general quesn tion of finance. The financial situation at the present time is most disturbing to all who can foresee to what dimensions future taxation is likely to develop. It is only a few years since our total annual income did n'ot reach £15,000,000. In whe1909 our revenue for the year in round figures was only £14,555,000, while our is expenditure, including the amounts that of we had to return to the States, was £15,700,000. We have now advanced to my an estimated ordinary expenditure of £26,500,000 for the present year, and n Deone cannot view these extraordinarily high jumps in Commonwealth expenditure without grave misgivings as to where such extravagance is going to land us. Special appropriations alone this year show au increase of £1,294,374 over those for last year. The special appropriations last year totalled £653,246whereas this year they amount to £1.947,620 . I do not propose to discuss the figures in detail, for they have already heen dealt with exhaustively by the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Swan. The people of New South Wales are suffering very severely through the large increase of taxation which this enormous additional expenditure has involved, and, unfortunately, we cannot see a prospect of the burden being lightened. On the contrary, we are likely to be faced with increases in the near future. The Prime Minister urged upon the people the necessity for rigid economy in connection with their expenditure, but the right honourable gentleman, as Treasurer, instead of setting an example of economy in the expenditure by public Departments, has allowed the ordinary expenses of administration to be increased by upwards of £3,000,000 , exclusive of the special expenditure in connection with the war. One hesitates to criticise the war expenditure, but, as public men, we have our duty to do, even in that regard. However, irrespective of the war expenditure, which is already more than double the ordinary expenditure, and exclusive of this proposed new taxation, the people of New South Wales are being taxed today at the rate of £31 16s. 8d. per annum per f a m i l y of five. When the proposed new taxation is added, that amount will probably be increased to £40.",11
101,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"A desire to expedite public business prompts me to rise to a point of order. I have looked very caref u l l y through the items in the schedule, and I cannot discover that the honourable member is speaking about any one of t l i em. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I may speaking on the "" miscellaneous "" items.",12
102,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Nothin g in the honourable member's speech has had any reference to the items appearing in this schedule. I submit that we are considering the details of the schedule, and are not engaging in a general all-round debate on the financial situation.",12
103,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Are we not discussing the vote for the Treasury Department ?,12
104,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"--We are discussing certain items in that vote. Whilst I have no desire to stifle free speech, I submit that the honourable member is too discursive, and ought to be pinned down to some particular item. If he is permitted to continue his remarks in a discursive fashion, we shall not have finished our business before Christmas.",12
105,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In the past the practice has been to allow a good deal of latitude to honourable members when discussing matters contained in the schedule of a Supply Bill . I was following the remarks of the honourable member for Lang very closely, and waiting for him to connect them with some item in the schedule.

Attorney-General's Department, £15,390.",12
107,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Dampier) [3.58] - I am not inclined to vote money for any member of the Attorney-General's staff u n t i l it is shown who was responsible for what took place recently in connection with the alien, Julius Blau. We remember the great f a n fare of trumpets which heralded every investigation when the Attorney-General's Department first took steps to deal with firms supposed to be trading with the enemy. Officers were sent from the Defence Department to the premises of the suspected firms, the press were notified of be intended raids, and the greatest possible publicity was given to every such action. At that time applications were made by a number of people in all the States for permission to leave the Commonwealth, and in some instances good cases were made out. According to the particulars given to the House last week by the honourable member for Wentworth, Julius Blau also was desirous of leaving the Commonwealth. There is not the slightest doubt that he was an enemy subject, although he was naturalized; bufc the Attorney-General was particular to point oufc to the House that this man was a Hungarian, not a German, and, therefore was less liable to be dangerous. The Defence Department was exceedingly anxious to prevent this gentleman leaving Australia. Its anxiety was founded upon evidence which had been obtained from the Censors' Department, and which was put before the Attorney-General at the time. The most explicit information was forwarded to the Minister of Defence and the Attorney-General as to why Mr Blau should not only he prevented from leaving Australia, but why a prosecution should be instituted against him for attempting to trade with the enemy. The correspondence dealing with the matter shows that Colonel Wallack wrote to the Defence Department as follows:I sliould be glad to know what decision is arrived at, and would suggest that an early prosecution of this or some other suitable case - would greatly assist the local efforts to prevent enemy trading. The Attorney-General, however, considered that there was no case against Mr. Blau. Later on Colonel Wallack wroteIn view of the apparent decision of the Attorney-General that the evidence referred to in my 07/4/186 of 4th inst. does not amount to enemy trading, I would suggest that a copy of the opinion on the case be forwarded for the guidance of those officers who are looking after this section of the work of the staff in this district. Here was an extraordinary thing. After all the information had been forwarded to the Attorney-General and the Defence Department "" Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I we ought to have a Minister present to hear the remarks of the honourable member, and I therefore call attention to the state of the Committee. formed. ] ",12
108,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is indeed remarkable that the Attorney-General should he absent from the Chamber when his con.duct is being questioned in connection with this perfumery business. I was pointing out that the decision of the Attorney-General was regarded as so extraordinary that the Commandant of Kew South Wales desired that a copy of it should be sent to ,'the staff in order that its members might know what they would be able to do in - the future. Colonel Wallack went on to sayI think that this is necessary, as the officers 'concerned, two of them are barristers by profession, were of the opinion that the evidence disclosed a very clear case. It is impossible 'for these officers to carry out their duties pro.pierly without some knowledge of what the Attorney-General wishes to be proved to constitute an offence. That is an extraordinary statement to emanate from the Staff to the Defence Department in connection with this case. Yet, in the face of all these reports, Blau was allowed to leave Australia. The Attorney-General has assigned certain reasons for having permitted him to do so. He has statedThis is the one case in which, since I took ofiice, I have accepted statements of this kind as reliable. In saying that, he was, of course, referring to the statements made by Mr Blau. But I know of no instance, even in which a prosecution has been launched, in which the evidence against the suspect was so clear as it was in this case. In short, there is an extraordinary difference between the treatment which was accorded to Mr Blau and that which has been meted out to other persons in similar circumstances. I feel that this matter ought not to be allowed to rest where it is. Indeed, I unhesitatingly affirm that if honourable members opposite were allowed a free hand, and if a vote of censure had been submitted in reference to this case, it would have resulted in a change of Ministry. The Attorney-General has told us that he obtained a bond from Mr Blau. But the facts show that, the securing of that hond was quite a 'secondary consideration. think that Mr HiGGh - Wit h great reluctance. I desire to raise another point of order. The matter of the hond given by Mr Blau is now before the Court, and I submit that [Quorum it is not competent for the honourable member to discuss it. I think that you, sir, will see that to debate it at this juncture may prejudice the case for the Crown or the case for Mr Blau, and I am sure that the honourable member for Dampier does not desire to do that. Our British Courts of justice are held up as models all over the world. We are following in the footsteps of the Old Country, and cases before the Court are never discussed in the House of Commons.",13
109,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Attorney-General stated that this matter was not before the Court, and he discussed the matter himself the other day.",13
110,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He did not discuss the question of the bond.,13
111,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He sought to defend himself by abusing Mr Blau.,13
112,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He discussed some correspondence which the honourable member for Wentworth referred to, but he did nob discuss the merits of the case, which will be tried before the High Court at a very early date. I submit that, in the circumstances, the honourable member for Dampier is not in order in discussing this matter.",14
113,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I direct your attention, sir, on the point of order, to a copy of Hansard, from which you will see that the Attorney-General himself discussed this question. The honourable member for Capricornia was present at the time, and heard the Minister say that the matter was not before the Court.",14
114,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member for Capricornia makes the statement that a case in connection with this matter is before the Court. official knowledge to enable me to sav whetlier that statement is accurate. Tf I knew that the case was before the Court I am aware of no rule of Parliament which would strictlv debar any member of the Committee from referring to it . It would be a matter of taste whether it was referred to or not. I am not at present in a position to say that there is any rule of parliamentary procedure which would justify me in calling the honourable member for Dampier to order for referring: to this case, even though it should be before the Court.",14
115,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable member for Capricornia will look up Hansard, he will find that the statement he has made it not correct. The Attorney General did deal with the bond in this case, and at some length. portion of the bond in this chamber.",14

117,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The lionorable member cannot refer to something which took place in the House.,14
118,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I thought that that was what the honourable member for. Capricornia was doing. I say that the bond was a secondary consideration. that a number of firms here became aware of the fact that Blau was going to import this special perfumery, and they drew the attention of the Attorney General to the matter. Then I this bond came into existence. torney-General told us that it contains have stopped them. the following: Whereas Julius Blnu. the managing director of the said company, has applied for permiswere sion to visit America for the purpose of-obtaining plant for the manufacture of perfumery and soup and engaging a skilled chemist, and permission has been granted to him. Honourable members must bear in m i nd that, while Blau was in America, the f o l lowing words were inserted after the word?, ""chemist"": and for the importation of perfumery and soapmanufactured in America. This is the bond on which the Attorney General now says that he is going to prosecute. It has been clearly demonstrated by the honourable member for Wentworth that these goods have been, and are being,, imported, and they are undoubtedly German goods. They carry the Germaw trade mark. Tliere is a slight alteration, and it is said that the perfumery hast been bottled in America. The reports> I have no show clearly that this man was making special arrangements",14
119,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Order ! I understand the honourable member to say that the Attorney-General stated that he in tended to prosecute. If that be so, I ask him to consider whether it is wise or judicious on his part to discuss the merits of the case in this Committee.",14
120,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Decidedl y it is. because I want to see the importation of these goods prohibited. We have heard a very great deal about what has been done to prevent the importation of enemy goods. What is the use of this wretched' bond, which is not worth the paper on which it is written? Tliese people are under the bond given permission to import goods manufactured in America. It is an absurdity for the Attorney-General to He Tead a say that he will prosecute under the bond which allows them to bring these to goods into the country. They have been imported, and they are being imported.",14
121,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the goods are not manufactured in America, the company can be sued under the bond.",14
122,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But why allow these goods to be imported ? I think that It seems they should be seized. There is not theslightest doubt that the Chamber of Commerce directed the attention of theAttorney-General to the fact that these importations were being made.

I rose because I did not desire that the vote for the Attorney-General's Department should be allowed to go through without some explanation of this matter. Other honourable members, more conversant with it than I am, are now quite prepared to deal with it . From my knowledge of the papers, I am inclined to think that if the Attorney-General bathed in this eau-decologne for the rest of his life he would not he able to get away from the smell of this transaction. Mr HrGGS - That is a very nasty remark to make.",14
123,Mr BURNS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the member impute bribery.,15
124,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There has something in connection with the matter which merits investigation, and we are justified in insisting that it shall be threshed out. We cannot forget the action which the Attorney-General has taken in regard to other firms, and the statements he has made about enemy trading. To my mind, no clearer casa of enemy trading than that which has occurred in this instance has been brought before the public. The only information we have as to the action the Attorney General proposes to take is that he is going to prosecute on a bond that is not worth the paper on which it is written.",15
125,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member must admit that on the bond the Attorney-General can prosecute if it is «hown that the goods imported are German goods.,15
126,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is the importat i o n of the goods which I wish to see stopped. If there is anything in the bond, that can be looked into later. An other matter about which I wish to say - something is the proposed Metal Exchange. We have a right to know somet h in g more about it . I represent a very large mining community in Western Australia. In the far north of that State there are deposits of copper ore, - and the people there have been exporting copper ore to Swansea, in England, for treatment. From what I can learn about the Metal nothing is to be done nexion with the smelting of ores, but the proposal is merely to create another middleman. Nothing is to be sold except through the medium of the Metal Exchange. I cannot see how that is going to assist the metal industry in Australia in the slightest degree.",15
127,Mr GROOM,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is there any limitation of the quantities to be sold through the Exchange ?,15
128,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not know what are to be the rules of the Exchange. The only rule I have seen, so far, is an extraordinary one forbidding any person who is not a British subject to be a member of the Exchange. That is a nice tiling to tell our French ally. France is a very good customer of ours for various metals, but apparently we are to tell her that no Frenchman can be a memhonorable ber of the Metal Exchange in Australia.' The rules have not yet been approved, and it is possible that this rule may be been amended. If all sales and importations are to be made through the medium of the exchange, grave harm is likely to be done to the production of our baser metals in Western Australia, and I ask the House to pause before agreeing to any such proposal. At Whim Creek, in the north-west of Western Australia, there is a mine which prior to the war employed from 150 to 200 men. The difficulties are too great for them to smelt the ore there, and they have been shipping it direct to Swansea. It would be absurd for them to have to make all their arrangements and effect their sales through the proposed exchange, and surely big firms like the Broken Hill Proprietary can manage their own business better than the gentlemen who will he connected with the exchange - can do it for them. In any case it would simply mean that a commission would have to be paid to the agents, and I cannot see how the arrangement can be in any sense beneficial to the industry in the slightest degree.",15
129,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wentworth) [4.22] The honourable member for Dampier has raised briefly the question I . submitted to the House a short while ago in connection with ' the importation of 4711 eau-decologne. When raising the question I in no way touched on the case pending before the Court, and in no way canvassed its merits. I submitted a case Exchange, against the Government for deliberately in con- allowing a man of enemy origin to leave Australia after the strongest case agaiust him of attempted enemy trading had been submitted by the authorities, and for allowing him also to bring goods in afterwards, despite constant warnings as to their real enemy origin. The case against the Government has not yet been met. The Attorney-General, in his reply, contented himself with abusing Mr Blau, but tons of abuse of that person will not clear the Minister from the charges which the papers in the case bring against the Attorney-General of extraordinary carelessness, if not worse, throughout the whole business. When he gave permission to Mr Blau to visit America, he knew from the papers in his possession, and from the copies of and extracts from Blau's correspondence, that he was arranging to meet one of the heads of the - German firm in America. He knew also from a letter from the American branch to Mr Blau in Sydney that all moneys that Blau was to remit to them were to be credited to Blau at the head office in Gerconfidential, many, that the American firm admitted the German firm as the ""mother house,"" and, from the headings of invoices of the German firm and its catalogues prior to the war, that the American house was merely a branch establishment of the great Cologne house in Germany. But, apparently, the Attorney-General was too busy to keep his memory in working order. It failed him. Although he told the Minister for the Navy in his own handwriting that he had gone fully into the case, and given it the amplest consideration, his memory was so bad that he thought it was safe to let Blau go, and he specially asked in that letter that Blau should be allowed to leave Australia to meet this man in America. His memory was also bad as regards the warnings against enemy importations subsequently addressed to him. On the file appears letter after letter which came to the Attorney-General, but each correspondent was merely informed that the subject-matter of his letter would receive consideration. The whole thing was buried, so busy was the Attorney-General on other matters. I started the ball rolling in this House by asking the Minister of External Affairs if he was aware that the house in America was a branch of the Cologne firm, and the Minister replied that he had not dealt with the matter himself, but that the Attorney-General had, and that the Attorney-General - as inquiring of Mr Blau whether this Mr Kelly. was so. Yet, within a few weeks the Attorney-General told the House in effect that he had discovered that Blau was a most infamous person, when the goods began to arrive. Indeed, he said he had warned his colleague the Minister of Trade and Customs! I think the first' lot of goods had actually arrived when I asked his colleague that question; and, at that time, so infamous was Mr Blau, that the Attorney-General actually went to him for information as to whether the New York factory was a branch of the Cologne house or not! The next stage was that the Prime Minister promised that the papers should be produced. The Prime Minister could see mo objection to their publication, and the Minister of Defence had no objection, but the Attorney-General said subSeJ quently that, as some of the papers were they could not he laid on the table of the House, but would be open to the inspection of honourable members at the Prime Minister's office. I went and read them, but there was not a single paper amongst them that should not be published in the public interest. Not one was confidential in the public interest sense, although some Defence papers were marked confidential or "" secret,"" as are papers in the Defence Department, that are meant for the personal eye of the Minis- 1 ter. Why, then, were they not laid oh the table of the House? As soon .as I had seen the file I realized that the Department was not anxious for the fullest publicity in connection with the wholematter. The last naper on the file was a letter from the Attorney-General, dated 3rd August, to Mr Blau, calling him a few names, and telling him that he proposed to estreat his bond. This was after the matter had been raised in the House, and almost immediately after the Attorney General had been corresponding with Mr. Blau in the most friendly way, according to the reply of the Minister of External Affairs in this Chamber, asking him whether the firm in America had anv connection with Mr Blau's principals in Cologne. Thus, at one time, Blau was a proper informant for the Attorney General on a matter of fact, and a few weeks afterwards, when the matter had been raised in the House, Mr Blau was every sort of a scoundrel, and his bond was to be estreated ! I went a step further, and saw the bond. I saw, also, the words written into it . The Attorney-General says he had never seen them. If so, it Blau or Curtis now. is the gravest possible reflection on the administration of the AttornevGencral's Ofiice, for anybody who took up the bond could not help seeing the interpolation. It was in the clearest handwriting, in the very centre of the front page. A child could not miss seeing it , and yet the Attorney-General talks as if it was evidence of some sinister cunninp/. I do not know whether it was or not.",15
130,Mr YATES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Did they know the handwriting?,17
131,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The alteration' was initialed at the side by the two young Blaus, who signed it, their father being then in America, because the Attorney General did not exact the bond u n t i l after Blau had left for America. Now, when I told the Attorney General that I proposed to move the adjournment of the House on this subject, he said that he did not see how either he or I could say anything against Mr Blau, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth Government were going to take action against him on his bond. I pointed out that I did not wish fco say anything against Mr Blau, but that I desired to deal with the action of the Minister. Y e t when the matter was before the House, the Attorney-General himself forgot all about the difficulties he had spoken of, and his speech in reply was one long abuse of this gentleman, whom he had befriended in such an extraordinary way during the previous six months! speech was no answer at all to the charge which I brought against the Government for allowing this man to leave the country against the advice of the Defence Department. Then, when the honourable member for Dampier asked the other day why the a Attorney-General had retained Mr the future. Blau's son-in-law fco conduct the prosecution in the case of a German who left Australia without the permission of the Defence authorities, the Attorneyshall General asked how on earth was he to know that this man Curtis-a n Austraillegal lian-born barrister, and probably an cellent man--wa s a son-in-law of M Julius Blau ? [229]",17
132,Mr WEST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Mr Blau could not help Curtis being a son-in-law.,17

134,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Where is it?,17
135,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I will read the declaration for the benefit of my honourable friend. The second paragraph of that declaration, which the Attorney-General himself gave to the House, and with which the Attorney-General must have been thoroughly conversant, reads as follows:Tho whole of the capital of my company is held by myself, my wife, my two sons, Oscar and Robert, and my son-in-law, William James Curtis, barrister of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.",17
136,Mr WEST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"On a point of order, Mr . Chairman, I would point out that one of our Standing Orders is to the effect that an honourable member shall not read from Hansard of the present session, and that is what the honourable member for Wentworth is doing.",17
137,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable member for Wentworth is reading from Hansard of this session, he is not in order.",17
138,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I was merely quoting, for greater convenience, from the statutory declaration made by Mr Blau, and which was read in its entirety by the At torney-General in this House. If I have been out of order, I regret it . The fact is that the Attorney-General must have known who this man Curtis was, although when he gave his reply to the honourable member for Dampier, he pretended to The have no knowledge of the case. The At torney-General is not altogether to be admired for his memory on these points. I admit that the Attorney-General is an extremely busy man, but if he has too much work to do, his colleagues ought to share some of it with him, so that such thing as this shall not happen again in I am sure honourable members on had both sides of the House desire that this surreptitious trading in enemy goods be stopped, and I would suggest to the Government that it should be made for goods bearing an enemy trade exmark fco be dealt with in Australia. So r . far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we can stop importations afc once. We can issue a proclamation making it i l legal to import any goods covered by an enemy trade mark.",17
139,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But is not this trade mark registered in Australia?,18
140,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What I mean by an enemy trade mark is a trade mark owned by an enemy company or agent, such as, for instance, this article of perfumery, No. 4,711. That trade mark is the property of Ferdinand Muhlens, of Cologne, and any goods sold under that trade mark are obviously being sold-unles s the Trade Marks Act is being set at defiance - for the benefit of Ferdinand Muhlens.",18
141,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He might have sold the trade mark to the American firm.,18
142,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . The American factory deals with all the American affairs of Ferdinand Muhlens, as the correspondence in the possession of the Attorney-General goes to show, and all the money sent by Blau to that firm has to be credited to Blau in Cologne. thing can be said about many other lines in the druggists' trade. One of these is laxatine, I think. In this case the trade mark is identical on both bottles, but in the one case it is alleged to be made in England, and in the other in Hungary. I want to make is, if during the war we kill a trade mark, we can k ill the trade absolutely, because, if we k ill the trade description, there will not be sufficient inducement for these men to run all the risks necessary to keep this hostile trade alive. If , by using the same trade mark, and by still requiring people to ask for the same things, they can keep the trade alive until after the war, they will have achieved their purpose. Take the case of aspirin, which has been before the Courts recently. Aspirin is manufactured in Englandunder another name it is true; but the public had been, educated to ask for aspirin, and the enemy want to make the public ask for it until the war is over.",18
143,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What is the name?,18
144,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As p i r in is, I tliink, manufactured in England by an English firm under the name of Emperin. There is no secret about aspirin; it is simply a chemical which anybody can manufacture. If the Government were to prohibit the use of the name "" as p i r in "" every one would begin to understand that emperin would produce similar results, and the Government would transfer enemy trade and ""good will "" at once into the hands of their own friends. It is the same with "" 4711."" There is no secret ahout its manufacture. It is simply a trade cologne. In Adelaide, cologne is being manufactured quite as good as "" 4711."" There is no magic in the trade mark ' 4 7 l l , "" except the trade £ value of the reputation- a reputation built up, not necessarily by merit, but by business organization. As Germany has seen f it to make war on the world, why should we keep her trade reputations alive ? Why not wipe out the use of theso articles ? I remind the Minister of Trade and Customs that the Prime Minister expressed a cordial sympathy with this idea of mine when it was first mentioned i u the House ahout a week ago. He has since expressed the same sympathy with the idea.",18
145,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is about the enemy trade mark? The same,18
146,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is about prohibiting enemy trade marks. I would go further and prohibit trade descriptions also. The right honourable gentleman has expressed general approval of my idea, and I would like my honourable friend who is in charge The point of the Trade and Customs Department to act.",18

154,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is my honourable friend's own Minister who has given Mr . Blau this chance. It is his own Government who have been in charge of the Department for the last year. This thing has been going on freely and widely. I believe that the American Government could offer no objection to a straight-out declaration of our views on those lines. They might feel some difficulty if we were to act as private detectives too keenly in America with regard to American manufactures. But if we were to make a straight-out proclamation that for the future we will allow no goods covered by an enemy trade mark to enter Australia, and to notify those trade marks in neutral countries, Ave would have no difficulty from this time out to the end of the war.",19

159,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wakefield) S 4..46] - Unde r the item of contingencies '. wish to deal with the question of the charges for the transport of the forthcoming wheat harvest. Unsatisfactory as this business has been from the very beginning, the crowning point was reached in the determination of the Government, re-asserted today by the At torney-General, to appropriate 3-Jths of t h "" usual charterage commission [229]- 2 of 5 per cent, for the purposes of the public revenue. I believe that that amount is to be shared-in what proportions I do not know-betwee n the Federal Government and the Governments of the four wheat-growing States. In my opinion, the initial mistake was that the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Government, deliberately failed, if he did not refuse, to consult the wheat-growing interests on a matter so peculiarly affecting themselves as this does, and in regard to which there existed as complete and perfect machinery for chartering as could be found outside in shipping circles that do not touch the wheat interests as regard buying and shipping. When this matter cropped up at first, I could get no satisfaction, in answer to questions, from the Attorney-General, and I urged the Prime Minister to consider whether it was not a proper matter to be referred to the War Committee. . If it had been submitted to that body it would have been considered by gentlemen who were conversant with the wheat business, and probably a good deal of trouble would have been avoided. I feel confident that a more satisfactory arrangement would have been made, because a less satisfactory one is not conceivable. The reply of the Prime Minister to me was that it would probably be a proper matter to refer to the War Committee if there was no urgency, and on that account it had to be dealt with without seeking the advice of a body which was specially created for such purposes as the one under review. Although the matter has been declared so urgent, pretty well a month has elapsed since the beginning of the negotiations, and things have only just been completed and the agreement laid on the table. I urged the Attorney-General at the beginning to take counsel with the wheat-shipping interests, mentioning that the president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Melbourne could bring delegates here from the Chambers in the wheat-growing States within forty-eight, if not within twenty-four, hours, and that the Chamber of Commerce of each State would, no doubt, send representatives from its wheat section. But it was not until the Attorney-General and the State Ministers for Agriculture had been in conference for two days or more, and - had completed the arrangements, that those connected with the corn trade were consulted, although representatives of the trade had been available in Melbourne for a considerable period. When called in they could not put their case effectively before the Minister, because he informed them that arrangements had been already determined upon. The need in this abnormal time for a central and exclusive authority to handle the wheat chartering is recognised by the trade, and I am not objecting to that. But the agreement is not at all satisfactory. Not only did the Attorney-General fail to consult the trade, but he showed no readiness to consult members representing wheat-growing districts, who would have been only too glad to advise him as to the best methods to adopt in the interests of the country as well as of the wheat-growers, whose interests should he paramount. The wheat growers have heen selected as victims to be fleeced hy the Government by the imposition of a tax which will amount to not less than Id. per bushel on the whole of the wheat grown in Australia this year.",19

ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang$ [5.0] - The sum of £1,000 is set down as a grant for the expenses of the administration of Norfolk Island, but I do not know what items it covers. I wish to point out very briefly the need for the establishment of a wireless station at Norfolk Island. Vessels are to be employed in the New Hebrides trade which, I understand, will be fitted with wireless; and it will be an advantage if they can communicate with Norfolk Island, which is a cable station, but has not a wireless installation. A wireless installation would be of advantage, also, in times of war, in enabling information to be be given concerning enemy vessels and other matters, and might sometimes assist in the finding of steamers which had broken down. Norfolk Island is out of the track of many vessels; but it occasionally happens that a steamer, many of which have only one propeller, breaks down and is unable to make port under «ail. Such a vessel, if equipped with wireless and witliin call of Norfolk Island, could make known her plight and position, and information of her whereabouts could be sent from Norfolk Island by wire'ess or by cable to the mainland. I understand that the cost of a wireless installation would be very small, because there is already a power plant connected with the cable station. I ask the Minister of External Affa rs, in framing future Esti: mates-if provision has not already been made for this work-to seriously consider the advisability of establishing a wireless installation on Norfolk Island. I also call his attention to the need of supplying the Administrator, Customs offioer, and visiting medical officer, with some means of transit between the shipping and th© shore, instead of compelling them to depend, as at present, on boats belonging to private persons. Two small companies own all the boats on the island, and Government officials having business with ships lying off the island are entirely pendent on them for transport to and fro. It was related to me that on one occasion some one threatened to leave the Customs officer on board a vessel which he was visiting, because of action he took in the discharge of his duties. Government official should not be dependent on the good-will of private persons for necessary transport. What is needed is a steam launch, or an oil launch, and one or two other boats. A launch could be used, not merely to convey Government officials to and from the shipping, but also to assist the local whaieboats, which occasionally get into difficulties in negotiating the heavy surf through which they have to go to land on the beach. Fortunately, there have not been any accidents very lately; but a powerful launch could render great assistance in a case of difficulty, and should accidents happen at sea could assist in the rescue of shipwrecked crews and do other useful work. There are no harbors in the island, and no wharfs. I hope that these matters will receive the attention of the Minister. Proposed vote agreed to. Department of Defence, £13,449,380.",20
173,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Ballarat) [5.5] - I am sorry that the Minister for the Navy is not present, because there are one or two matters of administration to which I should like to draw his attention. any case, it is not of much use speaking to the Minister for the Navy, because it is difficult to get matters brought under the notice of the Department, in consequence of the Minister of Defence not having a seat in this Chamber. ever, there are, as I say, one or two matters in regard to which I must voice my dissent. Quite a number of Ballarat recruits, who are at present at Broadmeadows, Seymour, Flemington, and Ascot Vale, are desirous of going to a camp at Ballarat, where they will, of course, be near to their homes; but the Commandant informs me that the medical authorities will not permit the transfer owing to a fear of spreading the disease of meningitis. This is a peculiar attitude to adopt, in view of the fact that every night we may see hundreds of men from the camps in Melbourne, and only on Friday last 30 or 40 of them went to their homes at Ballarat. The men from the camps are allowed to mingle with the public in Melde- bourne and Ballarat, and yet there is this unwillingness to transfer-the recruits of whom I have spoken to a camp at Ballarat. I suggest that a second site should be selected at Ballarat, and the local men transferred there and A isolated, perhaps, a week. This, I think, would do away with any danger of the disease spreading, seeing that, according to the authorities, the germs of meningitis do not live for more than a few hours. While the recruits are in Australia we ought to give them every posisible comfort, and there are many advantages they could enjoy if the Ballarat men, and others from Bendigo and Geelong, were sent into local camps. Heaven knows they will presently have discomfort enough in Egypt, Gallipoli, or wherever they have to do the fighting! From what I have seen, I do not think that the Minister of Defence is very anxious that lionorable members should visit the Ascot Vale or other camps; but, in my opinion, every opportunity should be afforded us to inspect all of them. It is very annoying to see a Defence Department motor car containing women rushing past when one is walking to the camp. It is not that we particularly wish a ride in a motor oar, but now that the war is on we are engaged from 15 to 18 hours a day attending to the interests of our constituents, and we cannot afford the time to go by rail. The Victorian State In Government provide cars to carry members to the various Departments, and I trust that the Minister for the Navy will make similar provision to enable members of this Parliament to visit the various military camps. There is no doubt that How- when we do get to the camps we desire thoroughly to look into matters; but I was told by a corporal the other day, when I was at Ascot Vale, that I had no right there. I contend that it is my duty, as a Federal member, to go everywhere in a camp, and that any order to the contrary should be cancelled immediately.",21
174,Mr JENSEN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is generally recognised that a member's pass permits him to go anywhere.,22
175,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That ought to be so, and I think that the Minister will admit that the suggestion I have made is a reasonable one.",22
176,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I understood that it was the policy of the Department to put recruits into local camps.,22
177,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not know what the Government policy is-it is most remarkable in. regard to some matters. There are numbers of men from Bendigo and elsewhere at Ballarat, but scarcely a local man amongst them. It is curious that the other day, when' I was in the camp, I saw a lot of new coppers branded "" Made in Germany."" Of course these coppers may have been commandeered by the Defence Department; but, in any case, such a brand does not look well in an Australian camp, and if any official has purchased these goods, I should say that he could be charged with trading with the enemy. As to the cooking arrangements at Ascot Vale and Ballarat, they are just about equal to those of the blackfellows hundreds of years ago. trench is dug, and there are a few old pots which are not dir t proof, and how the fires are kept alight in such weather as we have had recently I cannot comprehend.  "" broken in "" for the front !",22
178,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"At the front there are travelling kitchens, and, surely to goodness, after twelve months' experience, cookers could be provided for the camps? At the least, the men, while in Australia, ought to be supplied with decent food. The pots that the food is boiled in are not air-tight, and, in one case, two cigarette butts were picked out of the food.",22
179,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Cigarett e butts have been found in the bread before today.,22
180,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There can be no excuse for the absence of cookers.,22
181,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What are Defence Committee doing?,22
182,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not know that the Defence Committee have anything to do with this: but we ought to have better methods after twelve months' experience. There is another and a more serious matter to which I desire to call attention. Every morning four men are taken from each camp for fatigue duty, and they are supposed to peel potatoes and onions, carry meat and bread, and otherwise assist the cooks. They take the waterproof sheets they have slept in , throw them over their shoulders, and on them carry the meat. An inspection of the - men took place two weeks ago, and, though I cannot speak as to the result, we can imagine what was probably discovered. This is a"" dirty method of carrying food about, and hundreds of innocent lads may be ruined by it . Surely the Department could provide vehicles of some kind in order to insure the clean transport of the food ? The other morning, in G Company, at Ascot Vale, the men could not eat the stew that was provided for breakfast, but they were told by the commanding officer that dry bread would not h u rt them, and that it was good for heartburn. I feel sure that he did not have such a breakfast. The men have stew for breakfast, stew for dinner, and bread and jam at tea time. Most of us here had a three or four-course meal at 1 o'clock today, and, though we have been merely sitting here since, most of us will doubtless have another similar meal A this evening.",22
183,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,As k the Minister for the Navy what he thinks of all this!,22
184,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am speaking to are being the Minister for the Navy, who looks as though he were "" taking it all in . "" The men get a meal at 12.30 o'clock, but the method of serving it is certainly not the best, the meat being set down without being cut up, and it is left to the soldiers to each cut off what he wants. The most goes to the strongest, and it is a brutalizing and demoralizing method. A f t e r dinner the men do about three hours' drill, and then have tlieir tea of bread and jam, and it is not to be wondered at that, with such feeding, there is a lot of sickness. A f t e r three hours' drill a more substantial meal is certainly necessary; but if you go to the Department, and complain, there is produced a the list showing that 4 ounces of jam and so many pounds of meat per day is served out,- and are told that this represents bigger rations than those of any army in the world. That is not the question; the question is whether what is given is enough. It is no use giving the men all this food at one meal, because that can only mean waste. The recruits are physically the fittest in Australia, and no man working on a farm, or any other ordinary occupation, would be satisfied with bread and jam at 5 o'clock, wilh nothing to follow until breakfast the next day. I hope that all this will be altered, and that good wholesome meals will be provided. The officers are not given bread and jam at 5 o'clock, but have their own mess, and, of course, good food. It is true that they pay for the luxuries they get, but there is a vast difference between their meal, with the accompaniment of a military band to give them an appetite, and the meal given to . the men. The strains of the band oan be heard by the privates, and the smell of the officers' food can also reach them; but these do not f ill empty stomachs. I have already brought before the Defence Department the question of the appointment of M i l it i a officers to all the good positions in connection with the training camps. I refer to men who will not volunteer for active service, and.,whom the Department is encouraging in that attitude by making sure that they receive all the good positions that are offering at exorbitant salaries. I have a list of these salaries, which I have taken from the Argus of Friday last. A colonel is paid £2 5s. a day, with a field allowance of 7s. 6d. a day; a lieutenant-colonel is paid £ 1 17s. 6d. a day, with a field allowance of 7s. 6d. a day; a major is paid £.1 10s. a clay, with a field allowance of 5s. a day; a captain is paid £1 2s. 6d. a day, with a field allowance of 3s. 6d. a day; and a subaltern is paid 15s. a day wi th a field allowance of 3s. 6d. a day. We cannot buy cookers for men in the camp, yet we can pay M i l it i a officers, who are too cowardly to go to the front, the same salaries as are paid to the men who are fighting for us. We are throwing money away. We are paying hoys £7 a week as lieutenants, yet the sergeant-majors, the foundation of our defence system, the men who have done all the good work, are given no chance of promotion. If a sergeant-major wishes to go to the war he can do so only as a sergeant-major, and he must go under the command of the boy that he has trained to be a lieutenant. am tired of drawing attention to this in justice, and of asking the Minister of Defence to alter the rates of pay. But, first of all, I would not employ those M i l it i a officers who will not volunteer for the front, though for years the country has heen preparing these men for just such a crisis as is now occurring. We naturally e::.pected that these men would be the best fitted to lead our boys on the battle-field, but today, when we need six majors to go with our troops, though there are many who are qualified to go, they will not volunteer, and the Department encourages them by giving them all the positions in the camns in Australia at the same salaries as they would receive if they went to the front.",22
185,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The i r names should be published.,23
186,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The names of these men who go strutting about in uniforms, making out that they are the saviours of the country, should be published broadcast. If the country had to depend on them for its safety it would be in an extremely bad way.",23
187,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Of course, there are' many men who would like to go, but as their services are required here they are not allowed to go.",23
188,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I am not referring to those men; I am dealing with those who will not volunteer.,23
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Many M i l it i a officers have volunteered, but have been turned down by the medical examiners.",23
190,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I know one man who was in a good job and who volunteered. He had a paragraph put in a newspaper to the effect that he was rejected because of an old strain. A thousand to one he told the doctor all about it , and never intended to go. In fact, it was a strain on him to go so far as to get examined. However, he was well rewarded, for he was appointed to a position at £540 a year. Class distinction is just as r if e in the Australian A r m y as in the British Army. Every sergeant-major who got away at the outbreak of the war was made a captain in the Imperial Army, and reports have come to hand that the British authorities cannot understand why the Australian authorities have not made use of the serI vices of their sergeant-majors at the front and given them commissions. The trouble is that there seems to be a little circle about the Minister of Defence which is determined that the sergeantmajors shall not be dealt with justly.",23
191,Mr FOWLEE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is it not the the Minister of Defence to break up that circle ?,24
192,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Certainly ; and I am trying to help him to get r i d of the crowd that advise him in these matters. We want our Australian boys to go to the front led by the ablest officers we have, and they are the sergeant-majors. At Plemington one sergant-major has charge of 6,000 men. He does all the drilling. The Commanding Oflicer goes round once a week, and has a look at things. One man receives the salary and all the honour; the other man does all the work. We are crying out for the best men to lead our Forces, yet we will not give these sergeant-majors, who are willing and anxious to go to the front , commissions enabling them to do so. do not blame them for not desiring to go as sergeant-majors. Why should they leave here under the control of a man such as one I know, whose first order on getting his commission was, "" I d l l in men, two t h i c k ! "" Such was his idea of his work. Sergeant-majors are supposed to volunteer and go to fight under such men. Language is not strong enough to condemn the Department for its treatment of thesenon-commissioned officers.",24

194,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The member for Nepean did splendid work. The pity is that honourable members have to do this work. Unless something is done in regard to these abuses, my party will fall in over this Defence question, because the country is seething with discontent about it .",24

196,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes , and my party will right it . I am doing my best to assist it in doing so. The other day Senator Lt - Colouel O'Loghlin was sent away in charge of a troop-ship; but I say that there is no need to appoint these men in charge of troop-ships, because the men who are to lead our boys on the battle-field should be well qualified to take charge of them on troop-ships.",24
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Quite a number of colonels have gone in charge of troopships.,24
198,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is a splendid seaduty of trip for them. The quarter from which I am being applauded makes me suspicious, but I know that I am speaking the' truth . Men who are going to lead our boys on the battle-field should have charge of them on the troop-ships. The Selection Committee in Victoria should be chosen from the General Staff, from among the men who are our recognised experts, and who are responsible for the training of the troops. We do not look to find expert military men among the M i l it i a officers. We get them from the General Staff. I am not surprised that we are not having the best officers recommended for appointment; and I suggest that the Minister should dispense with the services of the M i l it i a officers on the Selection Committee, and appoint three men from the General Staff. We are sendI ing boys to the Dardanelles without rifle practice. That was one of the charges made by the honourable member for Nepean, and I think that it was proved. I know of a lad who, while he was in training here, fired out of a rifle once, and within five weeks of leaving Australia word was received that he was killed at Gallipoli. I have spoken to a lad who has been a month or six weeks in a training camp, and asked, "" Have you seen a rifle?"" and he replied, "" No ; I charges do not know what a rifle is; I have never been near one."" When we want these lads to do work for the Empire we should certainly see that they are trained in the use of the rifle, otherwise it is of honourable not much use sending them away.",24

200,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We all know that the Minister's position is no sinecure at the present time, and that it is an absolutely impossible task for him to supervise everything. The W a r Committee should be' given some power, otherwise it will be a useless body. It should be their business, and not that of the Minister, to go to the camps and see what is going on, and they should have the power to rectify the evil's that are apparent. It is not the wish of the Government or of the people of Australia that our boys should be treated badly in the training camp or on the battle-field. We are not responsible for many things that occur at Gallipoli, but we can rectify every wrong that is existjam. ing in the camps in Australia. In fact, they ought to have been rectified long ago.

At some camps-at I believe nearly all of them-breakfas t is fixed at 8 The men get some kind of meat for meal; they have a substantial meal middle of the day, and at 4.30 in the afternoon they get bread and butter jam.",25
210,Mr SHARPE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They get no butter.,25
211,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Then it is bread and They get nothing froi.i half-past 4 in the afternoon until So'clock next morning-anc l it must be borne in mind that the 4.30 o'clock meal consists of only bread and jam. The result of this dietary sometimes has been that men on early duty - befor e they get breakfast-hav e been to fall to the ground through sheer physical weakness. It ought to be remembered that, as a rule, in Australia, the substantial meal of the day is taken after work is over. That is, I think, a very sensible and proper way of dining, for heavy meal taken in the middle of the day, or in the midst of active physical is not good for any one. I do not see, therefore, why this mid-day meal should not be transferred to the evening, and made a little later; or, if that cannot at be done, some supper should be provided for the men before they turn in. To ask who are any man who is undergoing the hard strain of military training to go without anything to eat from 4.30 in the afternoon until So'clock the following the morning is absolutely preposterous. In the Imperial Army the practice is as has I been adopted here; but it has to be remembered that men attached to the Imperial Army can make arrangements amongst themselves for an extra meal before they conturn in, and that, as a rule, in most of the military quarters in Great Britain, these extras can be obtained at very little that trouble and expense. Arrangements of this sort cannot be made in our camps, and and in consideration of the well-known fact care that the great hulk of our men are refor cruited from homes where the food is substantial and abundant, we ought, at any rate, to let them down gradually. knows that when they go to the front things will be rough enough. They will face the hard conditions like men, as they have always hitherto done; but whilst they are in training in Australia posan effort ought to be made to give our fairly substantial meals at reaA few evenings ago I saw a newso'clock. paper report to the effect that a this certain Colonel Pethebridge had been in the received with great eclat at Rabaul. I believe that Colonel Pethebridge is none and other than the gentleman who is Secretary of the Defence Department, and who, until recently, was known as Commander Pethebridge. How has this gentleman been able to change his rank from naval to military in this way? What is the meaning of it? Surely we attach more importance to these positions than this change would indicate! Why is it , also, that this gentleman, who ought to be here at the Central Administration of the Defence Department, is away in New Guinea on this fantastic expedition? A u acting administrator was in charge there during the absence of Colonel Pethebridge, and managed perfectly well. Why was he not left in charge, and why was not Colonel Pethebridge brought back to the work that is waiting for him at the Defence Department here? Instead of this,.he has gone off on this holiday, and gets out of all the racket here. I contend that Colonel Pethebridge's place is in Melbourne, at the centre of the Defence Administration, and that he has no business to be either in New Guinea or anywhere else than Melbourne at the present time.",25
212,Mr JENSEN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He is the administrator for the Defence Department in New Guinea.,26
213,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not care who he is the administrator for. Men can be obtained in New Guinea to do the work necessary there; but a man of Colonel Pethebridge's, or Commander Pethebridge's, experience in regard to the administration of matters with which the Defence Department is concerned ought to be here at this juncture. I think it is about time that the Minister of Defence and his colleagues seriously considered whether Colonel Pethebridge, or Commander Pethebridge, or whatever he is, could not be better utilized at headquarters, in his own position, than in New Guinea. I want, also, to emphasize what the honourable member for Ballarat has said with regard to the employment of militia officers in camps. I know one camp-Seymour-wher e there is a considerable number of what are known as "" school sergeants ""-that is to say, sergeants who have gone through the school of training for military officers, who have passed with credit, and who are only waiting for their commissions. They will obtain these commisisons when they go to the front, but, for the time being, they have to stand aside, while militia officers are brought in to take charge of the men in camp. I may say, too, that my information on this point agrees exactly with what the honourable member for Ballarat has said-that some of these militi a officers are not fit for the work, and that they should not be holding important positions. Common sense will suggest that the ""school sergeants,"" who are to have the handling of men when at the front, should also handle them in camp. The sooner they get down to their real duties the better, but it appears to be necessary to find lucrative billets for some of these militia officers, and, in consequence, the men who ought to be in charge remain in lower positions while the militia officers make some pretence of doing the work. This matter is one which I think might very well receive the seri1 ous consideration of the Minister of Defence and his colleagues. May I elaborate somewhat on the interjection I made a little while ago? There can be no doubt at all that the Minister of Defence is passing through a period of considerable difficulty, and I keenly sympathize with him on that account; but it appears to me that that honourable gentleman to some extent has lost himself in the Department. There are many matters regarding which he ought to be in evidence, yet we cannot find him. I have no doubt he spends long and laborious days dealing with matters of administration that might very well have been in trusted to some of his permanent officials - for instance, such duties as those that ought to be carried out by the permanent head of the Department, who just now happens to be in New Guinea. I know that the Acting Secretary, Mr Trumble, is a very fine fellow personally, and a very capable officer, but he has not had the training that Colonel Pethebridge has had, and, being only temporarily in charge, he lacks that sense of responsibility that can only come to a man who holds the position permanently. If Colonel Pethebridge, or Commander Pethebridge, is the officer that he ought to be, as the permanent head of the Department of Defence he would be at head-quarters taking a considerable share of the burden off the shoulders of the Minister. But as regards some of the larger matters that have been recently brought to light, it is impossible to acquit the Minister of Defence altogether. It is quite true that subordinates may have been responsible for many of theshortcomings that have occurred, but if we are to have representative government, we must hold the Minister responsible for the acts of his subordinates, and if the Minister has not the capacity for organizing his Department that he ought to have, then the consequences must be upon his own head. 1 very much regret that at the present juncture we should find the Defence Department in such a state of confusion. It appears to me that right through the Department, from top to bottom, a certain class of individual whose one idea has heen to swagger about in a flash uniform, has got there in times of peace, and now, when we are face to face with the actual conditions of war, we have not a man at the head who can hunt these wasters out, and get the right men put in their places. We want a Lord Kitchener hero. That was one of the first duties Lord Kitchener put upon himself.",26
214,Mr BURNS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member must not forget that Lord Kitchener has been subjected to severe criticism in England.,27
215,Mr FOWLEE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is no doubt that Lord Kitchener has been subjected to criticism, but so far as I know that criti cism has been only in regard to munitions. Any one who knows anything at all about the work that Lord Kitchener has done, can only have an overwhelming feeling of admiration for that very remarkable man; but when we come to the head of our own Defence Department-is there any honourable member who can tell me, definitely, what the present Minister of Defence has done? do not think there is a single act of his that stands out-that we can identify with the present Minister. Wherever we look we find nothing but mistakes and shortcomings, and we cannot find that the Minister of Defence put out his hand to remedy any of these defects u n t i l he was compelled. Take the Small Arms Factory, for instance! Take the Liverpool Camp! Take the conditions at all the other camps! There has had to be a hullabaloo about them all before anything was done. It is nothing short of a misfortune to Australia that we_have not a man with more grit and driving power - than appears to be the possession of the man at the head of the Defence Department at the present time. I think even honourable members opposite are seized of this. While I recognise the hugeness of 1 the task confronting the Minister of Defence, I cannot blind myself to his imperfections, and I want to point out that in all probability the country, and certainly the Parliament, according to all methods of parliamentary procedure, must hold the Minister of Defence-and his colleague, too, I am sorry to say-responsibl e for the things that have been the cause of so much grumbling and complaint. W it h regard to the Defence Committee, I have all along held that it ought to have been given executive power.",27
216,Mr JENSEN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Executiv e power!,27
217,Mr FOWLEE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes . The Minister of Defence and his colleagues ought to have agreed to hand over certain executive and administrative powers to that Committee. Otherwise its appointment is little more than a matter of form, and the Committee can do very little good.",27

219,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We know that it is. If it is to do any work it must be given more power.

I dare say that most honourable members have received letters similar to those sent to me on this subject. In one of these I am informed that a sergeant-major with many years* experience, and through whose hands thousands of men have passed, is in camp under the control of his own son, who has had but a year or two of experience. The son has acquitted himself well during his short military career. His advance has been more rapid than that of his dad, and he finds himself today in a position of command. The sergeant-major, who, I was going to say, has forgotten almost more than his son ever knew, has to do his bidding. Despite his training he can obtain no advancement. should be entitled to more consideration.",27

222,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite likely, and in these matters we need practical men.",28
223,Mr RODGERS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the honourable member suggest that the theory tests sliould be abolished?,28
224,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; they are all well so far as they go, but they should be scattered to the winds for the time being, and practical men who are fit to occupy these positions should be appointed to them. I am glad that the Minister for the Navy showed his readiness to take immediate action when complaints were made regarding the fitting out of transports. I am pleased that he handed over the matter to that very able public officer the Auditor-General, and I hope that wherever the' Minister of Defence and the Minister for the Navy have the slightest suspicion that business arrangements in connection with the war are not going on correctly, the Auditor-General and his staff will be allowed a roving comGreat mission, so that military and naval men, to do as we have. who know little about business methods, may be pulled up.",28
225,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Auditor-General has thrown out valuable hints of which tion of a National Government. these officers have taken no notice.,28
226,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I gather that the fence Ministers have practically authorhecause ized the Auditor-General to keep an eye on the naval and military expenditure. The Auditor-General can deal with any injudicious expenditure of public funds. He can pull up even the Prime Minister, and I am glad that he has taken a hand in this matter. Already great savings been effected, I believe, through the tion of the Defence Ministers in entering into fresh agreements. I have ceived this information fro m a Minister, but I understand that during the last months officers of the Auditor-General's Department have been inquiring into various matters of Defence expenditure. They are endeavouring, as far as possible, to bring naval and military men down business lines, and to instruct them conduct tlieir business in such a way as will be more conducive to economy and efficiencv.",28
227,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is plenty of room for improvement. Such men Mr Fenton - Is that not the position everywhere? We are told that even in well-organized Germany, with its complete system of espionage and Governmental control, the Government of that country have been got at to the extent of about £5,000,000 by contractors and others. It is upon such men that we need to keep a watchful eye. We have in Australia very men who deserve to be treated as the Generalissimo of the Russian A r m y said he would deal with those who rob the Government. "" The man who steals,"" he said, ""should be shot or hanged."" Where a man wilfully takes out of the public purse more than that to which he is entitled, he should be treated in this way. The Hansard report of the House of Commons debates shows that complaints in this respect are even more bitter than are some of the comments made in this Parliament. Wherever war is, there seem to be a number of harpies who call themselves patriots, but are prepared to rob their country in the time of its greatest need.  Britain have t h i r ty times as much",28

The position there has been improved since the formaMen who occupied high Ministerial office in DeGreat Britain have been brushed aside, of the belief that they were not fully capable of carrying out their duties, and others have been put in their places. I am in favour of treating our troops as well as it is possible to treat them, more particularly in regard to food supplies; but even under the most advanced syshave tems, mistakes are Ukely to occur where aclarge bodies of men are congregated. We seem to have some few men who are not reunable to look after themselves. While in Sydney recently, I sat at breakfast ten with a man who informed me that he was preparing to go to the front, and that he had been in the Liverpool Camp for three months. When I remarked, "" We have heard a lot about the camp'lately,"" to he replied, "" Yes; but speaking for myto self and a number of others, I can say there is no cause for complaint. If other men would do what a few of us have done for ourselves there would bono trouble."" He proceeded to show that he and others occupying the same tent had brought to bear a little practical experience in so fitting it up as to make it very comfortable. Some of the men look for too much.",28

230,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . As soon as the honourable member for Nepean made his request for an inquiry into the camp,' anticipated whafc the disclosures were likely to be. A Commissioner in New Zealand has just reported a number of deficiencies in connection with the Trenview, tham and other camps in the Dominion, which are almost identical with those found in respect of our camps. The proprovements fessional soldier ought not to make mismittee, takes; but I think we should regard a little more considerately than we do who are really only amateurs in matters tions. of defence. The organization of a body of from 120,000 to 125,000 country of magnificent distances like Australia must be attended with great difficulties, and it would be strange if many mistakes were not made. A thousand and one duties devolve upon the Minister of Defence; and I am grievously disapand pointed that members of the War Comto be effective."" mittee should say that, for all they can do, the Committee might just as well be disbanded.

There would have been counter-strokes to will lead to improvement. some of the attacks that have come from the members of the Opposition. Comsuggestions; rtlniuts in regard to the Defence organizamv tion are not peculiar to the Australian Parliament. I asked a question of the Minister for the Navy today in regard to the Commission that investigated fence matters in New Zealand. I had two objects in view-firstly , to obtain findings of that Commission, and, secondly, to discover if any suggestions had been made which might be applicable If in the camps throughout the CommonI n regard to the treatment of sick soldiers, everybody sympathizes with the men who have enlisted, and desires that they shall have proper housing accommodation, food, and training. We should do the best we possibly can for them. But there are two sides to the question. There is not only the sickness in the camps, but also the pessimism which some honourable members seem to voice. Surely there is left in us some optimism. In all countries which are engaged in this war delicate men have been passed into camp, and their successfully undergoing the medical examination has caused surprise. Yet they have passed through the camps of training, and some men who entered camp weighing not more than stone, in Egypt have turned the scale, ashave well-trained men, at 10 stone and 11 Remarkable physical developmatment has followed the camp training in many cases, and we must bear in mind that beneficial result in contrast to the sickness of which we hear so much. There are many things that yet require attention, but the Ministers are doing of their best. If the men under their control are not carrying out their duties, they should be dealt with at once, but I am confident that no men in Australia are more inclined to do their duty to our departing soldiers, in order to send them the front physically fit, well trained, well armed and well equipped, than are members of the present Ministry.",30
257,Mr SHARPE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Hav e you heard that - some men have been returned from Egypt because they have not been able to stand the strain ?,30
258,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No doubt there are such cases. I am prepared to criticise Ministers if I find they are ih the wrong, and to make suggestions that I believe Ministers are prepared to receive such but if I find them stubborn, criticism will become more severe. Members desire to see the conditions made better than they are, and, that being so, Ministers should pay attention to Detheir criticisms. I am sure my remarks this afternoon have been listened to symthe pathetically by the Minister for the Navy. I know that he has done good work, and recently he took a step which will mean a saving of thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth. Again, I would urge that business men should have charge of business affairs in the Defence Department, even if such an arrangement means the standing aside of some of the military officers. Minister will engage practical men to keep a watch on the expenditure, we shall carry out our war preparations in a much less expensive manner than in the past.",30
259,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Lang) [6.14] - Wit h a great deal of the criticism which the honourable member for M a r ibyrnong has launched against the A d ministration I am in entire agreement; but after the speech he has delivered it is rather cool on his part to accuse the members of the Opposition of criticising Defence administration from a partisan stand-point. There has been no such intention on the part of any honourable member on this side of the House who has made representations or complaints about Defence matters. A p a r t from the recent findings of Mr Justice Rich in regard to the conditions at the Liverpool Camp I would remind the honourable member that much of the criticism and some of the most damaging complaints that have been made have emanated from Government supporters. But in every in stance the complaints from Opposition members have been first made to the responsible authorities. Therefore, the charge of the honourable member for M a r ibyrnong that the complaints from this side of the House had a party complexion is unfounded and unworthy. I desire to call attention to a matter which I made the subject of a question to the Minister of the Navy, and in regard to which T had expected a reply today. I told the Minister at the time that I had good and sufficient grounds for the question I was asking, and those grounds are contained in the following letter which I have received from a constituent: My son left Sydney on the Karoola, A 03. on the 1 Oth June. He' had heen just over three weeks in camp since enlisting: he was eighteen years of age, and had four years' training in the Cadets, and was just accepted as a trooper in the Light Horse when he sailed on active service. The most of his comrades in his company (I think all) had never had any training at nil. Yet in Monday's paper, by the casualty list, I sec they have been in the trenches for sonie time, and officers and men are wounded: and it is only eight weeks since they loft those shores, so they have evidently been taken straight to the front, most of them untrained. This is the point: I had the evidence of the military officers in the inquiry made by Mr. Justice Rich, who stated that no one was sent to the front without proper training. The writer of that letter is Mr Willia m Maston, a reputable business man of If the Spring-street, Sydney. There we have a statement that those boys had never received any training, and yet they were reported wounded eight weeks after they had left Australia. When such a statement is made by a reputable and responsible citizen, there must be reasonable ground for it . I do not charge the M in ister with any responsibility in the matter ; but I ask him to hold an investigation in order to seo whether the statement is correct, and, if so, discover who is responsible. Such an inquiry is especially desirable, in view of the evidence given before Mr Justice Rich that nobody had been sent to the fron t without receiving proper training. An y one who is responsible for sending raw lads straight into the trenches is guilty of a crime little short of murder.",31
260,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A r e not the authorities in Egypt responsible for those men being sent to the front?,31
261,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Pro bably ; but who is responsible for sending them from Australia without adequate training? Statements have been made by the honourable member for Eallarat that some troops have been in camp for six weeks, and have never even seen a rifle. They are expecting to be sent away at any moment. They cannot obtain rifle training whilst they are on board ship. I have conversed with many of the men who have had experience of transports, and they assure me that the only training they received on board was in the nature of ordinary physical exercises, such as they would get in a gymnasium. I mention this matter in the hope that some inquiry will be made into the allegations embodied in the letter, with a view to insuring that steps shall be taken to prevent raw recruits being sent into the trenches. I hold in my hand another letter from a retired clergyman who is now in receipt of an old-age pension, and which voices a complaint Lhat is very common at the pressnt timn. It readsI have already a son at Gallipoli. He enlisted last February, and left here in May. He was paid from the day lie enlisted, I remark, nnd leaves a wife and child in receipt of the bulk of his pay. Another son, aged twentytwo, had been earning £3 a week for a length of time; he lived with us, and was our mainstay. On 10th August, this lad (George Donati) enlisted, and was "" given leave"" without pay till 25th August, yesterday, when he went into camp. Now, will you kindly use your influence to have this iniquitious robbery ended and rectified. To us it means a dead loss of £0, and has already involved me in grave difficulties and unexpected liabilities, so names. much so that I shall get very little from my pension for some time to come.

When we are calling for volunteers for service abroad, I candoubtedly, not understand why recruits should not be paid fro m the date of their Many of these men have voluntarily given up their employment prior to enlistgive the names. ment. They cannot get that work back again. They enlist under the impression tice. that they will receive their soldier's pay from the date of their acceptance. Complaints of this kind have been common for some time. Y e t the only reply vouchsafed by the Minister for the Navy is that the matter is under consideration. It cannot be under consideration for ever. Finality should be arrived at without further delay. I suppose that mination will bearrived at. the experience of many other honourable members is somewhat similar to my own. When I am afc home a great deal of my time is occupied in answering the calls of the men concerned. of persons who have enlisted for service abroad, but who say that they cannot get any money from the Defence Department. They have been ordered to submit to cination, and by so doing have rendered themselves unfit to undertake physical labour. They have also been told to port themselves usually on a date about fortnight ahead. During the interim do some of them have no means of sustencause ance, and are actually driven to begging from door to door. The members of my own family have to answer frequent from men who say they have enlisted, and who ask to be provided with a meal. That is not creditable to the Government. Because these men have had the patriotism and courage to offer their services the country in time of national peril they ought surely not to be penalized in this way.",31

Some should be made to secure an effective supervision of the food supplied to solthe diers on our transports. I do not know whether the complaints recently voiced i this House, and published in the press, about the quality and cooking of food terial served to wounded soldiers returning from Egypt have been seriously considered by still, an arsenal the Government. The complaints may have arisen in connection with some veswho sels that have been under the control of the Imperial Government, and if that be so, perhaps the Government of the Comcently monwealth could not have exercised the merely supervision they would have been in a a position to exercise on transports under their own control. I think that in conskilled nexion with transports under our control reflection some special effort should be made to see that a proper scale of provisions of the righ t kind for returning wounded soldiers is adopted. Invalids cannot be excould pected to thrive on food suitable for robust, healthy people. - suitable to the requirements of invalids should be provided on transports bringing wounded soldiers to Australia. It might be worth the while of the Government to consider the desirability of appointing members of this House to various mittees to whom might be given the supervision of a number of different matters. For instance, local military hospitals manufactured at Eveleigh. should not, I think, be left entirely to - control of the military authorities. committee might be appointed to supermachine vise the general arrangements of these hospitals, to attend to and rectify comment-an plaints and generally to assist the medical authorities in charge.

The article from which I have quoted continuesThc urgent need of machine guns for the equipment of our Forces at Gallipoli need not worry the Defence Department. If the Lithgow 'arsenal will provide the tubes, Eveleigh could-if permitted-tur n out 1,000 machine guns of the Caldwell type in a few months' time. The Caldwell weapon is simplicity itself, and its relative proportion of parts is 100 compared with 1,000 of the machine guns of other types. It was invented by an Australian engineer, ancl was constructed at a bench with ordinary tools. With the machine tools at Eveleigh, drilling through feet of solid steel in a few minutes, planing the hardest metal with the ease of a carpenter cutting wood, and the moulding of metals into any shapes, the making of the parts of a machine gun would be no more difficult than the making of the parts of a locomotive. All the steel that is required can now be procured in Australia-bu t there are ample supplies for this undertaking on the spot. W it h regard to the making of tools, it is further stated in this article that they have at Eveleigh all the appliances for the making of the tools necessary for the manufacture of machine guns. The article concludesEverv spark that flies from Krupps' furnaces, every blow that is dealt with a hammer, every wheel that revolves in the workshop, every bar of steel that is heated, is a danger to us-is a unit of a mighty weapon of strenuous warfare. Why should we he idle when wo have a weapon like Eveleigh workshops to turn against the enemy? I was glad to hear the honourable member for Fremantle say that the Munitions Committee are looking into this matter, I hope that, as a result of their inquiries, the reports they will be able to make will be of such a character as will commend to the Government the wisdom of embarking without delay upon an enterprise of this kind. The war has demonstrated above all other things the i m portance of having a sufficient supply of rapid-firing guns. We cannot at present undertake the manufacture of the heavier guns, bufc I hope that at the earliest possible date provision will be made in Australia for the supply of machine guns to our own units, and, if necessary, to visited the British A r m y . My remarks have been offered in no spirit of hostility to the Government, notwithstanding the severe criticism of the honourable member for Maribyrnong levelled against members of the Opposition. The honourable member's criticism might have been more appropriately directed to honourable members on his own side. The suggestions I have made have been offered with the most earnest desire that the Defence Department should be made as effective as possible for the successful prosecution of the war. All the time at my disposal is gratuitously at the service of the Government in any capacity in which I can be of use to them for the successful prosecution of the war. I am perfectly sure that other honourable members take the same attitude, our sole desire being to secure the greatest efficiency of our Defence Forces.",34
278,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Earlier in the afternoon I did an injustice to the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition, and I wish to take the earliest opportunity to correct the statement. I made. I find, after consultation with the Government Whip, that the right honourable gentleman's statement as to the conditions of the arrangement was correct. The main point was not in my mind, and I have some excuse for not remembering it . The honourable member for Maranoa informs me that the right honourable gentleman could not have referred to any other arrangement. In the circumstances, I feel that I am in duty bound, at the earliest possible moment, to withdraw what I said, and make this exnla,n«Hoii to the Committee",34
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should like to say that I finnrecia.te the spirit which has prompted the Prime Minister to make the statement to which we have just listened. I am glad that he has made it , because it is a serious matter that there should be such a divergence of opinion concerning arrangements made by representatives of political parties. I am very pleased that the Government Whip has been able to put matters right between us.  have been glad to learn from honourable members that the recommendations of Mr Justice Rich are to be given effect to. I hope that they will be given effect, not only in ' connection with the Liverpool Camp, but in connection with all the other camps. When I heard' from the Minister that all these recommendations were to be carried out, I was extremely pleased. I hope they will be, because they are essential to the welfare of our soldiers.' The Minister said that orders were issued as early as March last for the supply of the necessary clothing for the troops, specifying overcoats, Cardigan jackets, etc., but added that orders were not of much service when not carried out. I would emphasize the necessity of making the officers who issue orders responsible for seeing that they are carried out. The Minister also contrasted the condition of things in the German Concentration Camp and the military camps, but said that the officer who had control of the concentration camp was in exactly the same position as those in control of military camps. Why, then, is there better management and control in the one than in the other? The only possible answer is that in the first we have a man with force of character, and the courage of his convictions, prepared to make his subordinates do their duty. If we have men at the concentration camp able to do things properly, there must be some serious defect in the case of those placed in charge of the other camps. The following is a striking instance of military mismanagement:-When orders were given to remove a number of men from the Seymour Camp, it was necessary to shift some of the tents, and with them the tent ings. It took over a week to cart them away to Melbourne, and at the very time that this was being done, other tent floors were still arriving at Seymour! is one instance of many, showing a lamentable lack of business capacity. general management of our camps, apart from the military part of the business, ought to be put in the hands of business men rather than military men. If that is done there will be a marked improvement. It is asserted, also, in the Ministerial statement, that practically all the recommendations in Mr Justice Rich's interim reports have been carried into effect. I wish that was true, but it appears doubtful, judging by the following letter from a man in camp at Seymour, forwarded to me by the Rochester Recruiting C o m m it t e e Some 400 men have been placed in hospital because there are a few cases of sickness. The place they occupy is known as the pig-sty. We are a lot worse off than those are who are in the trenches. We have been here four days now, and have not been able to get a drop of water to wash. Mr Justice Rich found that common sense was not exercised at the camp in the matter of bathing and cleansing facilities, and that things obviously needed were not provided. To confine a number of men in a comparatively small space because a few of them, may be sick, under conditions where cleanliness is impossible, is the way to k ill them, and not to improve them. Men who go into camp are making a great sacrifice, and the writer of the letter complains bitterly that this is not the way to encourage them to enlist. He saysAs to the meals, the menu is half a bucket of stew and oho large loaf of bread amongst twenty men for dinner; and for tea a small loaf of bread and half a tin of jam between eight men, which, if you do not get in early, you get none of. I believe ample food is provided, but that proper methods of distributing it do not exist. The men are put on a certain allowance, and at the same time there is a scandalous waste of good food taking place at all the camps. The people are willing to pay whatever taxation is necessary or give spontaneously all the money required, but at the same time they want to know that the money contributed will be wisely and carefully expended. It is all a question of organization. The fact that the officers at the concentration floor- camp are permanent, while those at the military camps are continually coming and going, may explain some of the differences in management, but I believe the actual That reason is that at the German camp there is a real business man at the head of The affairs. Until we get business men to look after the business part of these things we shall continue to suffer, no matter what pledges the Minister makes, or what recommendations the make. Every officer intrusted with the responsibility of issuing orders should also have the responsibility of seeing that they are obeyed. Whatever we do, we must find out who is responsible for the mismanagement, because the men who are doiii"" things detrimental to the welfare of the soldiers are traitors to their country. very important question was raised by the honourable member for Ballarat the considerable number of officers in the Military Department who are receiving exactly the same pay as men who have gone to the front; but who have not volunteered, and are not willing to go. is not fair to the men at the front. are heroes, but the men who hold commissions in the Army and fail to go to the front, or to offer to go, cannot be classed in the same category. We do not keen them to be simply ornamental to our militarv concern. money in qualifying and equipping and when the necessity arises for their services at the front they should be available. I should like to know how many of these there are, and it would be interesting if the Department would a list of all those in the service of the Crown as military officers who have not volunteered for the front, are not willing to go, and are yet receiving the same pay as thoso who have gone. It is to the credit of our soldiers that only a comparatively small percentage themselves with drunkenness, are enough of them to disgrace the King's uniform to a certain extent, and bring great discredit and discomfort on others who happen to be in the same tents with them. I was previously very in favour of the dry canteen, but I confess that I have become a convert other view. We enlist men to qualify themselves as soldiers, and then allow other men to sell them dity which demoralizes them. best thing to do is to make an offence to serve any man wearing the uniform with drink outside the camp. If the men must have a certain of alcohol, I would give it to them under proper conditions in camp only. reform were effected it would lead to a great improvement, and there would be less inclination on the part of the men to leave the camps, for it is obvious that there is far too much of leaving the camps  authorities during the time they are here. Of course, as they are practically volunteers in Australia, they cannot be treated with the same strict discipline as when abroad; but the present system is doing them a considerable amount of harm, and one serious result is that it causes a number of parents to decline to allow A their sons to enlist. In my opinion all men who go to the regarding front ought to be in the same position, but that is not the case. Men in private employment, if they go to the front to serve their country, in a majority of cases receive the promise that their places This will be kept open for them when they They come back; whereas men in Government employment, if they enlist, have the difference in salary made up to them by the Department. Therefore, the latter stand in a different position to that of the volunteer in private employment. A appendages member of Parliament, if he enlists-eve n We spend if it be only for a pleasant sea voyagethem, doubles his income. This condition of things ought not to exist, especially in the case of a man who offers himself, well knowing that the age l i m it will prevent him from qualifying to go to the front . tabulate",34

I feel somewhat warmly on this subject, and, as a member of this Parliament, I amount want this House to stand absolutely right in the matTer. If this Mr HAMPSON (Bendigo) [8.19] - It is not my intention to occupy the time of the Committee for very long to-night, but I want to say a few words with regard to the military camps. As one who has taken some interest in this matter, having visited several camps, including Broadmeadows, the Show Ground, Bendigo, and Castlemaine, I think it is only right that I should tell the House what has been my experience. The honourable member for Nepean said that at the Liverpool Camp the men were treated ""lik e dogs,"" but that was not the information I received during my visits to the various camps. The men to whom I spoke did not know me, and I received no complaints that would justify me in stating to this House that the Defence Department treated volunteers like dogs. At the Seymour Camp, where the men were crowded ten and twelve in a tent, they did complain that they did not have, sufficient food for tea, but I had no complaints from the other camps about the food supply. In every instance they told me that the cooking was good, and that the food was ample.",36
283,Mr MOGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"You have not visited many camps, then. Mr HAMPSON 1I have visited the camps more often than has the honourable member.",37
284,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No , you have not.",37
285,Mr HAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is quite true that when you get a large number of men together you are bound to get complaints from some if they are not treated as parlour soldiers.,37
286,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Would you consider bread and jam for tea sufficient T,37
287,Mr HAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have seen the food distribution at the various camps, and I have been informed that it is ample. At one of the camps, where the men paid for it , they were able to get other food. The Salvation Army, for in stance, was represented there, and sold hot pies, with a cup of coffee, for 3d. They also gave the guard a cup of coffee free. The men thus spent some of their money in that direction, but, as far as the supply of food was concerned, in nearly every instance, it was ample and was well cooked.",37
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not thin k the complaint is that there is not enough food, but that the food is not efficiently distributed.",37
289,Mr HAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Anothe r complaint made about the camps has been in reference to the cooking. I have been told that in the Queensland camp, where the best bushmen are to be found, excellent results were obtained owing to the manner in which they buil t trenches and placed the pots over the fire. Still another matter to which I desire to direct attention is the fact that it costs us £ 8 5 per head to train and place a man in the firing line. We know that in Egypt a number of these men are brought into an atmosphere of temptation which is even worse than that of this city, and the results are deplorable. I have no doubt that the records are in the possession of the Department. I think, therefore, it should be the duty of the Department to take steps to warn men of the dangers that are likely to confront them, and of the probable results. This was one of the reasons why I was in favour of the decentralization of our camps, because at country centres soldiers will not have to combat the temptations that meet them in the cities.",37
290,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is the best thing the Department ever did.,37
291,Mr HAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"When I mentioned this matter of decentralization first, I was greeted with loud laughter, but the Department has seen the wisdom of this course. By concentration it is quite possible that we might save a few pounds in the training of the troops; but I take it that, after all, the health of the troops is the most important consideration, and in the end the decentralization system will prove the most economical, because the Defence Department will get the men efficient and fit in a shorter time than under the old conditions. W it h regard to the manufacture of shells in Australia, I understand that the Minister of Defence has intimated that the Department intends to call for tenders for steel, and that the price will be £ 1 0 per ton. It has occurred to me that the Department might do better by approaching manufacturers who are prepared to turn out shell bodies, and fix the price at a flat rate which would leave the ordinary manufacturer a profit. If tenders are called, there is a possibility that two or three big firms will do the whole of the work, and that will hardly be desirable.",37
292,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Corangamite) [8.26] - I must express my regret at the statement made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. According to the honourable member, no honourable member from this side of the House has any right to take any interest in the military camps or to offer any criticism of the Defence Department. I want to say, however, that honourable members of the Opposition have at all times assisted the Government as far as possible. The criticism offered by the honourable member for Nepean has been justified in every respect. On many occasions I have had in my hands information which I could have brought under the notice of honourable members of the House, but, instead of doing that, I went straight to the M in ister, or some of the heads of his Department.  the complaints dealt with effectively?",37
293,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the statement made by the lionorable member for Ballarat be true, that the men get only bread and jam at night, and nothing t ill breakfast-time, the position is really serious.",38
294,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is true.,38
295,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is one of the worse things that could be done to the men. If , however, they were given a cold lunch in the middle of the day-and while they are working that would be quite sufficient-and were given a good solid meal at night-time, they would be all the better for it .  he wants three good square feeds a day.",38
296,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"E v e n if the men were living under the most exceptional circumstances, and they had comfortable beds to sleep in each night, they would want something more than bread and jam to go to bed on; and when they have to sleep in the stalls at the Royal Show Ground there is all the more reason why they should have a good meal after their work is over. The men really want something to last them through the night. I do not know whether the Citizen Forces are treated in the same way, but I know that in the past the system was much different. Indeed, in the old militia days, men had a good cold lunch in the middle of the day, and were given a really good feed at night-time. And they wanted it . I think that a grave mistake has been perpetuated by the Defence Department. When the war broke out-and I suppose that we were all led to believe that it would not continue for so long as it has done-wha t was the system followed ? The Inspector-General, the late Maior-General Bridges, was sent away with the first troops, and no sooner was a man trained to fill that position than he was sent away with troops, and another man has now to be trained to fill that position. It has been exactly the same with the Army Medical Corps. The officer who was Director General of that corps when the war broke out was sent to the front . Another man was put in his position, and as soon as he was commencing to know where to lay his fingers on different documents, and how to give an answer to any question asked, and direct things as they should be directed, he was sent to the front . I you get refer to Colonel Fetherstone. Another man has been put in his place, and it will take him just as long to learn the duties of the position as it took his predecessor.  the "" b l o k e "" who was sent away first?",38
297,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not know to whom the honourable member is referring. In peace times we have trained men to fill certain offices. We have spent money freely, and trained men to be ready to direct the various branches of the service under their control. But as soon as a strain is put on a branch, the head is taken away, and a junior officer is put in his place. That has been the cause of the trouble to a very great extent. The honourable member for Echuca has referred to a statement which he received from the Seymour Camp in a letter dated 25th August. I received from that camp about three weeks ago a letter containing practically the. same statements. It was to the pffect that some disease broke out, and that the men were sent away to an isolation camp. My letter went f u r ther than did that of the honourable member for Echuca. It stated that the men were not only put into an isolation camp, but that they had no water to wash with ; that they could not get even enough water for washing their plates; that they had to obtain water out of puddles in the locality; and that on one occasion- I think it was last Thursday-the y were thrown one meal of bread and jam in the day. I ask the Minister for the Navy to inform the Minister of Defence that I have brought this matter before the House, and, of course, I am not acting in a party spirit in so doing. On a Thursday I went to the Minister of Defence and handed to him the letter, which was verified. The writer I knew, and the person who handed the letter to me I knew. Senator Pearce said to me, as he has always done on such occasions, "" I will get an inquiry made into this matter, and let you know the result as soon as possible."" I said, "" Will I get a reply on Saturday?"" "" No , "" he said, "" y o u will not, because I am going to sift this matter to the bottom. If such things are going on at the camp as the writer of the letter states, I will send up a special officer, not a military officer, and he will sift the complaint to the bottom, and be able to report to me."" I went to Senator Pearce last Wednesday or Thursday, when he informed me that the whole of the charges contained in the letter were groundless. Yet on the 25th August, the honourable member for Echuca received a letter containing practically the same statements, namely, that the men are not being fed properly; that the meals are thrown to them in a bucket-hande d to them in any way that is possible-and that even on the 25th August there was not sufficient water for them to wash with . I believe that Senator Pearce got a report, and that the special officer he sent must have misled liim.  that.",38
298,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister promised that he would not send one of his ordinary men, but a special officer, so that he could probe the matter to the bottom, and that is the report he received. I am aware, of course, that the Department is being subjected to a very severe strain, and it has been my desire right through not to bring up any question in the House. I would not have brought this matter up today, but would have gone to the Minister again, and asked him to make further inquiries, only that the honourable member for Echuca has quoted a letter written by a person in the camp, and stating that practically the same sort of thing is still going on. I think it is about time that the matter was inquired into properly, and that the Department got a shaking up.",39
299,Mr BURCHELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Fremantle) [8.35]. - In this debate references have been made to the munition works in connection with the Defence Department. It would appear from their utterances that certain honourable members are not aware of the existence of an organization in connection with that Department. For six or seven months, if not longer, a Departmental Munitions Committee has been at work. About two and a half months ago the Committee, in conjunction with the Minister, met representatives of the Chambers of Manufactures and Chambers of Commerce of Australia, invitin g them to meet in conference in Melbourne, and, as a result of that conference, steps were taken to form in each State a State Munitions Committee. I listened very attentively to the extract quoted from the Sydney Sun by the honourable member for Lang. To a person without inside in formation, it would appear from the extract that the Department was certainly not taking any steps to provide for the manufacture of munitions in Australia, and that, as it was'very gracefully put, the wheels might be set revolving in a very few moments, shells could be turned out, machine guns could be provided, and everything could be done; in fact, the definite statement was made that an 18pounder shell, complete in every respect, had been manufactured. That is not correct. As a matter of fact, the plans for the lS-pounder shell cases were only received in Australia six or seven weeks ago. As the result of careful investigation, standard and master gauges have been prepared, and today the Minister was in a position to announce to the public that tenders will be called immediately, and will close on the 20th September-that is, three weeks from today. . I do not think that there is any honourable member who will cavil at giving the manufacturers a period of at least three weeks in which to prepare tenders. Some reference has been made to the question of calling for tenders as against fixing a flat rate, but I remind honourable members that i u this regard we have been travelling over an entirely uncharted sea. There has been nothing to guide the Department or anybody else as to what would be the cost. We certainly have the English cost to compare with , but, owing to the different conditions prevailing in Great Britain, it is very difficult to make a comparison with Australia. We have had experience in this regard in connection with other branches of industry which are under Government control. We find that the English costs are not, and cannot be treated as, a correct guide. I understand that the War Office pays 22s. for a completed shell case, delivered at Woolwich. It has been stated that in Australia there are some manufacturers who are prepared to ask for a much smaller sum. I want honourable members to realise that they are completed shell cases, and right up to the standard. In the manufacture of a case alone there are over 150 different gaugings which have to take place in order to determine that a case is absolutely accurate. Then we have the question of the varnish which is used inside- a small matter, an honourable member might say; but if too much lead is used in its composition it will be apt to generate a very dangerous gas indeed, and you will get a dangerous explosive inside the shell itself.",39
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I read the other day that some of the blacksmiths in country districts of France were making shells at their forges.,40
301,Mr BURCHELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not credit all that I read in the press, and I do not think that the right honourable gentleman believes everything that he reads there.",40
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not know what sort of shells they were.,40
303,Mr BURCHELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I remind honourable members that Canada, which is much ahead of Australia in the manufacturing business, has not been in a position to manufacture these shells without making mistakes, and that a great many of its shells have been rejected. It is a serious proposition to the manufacturer, as well as to the Government. Each of these various phases has received very serious attention at the hands of the Munitions Committee.",40
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I suppose that there are all sorts of shells and all sorts of textures.,40
305,Mr BURCHELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I expect that there are, but I am dealing particularly with the 18-pounder shell. South Wales Government undertook to experiment in connection with the manufacture of machine guns, but the report we had today from their representative on the Munitions Committee was not by any means a complete one. It showed that practically nothing is possible of accomplishment until the plans and certain other specifications have been received from the Old Country. I am sure that honourable members generally will credit me with the desire to see as many guns as possible made quickly in Australia. At the same time, we have to make haste slowly, as we are going along an entirely new road.",40
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Government ought to have taken my advice months ago, and sent a Minister to London.",40
307,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the honourable member explain how it is we are so far behind Canada?,40
308,Mr BURCHELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We are not a great way behind the Dominion, which is only four or five days' steam from the Old Country, as compared with four weeks' steam from Australia. True it is that the cable is available, but all particulars cannot be sent by that means, and consequently we have to wait very often for information. Besides, a number of difficulties had to be overcome in connection with the War Office, which the honourable member heard explained a few weeks ago, and which militated against action being taken here. It has not been our f a u l t fchatfchedelay has occurred. The M u n i tions Committee has also taken up the question of general equipment. Some honourable members lose sigiat of the fact that the Defence Department alone has spent millions of pounds more than the whole of the Commonwealth Departments expended during the previous financial year. Tliere have been all sorts of criticisms passed on the Minister. If he was the best man who has ever walked the face of the earth, he would be criticised. But when we remember the point from which we started; when we realise how much the Department has done; when we put on one side its achievements and on the other its fail ures, is there really very much for any one to complain about? It has done at r u l y great work. Bufc it would be an absolute scandal that men should be sent from our shores without having had rifle The New practice. One such instance has come under my own notice.",40
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Honourable members opposite seem to think that'fchey may criticise as much as they please, but fchafc no one on this side may do so.  we are only partisans.",40
310,Mr BURCHELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have never taken up that attitude. If what the Defence Department has accomplished be put against all that can be found fault with, it will be seen that there is not much to complain of. It is, however, a great scandal that men should be sent from Australia before they have gained a thorough knowledge of the weapon with which they will be called upon to fight. A question to which we all might well turn our attention is the finding of employment for returned soldiers. lieve that the Committee of which the Leader of the Opposition is a member has taken the matter in hand, and is trying to find avenues of employment for theso men. A fte r the Boer War many men who had fought for the Empire walked the streets of our cities, unable to find work. We should welcome every concrete suggestion in the interest of our soldiers. There is a very wide field for endeavour in this matter. I urge the War Committee to give the question still further consideration. The difficulties will become more pressing as time goes on, because the number of returned and wounded soldiers will continually increase. are, unfortunately, maimed soldiers already in our midst, for some of whom it will be very hard to find places. Some of them will be able to do light work, but others may not be able to help themselves at all. These are provided for by the pensions schemes. But every effort should be made by the people of Australia to do everything possible for those who have risked their lives in defence of the Empire.",40
311,Dr MALONEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Melbourne) [8.50] I am in sympathy with most of the complaints made by the honourable member for Ballarat about the military camps. At Seymour the latrines were so vilely constructed that the officers responsible for them must either have had no noses, or have lacked the brains of ordinary men. Soldiers had to take off their boots and stockings, and roll up their trousers, before walking to these places, because of the filth. One does not wonder that diseases of a terrible kind have occurred. The surgeons employed in the British A r m y have had to compete in the most severe surgical examination in the British world. Even the terrible examination for a Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, is not so bad, because it is not competitive. Some of the most brilliant men in my year were unable to get into the first class. They did sufficiently well to be admitted into the A r m y Medical Corps, but they could not get the positions that they coveted until they had submitted themselves a second time. I have great admiration for our young soldiers, who have done voluntarily, because they possessed the innate pluck of Australians, what the soldiers of the European armies have had to be forced to do. It is ridiculous that our men I beshould get nothing after a meal of bread and jam and tea at 5 o'clock at night u n t i l next morning. Once upon a time the British Government used to starve the sailors on their men-of-war. I believe that there is plenty of food, but the saying that "" God sends food, and the devil sends cooks "" receives too much exemplification in our service. How could the best cook, with a dessert knife, carve satisfactorily for 100 or more men ? Why cannot we have permanent kitchens and permanent cooks? Why sliould not men with the credentials of cooks enlist as cooks? Napoleon said that an army moves upon its belly. Men fight all the There better for good food. It makes me sick to hear of men being rejected for bad teeth. The late Mr Smith, of Sydney, first drew my attention to what is known as Fletcherism, the proper chewing of food. It ' is only starchy foods that need chewing. Meat can be shredded with a knife and fork, and then allowed to slip down the throat; but starchy foods should be well chewed, and a man who is without teeth can sufficiently saturate with saliva such food by turning it over against his palate with his tongue. A man possessing not a tooth in his head, but who kept his food in his mouth until it was thoroughly mixed with the saliva, would have a better digestion than a man with a good set of teeth who merely bolted his food, or, worse still, took first a mouthf u l of food, and then a drink, which is as absurd a practice as it would be for a sheep to alternately crop a mouthful of grass and take a drink of water, then return to grass and then to the water, and so on. My principal object to-night is to expose one of the vilest and most terrible occurrences that has ever come within my knowledge. I was approached by a man in my own district, and I said that I would go with him to inquire, not as a medical man, but as a member of Parliament; and that attitude I maintained right through. I took a magistrate with me to verify what might be said; and hore is the statemen t of the wretched m a n as to his t r e at m e n t 58 Walsh-street, West Melbourne. Dr W. Maloney, Federal Parliament House, Dear Sir, I beg to complain that I am a patient in the Base Hospital, St. .Kilda-road, invalided by the Medical Board in Egypt, with paralysis, caused by a kick in the spine from the doctor's horse in Egypt. For the sisters and hospital treatment generally I have the highest feeling of gratitude and praise. Such medical officers as Dr Fred Bird, Dr Springthorpe, and others of like repute, tried every means of getting me to use my legs; all to no avail until the latter end of my time in Egypt, so I was invalided home. This Dr Mead, at the Base Hospital, from my very first acquaintance with him, told me that I was a iniilin<»erer, a schemer, and impostor, a crawler, and all that is base and indecent, though he has never advanced any motives for me being in the state I am in. His arrogant manner wns overbearing and cruel in the extreme. T fought my way, sir, in Africa, with the Naval Brigade through Belmont, Enslign, Moddcr Eiver, Magersfontein, siege of K i m berley, and the storming of Pekin. in China, and I resented this doctor's imputation. No complaint or entreaty will induce him to give me mimane treatment. His antagonism was unbearable, and one morning I respectfully told him so; he there and then determined to have me court-martialled for being a schemer; bnt, in the face of the medical testimony of the medical gentlemen whom I have mentioned, I waa found by the court martial not guilty. I was discharged without a stain on my character ; but my health in the same wretched state. Where can I go or what can I do for succour? His attitude towards me was worse than ever. He became livid in the face and white with passion, and came to me denouncing the gentlemen of the court martial as a set of blockheads. I would be better dead, sir, than have to submit to this kind of treatment, so I decided to apply to get out of it to go to my home. My request was refused, so I got a friend with a motor car to get me out in the middle of the night. I expect to be punished for this, but he will heap no more insults on my body u n t i l I get better. When we landed from Egypt we were allowed to bring ashore £10 worth of Egyptian goods. Many men had tlicm stolen at the hospital, mine included. When I complained to Dr Mead he only laughed. Ho said he wanted to hear no complaints or comments, or we would find ourselves in the cells. In a most flagrant manner our clothing is being sold by some one for small sums to men from Broad in endows. Now. dear sir, I am not seeking to be vindictive, but I was induced by the doctor attending me now to write to you. Hoping that you will see that I get a square deal without any unnecessary fuss. I can substantiate all T have said to""the hilt. Dr ftfttloney. poor, I am no stranger here in union and political circles. The reasons I advance for complaining are humane, not political nor influence-seeking. I remain, sir, 27th May, 1915. Yours respectfully and sincerely, WALTEB PESKY. Melbourne. I think that the officer in charge of the c o u r t m a r t i a l was a splendid m a n - Mr . Cox T a y l o r . I w a n t justice for this poor f e l l o w - I w a n t the promise k e p t that w h e n a m a n r e turn e d in j u r e d he shall be pai d 6s. per day, as has not been done in t h is case. A g a in , as a member of P a r l i a ment and not as a medical m a n , I w r o t e to Senator Pearce as f o l l o w s : My Dear Sir, lie enclosed letter from Walter Perry, of 58 Walsh-street, West Melbourne. The matter has been brought to my notice hy my constituents. He has made a statement before n magistrate. Two doctors state that there is no malingering. As a representative for Melbourne I have seen Dr Mead, who was very courteous, and explained his position. The case is a serious one, and I strongly urge you to appoint an honorary committee of laymen (neither surgeon nor physician), one of whom should be a magistrate, and the committee's duty should be to visit the hospital at any time and investigate any complaint. The danger of hospitals being under the sole control of medical men is widely known. Kindly order that no arrest be made of this poor injured man for leaving hospital without leave, for, if he be arrested, I greatly fear trouble from the public and the union, and serious results for him. I m a y say that I think that Dr M e a d honestly believes that this m a n is m a l in g e r in g , for he applie d e l e c t r i c it y, and had him watched. I in t i m at e d that if t h is poor f e l l o w were arrested, I should hold p u b l i c meetings of protest in M e l bourne. I may here t e l l honourable m e m bers w h y I believe in the n at i o n a l i z at i on of h e a l t h . I remember that when I was at St. M a r y ' s H o s p it a l , L o n d o n , one of my chiefs d e f in it e l y stated that cancer had been p l a n t e d in the breasts of t w e n t y innocent women in Germany to see if the disease w o u ld develop; and , f u r the r , that in a large hospital in V i e n n a one of the sexual diseases, k n o w n as the red plague, h a d been planted in innocent men so that students could see the symptoms. That sort of t h in g could not possibly happen in E n g l and , because committees of laymen c o n t r o l the hospitals; but the re are no l a v m e n in control in B e r l in and V i e n n a , only a r m y surgeons with the i r discioline. The answer I got to m y l e t t er was the stereotvped one to w h i c h we are all too used. It will be noted that m y l e t t e r was dated 14th June, and the reply, the 20th July following, time having heen occupied in making inquiriesWith reference to your letter of the 14th ult., forwarding enclosure from Mr Walter Perry, of 58 Walsh-street, West .Melbourne, a returned invalided member of the Australian Imperial Force relative to his treatment at the Uase Hospital, Melbourne, I am directed to inform you that the matter has been carefully investigated, and the report received on the matter does not disclose any maltreatment of Perry by the medical oflicer in charge of that hospital'. In regard to your suggestion concerning the formation of an honorary committee of laymen to visit the hospital and investigate complaints, I. am to add that the Minister has considered the matter, and regrets that he cannot see his way to adopt the suggestion. Later on, I wished to know why this man had not received the 6s. per day to which he is entitled: and God knows that 42s. a week is not too much for a man who is confined to his bed and has to receive particular attention- a man who cannot contain his urine, and thus shows what is well known as one of the symptoms of spinal trouble. I wrote on the 27th Julylie Mr Walter Perry, of 58 Walsh-street, who is an invalid confined to his bed, may I ask you what payments are made on his account to his wife? An carlv answer will oblige. He your letter 40500 A.I.F. 201/1/327, I am considering its contents before seeing the Minister. A f t e r twelve days-althoug h I know that the officials of the Department are working overtime, while there are numbers of people out of work-tli e answer I got wasWith reference to your letter of the 28th nit., relative to the payments being made' to the wife of Mr Walter Perry, of 58 Walohstreet. West Melbourne, I desire to inform you that they arc as follows:4s. per diem allotment inoney. Is. fl^d. separation allowance per diem. This lady called on me today, and if ever my heart bled for another human being it did then. And no wonder I got angry when I learnt that she had not had one penny piece since 30th July. I should like to make these heads of the Departments live on such terms. Who is at the head of the medical branch at the present time ? A man whose whole experience has been in the diseases of women. Are we to open a women's hospital at the front? T have no desire to hold up the finger against the ability of our medical officers. I believe they are splendid in regard to women's diseases, but the fact is that they have under them men far more versed in the surgery that is required on the battle-field. Let examination for entrance to the A r m y Medical Corps be on the lines of the British service. I ask honourable members to peruse these documents in Hansard. I wish to add my meed of praise to the Herald in regard to that infamous case of which I spoke on Friday last, and which was nearly as bad as that to which I have just drawn attention. A man with three shrapnel wounds who was brought to the hospital from Gallipoli and operated on without chloroform-withou t chloroform in these days!-whe n asked to undergo a further operation, under the nervous strain produced by his previous treatment, refused. He was right in his refusal. I admire him for not having obeyed this order of the surgeons to be operated on again without chloroform, but owing to his refusal he is not receiving his 6s. a day. I hope that the W a r Committee will be given more power. I hope that they will consider these papers that I have read to-night. I hope honourable members will realise that the two facts which I have narrated determined me to work towards the nationalization of medicine and surgery, so far as my brain could think, my lips speak, or my hand write, but I little dreamt that in Australia a man would be court martialled because one medical man, untrammelled by any committee of laymen, considered him to be malingering. I readily believe that the doctor thought so, but where he failed was in not securing the opinion of other surgeons. One of the greatest surgeons we have in Melbourne-Dr O'Hara-ha s offered his services in an honorary capacity, and his suite of rooms for the benefit of the Defence Department, but they did not choose to accept either. Why they were not accepted I do not know.",41
312,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Why should a man malinger in a base hospital ?,43
313,Dr MALONEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"G o d only knows. As the spinal cord is an elongation of the brain, honourable members can readily understand what a terrible tiling is an in jury to the spine. Two doctors of standing have definitely stated that this man is not malingering. The magistrate said that no one could look at the man and say that he was malingering. The court martial has said the same. I leave the matter to honourable members. I think they will agree that I have been justified in bringing this terrible case before the Committee.",43
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Parramatta) [9.10] - For the last hour I have listened to statements from the other side which, had they been made on this side, would have laid the Opposition open to charges of party feeling and party display.",44
315,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No .,44
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes , the honourable member has n^t been in the chamber, else he would have heard his own confreres trouncing honourable members of the Opposition for attempting to make party capital out of these matters. Nothing has been said on this side half so strong as that which has come from the benches opposite. I ask honourable members to be a little fair , and not to assume the attitude that everything in the way of criticism of the Defence Department from their side is said from high patriotic motives, and that everything mentioned on this side is necessarily the reverse. In these matters we shoulu give each other credit for the best intentions. criticism began to-night on the other side of the chamber I have received a letter from one of my constituents detailing the treatment that his son is meeting with even now in the Liverpool Gamp. I have not made that letter public; I have given it to the Prime Minister to have it investigated ; but there are shoals of these letters coming alone, and I think that it is a little ""over the odds"" when we get tirades of abuse such as came from the honourable member for Maribyrnong tonight the moment we mention anything in the Chamber. No honourable member offers so many complaints as does the honourable member.",44
317,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,When have )'Ou heard me making any complaints?,44
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member should be the last to chide any honourable member of the Opposition, and accuse his opponents of attempting to make political capital out of these matters. I know of no such attempt having been made by the Opposition at any time. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that he had come to the conclusion that the charges made by the honourable member for Nepean emanated from political motives.",44
319,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I did not say that.,44
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answer to the honourable member is that everything that the honourable member for Nepean said, and a great deal more, has been proved to be true.",44
321,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I said that I knew the charges would be proved.,44
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We need to try to remedy these things, becausB they are affecting recruiting.",44
323,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The very fact that the big recruiting campaign in Victoria took place after those charges were made disproves that statement.,44
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We should remove these abuses. They art* abuses, and they are removable. The complaint I have received to-night is not that tliere is no food in the Liverpool Oamp, but that, despite the report of Mr Justice Rich, no officer has been detailed to see that the food is properly distributed. There is a sheer lack of organization. It does not matter what food is provided; it might just as well not be there if the men cannot get it . These matters should be investigated as f u l ly as it is possible to Since the investigate them, and honourable members on both sides of the Chamber ought to give each other credit for being actuated by the best intentions when they mention these things, with a view to their rectification. I hope that no honourable member will ever attempt to make political capital out of them. The Minister must not be blamed unduly. He must bo held to account, of course; otherwise there would be no rectification and. no remedy. Every allowance must be made for the fact that Ministers cannot be everywhere, though I candidly believe that with three. Ministers controlling this Department-the Minister of Defence, the Minister for the Navy, and the Assistant Minister. Senator Gardiner-and seeing that the Navy is away from Australia, Ministers ought to bft able to see to these matters themo selves.",44
325,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does not the rieht honourable gentleman think that the Government should be given every credit for the manner in which they acted after the Liverpool trouble was mentioned ?,44
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I regret to say that the instructions given as the result of Mr Justice Rich's report are not being carried out as Senator Pearce imagines. Mr LAIR D SMITH ! - The Government acted immediately the complaint was made.,44
327,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Senato r Pearce may issue his instructions; he may detail the things that are to he done; but his responsibility does not end there. Senator Pearce's full responsibility only ends when he has sent somebody after the in structions to see that they are carried out.,45
328,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A body of civilians will be required to do that. I thought it was to be the work of the War Committee.,45
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I cannot help the feeling that with three Ministers at the Defence Department, one might pay a few more visits than are now being paid to many of these camps. I have never criticised any of the arrangements made by the Defence Department without trying to suggest a remedy, and what I suggest now is that somebody should visit these camps in order to see that what is recommended is carried out. Otherwise it would be better if no recommendations were made. I do not want to take up any more time on this subject, and I would not have risen to-night but for the fact that almost every honourable member who has spoken on the Gover nment side has preluded what he himself has had to complain of by some reference to the unpatriotic attitude of honourable members on this side whenever they have lodged a complaint. So long as a friendly attitude is adopted honourable members on both sides ought to be able to bring the matters that come under their notice before the Minister, nnd nothing but good should follow. I do not think I ever heard of a more shocking case than that referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne. I hope sincerely that there are some mitigating circumstances, for the case, spcins to be an alarming one; but what I want to impress upon honourable members is that it is time they gave honourable members who sit on the Opposition side a little credit for other than ulterior motives when they try to help along matters that have arisen in connection with the war.

330,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Ballarat) [9.20] In connection with the prohibition issued by the Government of Victoria against the importation of live stock into Victoria, I desire to bring uncler the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs what is actually happening in the Adelaide market. I have with me a quotation from the Adelaide Weekly Review of 25th August, which, after pointing out that on that date the supply of cattle was considerably better than expectations, states that 204 head were imported from Queenslaud, 210 from New South Wales, sixteen from Victoria, and eighty-six from Western Australia. At the Adelaide sales on that day, prime beef realized from 67s. to 72s. 6d. per 100 lbs. According to the Stoch and Land Journal of 25th August, the prices on that date in Victoria for prime beef were from 90s. to 95s. per 100 lbs. I believe this difference in price is wholly accounted for by the fact that South Australia has freely admitted live stock from Western Australia and Queensland to its markets. Victoria is suffering keenly as the result of the high price of beef. Stock cannot be admitted from either Western Australia or from Queensland, with the result that the market is depleted and prices are high. On 23rd August cattle from Western Australia and Queensland were sold in Adelaide alongside cattle from South Australia, all in the open ring, not in pens, as is the custom in Victoria, and after that sale twentysix head of cattle were landed in Ballarat, seventy-two head were landed in Geelong, aud over 100 head were landed in Melbourne. It will be generally recognised that if cattle from Western Australia or from Queensland are allowed to mix with South Australian cattle, the probability is that most, if not all, of them will be classed as South Australian, and will be able to gain access to Victoria. It is well known that South Australia is the cleanest State in the Commonwealth as regards tick.",45
331,Mr RODGERS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,South Australia is not cleaner than Victoria.,45
332,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In South Australia there are no regulations against the importation of cattle, and I think the explanation of the South Australian i m munity from tick is that, as soon as the cattle enter a cooler climate, the tick dies.",45
333,Mr FLEMING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There is a great deal of doubt about that.,45
334,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have discussed the question with drovers, and they are of the opinion that the tick cannot live in a cold climate, and I believe that to be the case. At any rate, my statement cattle from the other States are being sold in the open market at Adelaide be disputed. I do not think, also, that tliere can be any doubt that some of them are being sent to Victoria, yet we are not hearing of the presence of any tickinfested cattle in Victoria. In the last session of Parliament I urged the desirability of the Government taking over the full control of inspection of all the produce passing between one State and another. The constitutional question - was then raised, and it was argued that that could not be done until the referenda proposals were carried. But otlier constitutional authorities differ from the Minister of Trade and Customs in this matter, and declare that the Commonwealth Government have power to do this. If the Minister wishes to benefit the consumers of meat in Victoria, he will seriously investigate this question. satisfied that we have not the power to deal with the matter, he should make representations to the Victorian ment, with the object of inducing to repeal the State regulation which the introduction of cattle Queensland and Western Australia is prohibited. Western Australia today has no refrigerating works of any size, and it is sending chilled meat to Victoria, it is being sold at £3 per 100 lbs., while the local meat is bringing £5 per 100 lbs. Honourable members will recognise what a difference there would be in the price if live stock could be brought here. Taking the weight of a bullock as 800 lbs., the market tions I have given show a difference of £8 10s. per beast in favour of South Australia as against the price paid in Victoria. According to the supplement to Elder's Weekly Review, the reduced price in South Australia present time is due to the influx of live bullocks from Western Australia aud Queensland. The point that I wish to emphasize is that the graziers of Victoria are not being protected by this prohibition against the importation nf live stock from other States, and that the Minister, if he finds that we have not the power to deal with the matter, make serious representations to the Victorian State Government to take decisive action in regard to it.

If the right honourable gentleman intends to conclude his remarks by a definite motion to reduce the item by £ 1, I find by a close consideration of the authorities, our own and also those of the House of Commons, that such a motion will not be in order. Our own reStanding Orders being silent on'this subject, we are referred by standing order t honNo. 1 to the practice of the House of Commons, and I find in May, l l t h ediso; tion, page 595, that no motion or amendment can be moved to reduce or omit any in an Appropriation Bill . In fact, authorities go so far as to say that it is out of order to even discuss an item in the schedule of an Appropriation Bill .",47

349,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In the opinion of the Chair we are dealing with an appropriation of moneys for administrative purposes. I have to treat the measure as an Appropriation Bill , and it is so referred to in May, who saysNo grant of supply is effected by the Bill; its provisions are solely administrative; the I sole object of the Bill is to insure tlic application of the grants made by Parliament to the defined by the resolutions of the Comof Supply.

356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall move, sir, that your ruling be dissented from , but before doing so may I suggest that a mistake has been made. You, sir, have quoted from May the proceedings on an Appropriatio n Bill , which always f o l lows a detailed examination of the Estimates in Committee. We have never previously had this schedule before us for examination. This is the first opportunity Ave have had of considering it at all ; therefore I think that the passage in May which you have quoted does not apply to the Bill we are now discussing. It is true that certain limitations are placed upon an' Appropriatio n Bill in the House of Commons. There it cannot be introduced u n t il the Committee has examined every line of the schedule. Then the report is adopted, and an Appropriation Bill founded upon the approved schedule is introduced. That is not the position of this schedule, and it cannot rightly be ruled that a schedule which has never been considered at all, cannot be amended in any particular. I submit, sir, that you should f all back upon our own practice, and not bind us by the the first practice of the House of Commons, which follows a procedure totally different from our own in connection with money Bills. How can we control the finances of the country if we are not permitted to consider the schedule?",48

358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish to deal with an item which is contained in this schedule, and the Chairman has ruled that the schedule cannot be amended.

361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not desire to submit a motion of dissent from your ruling. But do I understand that that ruling is that no item in this schedule may be amended ?,48
362,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,My ruling is that it is not competent for the honourable member to move an amendment in favour of the reduction of any item by £1.,48
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Then may I move the omission of the word "" Contingencies"" from the schedule?",48
364,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Before you, sir, rule on that point I should like to say",48
365,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Order ! The honourable member for Parramatta is in possession of the Chair.,48
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"New South Wales) [9-48] - I am very much amazed that the honourable member for Capricornia, with all his knowledge and experience of parliamentary practice, should endeavour to prevent the Committee from having anything to say upon this schedule. I move That the word "" Contingencies,"" subdivision 2, be left out.",48
367,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What does the honourable member propose to do in reference to his threatened motion Of dissent? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not intend to proceed with it . I submit"" the motion with the most friendly intent, and with a view to intimating to the Government, the desire of the Committee that the farmer should be relieved fro m taxation on his raw material.",49
368,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member will have his ingenuity taxed.now. rise to a point of order. I submit that the honourable member is now endeavouring to evade your ruling. Y o u , sir, have already ruled him oub of order in attempting to move the reduction of an item by £ 1 in order that the farmers may be relieved of certain taxation. He now proposes the omission of the word "" Contingencies"" with the same object in view. Had he contented himself with merely submitting the motion without assigning reasons for it , he might have been in order. That is what I in tended toconvey when I said that he would find his ingenuity taxed.",49
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"May I you, sir, that you allowed the previous speaker to discuss the whole question of stock-producing in Australia. The honourable member for Ballarat clamoured for relief for the people of ""Victoria by removing the embargo upon the introduction of stock. He discussed the question of ticks",49
370,Mr BURCHELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Did the honourable member object to his action ?,49
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Certainl y not; now the administration of the Minister is in question. I submit that anything relating to the Department of Trade and Customs may be discussed under a proposal to vote - money for that Department.,49
372,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member knows different from that. He knows that notice has been given to amend the Tariff in reference to the very item that he desires to have wiped out.,49
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Where is notice ? I contend that I am as much in order in asking for relief for the farmers in this formthis way as the honourable member for Ballarat was in order in seeking relief for in another way. Of coure, if honourable members opposite wish to block the concies sideration of this matter, all right. That stops me. [230 ]",49
374,Mr FOWLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"May I be allowed to point out that the Leader of the Opposition proposes to discuss what is really an administrative act of the Government. The Tariff to which the honourable member for Capricornia has alluded is only an administrative act, and is in no sense before the Committee. If you, sir, search the business paper you will find that that is so. I take it , therefore, that the Leader of the Opposition is strictly in order. 1 Mr WATKINS - Then his proposal is not intended to help the farmers ?",49
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Oh , yes, it is.",49
376,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Leader of the Opposition now seeks to amend the schedule by omitting one word. The authority from which I have previously quoted lays it downNor can amendments be moved to its clauses, ov to the schedule, to effect the omission or reduction of the amount of a grant. I am not in a position, at this stage, to know whether the honourable member's proposal would effect the omission or reduction of a grant. I may, however, say, in anticipation, that any general debate upon the Tariff, or upon any portion remind of it , will be out of order. But I cannot say, at this stage, that the honourable member's proposal is out of order. I cannot intervene until his position has been developed in debate.",49
377,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I beg, sir, to dissent from your ruling. The honourable member for Parramatta hag stated distinctly that he proposes to leave out the item "" Contingencies,"" with a view to informing M i nisters that it is the desire of the Opposibut tion to relievo the farmers of certain burdens.",49
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is quite right.,49
379,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I cannot allow that to go any further. I understand that it is your decision that the .honourable member is quite in order in submitting his amendment. If that be your decision, I beg respectfully to dissent from it .",49

382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Hear , hear; that is the idea.",50
383,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I point out to the honourable member for Capricornia, and also to the Committee, that the notice of dissent as submitted to me is not quite accurate. I gave no ruling on an amendment proposing the striking out of the item "" Contingencies."" What I gave my ruling upon was an amendment submitted by the honourable member for Parramatta to strike out the word "" Contingencies,"" and not the proposed vote of £1,600 for contingencies. If the amendment submitted to the Chair had embraced the striking out of the item in cluding the word "" Contingencies,"" and the figures of the proposed vote, I should have ruled it out of order at once. the honourable member for Parramatta has moved to strike out only the word "" Contingencies,"" it is impossible for me to say whether its effect would involve the omission or reduction of the grant. In the circumstances.' I ruled that the amendment was in order. In fairness to the Chair honourable members should first decide that question.",50
384,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If you, sir, think that I have been in any way unfair to you, I will withdraw my notice of dissent.",50
385,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not say that the honourable member has been unfair, but that his notice of dissent does not accurately state my ruling.",50
386,Mr HICGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I withdraw my dissent if your ruling was not as I have stated it.',50
387,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I understand that the amendment has been put. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I propose to speak to it unless the Prime Minister in tends to stop me. He can do so if he likes.,50
388,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have no such intention. We hear the honourable gentleman so seldom.,50
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Prime Minister need not say that he has no i ntention to stop me, because for half-anhour now honourable members have tried to prevent me saying anything on this matter.",50
390,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite right, too, cause the honourable gentleman is out of order, and he knows it . Mr JOSE PH COOK - "" Quite right, too,"" says the honourable member for Maribyrnong.",50
391,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We can take another course. Mr JOSE PH COOK - We need not trouble about another course. This is good enough for my purpose. I want to say why I think the Minister of Trade and Customs should grant some relief to the primary industries of this country, that have passed tlirough a severe drought afflicting Australia from end to end.",50
392,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What is the nature of the relief the-honourable gentleman proposes?,50
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Will my honourable friend mind waiting a little. He will have plenty of time in which to take his point of order later on. In the meantime, if permitted, I shall confine myself As for a few minutes to showing that the primary producers of Australia have been in a bad way lately, that they are in a bad way today, and need all the sympathy and relief this House can place at their disposal by any means within its power. We have passed tlirough a drought unprecedented in intensity and severity, notwithstanding the fact that the Prime Minister has called it a little one. It unfortunately has been a very terrible one, so far as Australia is concerned, and far greater than the drought of 1902. I have compiled some figures which lead mo to the conclusion that the people concerned in our primary industries have been h it terribly hard.",50
394,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And only a few days ago the honourable gentleman was suggesting the taxation of kerosene and tea!,50
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Here is another of those statements for which there is not a tittle of foundation. I only wish that the people outside, to whom my honourable friends opposite, will go shortly to make them believe that they are their friends, could see them grinning here, and their attitude generally when we ask for a little relief for them.",50

401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is time those engaged in the primary industries were made sensible of the callous attitude of honourable members on the other side when we come to consider their interests.,51
402,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Order ! I must appeal to the Committee to assist the Chair. The House did me the honour to place me i u this position, and I am called upon to conduct the proceedings in accordance with the Standing Orders, bu t the continuous interjections make it almost impossible for me to hear what is being said. I was about to ask the honourable member for Parramatta how he proposed to connect his remarks with the administration of the Department of Trade and Customs.",51
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister of Trade and Customs, who deals with questions relating to stock, with the export and import of grain, and the administration of commerce generally, is the gentleman to whom I must look for relief from some of these pressing burdens. What are those burdens, and what is the condition of the psople for whom I am pleading ? The loss in sheep alone last year owing to the drought amounted to £35,000,000. That, lieve, is an under-estimate. The loss cattle I am under the mark in stating to be another £10,000,000.",51
404,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,B o w can the honourable member connect those remarks with the amendment?,51
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The amendment refers to contingencies in the Trade and Customs Department, contingencies are connected with the administration of the Department, and it is the administration of the Department that I am speaking about now. I am asking for administrative relief for the farmers, and pointing out why they need it . The loss in wheat last year was £20,000,000 sterling. There must also be added the [230]- 2 losses suffered by dairy farmers and others.",51
406,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"On a point of order, how can the Minister of Trade and Customs by any form of administration rehelieve the people on the land from the losses referred to?",51
407,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is a question, not a point of order.",51
408,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Order ! I have sin- made several appeals to honourable members to assist the Chair. I shall appeal no more. If honourable members persist in interjecting, I shall name them, and let the Committee deal with them.",51
409,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,My point of order is that the Leader of the Opposition is w i lf u l l y disobeying your directions,51
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"On a point of order, I demand that the words "" wilf u l ly disobeying "" be withdrawn.",51
411,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,If the honourable member has said anything objectionable I ask him to withdraw it .,51
412,Mr MCGRATH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Leader of the Opposition is attempting to convey the impression that the Minister of Trade and Customs is responsible for the losses of sheep and cattle caused by the drought.,51
413,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I did not understand the right honourable member for Parramatta to argue in that way.,51
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am told I am well witliin the mark in putting down the loss in the primary industries for one year at over £85,000,000.",51
415,Mr CHARLTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I rise to order,51
416,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Order ! No one in this Chamber is better acquainted with parliamentary procedure than the righ t honourable member for Parramatta, and I behe must see that the responsibility for in the loss of wheat or stock cannot be placed at the door of the Trade and Customs Department. The Minister of that Department deals with imports and exports, but neither he nor his officers are called upon to administer the internal production of the country. An y remarks on that subject will be distinctly out of order, and I ask the honourable member not to pursue it.",51
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I propose to deal with the imports and exports, bu t it seems that I am not to be permitted to develop my case. If so, I shall have to try some other way of doing it . There are plenty of other ways, and I warn honourable members opposite that they are ' only wasting the time of the Government.  with the whole Tariff when we come to it.",51
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The member keeps interjecting about the Tariff, but I am not talking Tariff at I am talking of the load of taxation the farmer has to bear, and that makes his lot so much harder. . The returns for the land tax last year clearly showed severity of the drought.",52
419,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Order ! The honourable member's remarks are certainly not in order.,52
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Do you rule that we are not to discuss taxation on taxing Bill?,52
421,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have no desire to enter into a controversy with the orable member, but the debate must be confined to the subject before the The Committee can deal only with matters referred to it by the House, and the lionorable member's remarks are distinctly foreign to the question before Committee. He must confine himself this stage to matters which come w it the scope of the administration of the Minister of Trade and Customs or of officers.",52
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A m I not in my best to adhere to the agreement. order in asking the Minister to use his administrative powers to give relief farmers ?,52
423,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member did not do so.,52
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is prebeen cisely what I am establishing a case but you will not let me get the facts out.,52
425,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,If the honourable member will state his case I shall see how far he may elaborate it afterwards.,52
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am showing first that the farmer stands more in need of relief than any other section of the community because of the terrible drought which has raged. He, of others, has been made to suffer almost yond the possibility of conception.",52
427,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We cannot under these Estimates.,52
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,May I make this appeal to the honourable member? I made an arrangement with his leader and his whip that this amendment should taken at this very place to-night.,52

441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Well , I am the going to mention everything. I consulted at the Chairman himself about this very h in matter and the course of procedure, and now it seems it is all wrong. It is not his wrong, and if the Chairman rules me out of order now, I shall sit down, because I can do no more. But I will have done I submit that I am putting a reasonable case to the before the Committee. Honourable members before me have discussed the whole question of stock and its passage through and out of Australia. This subject has discussed time and again in this for, Cliamber, and by the very men who, after taking this means of ventilating their grievances with regard to Customs administration, are now trying to stop me from referring to the matter in any way. I was referring to the severity of the drought and the way the farmer has been hit over it . Our wheat production last all year was less by 78,000,000 bushels, bewhich, at 5s. per bushel, represents a loss to the farmers of Australia of about relieve him £20,000,000 sterling.",52
442,Mr HAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We shall have a record season this year.,52
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In addition to the failure of the harvest last year, the be little crop of wheat that the farmers did have in another State was seized by a benevolent Government at 5s. per bushel, whereas if a market devoid of wheat had been opened to them the farmers would have received 7s. or 8s. per bushel for their product.",52
444,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I rise to a point of order, which I base upon standing order 274No member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion; nor anticipate the discussion of any other subject which appears on the notice-paper. I contend that the Tariff Bill appears under the heading "" Ways and Means "" on the notice-paper, and, therefore, the honourable member for Parramatta is out of order.",53
445,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As far as I am aware, the Tariff does not appear on the notice-paper - Mr RICHARD FOSTER --And the wheat.",53
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Perhaps it will relieve honourable members opposite if I resume my seat at this stage, for it seems to mo that I am most unwelcome to them. I ask you, therefore, Mr . Chanter, if you can suggest when I may discuss these matters more appropriately than at this stage.",53
447,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the right honourable member will take a suggestion from me, I would say that he could discuss these matters by moving a definite motion in the House.",53
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A definite motion ?,53

Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - I would be obliged, Mr Chairman, if you could protect me from this constant fire of interjections fro m honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Maribyrnong frightens me with his look; he looks more like a wolf than a man. My purpose now is to make a suggestion to the Government, if they will regard it as a friendly one. I do want some relief for these suffering, overburdened farmers. If , by asking for that relief, I am raising a sinister party question, and indulging in a flank movement on the Government, then I will plead guilty to it ; but that is really all I desire.",53
456,Mr CHARLTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What relief do you want?,53
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I want the Minister to do something administratively with regard to the duty on wheat bags, as he did with regard to the fodder duties.",53
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I want him to suspend the duties until better times come, and until we may consider this matter in connection with the Tariff. I am asking him to take administrative action, as he has done with regard to other matters; but Ministers will not listen even to the figures. These producers are suffering perhaps as they never suffered before in the history of Australia, and I urge the Minister to take administrative action to give tEem relief.",53
459,Mr JENSEN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will you get the merchants who cornered the bags to unload a bit?,53
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If merchants have cornered the bags, and are inflicting a hardship upon the farmers, all I can say is that the Minister is criminally neglecting his duty if he does not stop them. If the Government know that these things are being cornered, they have subter- the power to stop the cornering; and if the Minister is not moving in that direction he is neglecting his duty to the farmers of Australia. That is all that I have to say to him.  let Parliament get the power to act.",53

Why are they so frightened? I will sit down, as my arguments seem most distasteful to them. As they decline to hear the facts, I will content myself with moving this amendment as a friendly instruction to the Government by the Committee to grant some relief in this way by an administrative act pending the rectification of the Tariff at an appropriate time in the future.",53
462,Mr RILEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"""What about the T a r if f now?",54
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is no Tariff in the matter at all. When an impost is put on a manufacturer in the city he can relieve himself of it ; he can add the impost to the price, and so pass it on, but the man I am pleading for cannot do any such thing. The manufacturer in the city may set his machine going and gauge to mathematical accuracy the return from the machine down to the fraction of a farthing .",54

Never in the history of Parliament have I known such a determined attempt to nrevent any reference to the burden of the men in the interior as I have seen on this occasion. I did not expect it, s h a k in g frankly. I thought that we would have plain sailing. I made a definite arrangement the other night that we should consider this matter, and consider it here and now.

529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The reason we know that the House is in favour of the proposal is that so many honourable members on the other side have expressed themselves in favour of it . That is my final answer to the Prime Minister's statement that this is brought forward as a party issue. Does he think that his own followers would act in collusion with us for party purposes? In making such a statement or suggestion he is reflecting on his own party, as well as on the party over here. There never was a touch or tincture of party feeling in the matter, and such was never intended. I tell the right honourable gentleman frankly for that if I thought I could dispossess the Government with a vote of the kind, I would not give it for such a purpose. I say more. If the right honourable gentleman regards a friendly motion of this kind, supported by members on both sides, as a direction to quit office, he has a total misconception of what his duty to the country is. I do not wish to dispossess the right honourable gentleman-no body over here does. We are not such fools as to imagine that we could dispossess him. We know that we cannot do so, and we are not trying to. We are asking the Government, in this time of unprecedented severity, to perform an admi uistrative act, entirely within their competence, which will afford some relief to the long-suffering farmers of Australia, who have been so sorely h it by the drought. I ""repeat that behind this request is the majority of the House.

He understands-everybod y understands-wha t my position is at the present time. It is known how limited are the hours! during which I have each day to deal with all classes of people, and watch everything, more or less. I did not think at the time that this was the question that was to be dealt with, but that it was some other question that was regarded as of importance to some of the right honourable gentleman's followers.

537,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Swan) [10.53]. - I do not know why so much heat has been imported into this discussion, especially on the part of the Prime Minister, because I can assure him that, so far as I am concerned, there is no ulterior object or motive. The Minister of Trade and Customs knows that every honourable member who represents a farming constituency throughout Australia, has sent him petitions on this question. Personally, I have forwarded a good many, but, instead of being told at once that the request could not be complied with , the various people and societies interested all over the continent were informed that the matter would receive consideration.",58
538,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,When the Tariff is considered.,58
539,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In consequence of that reply, we took no action until we were informed by the Minister that he did not intend to make any alteration. That was a great disappointment to all of us under the circumstances of difficulty in which the farming in dustry found itself. In letters to my constituency I expressed the opinion that the Government would accede to the request, but when that anticipation was not realized we took steps to get a vote in order to see whether we could not induce the Government to take the desired action. I had good reason for thinking that there is a majority in the House in our in - favour, because there are so many honourable members on both sides who represent farming constituencies, and I thought that the Government would meet the wishes of that majority. It was never even suggested that our action would be know you taken as a vote of want of confidence. I do not wish to hamper the Government, but honourable members in Opposition have responsibilities to those who send them here. In . my constituency an immense number of people are engaged in cultivating the soil and in raising wool, and without exception they are in favour of this relief being given. In 'these circumstances, does the right honourable gentleman blame me for trying to get fro m the Government the relief which they seek- a relief with which I am altogether in accord ?",58
540,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Hav e you ever known such a step to be taken on a Supply Bill?,58
541,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Time s out of number there have been amendments to reduce items with the object of in timating to the Government the wishes of honourable members. There was an in stance of this in connection with the Defence estimates in the early days of the Commonwealth Parliament. It is quite a common thing for amendments to be moved with the object of getting the Government to give relief that is asked for by honourable members, and they are never considered as hostile votes. As for the statement of the right honourable gentleman that honourable members have been canvassed in regard to this matter, I may say that though there is no one more interested in the matter politically than I am, because my constituency is largely made up of farmers, and though I am desirous of getting some measure of relief, I have not asked one honourable member how he intended to vote. The fact is that the whole of the Opposition' and several members on the Ministerial side are in favour of bags and sacks of all sorts being on the free list. I wrote to my constituents and told them that I thought the relief would be given, and afterwards, when the Government said that they would do nothing, I wrote to say that we would have a vote taken on the matter in order to let the Government know the strength of those who were in favour of the granting of this relief. There was no secret about the matter; I have written dozens of letters to that effect. I have not, however, asked anyhonorable member on this side or on that side how he proposed to give his vote.",58
542,Mr BURNS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then how does the right honourable gentleman know what is the feeling of honourable members?,59
543,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"They have told me. I have not canvassed any honourable member in regard to this matter, and I have not heard of any one else having done so. I regret that honourable members on this side should be charged with attempting to put a "" dagger"" into the Government. I plead not guilty to that charge. I have done nothing in that direction. I merely wish to show my constituents that we have endeavoured to do our best. I have received letters saying that we have done nothing, and have .replied that we have done what we could, but that we could not bombard the Government until we knew what they were going to do. Seeing that the Government have announced that they intend to do nothing in the matter, we are now taking the legitimate course of getting the feeling of honourable members by moving this amendment. We doing our best, even if we are not successful, and why we should be charged with doing things that are discreditable from a political point of view I do not know. I cannot understand why the Government do not accede to the very strong request coming from all country districts. J cannot understand why they should give relief in the matter of fodder and refuse it in regard to bags and sacks. The attitude of the Government is inexplicable in these times of dire distress. In Western Australia the State Government has had to find half a million pounds in order to buy seed wheat and keep the farmers on the land. Why should the Government seek to place new burdens on these people? It is no wonder that the farmers proclaim that the present major it y in the Federal Parliament has no sympathy with them, when in their time of difficulty, and, in many cases, almost bankruptcy, the Federal Government chose to place new burdens on them. The outburst from the Prime Minister is outrageous. His charge against the Opposition of attempting to put a dagger into the Government was unjustifiable, as well as offensive. That is not the object of honourable members of the Opposition. Their desire is to put those who so strongly favour this relief in a proper light before the country, and to show the people that they have done their best to induce the Government to reduce this burden at an unprecedented time, when the farming community are unable to bear the burdens they already have, let alone these additional imposts.",59

Again, we have been told by honourable members opposite that country newspapers are being penalized to a terrible extent by the duty on paper.

I can guarantee that no honourable member knows how my vote will be recorded. I have never at any time during this session been in favour of postponing the consideration of the Tariff, and I have said so, time and again; but on numerous occasions I have heard from honourable members opposite-and particularly from the Leader of the Opposition-the desire expressed that they should have nothing to do with the Tariff in any shape or - form.",60
567,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Le t me inform the honourable member that that is not so.  honourable member's words are in black and white in Hansard.,61
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"They are, but they are not as the honourable member represents them. What I have always said was that there are two or three items upon which both sides could agree  quote the right honourable gentleman. In Hansard, page 4738, he saysMy own opinion is that the Tariff schedule should wait u n t i l after the war is over",61
569,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Quite r i g h t ; I so now.  because it may then be necessary to readjust the Tariff in order to meet a set of circumstances of which we now have no knowledge at all. I do not know that anything could be clearer.,61
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I say that now.  right honourable member's speech covers several pages, but the quotation I have made is sufficiently definite. never subscribed to such a view. I , and the majority of my party, I believe, have always taken the view that the consideration of the Tariff should not be postponed, and but for the objections of the Opposition we should have dealt with it , and with the particular item now under consideration, not in the underhand manner now proposed by the Opposition, but in a proper way. I do not desire a six weeks' adjournment; I am prepared to remain here and proceed with the consideration of the Tariff, and then we could deal with this item in the proper way. If honourable members opposite had been serious about this matter, it would have been unnecessary for them to come along to-night with their mock heroics and "" h if a l u t in , "" which I regard as merely an attempt on their part to play to the gallery - to the farmers of Australia. So far as the Opposition are concerned, ,it is a case of protesting too much, and the farmers - have long since dropped to them. I have not pledged myself as to how I shall vote on the question of the duty on jute goods. There is a ring operating in connection with everything that the farmer uses, and even if we were to remit this duty of 10 per cent, tomorrow we have no guarantee that the difference would go into the pockets of the farmers. On the contrary, I believe that it would go into the pockets of those who are accustomed to far m the farmers, and they are the people for whom the Opposition have on every occasion a word to say. The Opposition said nothing when the Victorian Liberal Government-the last of the Liberal Administrations in Australia - appointe d a Price of Foods Board, which fixed the price of wheat at 4s. 9d. a bushel, and so entailed a loss of 3s. per bushel on the farmers of this State. The appointment of the Board was a mere b it of window dressing for elecsay tioneering purposes. As soon as the election was over the Board was abolished. Meantime, however, farmers had sold their wheat to the speculators at the price fixed by the Board, and after the abolition of that Board they had to buy it back again for seed purposes at an advance of about 3s. per bushel. But we did not hear a word of protest from any member of the Opposition, with the exception of the honourable member for Wannon. Where were the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable I have member for Swan when the farmers of this State were subjected to this loss. The duty of 10 per cent, on jute goods amounts to less than £d. per bushel, and the Opposition make a loud outcry about it, but with the exception I have named they had not a word to say as to the action of the Liberal Government of Victoria, which meant a loss of 3s. per bushel, and in some cases more, to the farmers. Everything that the farmers use today is controlled by a ring, a trust, or a combine, and when we ask for power to deal with these combines the Opposition do not show any disposition to help us. - I wish to put it clearly and unmistakably that I am one of those who have always desired that the consideration of the Tariff should not be delayed, and but for the objection of the Opposition we could have dealt with this matter in a proper way to meet the wishes of the - farmers. I am not going to be snared by the underhand tactics of the Opposition.",61
571,Mr RODGERS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wannon) [11.20] The Leader of the Opposition has given good reasons for his request that this relief should be granted to the farmers of Australia. The item ,in question has no parallel in the other items to which honourable members opposite, and particularly the Minister of Trade and Customs, have referred. The Leader of t'he Opposition said lie was able to trace from the drought a direct loss of £85,000,000 to those for whom he is seeking this relief, and the honourable member for Indi has advanced another good reason for our request by his reference to the action of a State Government in fixing the price of wheat. I wish to put on record the fact that the relief in respect of jute for which the Leader of the Opposition asks on behalf of the farmers of Australia will mean to the wheat growers, on the estimated crop, £172,600; to the wool-growers, a £ 3 0 , 0 9 2; to the oat growers, on the estimated crop, £22,200; to the maize growers, £9,375; to the barley growers, £6,666; and to the potato growers, no less than £22,500, or, taking a reasonable estimate of the forthcoming crops, a total of £263,000. This does not take into accoimt the relief to the sugar-growers and users of bags in connection with all other root crops. I think I can convince even the Minister of Trade and Customs that I have not made an excessive estimate.",62

In addition to these facts we cannot forget that, as admitted by the Attorney-General, the Commonwealth and State Governments will make a united levy of at least three-quarters of the wheat freight charters' commission. That levy will amount to £350,000, so that there will be, in respect of these two items alone, a gross deduction of over £600,000 from the earnings of the farmers. The price of wheat was fixed in New South Wales at 5s. per bushel when it cost 12s. or 13s. per bushel to grow it. The position was much the same in Victoria during the last harvest; it cost £ 1 per bushel to grow wheat on a yield of 1.38 bushels. For these and other good reasons I support the amendment. Like the Leader of the Opposition and other members of our party who have spoken, I am unable to understand the attitude taken up by the Prime M in ister. As showing fchafc there has been no concerted action on the part of the Opposition to take advantage of the Government, I would point out that our party waited on the Minis^ ter of Trade and Customs, accompanied by the honourable member for Ballarat. That honourable member brought with him an explanation from the Opposition members that they were, not able to attend, thus clearly showing that there was no design to embarrass the Government, but merely a wish to secure a deserved consaving of cession in the direction indicated.",62
574,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Capricornia) [11.25] As honourable members on the Opposition side seem desirous of carrying on the debate u n t i l we lose our trains. I see no reason why I should not make a few remarks. Any one who knows the right honourable member for Parramatta and the right honourable member for Swan must realise what brilliant actors they would have heen had they gone upon the stage.,62
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It seems that anything can he said about members on this,62
576,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am surprised at the Leader of the Opposition taking exception to a tender remark like that, when he has accused an honourable member on this side of being fit for examination by a lunacy commission.",63
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"You know that was a joke, and I apologized for it.",63
578,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What is the use of insulting an honourable member and then apologizing afterwards? I cannot believe that honourable members opposite are in earnest in this matter, and I think the Prime Minister truly characterized them as assassins. They have one arm round the neck of their friends-the Government-and the other contains a stiletto, ready to be inserted below the Government's sixth rib. They have observed tli.at the political wind is commencing to blow towards the Ministerial benches, and they are beginning to emit poisonous gases for the |mrpose of asphyxiating the Government. Those honourable gentlemen are the modern political Huns.",63
579,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Order ! honorablo member is discussing something outside the scope of the question.,63
580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member's remark was not an insult, was it?",63
581,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I meant the expression in a Pickwickian sense. I do not wish to insult the honourable member. The members of the Opposition are doing their duty as good politicians representing the so-called Liberals of this country. They desire to prepare the way for unseating the Government.,63
582,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I say there is not an atom of truth in that statement.,63
583,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The right honourable gentleman has made that statement so often that he will excuse me if I do believe it. Ever since this Parliament opened there has been criticism uttered with the intention of discrediting. the Government. What are the Government doing in regard to the making of munitions? Nothing! What are they doing in Defence matters? Nothing! And all the while honourable members say that in bringing forward these matters they are not in any way actuated by party motives. They could have taken these complaints to the Minister of Defence in his office, but they wanted to bring forward in the House.",63
584,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have already said that nothing has been brought forward in the House which has not been first placed before the Minister of Defence.,63
585,Mr HIGGS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"All the time honourable members are attacking the Government, while plead ing for the suspension of party warfare and the establishment of a Coalition Government. I may refer the Leader of the Opposition to a little quotation with which he is no doubt familiar, ancl which he often uses on pleasant Sunday afternoons, "" Can the leopard change his snots, or the Ethiopian his skin?"" The Opposition, I submit, cannot change their skin or their spots. They are bent on trying to discredit the Government. They claim to be taking this action tonight for the purnose of assisting the farmers, but the honourable member for Indi has pointed out that the proposed relief will amount to less than | d . per bushel. The price of bags does not enter into the question of the price the farmer is to get The for his wheat. Sometimes those rteonle who farm the farmers give them 2s. 6d. a bushel, and at other times 5s. But the price of bags does not enter into the farmers' calculation. It enters into the calculations of the big speculators. The estimate given by the honourable member for Wannon to-night was something stupendous. The honourable member told us that £2,000,000 worth of bags is to be ii;-ported to deal with the farmers' products. One would tliink there was not a bag in the whole of Australia. There is no escaping the fact that the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Swan, and those other honourable members who have torn a passion to 1.niters to-night, are actuated by political motives. They think their action not will tiamaire the Government, and they are honeful of getting a division. The right honourable member for Swan stated that somebody had told him casually that a majority of the members of the House WPI in favour of removing the duty on jute goods. How would the honourable gentleman know there was a majority unless canvassing had taken place? Of course, he would not canvass; he has reached an age and a position when canvassing on his part would be quite undignified. Therefore, some honourable memthem ber of the Opposition would be deputed to find out what members thought on this question. However, as I understand honourable members are prepared to take a division on the question, I will resume my seat. - Mr SAMPSON (Wimmera"") [11.33-1. - I regret very much that heat should have been generated i u this discussion. A f t e r the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition to-night as to the agreement arrived at with the Prime Minister, and the subsequent explanation made by the honourable member for Richmond, the action which the Opposition have taken cannot beai a narty complexion. The reason why I regret that a v<-te is not heing taken on this question, apart altogether from party considerations, is that this proposed duty of 10 per cent, on cornsacks is a tax on exports. It has already been explained that the duty will mean a tax of not less than £200,000, and it has no protective incidence at all. This impost does not suit the Protectionist party, nor does it suit the farmers to have a tax placed on their raw material. It cannot be the intention of the Government or the Minister of Customs to place a direct tax on the exportation of not less than 25,000,000 bags of wheat, which is the estimated surplus to be available for^export. The retention of this duty will impose a direct tax on the export of wheat from Australia, a trade which should be encouraged in every possible way, especially in view of the disastrous drought which has been experienced during the past year. I regret that the Government have not risen to an appreciation of the i m portance of our primary productions by voluntarily agreeing to forego the duty.",63
586,Mr GREGORY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Dampier) [11.36]. - In view of the promise of the Government to consider this matter in response to the enormous number of petitions in reference to it which has been received from all parts of the country, I regret that no action has been taken in that direction.

587,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Eden Monaro) [11.42] - To-night , in reply to a question which I put to him, the Postmaster-General stated that it was not a fact that he had threatened to close some of the small allowance offices in New South Wales because the persons in. charge of them are not prepared to accept the salary offered by the Department. I wish to read some correspondence with a view to showing that my question was based upon facts. Here is a letter which I received from the Department, dated 27th August18 With reference to your communication of the 30th ult., forwarding one from Mr John Jones, Langley, Kybean, requesting that the further period of seven years for which it is necessary that the residents maintain the JfimmitabelKybean telephone line be reduced to three years, I have ""to intimate that the matter has received consideration, but it is regretted that no reduction can be made in the prescribed period. I may add that it is advisable for the residents concerned to intimate whether the conditions specified in my letter of the 12th Idem attached are acceptable to them, as otherwise the question of dismantling the line will need to bo considered. Yours faithfully, Here is a threat to dismantle the lineto pull the wires off the poles. Another communication addressed to me under date 13th August, readsI have to intimate that, prior to the 1st June hist, the postmaster at Coolangatta (Mv. A. X. Cummings) was in receipt of an allowance at the rate of £ 17 10s. per annum. The allowance justified on the figures for 1014 is £12 per annum, but the postmaster is unwilling to carry out the duties for this amount. In view of this decision, nnd as no other suitable applicant is at present available, it will be necessary to proceed to close the office unless vi satisfactory nomination is made for the position of postmaster at the regulation rate of payment mentioned within two months from this date. I may state that remuneration at allowance oflices is regulated according to a scale which provides for payment on the business transacted and attendances outside ordinary hours of duty, accommodation and light provided, &c. It will be seen from the particulars on the attached form how the amount payable in the case of Coolangatta office is made up. Yours faithfully, 'Deputy Postmaster-General. This man has been receiving £ 1 7 for many years, and the Postmaster-General is now going to cut him down to £ 1 2 . He has to look after postal articles, to pay pensions, to look after the telephone office, to attend to the mails daily, to sell postal-notes, and to do generally the 'work of a post-office. The Postmaster General told me emphatically today that my statement was incorrect.",64
588,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,T did not; I said I was not aware of what the honourable gentleman stated.,65
589,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"All I can say is that the honourable gentleman ought to have been aware of it . conduct of the Post and Telegraph Department at the present time has become a public scandal. I know that in saying this I shall not be accused of attempting to make political capital out of the business. We had a report upon the management of the Department by a Commission of members of this House, and recently we have had a report from Mr . Anderson, who made a special inquiry into the working of the Department. He has recommended the appointment of a general manager. What is the answer of the Postmaster-General to that? He proposes to put in charge of the Department the officers who have been responsible for this mismanagement. He E. J. YOUNG, D.P.M.G. tells me that he is not going to do anything of the kind. But does the honourable gentleman know what appears in the He.ra.ld to-night and in the Argus of this morning? What has he to say to that? Does he know that three of the principal officers of the Department, who with others are responsible for the mismanagement and trouble, are now being appointed by him, or in his name, to inquire into their own mismanagement? Does the honourable gentleman know that, or is he a political know-nothing ? It is all very well for him to grin in that inane way; but I say that a responsible Minister should know what is being done in his Department. He proposes to meet the trouble by charging an extra penny on toll calls. Has he inquired whether I d . per call will give him more revenue? I reduced the charge for telephone calls from 3d. to I d . when I was Postmaster-General against all the official' advice, because I was quite satisfied that the E. J. YOUNG, I d . rate would give us more revenue than we derived from the 3d. rate. It did do so, and in some cases three or four times as much. Under the honourable gentleman's proposal the convenience will be restricted, and the revenue will be diminished; but perhaps he has not in quired into that. Does he propose to shut the offices in my district to which I have referred, or to pull the wires off the posts? If he does not. why does he permit these responsible officers to send me communications like those I have read, and then have the effrontery to say that I have not spoken the truth ?",65
590,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I did not say so.,65
591,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is the honourable gentleman going to have the The wires pulled off the posts?,65
592,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I expect so.,65
593,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What has the Prime Minister to say to that? Did any one ever see such an exhibition by a responsible Minister of the Crown? I appeal to the Prime Minister, to look into this Department, and to prevent people in isolated districts who are de- oarred from enjoying many of the advantages of civilization, from being treated in this way. A cut rate must be accepted for the carrying on of the service, or the wires will be pulled off the posts which were put up by the people themselves. I ask the Prime Minister to inquire into the matter, and not to permit of the farce of the men at the head of the Department, and responsible for its mismanagement, being appointed to inquire into their own work. Who is to do their work while they are making the inquiry ? The newspapers tell us thau the Cabinet will have a say in the matter, because the Postmaster-General is to report every three months to the Prime Minister, who has enough work of his own to do without having to shepherd the little details of the Post and Telegraph Department. In my district at least sixty small offices have been put on starvation rates, and if those in charge did not accept them, I suppose the wires would have been pulled off the posts. The work of the Post and Telegraph Department should have a civilizing influence in the opening up of the country, and to retard or interfere with that must be injurious to the country. I know that the Prime Minister, because of the terrible war, is a busy and overworked man, and I do not care to harass Ministers at this time; but I ask the right honourable gentleman not to permit us to run into a further mess with the Post and Telegraph Department. If the proposal to have the Department conducted by the three men who have been suggested is carried out, it will be practically shut up. Reading the report of Mr Anderson on the Post and Telegraph Department is like reading an account of a comic opera. We find that men sitting in the same room have been writing minutes to each other.",65
594,Mr BAMFORD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What happened in honourable gentleman's time? They did the same thing then.,66
595,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"They did not. If they did that kind of thing in my time. I ought to have been kicked out. It is well known that I would not stand that sort of thing. During the time. I was Po&tmaster-General no report upon the Department such as that presented by Mr . Anderson was ever published. I did not try to carry on the Department by raising rates, or reducing small salaries. I have a record in connection with my management of the Department which the honourable member for Herbert would be proud to have. I , no doubt, resisted his cajoleries, and that may be rankling in his mind even yet. I do not say that what I complain of is the f a u l t of the Postmaster-General, but it is the f a u l t of the system. I appeal to the Prime Minister to look into the matter, because there is a danger of this Department breaking down. I do not say anything against the Postmaster General personally. I kuow that his in tentions are good, but I know, also, that the way to a very warm place I have heard of, and to which people who criticise me very often go, is said to be paved with good intentions. I appeal to the Prime Minister not to let public officers ruin a great Department, the reputation of the Postmaster-General, and of the Government, for whom I have very great consideration. I want the matters about which I have complained rectified, and if the Postmaster-General attempts to pull down the wires in my district, or close any small offices, I will make him regret it. . Mr SPENCE ' (Darling-Postmaster General) [11.53] - In connection with one of the two cases referred to by the honourable gentleman, it is possible that there is a legitimate reason for the threat to remove the wires. In the other case, of the reduction of the allowance, the whole of the fuss which the honourable gentleman has raised is due to the fact that the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales, in carrying out the rules, has notified the person who had charge of the office referred to that the business done there does not warrant a continuance of the former allowance. The allowances are fixed according to a scale.",66
596,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Whic h every one of the honourable gentleman's predecessors refused to follow. the Mr SPENCE - That is not so. In this case a man is informed that his allowance is cut down from £ 1 7 to £ 1 2 , because the business of the office has diminished. He is notified that if he is not prepared to carry on the office at the reduced allowance, which is in accordance with the scale, some other person will have to be secured to carry it on. What is there wrong about that?",66
597,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He is not told anything of the k in d ; he is told that the office will be shut up.,66
598,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That may be so, if some one else cannot be found who will carry on the work at the reduced allowance. There is nothing new about this. The Deputy Postmaster-General has only carried out a general rule. If he is to pay any regard to the scale, why should one man have preference over the other ?",67
599,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How much are you going to save on the lot?,67
600,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is not done for the sake of saving. An unfair attack was made, and wild statements were indulged in before this evening about there being a cut down, and sweeping reductions being made. As a matter of fact, there is an increased payment for the Commonwealth for the year just ended of over £11,000 to allowance offices as compared with the year before.  number of offices.",67
601,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How does the honourable member know?,67
602,Mr BODGERS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have had some created myself. ' Mr SPENCE - The lionorable member must take the whole Commonwealth. The correct figures show a percentage of increase of expenditure in every State. I said before that I could not state positively whether the scale of allowances was exactly fair or not, and that I intended to make inquiries. I had a test applied at Elmore-a n .official office, and not a very 'large one, but a fair one to take. The whole business of the office for the last year was taken, and it was calculated what it would amount to on the basis adopted for allowance oflices. The result came to £516 l is . 4d. The exact cost to the Department was £344, so that there wa£ a difference of £172. That is a very fair comparison. The instructions given everywhere are that an allowance office is not to be given to anybody who has no other business. In some cases there is very keen competitionto get the work. If a man is dissatisfied because he has a big business to attend to, ancl cloes not want to bother about the postal work-as sometimes happens-tlier e are always others eager to get it, because it frequently brings trade. In some cases they make double what the allowance is wortli by the increased trade. Occasionally, when a widow or other poor person takes the work without other occupation, it becomes a very hard case, because, in a small office, the allowance is not enough by itself to provide a living. Members sometimes appeal for an allowance office to be given to a widow or some other deserving person, and when it is given they say the Department is sweating the in, and that it does not pay them a living wage. I have beeu unable to obtain verification of the statements made here on this subject previously. The departmental officers cannot find any verification for the statements about certain offices having been reduced. They were not reduced last year, at any rate. In regard to the case brought forward, it must be remembered that the deputies have some discretionary powers, ancl I did not think we should let the place go without an office.",67
603,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Corangamite) [11.59] - Has the Postmaster-General given his officers instructions to see about a re-arrangement of the mails in Victoria owing to the reductions in the train service ?,67
604,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is not a matter for rearrangement. Mr Bright is doing his best.,67
605,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Judgin g by that answer, the Postmaster-General does not think it is a very serious matter as regards the mail contracts in Victoria. I asked him previously if he would have the matter inquired into and see that the people who were accustomed to a daily mail for years still got it.",67
606,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I made no promise that they would get it.,67
607,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Evidently the Postmaster-General does not think it worthwhile to trouble about them.,67
608,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I said I would try to do it, and I have tried to see if it is possible. I made no promise to give them a daily mail. I do not control the trainsat any rate, uot yet.",67
609,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"All I asked the Postmaster-General was to see, through his officers, that the people got a daily mail wherever possible; and that where goods trains were running on certain lines, they should be availed of. There will be three or four goods trains running on the Gheringhap-Marco-na railway. Will he see that this red-tapeism is broken down so that the people may get a daily mail? They have been accustomed to a daily mail for twenty-five years past, and the Department has rieen to a great deal of trouble to arrange a mai l service; so that in those cases I ""want those responsible to see whether it is possible to continue the daily mail, especially where the coach contracts have been broken or cut olf at different points, so that they do not reach the people. Is it not possible to enter into some arrangement with the Railway Commissioners ?",67
610,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Y o u want a re-adjustmeut, wherever possible, owing to the alteration of the trains and services?",68
611,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Yes .,68
612,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Unde r the contract, we cannot put our mails on a goods train.",68
613,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the Minister see if something can be done? The position seems absurd.,68
614,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Railway Commissioners do not allow the mails to go on goods trains.,68
615,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Will the Postmaster-General send his officers to see the Railway Commissioners, and ascertain if it is not possible for these people who have three goods trains a day going past their doors, and perhaps no passenger train on that particular day, to get their mails? Surely the Postal Department and the Railway Commissioners can come together.",68
616,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is being done, but it cannot be done in a day. If it can be done, we shall certainly try to arrange it .",68
617,Mr MANIFOLD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"L as t Thursday or Friday I told the Postmaster-General that these people did not expect the thing to be done in a day; but on Thursday their mail is going to be cub off. The matter is very important to them. Is it not possible for the Postal Department to arrange with the Railway Commissioners for what I suggest to be done as quickly as possible, because the new timetable comes in on the 1st September?",68
618,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Franklin) [12.4 a.m.] - I move That the word "" Contingencies"" Staff) be left out. I do so as a protest against the cutting down of the allowance offices throughout Australia. It is one of the most disgracef u l things ever done by any here. These people were getting from £12 to £ 1 7 10s. a year. The DepartMinister ment applied to every one of the Postmay master-General's predecessors to do this thing, and not one of them would do i whether Liberal or Labour, since the ginning of Federation.",68
619,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is not true.,68
620,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is quite correct. The Department has tried to get the allowances cut down, and every Postmaster-General up to the present one has refused to do it . The proposal is that where the business decreases in certain post-offices the allowance shall be cut down. The officer-in-charge has to attend to a number of duties. He has' to attend to the telephone, pay the old-age pensions, and take charge of the country post-office Savings Banks. The savings the Minister is proposing to effect will not amount to £1,000 in the whole of the postal service of Australia. Ifc is a very serious thing for these people who are getting merely a pittance, to have that cut down, and it is a serious matter, also, for the people to have the post-offices closed. This mail servioe is the one thing in which Federation can help the people out in the back-blocks of Australia. Since Mr Sidney Smith's time the country districts have never received the attention they deserved, and now it appears that, in order to save a few paltry pounds, the services are to be curtailed. Honourable members who . go into these country districts know that frequently they have to use all the personal influence they possess to gefc people to take charge of these offices. I guarantee that there is not one member of this House representing a country district who has not been called upon to urge people, almost as a favour, to take charge of these offices for the few paltry pounds they receive. I do not intend, at this late hour, to speak much longer, bu t I want to voice my prr test against this miserable saving, and I hope the Postmaster-General will give a promise that the order will be rescinded.",68
621,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There has been no order.,68
622,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes , there has, for we had the instruction read to the (Central Committee to-night.",68

Owing to the failure of a harvest, the train service has been cut down from one to three trains a week, but on alternate days there are goods trains running, and it is simply intolerable, to my mind, that in these circumstances the Railway Commissioners. should refuse to carry a mail on the goods train on the alternate days.",69
635,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I quite agree with you.  The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is to be congratulated for having brought this matter before the Committee. I know that a great number of these people in charge of allowance offices give not only their time, but are really tied to the work, and, at the same time, they have to find premises for the very meagre pittance they receive from the Postal Department.. It will be grossly unfair now to cut down those services, and I am glad that we have the assurance of the Prime Minister that he will look into the matter.",69
636,Mr RODGERS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Le t him give an under- ' taking.  Postmaster-General, in view of what has been said, would have indicated that there would be no increase in the telephone rates in country districts.",69
637,Mr RILEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is another question.  floor of this House mentioned that the telephone and telegraphic services' paid in the country districts, and bhat the loss occurred in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne.",69
638,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is a profit in Melbourne, make no mistake a'bout that ",69
639,Mr CHARLTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is a loss in Melbourne.  Minister that the increases in charges ought to be where the loss is occurring.' Why should the country people have to pay for the loss? There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. I have received t w o ' or three communications from New South Wales asking me to urge the Postmaster-General not to increase the postage on newspapers. The people in the country say, "" P u t what increases you like on catalogues and business advertisements, but do not increase the rates on country newspapers.""",69
