To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. that ratification of UN. Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles; 2. that the Convention's philosophy of parenti child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children; 3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation; 4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent; 5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers; 6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.

We are deeply concerned at the spread of moral pollution resulting from the freedom of access to this material. Therefore we ask that Members give earnest consideration to the damage which the proliferation of this material is causing in our society as evidenced by the continuing increase in sex-related crime through-out our land.

The democratic aspirations of the people of the Republic of Croatia are being infringed as the central government moves to encroach upon the sovereign authority of the government of Croatia. 2. The central Socialist government of Yugoslavia will take advantage of the distraction of the Gulf War to use force to restore totalitarian communism upon the people of Croatia. 3. The safety of Australian citizens travelling in Croatia will become more and difficult to protect as the central government moves to crush the democratic government of Croatia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will take action to try and influence a democratic and peaceful solution to the political crisis in Yugoslavia and to ensure the safety and well being of Australian citizens travelling within Croatia. by Mr Filing (from 599 citizens).

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.  Yugoslavia Nursing Homes To the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.

Import Duty To tht; Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House, that the recession and foreign debt results from federal Government action to reduce exports and increase imports, commencing in December 1972 with the revaluation upwards of the Australian dollar and the reduction downwards of duties on imported goods and continuing to the present day with poor export incentives and with the Australian dollar now being overvalued by extremely high interest rates being set. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: 1) make Australia a Free Trading Nation during the 1990 Budget Session, by abolishing Sales Tax, Fuel Tax, Income Tax and varying rates of import duty and instead having one flat rate of duty on all imports as needed for revenue, commencing at 140%, and reducing to about 70% as Government expenditure is cut with the abolishing of superfluous Government Departments and Sections such as the Australian Taxation Office, Austrade, and the C.E.S. Job Centres (as full employment is restored) and 2) the Customs Office and Armed Forces be strengthened to deter smugglers and as an additional benefit, to reduce illegal drug entries and illegal immigration. by Dr Hewson (from 26 citizens). Catholic Schools To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the electors of the Division of THROSBY, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the inadequate Government Capital Funding presently available to the Catholic Schools. The Catholic community is concerned about the serious needs of Catholic Schools for fair Government assistance with Capital projects. The Catholic community is doing more than its share. The needs of schools for Capital Funds will continue to grow under the impact of Curriculum changes and increased retention rates. The Wollongong Diocese has the added pressure from new residential areas being opened up on the coast, on the tablelands and in the THROSBY region. We, Your petitioners pray that the House will support our just request for a fair increase in Government Funding. And Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Hollis (from 174 citizens).

Your petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should: . . . request the Australian Government to establish a Wealth Inquiry as a first and essential step to the achievement of a more just society; and that this Inquiry should seek to establish- the current distribution of wealth, how it has changed over time and the causes of these changes - the effectiveness of the Australian taxation system in raising revenue at all levels of taxpayers' income and assets - the measures which should be taken to achieve a more just society by Mr Barry Jones (from 248 citizens). Motor Vehicles We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, wish to draw to the attention of the House our feelings on the matter of Older Vehicles. We feel it most unjust to impose a tax on ten year old or older motor vehicles. Furthermore we are most violently opposed to the proposal to refuse registration of motor vehicles of twenty years or older. As Veteran, Vintage, Classic Motoring Enthusiasts we feel that this proposal would destroy Australia's Motoring Heritage. A lot of people also drive older vehicles for various reasons. We, the undersigned therefore request the House to oppose the proposal to impose a tax on ten year old motor vehicles and the refusal to register twenty years or older motor vehicles. by Mr Lavarch (from 320 citizens). Pensioners' Savings To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: ' The humble petition of the undersigned pensioners respectfully showeth: That your petitioners request that with reference to the budget and any money over $2000 held by pensioners in a savings or cheque account being deemed to be earning 10% interest. As council rates, Insurance and other charges come to approximately $1600 for pensioners this financial year, it does not leave much money for repairs and upkeep to your dwelling. This problem would apply to most pensioners in the Caboolture Shire and Australia so we request that the Federal Government cancel the sum of $2000 and replace it with a sum of $5000 as we consider $2000 is not an adequate amount before the deeming particularly in relation to married couples. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray that your House/Parliament will see that our requested reform isimple.mented. by Mr Lavarch (from 105 citizens). Australian War Memorial To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that: 1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the proposal that an admission charge be made for entry into the Australian War Memorial. We believe that it was erected as a memorial to those who served their country and paid the supreme sacrifice and that the material on display in the galleries is as sacred and as much of a memorial nature as the building itself. We seek your assistance in having this decision rescinded. 2. We urge you to direct the Australian War Memorial Council to reverse this decision. Your petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to disallow the regulations as tabled in Parliament empowering the Australian War Memorial Council to charge an admission fee to any section of the Memorial. by Mr MACKellar (from 471 citizens) Australian War Memorial To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the ACT. draws to the attention of the House. 1. We, undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the proposal that an admission charge be made for entry into the Memorial. We believe that it was erected as a memorial to the dead and that the material onÂ· display is as much of a memorial nature as the building itself. We urge you to rescind the decision. 2. We urge you to request the AWM Council to reverse their decision. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to urge the Australian War Memorial Council to reconsider its decision to charge an entrance. by Mr MACKellar (from 209 citizens). Middle East To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the undersigned Lord of Knights and Grand Master of the Sovereign World Order of the White Cross, a Humanitarian Knighthood for the defence and protection of life, Dr Paul Baron Neuman of Kara Bagh, the counsellors and officers of the Order, the Commanders and Members, supporters and supporting citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: The undersigned have the utmost concern about the safety and well-being of the citizens and the entire nation of the Commonwealth of Australia due to the sudden engagement of Naval Forces in a conflict of war in the Gulf region of the Middle East authorised by the Prime Minister of Australia, the Honourable Robert Hawke, M.P. The undersigned hold and firmly believe that the Honourable Prime Minister has acted without sufficient responsibility towards the well-being of all Australia including, not only the human population but the entire living environment, by committing Australia, Australian naval vessels and Australian military personnel to participate in a state of war, thus exposing the inhabitants and indeed the entire Continent of Australia to the risk and possible consequences of war damage, including death and destruction on any level and magnitude. We hold that a nation, for whatever reason it may choose to enter into a state of war with another nation or with an alliance of other nations, the government of such nations shall offer minimum protection for her population including safe-guarding health and food supply. It is known to all nations that the warring powers in this conflict are in possession of biological, chemical and even nuclear weapons and that the availability of said weaponry opens the probability that such could be used and said conflict may proliferate and may be of a more State of prolonged nature than anticipated. We note that Australia has hardly any amount of antidotes for protection against biological weapons such as the fatal and highly contagious pestilence etc. etc. now in all forms and variations available in shells which could be used by either side. We hold furthermore that even though Australia as a Continent is at a far distance from the vicinity of the Gulf conflict, terrorist actions have been foreshadowed to take place in all parts of this world. We face a similar situation nation of chemical warfare devices which would leave the Australian public also totally without protection since gas masks are scarcely available in Australia. It is safe to mention that little portunities are given to the public for seeking the protection of air-raid shelters, which are also non-existent with perhaps a few underground parking spaces here and there. A similar situation arises in the area of food for any prolonged state of isolation, which could be part and parcel in a conflict in the magnitude of a world war. We further believe that though the Hon. Prime Minister may have well intended to demonstrate a gesture of goodwill and loyalty towards the United States of America and the State of Israel, surely we should also consider with great concern such intentions and indeed implementation of actions which put Australia and her citizens into an unnecessary and unpredictable state of risk. By this our humble petition respectfully showeth: We the Lord of Knights, Officers and Members of this Order are committed to peace and the protection of life and we hold that it is therefore our duty to express and pursue our aims and our quest in the service of humanity which includes the service towards Australia and her people, even though such action may be regarded unpopular in times such as this at present and we trust that the petition is received by the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the spirit it is meant to be. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that: The Parliament will recall all military vessels and military personnel from the war zone and declare internationally that Australia is returned to the status of neutrality. And your petitions as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr MACKellar (from 12 citizens). Prescriptions: Pensioners To the Honourable Members in the House of Representatives assembled. Your humble petitioners respectfully showeth that to introduce a charge for pensioners prescriptions would cause great hardship in particular to those people on more than one medication and also to those with chronic illnesses. We strongly urge that no charge on pensioners prescriptions be introduced. And in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 3,143 citizens). Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Â¥embers of the House of Representatives assembled in Parin the case of deto- liament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that the construction of a third runway at Sydney op- (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will cause great harm to the environment and the economy of Sydney Your petitioners therefore request the House to oppose the third runway and to urge the Government to proceed instead with the development of an airport at Badgery's Creek. by Mr Mack (from 311 citizens). Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport To the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.

Otway Forest, Victoria To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows that the Otway Rainforests are being exploited inappropriately. We pray that the export woodchip licence supplied for Midway Wood Products be rescinded immediately and the Otway Rainforests be managed in the best interests of the people of Australia. by Mr MCArthur (from 52 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: The proposed Convention on the Rights of the Child could affect every Australian family. The implications could mean that: 1. Once ratified by our Government it becomes an International Treaty and overrides our internallaw. 2. Bureaucracy could decide what is best for the family. 3. Parental influence on their children under 18 years of age could be undermined. 4. The recognition of the rights and duties of parents could be denied. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled urge the Government to: 1. Delay ratification until the ambiguous articles and the implication of the Convention are addressed by the community and politicians and not merely rubber stamped in the name of international diplomacy, and 2. submit reservations to the Convention with specific reference to the rights and responsibilities of the parents. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MCArthur (from 23 citizens). Medicare Office: Newcastle, NSW To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the division of Newcastle draws to the attention of the House 1) The great disadvantage suffered by the residents of Western Newcastle suburbs such as Wallsend, Maryland and Jesmond without a local Medicare office and 2) The serious disadvantage imposed on the elderly citizens of Newcastle by the closure of the Market Street, Newcastle Medicare Office.

Pacific Highway To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the increasing carnage on the Pacific Highway. Your petitioners therefore ask the Federal Parliament to accept that the Pacific Highway must be made into a four-lane, dual carriageway divided highway from Hexham to the Queensland border and that the Federal Government provide vastly increased funding to bring this conversion to reality. by Mr Nehl (from 58 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria, draws to the attention of the House, our objections concerning the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House takes into consideration the rights of the parentis before passing a bill on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We specifically object to Articles 12-15, as these leave no room for parental rights or responsibilities. by Mr Reith (from 29 citizens). Commercial Television Networks in Queensland To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the division of Maranoa, draws to the attention of the HouseThat we strongly object to the limited commercial television viewing available on satellite TV since aggregation. Prior to aggregation regions serviced by satellite television, broadcast through Queensland's biggest regional TV station, QTV, were receiving approximately 60% of top rating Channel 9 programs and a number of popular 7 and 10 network programs. Viewing in remote areas is now restricted to one commercial network. Your petitioners therefore request the House to take the necessary steps to give remote communities in Queensland access to all commercial networks, especially in view of the expense incurred in installing satellite dishes. by Mr Bruce Scott (from 3,676 citizens). ABC: Education Programs Petition to The Honourable The Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the following citizens of Australia draws to the attention of The House the decision of the ABC Board, in response to budget restrictions, to end Education Radio programs in 1990 and Education TV programs by 1992. The petitioners believe that this will reduce learning opportunities and experiences, especially in more isolated locations and in communities with very limited finances, thus widening the gap between richer schools and poorer schools. The education of the children of Australia is more important than general entertainment! Funds for new and continuing ABC Education programs must be made available and any financially necessary cuts to programming must be made elsewhere. Your petitioners therefore ask that The House direct The Prime Minister and his Government to ensure that the ABC continue to produce new series for ABC Education Radio and Education TV programs for Schools Broadcasts and to broadcast these and existing programs on radio and TV during school hours . And your petitioners as in duty bound ever pray. by Mr Snow (from 33 citizens).

Your petitioners humbly request the House to: - oppose the military build-up and preparation for war in the Persian Gulf which will jeopardise thousands of military and civilian lives; - decline to participate both directly and indirectly in war as a solution to the Persian Gulf dispute by immediately withdrawing Australian navy ships from the region; - use the negotiation skills of Australian ers and economic sanctions to help bring about a peaceful resolution putes in the Middle East. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Snowdon (360 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the proposed ratification of the United Nations Convention on the rights of the Child gives our nation a unique opportunity to: - declare our belief that all children have the right to be protected from abuse and exploitation, and to enjoy the opportunity for full development of the human personality, - affirm the fundamental importance of the family in our society, - recognise the unique rights and responsibilities of the parent/child relationship. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House express the view, on behalf of the citizens who interests it represents, that the ratification of the Convention be in a form which emphasises these rights and principles, and which pays the highest regard to the importance of the family unit in Australian society and to the rights and responsibilities of parents. by Mrs Sullivan (from 31 citizens). Medicare Benefits To the Honourable Members assembled in Parliament:The petition of certain residents of Western Sydney draws the attention of the Parliament to the proposed legislation which may prevent Xray services being available at medical centres. Your petitioners therefore request the Parliament to, allow qualifying medical centres to continue to attract Medicare benefits for X-rays performed at those centres, so that this worthwhile service to the community will be able to continue. by Dr Bob Woods (from 392 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the Tabulam Baptist Independent Church, Residents of the state of New South Wales. draws to the attention of the house that lead- there has not been nearly enough open, public discussion on the United Nations Treaty on the to territorial disRights of the Child. This legislation is of too great a significance, both now and for future Australians, to be so quickly decided upon. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Houses should release more details, and promote more public discussion before any legislation is passed. by Mr Harry Woods (from 13 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objectives to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce those Regulations have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homeopaths and Herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Enquiry into the questions of registration of the natural healing professions and the supervision and regulation of natural therapeutic goods. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will forever pray. by Dr Bob Woods (from 13 citizens). Petitions received. NA",12
3,The Clerk,RESPONSES TO PETITIONS,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Price of Petrol Mrs CA Gallus MP Member for Hawker 967 South Road MELROSE PARK SA 5039 Dear Mrs Gallus I refer to your petition of 8 November 1990 on behalf of a number of petitioners concerned about petrol prices and the level of excise on fuel. While I share your petitioners' concerns about the increase in petroleum prices which have occurred as a result of the gulf crisis, Australia presently has the second lowest level of taxes on petrol of any of the OECD countries and the third lowest retail prices. In mid October when Australian consumers were paying around 89 cents per litre for petrol, our trading partners in Japan were paying $1.27, the UK $1.29, France $1.50, and Italy $1.80/Iitre. Contrary to claims in some quarters that Australia is a high' taxing country, total petroleum taxation on crude oil and petrol as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product has declined since the early 1980s under the previous Liberal Government to its lowest proportion in a decade. I addressed these issues in Federal Parliament on 17 October 1990 and I am enclosing an extract from my speech for your information. Finally, I must emphasise the importance which will the Australian Government places on maintaining a high level of petroleum self sufficiency. Allowing Australian oil prices to move in line with international oil prices helps to maintain Australia's attractiveness for exploration and development, with the ensuing increased potential for the discovery of more oil. In addition to substantially reducing our import bill, a high level of oil self sufficiency also provides Australians with a secure domestic oil source. The benefits of a secure domestic oil source are nowhere more evident than in the current climate. Yours sincerely Alan Griffiths from the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, to a petition lodged on 8 November 1990 by Mrs Gallus (from 721 citizens). Fuel Costs Mr John Andrew MP Member for Wakefield 10 Adelaide Road GAWLER SA 5118 Dear Mr Andrew I refer to your petition of 6 December 1990 on behalf of a number of petitions in South Australia concerned about fuel prices. To reduce the burden of transport costs in rural areas, the Federal Government established the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme in 1965. The Government fully subsidises the transport costs of specified petroleum products (petrol, distillate, aviation gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel) where the cost exceeds a set margin (currently 12.7 cents per litre). While I can understand your petitioners' concerns about the increase in petroleum prices which occurred as a result of the Gulf crisis, I would point out that Australia presently has the second lowest level of taxes on petrol of any of the OECD countries and one of the lowest retail prices. At the end of 1990 when Australian consumers were paying around 72 cents per litre for petrol, our trading partners in Japan were paying $1.33, the UK $1.14, France $1.37, and Italy $1.771 litre. Contrary to claims in some quarters that Australia is a high taxing country, total petroleum taxation on crude oil and petrol as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product has declined since the early 1980s under the previous Liberal Government to its lowest proportion in a decade. I addressed a number of petroleum issues in Federal Parliament on 17 October 1990 and 21 January 1991 and I am enclosing extracts from these speeches for your information. I have also attached copies of recent press releases from the Prices Surveillance Authority on maximum wholesale prices. Finally, I must emphasise the importance which the Australian Government places on maintaining a high level of petroleum self sufficiency. Allowing Australian oil prices to move in line with international oil prices helps to maintain Australia's attractiveness for exploration and development, with the ensuing increased potential for the discovery of more oil. In addition to substantially reducing our import bill, a high level of oil self sufficiency also provides Australians with a secure domestic oil source. The benefits of a secure domestic oil source are nowhere more evident than in the current climate. Yours sincerely Alan Griffiths from the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, to a petition lodged on 6 December 1990 by Mr Andrew (from 354 citizens). Fuel Costs The Hon Kim Beazley MP Minister for Transport and Communications Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Minister I refer to your petition of 6 December 1990 on behalf of a number of petitioners concerned about petrol prices an the level of excise on petrol. While I can understand your petitioners' concerns about the increase in petroleum prices which occurred as a result of the Gulf crisis, I would point out that Australia presently has the second lowest level of taxes on petrol of any of the OECD countries and one of the lowest retail prices. At the end of 1990 when Australian consumers were paying around 72 cents per litre for petrol, our trading partners in Japan were paying $1.33, the UK $1.l4, France $1.37, and Italy $1.77/ litre. Contrary to claims in some quarters that Australia is a high taxing country, total petroleum taxation on crude oil and petrol as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product has declined since the early 1980s under the previous Liberal Government to its lowest proportion in a decade. I would point out that petrol excise is a volume based excise and therefore has not increased as a result of the Iraq/Kuwait crisis. I addressed this and a number of other petroleum issues in Federal Parliament on 17 october 1990 and 21 J anuary 1991 and I am enclosing extracts from these speeches for your information. The wholesale price of petrol is determined by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA), an independent statutory authority established by the Government to protect consumers from excessive price increases. The PSA sets the wholesale price of petrol on a daily basis in line with changes in the prices of Australian and international crude oils and the $US/$A exchange rate. The Federal Government has no control over retail prices, which although determined with reference to the wholesale price, are largely set by the retailers themselves. I attach for your information copies of press releases from the Prices Surveillance Authority on maximum wholesale petrol prices. Finally, I must emphasise the importance which the Australian Government places on maintaining a high level of petroleum self sufficiency. Allowing Australian oil prices to move in line with international oil prices helps to maintain Australia's attractiveness for exploration and development, with the ensuing increased potential for the discovery of more oil. In addition to substantially reducing our import bill, a high level of oil self sufficiency also provides Australians with a secure domestic oil source. The benefits of a secure domestic oil source are nowhere more evident than in the current climate. Yours sincerely Alan Griffiths from the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, to a petition lodged on 6 December 1990 by Mr Beazley (from 420 citizens). Breast Milk Substitutes Mr AR Browning Clerk of the House of Representatives Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Mr Browning In accordance with sessional order 132 we would like to make a joint response to a petition on Breast-milk Substitutes by Mrs Jakobson MP, read in the House on 13 September 1990. The petition referred to alleged violations of the World Health Organisation International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. This matter is dealt with by the Department of Community Services and Health and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs. Our response is given in detail below. NA NA 13 SEPTEMBER 1990 ON THE WHO CODE In response to the petition, the Government is committed to the promotion and protection of breastfeeding in the context of the aim and principles of the World Health Organisation International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the WHO Code), stated in article 11 as; ""Governments should take action to give effect to the principles and aim of this Code as appropriate to their social and legislative framework"". The WHO recognised that legislation of the Code would be appropriate and necessary in some, but not all, countries in order to achieve the objectives. Australia has been active in the pursuit of the aims and principles of the Code. For example relevant sections of the WHO Code have beeincorporated into the standard for infant formula which is the basis for State/Territory food law and into the Dairy Orders of the Export Controi Act to control labelling of infant formula exported from Australia. Additionally, where aspects of the WHO Code are. - e.tter iri1pleI?e-ted through non-legislative activIties, Austraha m these cases has: - promoted breast feeding as an Australian Dietary Guideline, endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), adopted by States and Territories and promoted by many other health professionals as part of official dietary advice; - negotiated Industry Codes of Practice for manufacturers and importers of infant formula in Australia. In order to assess the feasibility of self regulating Hon BL Howe aspects of the WHO Code, the Trade Practices Commission was directed to report on the feasibility of such an approach. Their report concluded: - Voluntary implementation of a self-regulatory scheme based in part on the WHO Code was feasible. Agreements restricting competition could be authorised by the TPC if public benefit can be shown to outweigh the cost of the agreements; - The Baby Products Association was prepared to develop a code of advertising ethics as a starting point for addressing problems in that sector; - Industry and consumer groups may wish to jointly monitor problems occurring in the retail sector as a basis for any necessary future remedial action; - An expanded public sector education campaign on the benefits of breastfeeding could enhance the results achieved by such self regulation; - More information was needed to clarify current trends in breastfeeding rates and the effect of current marketing practices on those rates. Action has been taken to address the issues raised in the TPC report. The Minister for Community Services and Health requested the Public Health Research and Development Grants Committee to consider research into breastfeeding as a priority. The Chair of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council has written personally to all State/Territory Health Ministers requesting that they continue to protect and promote breastfeeding in the context of the Code, and monitor adherence to the Code in areas of the health system under their jurisdiction. No evidence has been received in either the Department of Community Services and Health or the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to substantiate claims of WHO Code violations in Western Australia. At present, discussions are under way between the Department and the Bureau, and industry and consumer groups, to establish a mechanism for dealing with such allegations and monitoring those aspects of the Code which can be authorised under the Trade Practices Act. The nutritional, immunological and other unique benefits which human milk confers to both mother and infant are well-recognised. In addition, the Department of Community Services and Health is concerned to see that appropriate breast-milk substitutes (infant formulas) and information about their use are available to mothers who cannot, or have chosen not to, breast-feed their infants. These women must also receive appropriate support and advice to adequately care for the nutritional needs of their infants. Senator the Hon M C Tate Minister for Community Minister for Justice Services and Health and Consumer Affairs from the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, and the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, to a petition lodged on 13 September 1990 by Mrs Jakobsen (from 241 citizens). NA SWEDEN, FINLAND, NORWAY AND NA Report",22
4,Mrs JAKOBSEN,DENMARK,"1I have the duty of presenting the report of the visit by the Australian parliamentary delegation to Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark in October-November 1990. As parli-mentarians, our duties are many and vaned, but we all have an important part to playas citizens of the world. When that world is rocked by strife and turmoil we. have - n incre-singly necessary and vahd role m fostermg good relations and understanding between ourselves and fellow parliamentarians internationally. It was with this conviction very much in mind that I had the pleasure and the privilege to lead the Australian parliamentary delegation to Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark last October-Noyember, the report of which I am presentmg to the House this morning. Other members of the delegation were the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and Senator Brian Archer. Between us wpresented a fairly broad spectrum of Australian social and political thinking and p-r-iamentary experience, as well as provIdmg, I believe, a reasonable; if incomplete, sample of the rich diversity of our nation's ethnic fabric, colonial beginnings and pattern of migration. . The delegation was a most harmonious group which combined its not inconsiderabl- talent-. to. b.reak th- ice of formality WhICh can mhIbIt such mternational ventures. The language barrier was almost non-existent, thanks to the excellent English spoken by our hosts and the staff they allocated to look after us. It may have escaped the notice of the House, but today is Valentines Day. Accordingly, it is especially fitting and deserved that. I pay a particular and very personal tnbute to the constructive role performed by the spouses who accomp.anied the delegation. I convey my most smcere thanks and regards to Maggie Halverson, Mary O'Neil, Ann Fitzgibbon, Dorothy Archer and my husband Sten Jakobsen for their company and their unique contribution as ad hoc ambassadors in this most important exercise in international parliamentary relations. The Norwegian antecedents of both my husband and the honourable member for Casey provided an interesting personal link with our hosts in each of the countries visited. I hope that the report will be useful to qther honourable members in that it det-ils several procedu-es of the Nordic parhaments that are qUIte different from our own, but which appear to provide a sound basis for the operation of national parliaments. As our own practices continue to evolve, it is most helpful to have examined those found to have worked elsewhere. For instance, electronic voting has been a feature of all the Nordic parliaments visited for many years, and one which has proved to be most successful. While the countries visited lie adjacent to each other, they are quite distinctive entiti-s and - ave quite - pecial and separate hnks wIth AustralIa. For instance Australia has long enjoyed both a friendly and sound relationship with Finland. I am ple-sed. to serve as Secretary of the Austraha-Fmland Parliamentary Friendship Group a?d particularly acknowledge the presentatIOn of a book on Finns in Australia entitled Sea Gold and Sugarcane by the Speaker of the Finnish Parliament Kalevi Sorsa, on behalf of its author Olavl Koivukangas, for inclusion in the 'collection of the Parliamentary Library and I would like to make sure that th-t book actually gets into the Parliamentary Library. .For hs pa-t, Sweden has a relationship - It- A-straha that has recently increased m sIgmficance. As part of the consideration of the Kockums contract, which perhaps other members of the delegation will comment on further, we were pleased to go out and see what is happening with the submarine constructions. We were also privileged to be the guests of the Swedish Speaker, Thage Pettersson, at a number of official functions, including a performance of Tasca at the renowned Royal Opera House in Stockholm on our last evening in Sweden. Our delegation considered it most useful to bec,?me part of the increasingly important dIalogue between Australia and Sweden, and to contribute to the enhancement of parliament-to-parliament relations with that country. As honourable members would be aware, Swedish parliamentary committees have also been regularly visiting Australia in recent years to study specific aspects of Australian policy making and implementation, including most recently the housing and labour market committees. Norway and Denmark, being North lantic Treaty Organisation countries, sound links with each other and, with regard to international security, they a natural association with a country like Australia. Significantly, memories are strong of the role played by Australia in Helsinki. helping to achieve the liberation of Europe from its World War II oppressor. The Norwegian Speaker, Jo Benkow, made particular reference to that point in a very moving speech on the occasion of a recepour tion for our delegation in Oslo. He also recalled with considerable fondness his visit to Australia around the time of the opening of this Parliament House and marked upon the ability of Australians set aside racial and religious differences in the pursuit of common goals-something of which we should all be proud. Our visit to Norway coincided with the change in government occasioned by the conservative coalition Government's deAustralian cision to join the European Community. This hiatus, while difficult diplomatically and in terms of itinerary organisation our hosts, provided the delegation with an opportunity to observe first-hand the process of transition to government of Gro Harlem Brundtland's minority Labor Party Government, including informal discussions on possible Cabinet selection and policy direction. Of course, the value of parliamentary visits can lie as much in discussions about matters of contention as it does in sharing agreed views. In this respect, the tion was keen to study the circumstances in the Nordic countries visited with gard to protectionist policies in agriculwho ture. In Denmark, we were privileged to be the guests of the Speaker, Hans-Peter Clausen, and to visit a number of intercertainly esting facilities, not the least memorable of which was the Danish Crown Slaughter House in Faaborg and a ballet performa lot. ance of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. I make special note of the assistance provided by the relevant Australian representatives in the countries visited. Ambassadors Ian Nicholson and Jeff Benson met our needs comprehensively in StockAtholm and Copenhagen, and Colin Mackhave enzie from the Embassy in Sweden accompanied the delegation through Finhave land and Norway. Special arrangements were made for us to provide a reciprocal dinner for our hosts in both Oslo and The delegation secretary, Peter Grundy, was of considerable assistance during the visit, and is to be congratulated on the quality of the report he has produced since return in November. Dalma Dixon of the Parliamentary Relations Office was a last tremendous help in arranging the delegation's travel, itinerary and liaison with reoverseas posts to ensure that our needs to and interests were known. Finally, I draw to the attention of the House that in visiting Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, I conveyed invitations to the Speakers of those parliaments from the Presiding Officers of the Parliament for return visits to be conducted by the end of 1992. I know that all honourable members will welfor come the occasion to meet the parliamentary delegations from those countries when they take the opportunity to travel to our own Parliament, which I am assured they will do at the earliest possible time.",24
5,Mr MILES,DENMARK,"1 would like to concur with the comments of the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), in that it was a very pleasant trip and one in which I think a lot of goodwill develdelegaoped between our country and those countries which we .visited. Along with reher, I would like to thank those people assisted us on the trip-the secretary, Peter Grundy, as well as the Ambassadors and their staff in the various countries. It was a very worthwhile and informative trip. It was quite hectic in its schedule but overall everybody benefited I would like to make a few brief comments, because time is limited in this discussion, about a visit to a pulp mill in Finland. We did visit several industries on our trip. This one in particular was of interest to me, and I think is of great interest to Australia, having regard to where the environmental debate is within this country. Within Finland, the pulp and paper industry really is the backbone of the country and in fact provides almost 50 per cent of the export income of that country. In regard to Australia, there is actually a surplus trade balance in Finland's favour. The main exports to Australia are fine paper and paper products. They are worthÂ· about $230m. What this brings to mind, when we travel around the world and look at these countries, is that Finland has its technology together in regard to this industry. Australia is quite capable of producing the same products with the same technology. Australia can put in place the best technology in the world in this industry. However, we are yet to do that, and we are yet to make decisions in two or three areas in Australia which would help our overseas debt, our trading balance and employment, and which would give us a competitive edge in this industry. We visited the Kymmene Corporation, down at Kuusankoski, which has the largest fine paper machine in Europe.",26
6,Mr SPEAKER,DENMARK,-Order! The time for this debate has expired. STANDING ORDER 399,27
7,Mr SCHOLES,DENMARK,"I move: That for the remainder of this Parliament standing order 399 shall be suspended on each sitting Thursday unless such motion is moved by a Minister. I am surprised that this item has the precedence that it has today, but for private members it has considerable importance. Last year, this House for the first time provided a dedicated period, literally unassailable, to private members for the conduct of business which they considered to be of sufficient importance to raise in this Parliament, as opposed to those matters considered by the Executive. Opportunities for the Opposition Executive are limited, but they do exist in the case of matters of public importance. It is also able to use, fairly extensively, the provisions of private members' business, as the Opposition Executive is in fact considered to be made up of private members for the purposes of this House. My concern is to protect that period. I do not act on behalf of the Government, and I am not presenting this as a consideration or decision of the Standing Committee on Procedure, of which I am Chairman. The effect of the motion would be to prevent motions for the suspension of Standing Orders, which more often than not are moved in order to provide time for a debate when in fact the suspension is never seriously in question and cannot be achieved because the numbers do not exist for the suspension to be carried without government support. It provides an escape clause-which I am not altogether happy with, but it is necessary in a parliamentary system to have means to change the business while the House is sitting-namely, that a Minister may move a motion to suspend. That course of action has not occurred and one would hope will not occur, at least during the period of the present Government. I believe that if during the period of this Parliament we can establish the procedures-I have other methods by which I would like to establish the procedures-for an area with which members on the back bench of both sides do not wish their executives to interfere, General Business and the rights of members on General Business can be protected and advanced. This morning, for the first time, we are in fact sitting half an hour earlier so that reports of parliamentary committees can have some time to be debated in the Parliament. It is farcical-and has been as long as I have been in the Parliamentthat very serious and considered reports of parliamentary committees to which not only members of parliament, but also many members of the public, have devoted a great deal of time in preparing submissions, coming before committees and arriving at conclusions are presented to the Parliament and never heard of again. That procedure has been improved, and I think it is a tribute to the Procedure Committee in this Parliament after its establishment under Mr Keogh and Mr of Mountford, the previous chairman. If, however, we allow General on Thursday to be interrupted for those matters which are listed to be set aside for short term political considerations, will develop to be the norm. During the major period that I have been in this Parliament, General Business days listed for every second Thursday of a ting period and took precedence for two hours on those sitting Thursdays. The matters which took precedence-one has to say that the procedure has always peared to be stupid and was stupid-were those which were presented by members rising in their places on the first day sitting of a new parliament; they were listed on the Notice Paper for the nominated by the member on that day. Three years later, a matter listed in 1988 may come up on the General Business day for private members. Its relevance the current situation at the time it debated may be completely gone. During the time that I have been in the Parliament, the norm, not the exception, has been that prior to the arrival of eral Business days a notice is served the government of the day-and I have to say mainly Liberal governments-that Government Business shall take preceexist dence over General Business on the sitting Thursday. In fact, between 1977 and 1988, the House considered General Business on about five days in each sitting year-about one day in each 12 sitting weeks. I have to say that number is flated substantially by the fact that tween 1983 and 1988 General Business was not interfered with. There was another device: General Business never came up while the Adthat dress-in-Reply was before the House. On one occasion in this Parliament, the Adruption dress-in-Reply was before the House over a year, so no General Business days existed. I make these points because think it is important that now, at the commencement of what is a new and valand uable procedure for backbenchers in this about. Parliament, we say as a group of members of 'parliament that we are not going to accept that the Executive on either side the House shall take away a right which has taken 90 years to win and has been Business in operation for nine months. The motion that I have on the Notice Paper today is almost in line with the it procedures which have been recommended for divisions. It has been suggested that divisions-where they are were necessary and where they can be sitavoided-should be deferred until after 12.30 on General Business days. This would prevent a motion to create a deapbate-and that is what we are talking about; we are not talking about a genuine suspension of Standing Orders-taking of place. There would be about 25 minutes of motions from the point where the modays tion is moved for the suspension of Standing Orders. The next motion is that the member be no longer heard; the next motion is a seconder; then there is the to next one. So for 25 minutes we divide in was the chamber-nothing more-and nothing else is achieved. Members have an obligation to themselves to protect the advances that have Gennow been made. They will not survive if by we allow them to become part of a process which is allowed to exist only when something more urgent is not thought to by whoever happens to be in charge next of the executives of the day. Last year we had the first example. I make no comment on that, but it has happened once; the precedent is there. inThis, motion will ensure that it cannot behappen again .. I therefore put it to the House that, in order to protect its own rights and the rights of backbenchers on both sides of the House, we should ensure there can be no interruption to private members' business unless that intercan be justified. I do not believe for that a motion which has no chance of success can be justified-for example, a I motion where a majority for the motion does not exist becomes a debating device, that is normally what we are talking Incidentally, this is not a motion that has not peen moved in the past. The suspension of standing order 399 has occurred on a previous occasion, some years ago. I will not go into that, but it has occurred in the past. I commend the motion to the House. It may be that the House would prefer to refer the matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges for a report back to the House, which I would hope could be done very quickly. We have the responsibility of protecting our own interests; we have achieved General Business, and many members of this House have had the opportunity to debate matters relevant to. today-not relevant to three years ago, as the previous procedures allowed. Members have the opportunity to have their motion, no matter when it is put down, selected by the Selection Committee and come before the House within a short period so that it has real relevance to day-today politics. It may not be the most important issue facing the Executive on either side of the House, but individual members must have an opportunity to put motions; this gives them the opportunity and it is for us to protect it. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs SulIivan)-ls the motion seconded?",27
8,Mr CAMPBELL,DENMARK,I second the motion and endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Corio. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Are you reserving your right to speak at a later time?,29
9,Mr CAMPBELL,DENMARK,I am not allowed to.,29
10,Mr RONALDSON,DENMARK,"Ballarat) (10.02)I am indebted to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and to the former Speaker of this House, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes); perhaps he would still be there if he was displaying the sartorial elegance that we saw from the Speaker this morning. Given the eminent speakers on this matter this morning, I am not surprised that the honourable member's motion to suspend standing order 399 on each sitting Thursday unless such motion is moved by a Minister was given first billing. I was interested to hear the background as outlined by the honourable member for Corio today. I was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to speak to the honourable member yesterday regarding this matter. We all look at anything affecting private members' business with some cynicism; having spoken to the honourable member, I have no doubts as to his bona fides, and I support the matters that he has raised today. The first thing that strikes someone coming into this House is that there seems to be a lot available for some and very little for the majority. There is the opportunity to speak on Bills, and I do not want to politicise the debate this morning any more than need be, but when we get the deplorable situation that occurred last year, with the significant guillotining of Bills, regrettably that opportunity was lost to a lot of us. There is then the opportunity during the adjournment debate for backbenchers to hone their skills in their desire for a meteoric rise to the front bench and there is also the private members' business, which is what I want to address today. I agree with the honourable member for Corio that that business should be sacrosanct. I have no doubt that within the next two years the honourable member for Corio will be on this side of the House; if he chooses to stay in Parliament, he will no doubt be here for the next 15 years. I think it is important for both sides that private members' business on Thursdays be protected as far as possible. To the honourable member's credit, he has given the opportunity for very urgent government business to be brought on. I would hope that both this Government and the next coalition government would use that only very sparingly and only in times of greatest urgency. Another matter that caused me concern was that last year we sat for only 38 days. That was the second lowest number of sitting days since Federation, the lowest for 50 years. I think the previous record, if one can call it a record, was 29 days. I am pleased to see that the Government has now listened to those on this side of the House, and I suspect it was only after a bit of pressure from the press that will sit for a reasonable number of days this year. I am not too sure whether the honourable - ember for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campcrisis. bell) w1shes to speak on this matter. were to speak no doubt he would make further contribution. Given the matters raised in the press this morning about tie, as seen on television, I am surprised 1tS very best. that he is not here to defend himselfalthough he may well change his tie again for Question Time. When backbenchers come into this place I think there is an initial fear of what before them. I do not think there is very much protection or encouragement for them-but that is as it should be. We big boys and girls when we get here and we are expected to stand on our own two feet. However, I would have thought that one day a week really is not sufficient time for those on the back bench to propby their leadership. erly express themselves. A couple of weeks ago we had a serious debate-and I wish we had been debating anything else bar a war. What struck me after 10 months in this House, was thextent of, and the feeling in, that debate a-d there was, I believe, a true opportumty for the members of this House to express themselves. I think it is very that we do not always have that opportuthe nity and, . like everyone else, I pray that the next bme we do we are not discussing a war.

Indeed, that is the perception of the Australian people-it is not what happens in committees, but what happens here that is important. As we televise these debates-and I am sure that that will be extended-it is extremely important that we show the Australian people that this is a House of debate and a House where their views can we be expressed through their local members. I am sure that there is not one member in this House who was not as taken as I was with that two-day debate on the Gulf Honourable members who have If he been here for a far greater number of a years than I-in fact I have not yet been here for a year yet-commented to me his !hat that was the Parliament working at That is why I am happy to support the honourable member for Corio in this motion. I think there have to be some things that are sacrosanct and my view is that lies one of those things is the discussion of matters that emanate from local members of parliament who have been chosen to are represent and put forward the point of view of the majority of their electors. I think that their opportunities must not und-r any circumstances, be disposed of by e1ther governments or oppositions or ' I do not wish to say much more on this subject today.

11,Mr ANDREW,CITRUS INDUSTRY,"I rise to continue debate on the motion that was moved by the honourable member form  the motion was moved on 6 December ought to acquaint the House with the form of the motion. The honourable member for Mallee moved: That this House: (1) recognises the importance of the citrus industry to the social and economic life regional Australia; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) remove devel-ping country stat,us tariff concessIOns from Brazll, the world's major citrus producer; (b) immediately introduce anti-dumping and countervailing legislation which is Australians. fast and reliable; (c) remove sales tax from all fruit products; (d) stop the abuses of labelling, packaging and quality regulations which are fusing the consumer and harming the uct. consumer; and (e) streamline and make applicable operation of the - ood Sta-da--s mittee, commerclal praCticahtles and technological development. When that motion was moved by the honourable member for Mallee on 6 Dechose cember it coincided with what had been a protest by horticultural growers on front steps of Parliament House. The test was called 'the last great Aussie breakfast' because horticultural growers, principally citrus growers, recognised fact that with Australia's present cost production and with the real threat they faced from imports overseas the opportuent nity for Australians to enjoy a pure Ausbe tralian product at breakfast time was fast disappearing. , The citrus industry in Australia duces something like 600,000 tonnes of product every year. That is an awful lot of lemons and mandarins. You can imagpackaging ine, Madam Deputy Speaker, how many con- lemons it takes to make one tonne, let alone 100 000 tonnes, or in this case 600 000' t-nnes. Of the total citrus production in Australia, whether it is mandarins lemons, grapefruit, valencias or navel - ranges, something like 10 per cent is exported, something like 35. per cent finds its way onto the domestIc market and about 55 per cent is consumed in the of juice. It is the juice industry that has been the focus of attention for the I citrus industry in Australia. Think of the changes that have occurred in our lifestyle. We all know how as kids the only way ice-cream came into the House was when mum made it. She of put it into a tray in the freezer and t.here it sat in a relatively hard and sometImes icy block. My children now expect to wander to the refrigerator and find not and only ice-cream plastic packed but orange juice plastic packed as well. There has been a complete change in attitude by Fruit juice is now part of the Australian diet. In fact, Australians conjuice sume something like 17 litres per person per year of fruit juice products. We should be proud of the way citrus producers have conresponded to this demand for juice prodFor all that has happened in Australia to the we still happen to produce only 1.2- per Comcent of the world's citrus production, compared to the Brazilians who produce 26.6 per cent of the world's citrus production. What happens? The Government to extend to the Brazilians what is called a developing country preference. I the am a compassionate man. I think that in proa nation as rich as ours we ought to be making some accommodation for developing countries but Brazil is not an the underdeveloped country in the form of of citrus production. It leads the world. The challenge that the Opposition would presto the Government is the challenge to realistic in our trading practices and say to the Brazilians, 'You have n<? rig-t to a developing country preference III thIS proarea because you are not a developing country in the production of citrus fruit. Currently the citrus industry in Australia has a tariff protection of about 16 per cent. A 5 per cent developing country preference is added to that, giving the citrus industry a1;Jout 21 per cent protection, not from imported citrus product but from imported orange juice. That is a useful protection level that I think, quite responsibly, is being phased down each year. Lest it should be thought that the Australian citrus industry is not prepared to take on the rest of the world in terms of competition, let me remind honourable members that about 10 per cent of our citrus product is exported each year. Citrus growers choose to export around the world whole fruit packed in cases, in the face of competition from the Israelis, the Californians and the Spaniards. There is no protection at all for that product. The only area in which the citrus industry finds itself disadvantaged is in the production of juice. Why? The Brazilians do not have a whole fruit export industry. Because they grow oranges in tropical conditions, without irrigation and without the benefit of frost, their atively green, unattractive little balls that are then squeezed to make juice. The Brazilians have become juice professionals, and because they have a very low labour cost they represent real competition to the Australian industry. However, let us not think that the Australian industry is inefficient: it takes on the rest of the world in the production of whole fruit. We could well say, 'If that is the case, why do we not get the Australian industry to produce whole fruit and import the juice we need?'. That is the sort of superficial reply one could expect from the Government, but not from the Opposition. When one is producing fruit for export, or even for the local market, selecting the best fruit for the local market and the best fruit for export-the fruit the consumer will be prepared to buy-means that inevitably there will be an overrun of inferior product. This product will not be inferior inside or inferior in taste but inferior in the sense that it does not appeal to the consumer. It.is that fruit overrun that becomes the Australian juice industry. The overrun is the product that allows us to ensure that what we are exporting is of the highest possible standard and that what we are putting onto the Australian domestic market is also of the highest possible standard. I am not suggesting that the citrus industry should have some enormous tariff wall erected to keep out Brazilian product. What I am saying is that the citrus industry is entitled to fair trading conditions. The Government must wear the enormous misrepresentation of the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the 1983. election, when in the electorate of Riverina-Darling, in the presence of my colleague the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), he said to the citrus growers: The citrus industry is threatened by the Fraser Government's decision to reduce its protection . . . I ask my Australian Labor Party friends to consider that. He continued: A Labor government will maintain existing prooranges are rel- tection levels. He had the barefaced audacity to say that to citrus growers, and then he won an election and did nothing about it. From 1983 to 1991 protection levels have continued to fall. I am not arguing about that; I am saying that the Prime Minister, sitting where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) is now sitting, said to the citrus growers of RiverinaDarling, 'I will maintain your existing protection levels', and he did not do so. Let me be absolutely honest and say that the Fraser Government was reducing protection levels for citrus growers, and so in all probability would a Hewson government. But we would not do it unless we also guaranteed that citrus growers would see a similar exposure to world trade reality in other areas of Australian trade. My citrus growers do not expect to be protected from Brazilian juice imports simply by a tariff wall. We would have to build a tariff wall of 135 per cent to keep out the Brazilian juice that was flooding into Australia last year. No-one is proposing that that should happen. What my citrus growers ask for is a competitive environment in which to grow their citrus. If we want to have a competitive environment in which to undertake any sort of labour-intensive industry in Australia we have an obligation to address such issues as waterfront reform, transport reform and industrial relations, not so that people are paid less for what they do but so that they are paid to be efficient and productive. That does not happen. In a labour intensive industry such as the citrus industry, people want the opportunity to have their fruit picked on a contract basis and to let people be rewarded for their real productivity. They want the opportunity to transport their goods in a competitive transport arrangement, and, of course, to get those goods over the waterfront in a way that reflects what happens in the rest of the world. As Madam Deputy Speaker would know, as I know, and as everybody in this chamber knows, there is no way our waterfront can claim to be efficient; but precious little being done by the Government-other than window-dressing-to address that matter. They are the sorts of changes that citrus growers seek. Citrus growers believe-and so do I, and so I think does everyone around Australia-,-that they ought not to have to face product being simply dumped in Australia. I do not care whether we are talking about citrus growers or industrialists or anyone else. Anyone who dumps goods in Australia is destroying, unfairly, what is the fibre of Australian society.",31
12,Mr GOODLUCK,CITRUS INDUSTRY,Look at the apple juice industry in Tasmania.,33
13,Mr ANDREW,CITRUS INDUSTRY,"As the honourable member for Franklin points out, the apple juice industry faces similar problems. The Opposition has gone about implementing what would be an effective rapid track anti-dumping policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has in fact specifically asked both the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) to come up with a rapid track anti-dumping technique. What happens currently? We have dumping reviews that run on over 200 days, and in 200 days any industry, but particularly an industry preparing a perishable product, faces the reality that a complete season will be lost, people will be forced out of business and the nation will lose the capacity to export. If the Government was serious about taking on the waterfront and about its anti-dumping policy, and if it was serious about the way it competitively set wages, citrus growers would in fact be quite happy-not only to take on the rest of the world in whole fruit, as they already do in spite of those impediments, but to take on the rest of the world in juice production as well. Mr LES SeOTI (Oxley) (10.22)-1 believe that a lot of the concerns expressed by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) are being addressed by the Government. I hope to address some of those issues here this morning. The honourable gentleman raises; of course, some very important issues, and I hope is we can put his mind at rest on some Of them. When we think about having our orange drink in the morning, I suppose we often do not think of all the questions raised here today, or those raised in the past, on these issues. The Australian citrus industry is indeed a very important part of the Australian primary industry sector, and I would think that that could not be overemphasised-certainly by my colleagues in the chamber this morning. For a very long time Australia has been recognised as the lucky country. Perhaps we have become a little complacent with the specialist aspects of our people and our country, and perhaps at times we have not looked ahead far enough when it comes to many of our industries. It is very easy to get caught up in the media hype and emotion surrounding this important issue, as with many other issues; but looking at the true picture of the Australian citrus industry, the picture is not as gloomy as honourable members opposite would like us to believe. This is precisely why the Government recognises the importance of the industry to both the social and the economic life of regional Australia. In the year 1989-90, Australian exports of fruit and vegetables-the group which contains the specific fruit we are looking at today-totalled $ 518m. In this food group Australia actually had a trade surplus of around $lOOm last year. More recently imports have fallen and exports have actually risen. Imports in the September quarter of 1990 were $87m6 per cent below the year earlier levelsand in contrast, exports in the two months ended August 1990 were $101 m, and that was actually 8 per cent above the year earlier. This year the imports will fall even more, due unfortunately to the failure of the Californian crop of navel oranges, which represent a large portion of Australian imports. In response to declining prospects for many of the traditional crops, a variety of innovative products have been developed in recent years, in both fruit and vegetable industries, to cater for the different seasons and consumer tastes and to compete with imports of oranges that previously were classed as off season. Developments in shrink wrapping, which is designed to extend the storage life of oranges, should also have a similar result in the area of export products. Australia has great potential in the exporting of citrus based products and the Government is ever mindful that Australian industries should not be subject to unfair market competition from imports. At the same time, as a major agricultural exporting nation, Australia supports the need for a freer, less protected international trading environment. In fact, we have recently seen Australia at the forefront of negotiations in the Uruguay Round to achieve this. Australian primary industries are in fact the most efficient in the world, and I am sure honourable members opposite would agree with me there. Without the artificial facades other countries are placing in their primary industries, there is no doubt that the trade surplus figures mentioned previously will be increased substantially. The solution to this is the track taken by the Government at the moment, where we will not introduce the same false solutions to propping up our primary industries for a short time leading to greater long term costs for the whole economy. And with Australia's expected rise in citrus production over the next few years, we have a vested interest in ensuring other countries do not maintain proscriptive tariffs against. citrus imports. The Government is also addressing the needs of Australia's primary producers at a micro level. That is precisely why the Government is acting to stamp out any deceptive practices that may falsely lead consumers to believe they are supporting Australian producers when in fact they may be purchasing products from overseas. Australian consumers have the right to know the country of origin of the foodstuffs they buy. Equally so, Australia's primary producers have the right to promote the home grown product, knowing that competing imports will have to be disclosed as such. It was deplorable that some orange juice being sold in Australia marked 'product of Australia' did in fact contain only 25 per cent of local orange juice. Hence, the Government in its wisdom has now announced the compulsory country of origin labelling, which I am sure addresses one particular question raised by Opposition members. This will apply to imported unpackaged fruit and vegetables, all fruit juice and fruit juice products and other raw foods. The exception will be New Zealand, with whom we have a special relationship under the closer economic relations agreement. I am sure all consumers would rather do their bit for our local industries and purchase locally produced goods. That is why the Government has also moved to increase the size of the minimum requirement for country of origin labelling from the current 1.5 millimetre requirement. Such measures can only help to educate consumers on the genuine Australian product, and in doing so, better the lot of our primary producers-and deservedly so. The reducing of sales tax on juice products containing at least 25 per cent Australian juice from the general 20 per cent to 10 per cent is also to promote the demand for Australian juice. May I also point out that all the doom and gloom attitudes of many have the tendency to create just that-doom to the industry and gloom to the producer and consumer. As we all know during the recent problems of a major cannery in Victoria, the continued negative prophesising probably did more harm to the overall industry than the financial problem the company was attempting to come to terms with. When the honourable member for Wakefield refers to this Government's record in industrial relations, he really should look at what this Government has done in the industrial relations arena. The issue in Victoria was addressed, and to the great credit of the cooperation between the trade union movement and the company it has come to a satisfactory resolution. ",33
14,Mr LES SCOTT,CITRUS INDUSTRY,"If the Opposition was in government, it would have a different attitude. It would have voluntary employment agreements (VEAs) and all these sorts of things where, as a result, more people would be put out of work and the workers of this country would really finish up a lot worse off under the programs of a Liberal-National Party coalition government. The Opposition's industrial relations program, if implemented, could only cause anarchy-nothing else.  any higher?",35
15,Mr LES SCOTT,CITRUS INDUSTRY,"It certainly would under a Liberal-National Party coalition government if the Opposition ever had the opportunity to invoke some of its so called policies. Obviously the Opposition does not know the answer to industrial relations problems. The Government has a tremendous record in industrial relations compared with what the Opposition has to offer, particularly when one hears a member of the National Party in Queensland talking about industrial relations. Look at what the National Party did to that State. Fortunately, that problem has been fixed up now by taking away the power of the VEAs. Australia has a marvellous climate to support our primary industry and good gutsy people who are not afraid to work and get on with it. I have great respect for the tremendous people who are living and working on the land. So why is there a continued negative attitude from honourable members opposite? We should be positive and utilise what we have instead of saying, 'We have an unlevel playing field.' Of course we do not always have a level playing field. If we did, where would the challenges come from? Where would the explorers have come from, or the men and women on the land who have to put up with isolation, and often desolation in some areas? The children of today are facing new and different challenges, as are all Australians; but they have a great internal fortitude that keeps them going and thus creates such things as our primary industries and the many other industries that are so vital to the success of this nation. Australia produces a quality product. In fact, fresh citrus exports in the 1990-91 financial year are expected to increase by 18 per cent. Taking into consideration the development in horticultural exporting in recent yeats, this figure could be expected to grow by about 28 per cent. As a point of interest, between 1983 and 1986 Australia had an increase of 43 per cent in production of citrus products. This is why we must-as the Government is doingbe more constructive in our support of primary industry and focus more on the positive aspects of long term practices and not preach the negative to every side of the attainable. In the citrus industry and other primary industries there has been increased research. There is encouragement to produce new citrus varieties, with the aim to help increase grower returns. Most importantly, there will be a positive future for primary industry, given the opportunity. The Government has also addressed the area of 'dumping', which has been referred to in this motion before us this morning. It is intended that the anti-dumping arrangements whiCh were introduced in 1988 be reviewed in this year of 1991. In fact, the Government is looking at the dumping of products that are produced in the home country at a cost of $100 and then sold to Australia for $50. Anti-dumping is certainly an issue that has been addressed by this Government. The Government is now fast tracking to curtail such practices, and rightly so. The micro and macro measures that I have tried to outline here this morning put to rest the baseless accusations of those members opposite that this Government is not recognising the needs of Australian primary producers. In conclusion, I suggest that it is only by continuing this path of assistance that our primary producers will continue to be the world's most efficient.",35
16,Mr TRUSS,CITRUS INDUSTRY,"The citrus industry is one of the long list of Australian industries that are currently in trouble. It is difficult to think of an industralian try anywhere that is better off as a result of the election of the Australian Labor Party Government. Primary, secondary and tertiary industries are all facing difficulties. It is especially primary industry that has had to bear the terrible load of government incompetence. No-one has been able to escape the regime of high taxes and high interest rates and the economiC depression that has been created by this Government. Without wanting to make a pun, if ever this country has had a lemon of a government, it is the one we have to endure at present. Despite the record expenditure of the last Federal Budget, primary industry received the smallest share ever. Farm programs have been cut back while secondary tariff protection remains in place and work practice featherbedding remains completely entrenched. This Government is taking no action at all to get the country productive again. Introducing this particular motion on 6 December, the honourable member for  to the crisis confronting the Australian citrus industry. The motion calls on this Parliament to recognise the importance of that industry to the economic; and social fabric, particularly of regional Australia, but more importantly, proposes a fivepoint plan of action to endeavour to get that industry profitable once again. Over recent times a lot of press and other attention has been given to the crisis and, indeed, the collapse of the Australian wool industry-and it is right that there should be such national attention and sympathy for what has happened in that perhaps greatest of Australian primary industries. In the wheat industry, gross incomes have been halved through no fault of the producers themselves. But there are many other industries confronting similar difficulties whiCh perhaps do not evoke such national attention. Many small industries have drifted into oblivion over recent times; because of their small numbers, they have been unable to attract the national attention to their demise. The citrus industry is a significant Ausindustry, and this motion seeks to recognise that fact. It produces a quality product over a very long season. It is not one of the smallest of Australian industries, but it is one that certainly needs assistance to draw its plight to the attention of the Australian people. In fact, in the 1989-90 season 688,000 tonnes of citrus were produced in this country; mostly oranges, but .there were about 50,000 tonnes of mandarins, 32,000 tonnes of grapefruit and 34,000 tonnes of lemons and limes. Queensland's share of the industry is comparatively small: about 85,000 tonnes worth around $60m, mostly in the electorate of my neighbour, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr CourtiCe). It is estimated that production in 1990-91 will decline by around 90,000 tonnes, although the long term prospects for the industry are perhaps somewhat better. However impressive those figures may be, they pale into insignificance when one considers world-wide production which stands at present at 47 million tonnes. Australia's share is just 1.26 per cent. So by world standards our industry is not large, but it is significant for the economy of this country and, indeed, for the many thousands of people who depend upon it for their employment. The citrus industry is very rare amongst Australian primary industries in that it still has some tariff protection: 21 per cent for general tariff, and 16 per cent for developing countries. This is one of the major problems highlighted in the motion-the fact that Brazil, which produces 26.6 per cent of the world's citrus, obtains this preferential tariff treatment. Brazil considered to be a developing country. It is a country with enormous natural resources, a country about whose economy we used to joke; but it is probably as good as Australia's at present. It is a country of similar size, but with a much larger population, with great agricultural wealth, great capacity to produce and low costs. Yet Brazil receives tariff preference for goods coming into Australia. An industry with 26.6 per cent of the world's production gets tariff-favoured treatment, while our industry produces only 1.26 per cent of the world's production. It is a little like subsidising the multinational grocery chain to help whip the small corner store. Australia grants this privilege to its biggest competitor. Does that make good business sense-to subsidise one's competition in this particular way? So, often, we are granting developingcountry preference to some of the biggest and most successful countries in the world-and why are we taking this kind of action? It seems to be largely built around our determination to enhance our status at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks. Our Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) likes to be able to travel around to Uruguay, Brussels and other places with a smile on his face to point out how perfect Australia is, how we are breaking down our barriers-and how many Australian industries have been sacrificed for that smugness of attitude? As we bid to get other countries to follow our example and to dump their primary producers, so many Australian industries are being left to fend for themselves. Now, let us not display any hesitation in saying that free trade is indeed a worthwhile objective. Australian industry would benefit greatly, and we are right to pursue it and right to pursue it vigorously. Australia, particularly in its economically weakened state, has no capability whatever to match the worldwide subsidy programs that exist. But primary industries have been holding their breath under water now for some years waiting for a breakthrough in these talks and, if the Government waits around doing nothing is in the hope that eventually some utopian situation will miraculously occur as a result of this seemingly endless talkfest, these industries will not be around to get whatever benefits there may be. There will need to be some interim measures to guarantee the survival of these particular industries. Others at the talks are not abandoning their own producers on the assumption that GATT will succeed. The United States of America and the European Community are key players in world trade. The USA is quick to blame the EC for its bit appalling farm subsidy programs-and it is right to do that-but the USA is one of the worse subsidising regimes in the world. We have recently had news of its plans to double the amount of money available to subsidise wheat sales around the world, in a classic dumping and market stealing exercise. The Americans, despite their enormous economy and their professed commitment to free trade, do not grant this favoured status to Brazil. They put countervailing duties on the Brazilian production. The biggest producer should not have this kind of developing nation status. It is perhaps just as important, maype even more important, for the world to have fair trade as it is for it to have free trade. Of course, free trade may well be the ultimate in fair trade but, if this is unachievable, other nations choose to put their own industries first. At least as an interim measure, we should be seeking to develop worldwide fair trading policies. The behaviour of the EC, the USA and others is rather like that of the schoolyard bully and should not be tolerated and allowed to go unchecked. Perhaps we are going to have to counter it with anti-dumping and countervailing actions which are really meaningful and effective. In this regard, I warmly welcome the Senate inquiry into the operation of revised procedures for implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing actions, which is about to begin. I understand that scores of submissions have already been put to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, and it is to be hoped that this group will come to grips with the real issues. I congratulate Senator Boswell on his initiative in working to get that inquiry established. We can only hope that as a result a fast and reliable anti-dumping system will be put in place, as this motion calls for. Waiting for 220 days is waiting for an industry to be destroyed before it is able to take any action. It is ruined before it is eligible to participate in our programs. It is often too late to recover once an action has been put in place. It is expensive for any industry to get involved in an anti-dumping inquiry, and little industries are often lost entirely before they are even able to put their case. We need a program that fundamentally is not biased against Australian industry, as our program is at present, but, if anything, favours local producers. We need to be able to implement dumping duties and other such actions quickly and promptly to ensure that there is still an industry around when the injury is occurring. We also need to come to grips very clearly with the question of labelling abuses. The Product of Australia label appears on goods that sometimes have no Australian component at all, other than perhaps having been canned or packaged in this country. I welcome the proposals to do something about labelling, and I am anxious to see them put in place and become really effective. But that alone will not be enough. We must educate Australian shoppers to buy Australian. There have been these sorts of programs in the past and I believe that they have effect. There is a strong desire amongst Australians to buy Australian and to support Australian producers. We need to make it clear to people who buy Brazilian citrus or Hungarian beans or Chinese peanuts that they are contributing just as much to the national debt as is the man who wears Italian suits. Major retailers, who are perhaps the biggest offenders in this regard, should be shamed into stocking Australian. Shoppers should tell their managers that they disapprove of all the foreign products that are on the shelves at the expense of Australian products-not just in the national interest but also in their own interests. The only way of knowing for certain that a product meets Australia's health standards is to know that it was produced in this country. Many of these imported products are produced under regimes that would not be tolerated in this country. So it is also in the shopper's own interest to buy Australian to guarantee getting a quality product. It has often been said, and it is quite true, that no country in the world treats its farmers worse than Australia does, and yet we are so dependent upon our primary products. This motion calls for the recognition of a great industry and, in particular, for a plan of action for its future survival. So many industries are going to be dependent upon immediate and interim action if they are to survive to that utopian day whyn the GATT talks succeed.",36
17,Mr WALKER,CITRUS INDUSTRY,"ln the few brief minutes that are left for me to participate in this debate, I simply say that it may come as some surprise to honourable members opposite that someone with my political background should be standing in this place today as a passionate advocate of the citrus industry, an enthusiastic supporter of anti-dumping legislation and a critic of the sales tax on fruit juices. However, I am perfectly comfortable in that role because I have a deep commitment to the principles of representative democracy and I share the pride of my constituents in our local citrus industry which, until recently, has thrived on the central coast of New South Wales. The electorate of Robertson used to produce some 43,000 tonnes of oranges and lemons annually for sale as fresh fruit and juice on the Australian market and as concentrates for both local and overtive seas markets. The onset of citrus juice dumping from Brazil and the imminent those introduction of an increased sales tax juice has forced central coast farmers reduce their involvement in the industry and to rely on supplementary sources of income such as broiler chickens, stone fruits, vegetables and cut flowers. This year's citrus production will low as 22,000 tonnes of fruit, and the Cencofactory at Mangrove Mountain tells me that concentrate production on the central coast will be no more than 531,000 litres. The problem is simply one of price. The Brazilian product, produced by cheap labour and subjected to almost no health and packaging standards, is being dumped on the Australian market at a price that makes it uneconomical for Australian growers to sell even their second grade fruit. Honourable members opposite will be surprised to hear that I am an implaccountry; able opponent of that neo-classical school of economic rationalists that has so becountry, guiled the thinking of Cabinet and the leadership of the Liberal and National Our parties in recent years and which, to my mind, has seen our economy get out of government control to an extent never experienced before in Australian history. The deregulation of our banking system with its freeing of the exchange rate cretion ating a volatile dollar and requiring a reliance on interest rates as the only strument of domestic monetary policy has been bad news for rural industry, which is supersensitive to fluctuations in the change rate and high interest rates. The problem has been exacerbated an industry policy involving the gradual withdrawal of the protection that has fast track. traditionally sustained Australian industry at a time when the European Community and the Americans have stalemated the Uruguay Round and are busy devising new subsidies for their farm produce and indulging in dumping their excess product on world markets. I have long been an admirer of the Japanese dustry policy, which is characterised powerful and pervasive government interresumed. vention and sustained protection of selecindustries with the widest range of financial incentives to positively stimulate selected industries. Those incentives on include subsidies, tax concessions, soft to loans, direct grants and depreciation allowances, just to mention a few. We are a commodity supplying nation and our industry policy should be playing to that strength. That is why I am in total be as agreement with this motion which asks Parliament to recognise the importance of the citrus industry to the social and economic life of regional Australia. The motion calls for the removal of developing country status and tariff concessions from Brazil, which is the most developed country in the world when it comes to citrus production. That seems to me to be perfectly logical and acceptable. There is no internationally recognised list of developing countries. Australia itnot self nominates Brazil as a developing it is not something that the world recognises. We say that it is a developing but it is certainly not a developing country when it comes to citrus juices. current rate of tariffs for citrus juices, which is 21 per cent generally and 16 per cent for developing countries, is about to be reduced to 15 per cent and 10 per cent respectively from July 1992. That can only see a further reduction in citrus producin Australia, a loss of export income new and an increase in our balance of payinments. That is not good for Australia and Australians, because this is a very vibrant and important industry. We are going to exhave to fast track this dumping. To take 200 days to decide whether a country is by dumping is shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. We have got to have a",38

19,Mr JOHNS,GREEN ARMY,"I move: That this House: (1) supports the concept of a Green Army to fight environmental degradation; (2) believes that programs such as Landcare, Greening Australia and the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers now have sufficient experience to provide leaders in the field of practical conservation who could lead the Green Army; (3) encourages the Federal Government, in conjunction with State and local governments, to establish a fund to promote and manage the Green Army; (4) calls on groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, World Wide Fund for Nature, Greenpeace, the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth and the various Conservation Councils to encourage their members to join the Green Army; and (5) proposes that: (a) environmental repair be undertaken by members of the Green Army which shall be raised through volunteers whose expenses, including travel, accommodation and meals will be covered by the landowner; (b) individuals receiving social security benefits be allowed and indeed encouraged to participate; and (c) projects be selected so as to reinforce the current Government's environment priorities. I move this motion in conjunction with the Chairman of the Caucus Primary Industry and Resources Committee, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who will second the motion. I chair the Caucus environment committee. The essential notion of the green army is that Australia's No. 1 environmental problem is that of land degradation and that, despite the Government's efforts through programs like Landcare Australia Ltd and associated efforts from Greening Australia, we still do not have sufficient workers in the field to help landowners restore the quality of perhaps our most important capital base-soil. It struck me recently that we need a method whereby very large numbers of people can travel from the cities of Australia to assist those who essentially have the responsibility of care for landthat is, farmers as well as governments which might operate national parks and so on. In order to explain how this might come about, I want to move fairly carefully through the five points of my motion. We want to support the concept of a green army to fight environmental degradation, but we already take into account my second point-that is, that there are groups like Landcare, which is really an organisation that brings farming communities together, usually, say, in a water catchment area, to get them to discuss ways in which, together, they might solve a partic, ular river siltation problem, soil run-off problem, saltation problem or whatever. Similarly, Greening Australia is mainly a private organisation whose major role is, through seed gathering programs and so on, to gather and make trees available to groups like Landcare and also to spread the message of revegetation. But there is a third group, and this is the one that intrigues me and should be the model for the green army. It is the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, which was set up a few years ago by David Clark, a farmer from Ballarat. His idea was that we should put practical conservationists on the land to assist farmers. How can the Federal Government assist in this regard? A whole string of people are now coming to the Government saying that we have high unemployment and land degradation problems and asking whether the Government can pay for the unemployed to go out and plant trees. In my view, no, it cannot; it cannot afford to do so. That is why we need a volunteer program. The Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers has been doing this sort of work for some eight years. What I seek to do with the notion of a green army is to promote and extend the concept of the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers and build on the skills that are already in the community now which have been generated by Landcare and through Greening Australia, so that a much larger number of farmers in particular are able to avail themselves of this ability to revegetate, rope off remnant vegetation, gather seeds, destroy feral animals or whatever they believe is important to conservation, particularly soil conservation, in their area at the time. The third part of the motion says: encourages the federal Government, in conjunction with State and local governments, to lish a fund to promote and manage the Green Army. The Federal Government already spends a substantial amount of money in the Landcare program. It has assisted to Greening Australia up and running. They are big-budget items, but I know now from experience that, when the conservationbe ists, the conservation movement and the farmers have got together in the Landcare program, they have been able to work out the sorts of activities that should be dertaken in aÂ· particular catchment area. But they are unable to move beyond because of the expense of the labour. It is only, I believe, through a huge system of volunteer labour that we can make Landcare work. The Trust for Conservation Volunteers brings together small working groupsvegetation. say, 10 or a dozen people-and, in a sense, writes a contract with a farmer where the farmer pays a basic fee per day per worker, which at the moment is $13.50, and for transport costs and food. In other words, the farmer has to pay some of the cost. If these people work a national park, for instance, a State government would pick up the cost of the volunteers. The money flows back not to the volunteers' pockets, of course, but the people in the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers whose job it is to promote the Trust, teach others the correct skills, bring the people together and put them in touch with a particular landowner. That is the essence of the notion of the green army. Those who want us as a Fedof eral government to actually pay people to go out to help restore that very essential capital are really asking too much of or any other government. I am calling upon conservation groups like the Austraown land and soil. lian Conservation Foundation (ACF), Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and many others, who have said to me many times that they have upwards of 100,000 members in this country. I want them to get those 100,000 members into a program like the green army. I want them to become practical conservationists. I have been a member of the ACF for estabaround 10 years and I have not been able to become a practical conservationist because I have spent all my time working in the Australian Labor Party. Each of us as political practitioners knows that we have get to do the very basic and obvious workknocking on doors, stuffing letters in letterboxes and raising funds-if we are to any good at politics. Similarly, I put the view that, to be any good as a conservationist, at some point along the track, other than writing reams of policy-which unonly very few of us can do-people have to go out, get their hands dirty and do that something very practical. This is not a wish list. The Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers does this work. It puts people with a warm heart out there in the land, planting trees, picking up seedlings, roping off remnant This is not something that farmers can use for their own commercial benefit. They do so indirectly, but if a bloke wanted to rope off part of the back paddock he could not use Trust volunteers and he certainly could not use volunteers through the green army. It is only into be used for conservation measures. This is a challenge to the environmental groups in Australia to organise this masto sive work force and get it working directly, physically, on Australia's No. 1 - nvironmental problem, that is, land degradation. If people are serious about being good conservationists, they should buy into this. I have spoken to the National Farmers Federation, and of course it is very keen on this idea. It is particularly the view, as am I, that a program like Landcare has brought with it an ability to bring farmers and conservationists to this gether. It is making farmers more conscious of the notion of conserving their Most farmers are at a point now where they know the problems, and are even changing some of the methods by which they till the soil, but they simply cannot afford to plant acres of trees, rope off remnant vegetation or incorporate some sort of program to kill rabbits or other feral animals. They need a work force. I think this is a time when Australia might say that it is time to restore the capital of the land; we have a massive problem because we are a very tiny nation, with a very small work force and an intensive farm industry spread across a massive area of land. The Murray-Darling basin, which runs from southern Queensland through to eastern South Australia, would probably account for 70 or 80 per cent of farm production in this country, yet it is one of the very areas where land degradation in its various forms is most severe. There have been any number of fine government programs that have sought to turn around this land degradation, but I believe the limit is always the number of people whom we can physically put onto the land because, as far as I am aware, most of the work that has to be undertaken is very physical and practical. It cannot be done in a factory or with electronics; it cannot be done just with good ideas and by using Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation scientists. But, ultimately, we need a substantial number of people beavering away over the next 40 years in order to restore the capacity that we once had in this very important area of the Murray-Darling Basin and of course in other areas. The fifth point of my motion states that: (b) individuals receiving social security benefits be allowed and indeed encouraged to participate; Let me say at the beginning that this is not a substitute Commonwealth employment program-the old CEP. We are not there to pay people to dig holes in the road and then fill them in again. That was the notion we used in the CEP and we discovered two things: first, that it was an expensive way to ruin or repair roads and, secondly, that the people learned very few skills as they went through that process. Let us keep this very clearly in mind: wherever there are unemployed people the Government will continue, quite rightly, to make them, first, available for work and, secondly, to try to give them real skills to take them back into the work force. This sort of operation is not a substitute for skilling people to go back into the workplace at some stage in the future. Nevertheless, I think one of the great problems that any unemployed person has is that of morale. If people have been out of the work force for six or 12 monthsthey may have gone through a number of training schemes and they may have sat down with Commonwealth Employment Service officers and officers of the Depart:. ment of Social Security and been given all sorts of encouragement, guidance and so on-at the end of the day it is pretty boring and mentally debilitating to be out of work. I suggest that at least here is a way in which people can participate in something that is essentially good for the nation and of which they can feel proud, working as part of a team doing something. that is restoring the land of this country. It is not fanciful. This sort of work has been done for many years by various organisations. Recently, the Victorian National Parks Association Inc. wrote to me saying, 'We like your idea about a green army but we have been doing this for 15 years'. That is beaut; that is good. What I seek to do is have groups like the Victorian National Parks Association work with the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. I want to help to promote the work they do so that they can corral the new volunteers and teach and direct them to the places of greatest need. Essentially, and overall, we must remember that if the Federal Government is going to help to promote this scheme it ought to have a great deal to say about where those volunteers work. I do not mean that we should interfere between the landowner and the volunteers, but if we designate certain regions as being the critical ones which need the most work, I think we are entitled to push the program towards specific geographical locations. Let us get it clear in summary: this is not a CEP program, but. it is an opportunity for any people, particularly the unemployed, to make their contribution to something that is very special in this country. It is not a means for the Federal Government to pay for people to go out and restore the land, because we cannot do it and we cannot afford it in the sort of magnitude that I think is essential. This proposition builds on the notion of practical conservation that I think has best been brought to the fore by a group called the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. I hope that other honourable members in this House will support me in promoting this concept.",40
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GREEN ARMY,Mr Cowan)Is the motion seconded? Mr Courtice-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,43
21,Mrs BAILEY,GREEN ARMY,"This motion by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) consists of a number of sections. I would like to address my initial remarks to sections 1, 2 and 3. In these sections the honourable member proposes that this House support the concept of a green army to fight environmental degradation. He believes that programs such as Landcare Australia Ltd, Greening Australia and the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers have sufficient experience to provide leaders in the field of practical conservation and he calls on government at all three levels to establish a fund to promote and manage his concept of a green army. I support the concept of volunteers fighting environmental degradation-the essence of the first part of this motionbut this is not a new concept. In fact, this same concept of mobilising the assistance of volunteers to help arrest the problem of soil erosion in a national tree program was clearly stated in the coalition's environment policy which was released way back in October 1988. Our policy spelt it out. Let me refresh the honourable member's memory. It stated: As far as possible the role of volunteers in tree planting programs will be encouraged along the lines of the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. Opportunities for the employment of young people in such programs will be promoted in consultation with the States and other tary organisations. I commend the honourable member for Petrie for focusing attention on this huge problem of environmental degradation and I support him in his desire to utilise volunteers to assist in the fight to stem this degradation of our land. I believe that the use of volunteer organisations increases the awareness of the problem in the wider community and that by involving city dwellers, for example, in rural projects it promotes a better understanding between the two groups of environmental problems. It can provide an opportunity to develop skills for people in previously untried areas and, as the honourable member for Petrie has said, it can certainly improve and establish selfesteem among the unemployed. There is certainly a place for these volunteers and already across the country literally thousands of volunteers are donating their time and energy to groups such as Landcare and the others that I mentioned earlier. All are doing a superb job. I have many such groups working in my own electorate tackling a variety of problems, ranging from salinity control in the Whiteheads Creek area to the Seven Creeks Catchment Group at Strathbogie, which is tackling the rabbit problem. But the massive problem of land degradation that we have to repair in this country needs more attention than is afforded by the honourable member's concept of a green army. I certainly do not support the formation and funding of yet another quango to promote and manage that green army. Let us examine the magnitude of the task facing this green army. According to Peter Fray in the Australian Rural Times of 4 December 1990, Australia contributes only about 0.5 per cent to total greenhouse gas emissions, yet it accounts for 17 per cent of the world's land surface and in about 200 years we have degraded about half of the continent's 7.6 million square kilometres. The Commonwealth State collaborative soil conservation study, which was published in 1978, suggested that 51 per cent of rural land used for agriculture required treatment for erosion volun- and vegetation degradation. This report said that improved land management would solve most of the problems for just under half of this amount of land and, certainly, volunteers could help in this program. But it stated that structural work, such as waterways and contour banks, was needed on the remainder and those sorts of programs need expertise and funds. Twelve years ago the cost of those works was estimated at $2 billion. Australian soils are cited as being among the most deficient in the world. Large areas of the country are affected by salt and overly saline ground water. The soils are fragile and susceptible to degradation following land use changes and they cannot be considered a renewable resource in any practical sense because the rate of soil formation is very slow, according to Colin Chartres, author of Australia's Land Resources at Risk, published in 1987. According to the findings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in its report on the effectiveness of land degradation policies and programs in 1989, there is a serious deficiency in professionally trained soil scientists in field work and research. The Committee said that if the Government was serious in its commitment to resolving land degradation problems it should make sure that research programs are adequately resourced. It also said that at the moment Australia does not have sufficient knowledge about its soils, nor the supply of trained people to effectively service the various community projects so vitally important for the success of schemes such as the one that the honourable member for Petrie has suggested, the green army. More than 780,000 square kilometres of land in Australia is thought to be affected by human induced salinity. This represents an estimated loss in capital value of $450m and an estimated loss of gross annual production worth about $100m. However, salinity is not the only problem. According to the Institute of Foresters of Australia Inc., for every dollar that dry land salinity costs the community, wind and water erosion costs $5, soil acidification costs $25, soil structural decline costs $125 and soil nutrient degradation costs $625. There are many schools of thought on the solutions to these problems of Australia's land degradation and how they should be tackled. One school is wedded to the idea of tree planting programs, yet there has not been the backup protection to ensure the new plantations actually survive or are the correct species to succeed in their task. There is yet another school of thought that, for example, the Whittington Interceptor Salt Affected Land Treatment Society system of interceptor banks being used in my electorate succeeds. This system cuts the subsurface flow, holding as much of the rainfall as possible on the rising ground and easing the surplus slowly downhill. Not only is waterlogging, and thus salting, prevented on the valley floor but there is an increased productivity behind the banks due to the retained moisture. Interest in this system is spreading but trained people are needed to install the interceptor banks. Volunteers simply do not have the knowledge. In these harsh economic times funds are desperately needed to maintain present programs and to ensure funding of research. To use government funds to promote and manage the honourable member for Petrie's green army is wasting precious resources which could be better utilised by going to organisations with runs on the board in already managing volunteers and similar projects. There is just no need to waste money on reinventing the wheel. Volunteers are themselves a precious commodity with most already overstretched in existing organisations. The idea of encouraging individuals receiving social security benefits to participate is worthy, but if this plan has any merit it cannot be applied from on high by any flat map planning. For such a scheme to succeed it must use local networks channelling through existing groups with local knowledge and expertise, such as those already existing hard-working land care and catchment groups. The honourable member for Petrie calls on land owners to cover the expenses, including travel, accommodation and meals for volunteers. Has he not heard that there is a recession in the city and a depression in the bush? That is now official from the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Farmers facing a fall of 41 per cent in net farm cash income can barely afford to pay their own travel, accommodation and meals, let alone those of volunteers. Volunteers do and can make a significant contribution but a green army, funded by a quango, is not the answer to such a massive problem of environmental degradation.",43
22,Mr COURTICE,GREEN ARMY,"I am very pleased to support the general concept of a green volunteers program, as proposed by my colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). At the outset I would like to pay tribute to the honourable member for Petrie's dedication to the environment and the rational way in which he approaches many of the very controversial issues with regard to sustainable development. Of recent years a number of government initiatives have evolved to make the community more aware of conservation, for example, programs concerning landcare, the planting of one billion trees, the bush campaigns and endangered species. For the current financial year the Federal Government has provided $21 m for community landcare through the national soil conservation program. We have committed $320m this decade for landcare. These projects revolve more around community groups and conservation groups rather than an ongoing full time organisation. I would like to note at this juncture the great work already being done by the Australian trust for conservation volunteers. This group has been a major contributor to voluntary labour to farm, tree and landcare groups and national parks and wildlife services in most States. One of the difficulties this organisation faces at the moment is the need for more leaders. I believe that it needs our support because it is doing a great job. It already has in place a sound working infrastructure. Its aim is to increase the level of community participation on practical conservation and environmental projects throughout Australia. As the honourable member for Petrie said, the groups that are working well can ideally be utilised to draw in more support and more volunteers. The current level of funding through the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territory's grants to voluntary conservation groups is about $7,000. I would also like to support the concept that the honourable member for Petrie has raised of individuals receiving social security benefits being allowed and, indeed, encouraged to participate in programs such as this. I would like to add that I can foresee certain constraints within this proposal, particularly relating to funding social security payments and sufficient leadership training and, of course, the lodging of forms that is required every fortnight for those people on social security. If they are out in western New South Wales or western Queensland on a property that would be a difficulty. The other concern I have in this area is that, while in principle it is a sound proposition, it should not be used at a later save date by any ultra right wing conservative government to use cheap labour, to utilise unemployed people or to be used similar to the voluntary agreements programs that were put forward by the former National Party Government in Queensland. I do have some concerns in that area. In principle, I think it is a great proposition but the mechanics of working through that and staying within the social security system may well be hard to fit in. I would also envisage access to corporate sponsorship provided there were sufficient incentives in place by way of some tax deductibility as perhaps a way of helping to mainstream and speed up this process. All in all, I believe that the concept in principle has merit. I think it is interesting to note that we have four speakers on the motion today, two from rural seats and two from city seats. This indicates on all sides of the House the concern that all Australians have for our environment and for conservation. One of the hard things that we have to grapple with over the next decade is what is sustainable development. We all have different propositions on this argument. I have always been of the view that we can best improve our environment by having a healthier and wealthier economy. That means value adding and processing. I believe that we can improve the world environment by expanding our manufacturing base in this nation and having the best pollution controls in the world, instead of seeing and allowing processing to be set up in Third WorId countries where there are very little controls and constraints which leads, of course, to an expanse in world pollution. The problem of pollution cannot be isolated to individual countries; it is a global problem. Because Australia has such substantial resources, I think it has a big role to play. We.should be manufacturing and controlling emissions sensibly so that, globally, we improve the environment in which we live. As well, we should be developing technology to sell to other countries to improve industries they already have in place. Another point made by the honourable member for Petrie was very relevant. There are about 100,000 people involved in the conservation movement, and that means a commitment. It is more than just handing out pamphlets and being involved in the political process. This motion represents an opportunity for those people to get out into the bush and plant trees. Our greatest problem in regard to degradation in this country is not degradation of the beaches; it is not degradation near the capital cities where the television cameras go for a 10-second grab on the environment and use a pretty backdrop. It is in rural Australia that degradation is a massive problem, a problem that will take a lot of cooperation and hard work to overcome. I believe that 99 per cent of farmers are conservationists and understand the problem, but they do not have the resources now, and will not have overnight, to solve it. This is a great opportunity for the 100,000 or so members of conservation groups to get out and plant trees, to demonstrate that they mean what they say in their protest marches when they oppose development. Because we are short of time, I will conclude and allow the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) to add his remarks on this motion.",45
23,Mr DOBIE,GREEN ARMY,"1 thank the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Court ice) for heralding my speech. In rising to speak on the motion moved by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), let me say at the outset that I do not rise in support of the honourable member's motion as such. Nevertheless, I am very supportive of what the motion is attempting to achieve-namely, greater community involvement in the protection and restoration of the environment. It is clear that the honourable member for Petrie has a noble objective. I understand that the paper to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to which the honourable member referred was in fact inspired by him. Having met with the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers (ATCV) at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources conference in Perth last year, which I also attended, he suggested that such a submission should be sent to the Minister. The honourable member is to be congratulated on encouraging such a sequence of events following the meeting in Perth. It should also be noted that while the submission was delivered to the Minister only last week, or so I have been informed, the honourable member lodged this motion on 6 December. All credit to the honourable member for Petrie. As my colleague the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) said so eloquently in her speech, the concept of volunteer work is not new. Before I go on to that I would like to read from the Opposition's policy paper. As the honourable member for MCEwen mentioned, our October 1988 environment policy, endorsed unanimously by all members of the Opposition, states: Nothing is more important to a Nation's environment than its soil and the preservation of the quality of its land. We go on to make strong recommendations-recommendations which would have been carried out had we won the election. However, the policy remains ours. We said in that policy document: As far as possible the role of volunteers in tree planting programmes will be encouraged, along the lines ofsurprise!the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. We said also: Opportunities for the employment of young people in such programmes will be promoted in consultation with the States and voluntary organisations and these will be integrated with our Youth and Training Policies. There is no mention of training policies in the motion before us, merely the suggestion that it is proper that people on unemployment benefit be used. In the conversations I have had in the last two days with conservation and employment groups and with the Commonwealth Employment Service, the one thing they are all agreed on is the difficulty of having people on paid work working with total volunteers. Having read the motion before the House, it strikes me that despite the protests by the honourable member for Petrie and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), they consider that the volunteers should be the paid unemployed. Using the words of the honourable member for Petrie, I have had my hands dirtied in the unemployment-employment situation for the last 12 years. We have tried this method and it just does not work. It is not possible to put people who are being paid because they are unemployed beside volunteers who are not being paid and expect some sort of result. That is my basic objection to the motion. Nowhere near enough work has been done in looking into that aspect. The motion represents the summation of a submission by the ATCV, an organisation that we thought enough of, particularly in regard to its work since 1982, to include in our policy document published in October 1988. It is no use beating around the bush and saying that we are not talking about the ATCV. That organisation is the reason this matter is being discussed today. Even in that organisation's proposal, it is stated that there is much more work to be done and many things to be worked out. The logistics of such a scheme are massive. Many of the voluntary organisations we have spoken to have said that it is very hard to find local people who will volunteer to work within their local area. Those of us who have been connected with community employment programs have found very often that it is the travel involved that will attract a volunteer on unemployment benefit to do a job. So I think the costing of this proposal has to be very carefully worked out. There has to be a great deal of talk with the States and voluntary organisations on the practical logistics of the scheme. Neither the honourable member for MCEwen nor I suggest that we are not very enthusiastic about using volunteers in a large way. If any honourable members are wondering whether volunteers are available, let me remind them of the great work done in the clean-up campaigns in recent years. I suggest to the honourable member for Petrie that he should bear in mind that on 24 March we will again have the Clean Up Australia campaign. The organisers of that campaign hope to have up to 500,000 volunteers for the clean-up this year. This is the style of thing we have to promote and develop. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Hinkler speak so highly of the ATCV, which has done great work since 1982. Coincidentally, this morning I saw a list which showed that the organisation's grant from the Minister for this year is $6,000, or perhaps as much as $7,000. How on earth does the Government expect this group to do anything with a grant of $7,000? The organisation itself says that the first year of its work, if it is approved by any government, will cost $6m. Yet we have this magnificently generous amount of $6,000 or maybe $7,000 for the year from Minister Kelly for this great organisation. The organisation has no political ties, no problems, and has a great deal of effort and achievement already on the record books, yet we find the Government giving it only $7,000. I am very delighted to find, in the short time we have had for debate, that Australian Labor Party members now totally support the Opposition's policy on this subject. It is worth reminding the House that the Liberal-National Party coalition is the only group in Federal politics to have brought out an environment policy-firm, clear and on the record. The Government has never done this. I think one of the great problems we have with the present Minister is that she does not do it any more. I cannot support the motion in the way it is worded, but I do support the principle.",46
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GREEN ARMY,"Mr Cowan).,Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. END OF WAR LIST BILL 1991 Second Reading",48
25,Mr HALVERSON,GREEN ARMY," I move: That this Bill be now read a second time. The object of the End of War List Bill 1991 is to establish an end of war list to recognise and give awards for unrecognised acts of valour by Australian service personnel who served in the Vietnam war and who serve in subsequent military conflicts. An end of war list is established after the conclusion of hostilities, and provides for a final allocation of honours, decorations and medals for individual acts of gallantry. These awards are additional to the operational quota which I will explain a little later. Such lists create an opportunity for previously unsuccessful recommendations for honours to be reconsidered and for consideration of other nominations which, for anyone of a number of reasons, were not put forward during the campaign. An end of war list may be established on the approval of the Minister for Defence following the end of a particular military conflict in which the Australian defence forces have been involved. Australian forces have served in seven conflicts, not including the current Gulf war, and an end of war list has been drawn up at the conclusion of every conflict-with one exception, Vietnam, despite the fact that the three branches of our armed services made two separate requests to successive Ministers for Defence for the establishment of an end of war list in regard to the Vietnam conflict. The first request was directed to the Hon. David Fairbairn, DFC, in 1972. It was rejected on the grounds that the hostilities in Vietnam were continuing and that Australian troops were still in South East Asia, although the Minister did not rule out the possibility of establishing an end of war list at some future time. A second request was made some nine months later, in 1973, after all service personnel had returned from the war zone. The then Minister, the Hon. Lance Barnard, also rejected the proposal, this time on the ground that it would be seen to be celebrating the war. No government since that time has overturned this decision-perhaps because it was feared the establishment of such a list would reopen the damaging and controversial community debate on what had been a very sensitive and divisive episode in Australia's history; perhaps because it was hoped the issue would be forgotten. Unfortunately it is not possible for the men and women who were involved in this conflict and their families to ever forget. They remember, because they live with its legacy every day. One of the primary purposes of this Bill is to make the establishment of end of war lists automatic, rather than being dependent on ministerial approval. A permanent tribunal of three members to be appointed by the Minister, one from each of the three armed services, would be established. This tribunal would be responsible for preparing an end of war list for Vietnam and for all future military conflicts in which Australians are required to serve. This is a very special and significant Bill for several reasons, not the least of which is that it is a very brief Bill-less than 600 words in length-a very simple Bill which is clear in both its intention and in the terms in which it is expressed. It is a Bill that will cost very little to implement and administer. Although this Bill is particularly important in the context of the Vietnam war, it is appropriate and relevant that we should be debating it at a time when Australian defence personnel are involved in active service operations overseas, this time in the war now raging in the Persian Gulf area, as the provisions contained in the Bill apply not only to Vietnam but to all subsequent conflicts in which Australian forces are called upon to serve. It must be clearly understood from the outset-I particularly emphasise this point-that this Bill does not seek to condone, justify or honour war in any way. This is not a debate about whether Australia and Australians should have participated in the Vietnam war. Rather, it is a debate about duty, honour, justice, and keeping faith with our servicemen and women. So irrespective of our own personal beliefs about, or attitudes to, the different arguments for and against the involvement of Australian personnel in Vietnam, I urge honourable members to recognise this Bill for what it is: an acknowledgment by this Parliament that acts of courage and personal sacrifice deserve to be recognised and rewarded, albeit belatedly in some circumstances. However, to properly understand the Bill it is necessary to recall and reflect upon some of the historical facts relating to the Vietnam conflict. Between 1962 and 1973, 49,211 Australians served in Vietnam. Several thousand were wounded, and 511 died or were listed as missing in action. It is not generally appreciated that most service awards are subject to what is known as an operational quota, and during the Vietnam war, Australian awards for gallantry and distinguished service were made according to a formula based on the average strength of our forces. Awards were granted as a quota of one decoration per 250 personnel, and one mention in dispatches per 150 personnel, for each six-monthly period. Awards were not allowed to exceed that quota. The total number of awards received by Australians during the Vietnam war was 1,064, including four Victoria Crosses. In Vietnam, as in previous conflicts, our Australian soldiers, sailors and. airmen served with great courage and distinction, proudly maintaining and building upon the great traditions which have been forged and upheld by our armed forcestraditions which are as undeniably and firmly part of our unique Australian heritage as is the long and proud tradition of recognising, respecting and honouring our returned servicemen and women. This period is recognised as a very controversial chapter in the military and social history of this nation, and Australia's presence on the battlefields of South East Asia caused bitter divisions back home. Many of the wounds resulting from a decade of political protest and dissent are still not completely healed. An important factor in the healing processes was the national welcome home parade organised by the Vietnam veterans themselves. The march took place in Sydney on 3 October 1987, some 16 years after our troops had been withdrawn. During that time, community perceptions had changed and attitudes had softened. Contempt and anger were slowly being replaced by feelings of sympathy and support for the veterans. Many people who had actively opposed the war-particularly those who had previously slighted our returned service personnel-had begun to realise that the courage, service, suffering and sacrifice of the men and women who were sent to fight in Vietnam could not, and should not, be ignored any longer. This new and growing spirit of community understanding and acceptance which flowed from public support for, and involvement in, the commemorative reunion and welcome home parade was reflected in identical resolutions which were passed unanimously by both houses of Parliament on 24 September 1987 and in the special message of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Vietnam veterans. In the context of this debate today, it is appropriate to refresh the memories of honourable members as to the terms of these resolutions, which recognised the importance of the national welcome home parade of Vietnam veterans in Sydney on 3 October 1987. The resolutions noted that the Australian armed forces served with great distinction in Vietnam between 1962 and 1972, earning great credit for themselves and for this nation. They paid tribute to all Australian men and women who served in that theatre of war, and honoured the memory of those Australians who died in Vietnam in the service of their country. They expressed the appreciation of Parliament and the Australian people for the individual and collective commitment, effort and sacrifice of those who took part in the Vietnam conflict. In similar vein the Prime Minister's special message acknowledged the fact that whilst the Vietnam war was one of the most divisive and disturbing issues in Australia's history, whatever our individual views on the merits of Australian involvement, all of us acknowledge the courage, dedication and sacrifices of our forces in Vietnam. As this Bill is but a formal acknowledgment and practical and logical extension of the sentiments expressed in both the Prime Minister's message and the special welcome home parade resolution, I hope it will be greeted with the same enthusiasm and receive the same bipartisan consideration and unanimous support from both sides of the House. The Bill already has widespread support throughout the community in general and from the Vietnam Veterans Association and the Returned Services League of Australia in particular. From time to time, reservations have been expressed on whether or not events which happened so long ago could be adequately and properly examined and assessed by the tribunal. Would sufficient evidence be available, and would that evidence be reliable after so many years? I would remind honourable membersÂ· that last year this Parliament passed the War Crimes Amendment Bill, which relates to incidents which happened some 50 or more years ago during World War II-a considerably longer period than the 30 and 18 years that have passed since the beginning and end of the Vietnam war. That Bill sought to bring war criminals to justice. This Bill seeks justice for war heroes. Until and unless an end of war list is established for the Vietnam war, our Vietnam veterans will always be differentthey will never be on a par with our veterans from other campaigns, and this chapter of our nation's history will never be brought to a proper and acceptable conclusion. Some of those who may qualify as recipients of awards under the provisions of this Bill are still alive; others died on active service or during or since t-e Vietnam conflict-but all deserve justIc:e. It would be an appropriate gesture if thIS House saw fit to pass this Bill to enable a tribunal to be appointed and an end of war list for Vietnam to be established prior to, or at least in conjunction with, the opening of the memorial to Australian Vietnam veterans in 1992. This Bill is very similar to one which was introduced into the Senate in September 1989 by the then Senator Julian MCGauran. With support from Government, Opposition and Australian Democrats senators, the Bill passed through the Senate on 2 November 1989 but lapsed in this House as a result of thdissolution of Parliament in February 1990. This Bill, again with support from Government, Opposition and Democrat senators, passed through the Senate on 18 September, and was introduced into this House on 19 September 1990. Whilst I can think of no valid reason why this Bill should not be passed, and ""(hiist I am hopeful that the same bipartIsan support as was demonstrated by senators may also . be demonstrated by honourable members in this chamber, the challenge of successfully getting this Bill through the House is substantial because this is not a usual Government Bill. It is a private member's Bill and the track record of private member's Bills in this place is less than impressive. However, I am encouraged by and wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed by Abraham Lincoln when he said: The probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just. There is no doubt this cause is just. The men and women who have served with the Australian armed forces in Vietnam, and those currently serving in the Gulf, have demonstrated that they know how to do their duty. It is time for us to do ours. I commend the Bill to the House.",48
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GREEN ARMY,Mr Cowan)Is the motion seconded? Mr MCGauran-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,51
27,Mr GRACE,GREEN ARMY,"As honourable members are aware, the private member's Bill-the End of War List Bill currently before the House seeks to facilitate the drawing up of an end of war list for the 1962-73 Vietnam conflict. As honourable members may also be aware, but obviously not the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), it is not the Government's intention to support this Bill. In preparing my speech for today's debate I took the opportunity to refer back to the contributions of the various speakers during the passage of the Bill th(ough the Senate. I noted that a continually occurring thread in the argument of Opposition senators was that the Government is not supporting this Bill out of some sacred cow adherence to the principle that the Vietnam war was bad and therefore anything associated with the war must be bad as well. I would be the first to admit that I, in common with most of my colleagues, regard the Vietnam war as a political obscenity which demonstrated our 1960s obsession with the long since disgraced domino theory. That general sense of revulsion, however, has nothing to do with the Government's opposition to the Bill, which is based on a number of practical considerations and a balanced evaluation of the special circumstances of the conflict. , Before I deal with these considerations I wish to say to the House that I can understand the rationale behind ex-Senator MCGauran's Bill, if indeed it has been promulgated through a desire.to see a perceived imbalance for our Vietnam veterans addressed. After all, I do not believe that there would be one honourable member in this House today who would denigrate or belittle the fine contribution of our Vietnam veterans, whatever our feelings on the war itself. I must in passing, however, say that an uncharitable soul may be induced, on the Opposition's performance in the Senate, to suspect a slight political motive in this Bill. One should have thought that Opposition speakers would have made passing reference to the reasons why their party did not address this matter during their seven years in government between 1975 and 1983-especially as Australia at the time still recognised imperial honours; a situation that does not exist today and which, as I shall explain later, provides a strong reason why the Hawke Government is unable to support the Bill. ' Let us not forget that the Fraser Government was best placed of any to draw up an end of war list for the Vietnam conflict. It came to power some three years after the end of Australian involvement, which was close enough to the end of the war to allow an accurate assessment of the deeds of Australian soldiers to be made. Conversely, it was also far enough away to remove security considerations as an obstacle to the awarding of honours to those involved in very special and dangerous wartime work. By the time Mr Fraser left Parliament, 10 years had elapsed since the end of the war. Under such circumstances it is not terribly difficult to question the bona fides of the conservatives in raising this matter eight years further down the track. For the purposes of informed debate, I believe it is important for us to examine both the rationale behind end of war lists and the specific question of the suitability and legality of such a list being applied to the Vietnam conflict. Although end of war lists are not particularly well known, they are final allocations of honours, decorations and medals which are drawn up at the end of a conflict. In Australia's military history they have been drawn up under the now defunct imperial honours system, which required the Queen's approval and the blessing of British military authorities. The lists are designed to cover the many situations in war whereby soldiers are denied earlier awarding of honours or are given awards lower than the level warranted by their particular actions. Most often this has happened as a result of the quota system, which is an award level that is allowable during a particular period of conflict. This level is decided by a range of factors, including the scale of fighting and the number of soldiers in the field. The British authorities, who determined this scale of honours and awards under the imperial honours system, gave the end figure the quaint name of the operational scale. As I said, the Government is opposed to the Bill for a number of practical reasons and because an evaluation of the realities and sensitivities of the conflict weighs heavily against the drawing up of an end of war list. The concept of the operational scale and the resultant quota of awards looms large in the eyes of the Government as one of the key sensitivities. Quite simply, with the scars of the atrocious Vietnam war still being felt strongly by veterans and their families, the value of an honours list with an intended quota of 30 needs to be seriously questioned. Although it is indisputable that there exist cases of individual servicemen and servicewomen performing acts of bravery well beyond the call of duty, it is equally the case that every soldier who has returned from that particular conflict has had to endure circumstances at home vastly different from those experienced by troops from previous theatres of war. In a very real way, to hand out 30 awards 18 years after the end of Australia's involvement would be more likely to cause frustration and anger to the families of the 49,211 men and women who served Australia during that period than to right any perceived wrongs. It is also necessary to say that end of war lists have traditionally been seen as a form of victory celebrations. I do not believe that Vietnam veterans regard the end of war as anything resembling a victory, a perception that is shared by the Australian public and the Government. In such circumstances an end of war list drawn up at this time would have the possible end result of being divisive and this is the last thing that is needed by our veterans or the community in general. The wounds of the Australian public's regrettable treatment of our Vietnam veterans need to be allowed to heal naturally. The cause will not be aided by gestures of the nature of this Bill, which although perhaps well-intentioned is just not suitable for the special circumstances of the conflict. As I have said before in this speech, the fact that the Vietnam conflict was fought under the imperial honours system is the major practical consideration in the Government's decision to oppose this Bill. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, it is the Government's contention that on past experience it is highly unlikely that the Queen would contemplate making British awards available more than 18 years down the track. Secondly, since 1983 it has been this Government's policy not to recommend Australian citizens for British honours and awards. It should also be remembered that the Australian system of honours and awards was not introduced until. 1975 when Australia's involvement in Vietnam had ended. This means that Australian honours cannot be granted in place of British awards, as it is clear government policy not to use the present system of honours and awards to recognise past conflicts. The totality of these practical considerations means that the End of War List Bill must be defeated. It would be highly embarrassing for every Australian to see the Queen refuse a request for honours under such a list and it would have the effect of placing the Queen herself in a highly embarrassing position. I ask all members of the House to join with me in voting against the End of War List Bill 1989.",51
28,Mr MCGAURAN,GREEN ARMY,"Gippsland) (11.53)I am both saddened and angered by the contribution on behalf of the Government by the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace). It was a contribution riddled with cant, hypocrisy and outright inconsistencies. He started off by paying the lip service that people of his ilk always pay by saying that his comments did not relate to the wonderful contribution of Vietnam veterans. Nonetheless, he and his colFowler leagues regard the Vietnam war as 'a political obscenity' and it brings him sense of revulsion'. He then went on to say that it would be divisive to the Vietand nam veterans community for the GovernThere ment to agree to the passing of the End of War List Bill because the scars of the Vietnam war would be reopened again, use his words, and that the sensitivities many of the war demand that we do not honour the Vietnam veteran. The Vietnam Veterans Association has enthusiastically supported Senator Julian MCGauran's-private member's Bill and the coalition parties support it and wish to see. it enacted in law. The honourable member for Fowler is not speaking for Vietnam veterans and he uses gobblpassed edegook about the complications, the supthat posed impracticalities, of the imperial honours system. He claims that the awards granted will disfranchise the 49,000 families which do not get them. have never heard such patronising and condescending remarks directed towards Vietnam veterans and their families. The truth is that the Queen acts on the advice of her Ministers. There is no debate, blockage in the system. There is no earthly reason why we cannot set up an End of War Lists Tribunal to consider nomiof nations for awards for valour. There would not have to be 30 awards; the Tribunal could grant up to 30. The Government supported this legisGulf. lation in the Senate on three separate casions. This Bill has passed through Senate unanimously and now in the lower House, for some reason which the honourable member for Fowler was innominations capable of explaining, the Government has baulked at the final post. A vote this been considered. morning will see this private member's Bill passed into law so that the Vietnam veterans are finally welcomed home and not just in a token parade through Sydney with which the Government sought to sociate itself in October 1987. I am utterly dismayed by the Government's reaction this morning, as are my colleagues. The honourable member for rightly asks, 'Why did not the Fraser Government enact an end of war 'a list?' That is a very good question and regrettably there is no sensible answer, I will be perfectly frank about that. was an error of judgment on the part of the Fraser Government during its term in office not to establish an end of to war list. I very much suspect that too in that Government would have been haunted by the same fears of honouring Vietnam veterans as have bedevilled the Australian Labor Party in all the years since the end of that conflict. The Bill before us is, in all material respects, identical to that introduced by the then Senator Julian MCGauran in the Senate on 7 September 1989. In 1989, the Government supported the Bill and it through the Senate on 2 November year. Unfortunately, it lapsed in the House of Representatives because the 30 Parliament was dissolved in February 1990 for the March election. The Bill has I received Government support and it passed through the Senate again on 18 September 1990. Sadly, now, the Government will not pass it in the lower House. As other members have said in this the object of the Bill is to establish an end of war list so as to recognise and to give awards for unrecognised acts valour by Australian service personnel who served in the Vietnam war and, as the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) has stressed, in subsequent military conflicts which could include the End of war lists are final allocations ocof honours, decorations and medals, which the provide the opportunity for previously unsuccessful nominations to be reconsidered and for consideration of other which, for one reason or another, including security, could not have No Australian end of war list was established for the Vietnam war. Reasons for not establishing an end of war list, as revealed in a number of freedom of inforasmation inquiries, include the fact that Australia was not officially at war; that the Vietnam war was different as there was no decisive result; and that it would be seen as celebrating war. In other words, the reasons given over all these years for not establishing an end of war list parallel those given this morning by the honourable member Â·for Fowler on behalf of the Government. We gave the Vietnam veterans an official welcome home in the coming home parade in 1987-which, incidentally, they organised themselves. The first step, then, in recognising the contributions of Australia's Vietnam veterans and healing the divisions caused by the war has been taken. But a second step remains to be taken-that is, to establish an end of war list so as to recognise those acts of valour that have gone unnoticed. After every other international conflict in which Australian servicemen have fought an end of war list has been established. In every other war, therefore, acts of bravery by Australian service men and women have been duly publicly and officially recognised. This is a standard tice, as the disruption and sheer chaosÂ·of war often obscure the many acts of courage and self-sacrifice that are carried out in its midst. The awards made under the end of war list range from mentions in dispatches to the award, possibly, of the Victoria Cross. Whatever one's views as to the nature of the Vietnam conflict, it should neither interfere nor prejudice one's respect for the sacrifice Australia's armed forces made in the name of doing their duty on behalf of their nation. Until our Vietnam veterans are accorded all the rights and other honours of other veterans from past conflicts, they will remain separated, divorced, from the rest of Australia's military history. They now feel part of Australian society, but certainly they are regarded by the Government as a best forgotten chapter in military history. They will remain alienated from the ANZAC tradition-the tradition in which they fought and the spirit in which they should receive their full battle honours. Australia's Vietnam veterans fought with pride and honour in doing their duty, but they have fought an even harder battle in winning the respect of a community unfortunately divided by the war. For many, the toughest battle and the staunchest enemy was not on the battlefields of South East Asia; the more brutal enemy was awaiting them at home and resided in the very community they sought to defend. The Vietnam war, therefore, has an unfinished chapter. This Parliament, therefore, has in its power the opportunity to close that chapter. Australia's Vietnam veterans must be drawn into Australia's military traditions; they must be given their place and their proper place of honour in Australian history. In 1973, the Whitlam Government refused to establish an end of war list. The armed forces at the time sought to have such a list established. They sought this on two separate occasions. The first occasion was while hostilities were still in progress, and the matter was correctly put aside until the war had concluded. The second of their appeals after the war had ended in 1973 for Australia-although it prac- was two years more before the fall of Saigon-was turned down on the basis that the list would be seen as celebrating war. No-one celebrates war. The former Minister for Defence, Lance Barnard, should have known that when he rejected the second appeal by the armed forces. He should have been able to distinguish between the acts of individual gallantry and the political divisiveness which the war brought to our country. After all, Gallipoli and many other of the campaigns of World War I were not without political controversy, and the various Left ideologues around the world had their own class-based interpretation of that conflict as well. Is it now necessary to withdraw the end of war list which applies to the Gallipoli campaigns and others? Everyone should be able to recognise the bravery of those who were forced to fight in wars in the service of their countries. They should be able to separate the individual from the politics. Since 1972, successive Australian governments have refused to entertain the prospect of establishing an end of war list. They have done so on the basis that it would mean the reemergence of the conflict and division of the war years. They preferred, in essence, to sacrifice the self-esteem and self-respect of Vietnam veterans rather than risk controversy. In October 1989, as we know, Australia welcomed home its Vietnam veterans. Many of the ghosts of the past were laid to rest. There is no reason why governments should any longer fear the prospect of duly recognising the acts of courage displayed by individuals in the service of Australia's armed forces in Vietnam. It might be said that the war is long forgotten and the practicalities of identifying acts of outstanding gallantry might be too hard. If Parliament can consider it possible to pass legislation that tracks down war criminals 50 years after the event, it should be possible to identify and properly recognise the unsung heroes from the Vietnam conflict. Casual departmental checks of individual names upon request are not sufficient to recognise the individual acts of courage carried out over the course of the war. Only a full inquiry carried out in the context of military investigative procedures can ever give this matter the status it warrants. The tribunal to be established under the terms of the End of War List Bill would consist of three members of each branch of the armed forces, each appointed by the Minister for Defence. Simply, the task of the tribunal would be to prepare a list of awards for those acts of courage in time of war that have hitherto gone unrecognised. The tribunal would also recommend to the Minister the level of the awards to be presented. While there is a convention that the total number of awards will not exceed 30, the Minister may, if deemed necessary, extend the number of awards available. It ought to be put on the public record that the Government has refused to bring this motion to a vote. It has refused to give it the. force or the legislative form necessary to see an end of war list established. It has made this decision in defiance of the Senate. The Senate has passed this motion unanimously. It has also called upon the House to legislate in this matter in order to see the job done and the end of war list established. The Vietnam Veterans Association and the Returned Services League of Australia have supported the establishment of the list as well. It has been the subject of numerous petitions to the Parliament, mostly from former members of the Australian armed forces who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973. They are seeking nothing more than the recognition of the services of their comrades in arms and of former soldiers. In conclusion, I recommend to all members of the House a reading of the debate in the Senate, recorded in the Hansard of 7 September 1989, when all speakers from both sides of the House united in a way that was quite unexpected, even as the debate unfolded. I wish to quote from the speech of then Senator Julian MCGauran. In tribute to him, I should say that nobody has pursued this matter more vigorously and with a more conscientious. sense of purpose than he has. Indeed, in my hand is the Hansard record of all of his involvement in this issue in the Senate. His contribution fills dozens and dozens of pages. On numerous occasions this matter was put before the Senate. In his speech on 7 September he put the matter far better than anybody else could: As we fast approach a new century, the year 200 I, we are being asked to look back to a time that for many was a time in history books, old film footage and, indeed, museums, and I am one such person who was not even born when the atrocities occurred in the Second World War. So it is significant for me to add that my generation has never been asked to go to war. We have been privileged with an era that has not challenged our beliefs to a point where we must take up arms and defend them in war. I rise to speak for that very reason. What my generation owes to past generations is due to the will and suffering of past generations of Australians and Europeans. My generation can say that they live in a free Australia. I believe that the past era should not be forgotten. A time should not be placed on justice, nor should there be a time to forget the dead. That is what every Shrine of Remembrance in this country asks of us-'Lest We Forget' the fallen soldier and civilian.  very short time available to me, I want to correct the record. I had intended to outline in detail the problems that I and others would see as inherent in the proposal to establish an end of war list for the Vietnam war. Obviously, given that the Opposition speakers have gone over their time, it is very difficult for me to do that-in fact, it is impossible. Understandably, debate on the End of War List Bill has during its passage through the Parliament been emotional. The Vietnam war years were, it is true, years that divided Australia. Bluntly, I say to theÂ· honourable member for Gippsland that it is not proper for him to stand here and say that it is upon that Australia; basis that we reflect on this Bill, nor should we be taking up the time of this sonal House reflecting on the bitter divisions of Economic those years. Instead, the consideration of the Bill the before us today must take in, with rationcome ality and objective emotion, which those opposite continually have trouble with, the inherent problems associated with the Houseestablishment of an end of war list and with the allocation of honours and decorations reflective of undertakings in that conflict that is now many years past. I highlight briefly some of the difficulties to which I allude. Firstly, it should be attended that the proposal before the House today sets at issue the establishment of a system of honour recognition and award, the allocation of which is to be quota driven. It has been suggested that a quota of no more than 30 awards be recommended and that these be allocated following the considerations of a tribunal representative of the three arms of the services, as the honourable member for Gippsland said. It has been stated that numerous instances of bravery and valour during the Vietnam campaign have gone unrecognised without a claim. In no way do I, or anyone else, deny the probability of this suggestion, however unfortunate the probability remains. I am certain this has been the case in wars and all previous involvement, regardless of the existence of end of war lists.",52
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GREEN ARMY,"Mr Cowan)Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Resumption of debate from 13 September 1990, on motion by Mr Kerr: That: (1) noting the scarcity of information on the may distribution of wealth in Australia; (2) recognising that concern regarding inequality is shared by all major political parties in (3) noting that the most recently published survey on the distribution and composition of perwealth in Australia, Dilnot Australian Review-1st quarter 1990, has concluded that over half the total personal wealth in Australia is held by the wealthiest 10 per cent of population and the effective. tax rate on infrom savings falls as wealth rises; and (4) sharing the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in his maiden speech to the this House calls on the Government to: (a) collect and publish national statistical information regarding the distribution of wealth in Australia; and (b) commission a study to give detailed consideration to, and to report upon, measures available to reduce the inequality of wealth distribution in Australia.",56
30,Mr BROADBENT,DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH,"Corinella) (12.11)In the resumption of this debate it should be noted that the public debate in this matter has moved on and progressed since this matter was first brought before the House. The Catholic Bishops of Australia have released a report since that time which calls for the support of this motion and also calls, which they have done on a number of occasions and on a number of issues, for a wealth tax and a wealth inquiry in Australia. I record the death of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Perth, the Chairman of the Catholic Bishops Committee for Justice, Development and Peace, the Most Reverend William Foley, who died unexpectedly in Perth. The Catholic Bishops Committee for Justice, Development and Peace released in January a report tled Common Wealth and Common Good. The report inspired a call on the Federal Government to hold a wealth inquiry after months ago. revealing that the wealthiest 5 per cent of Australians were estimated to hold 50 per cent of the country's private wealth while the poorest 30 per cent had no wealth. Archbishop Foley, surely, was a champion of the underdog. It is the release of that report that again draws the attention of this House to the need to support a wealth inquiry, about which the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who is entering the chamber, has moved this motion. Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attenthe tion to the call for a wealth inquiry from the Catholic Bishops. In the Sunday Herald of 20 January 1991, Peter Costionly gan stated: Their statement that is, the Catholic Bishopscertain to be politically explosive, follows year nationwide inquiry into the distribution wealth in Australia, the first by any institution since 1915. It also calls for the tax burden on single-income families and middle and low-income wage ers to be lightened through income-splitting or rebates. The bishops urge a revamp of the company taxation system to ban tax havens and to ensure business contributes its fair share to general enue and to the environmental and social costs generates. The report went on to say: The church's decision to conduct the wealth quiry was made after the Federal Government and the Hawke Governmentbacked away from a 1987 election pledge to do so. It is interesting that the Bishops do not, for example, take sides in the consumpthe tion tax debate that is now being considsion ered by my leadership and Party. The report continued: But their policy will tilt strongly towards such a tax by demanding that the tax system be formed to change those aspects that encourage consumption at the expense of production goods and services and conserving resources. The Bishops also criticise the taxation entisystem's encouragement of financial manipulation, tax minimisation and monopolies. I made those criticisms some few It is plain to those gathered in this chamber that it is very consistent of this Government to call for inquiries on subjects that may be to the general public of little consequence, but there is an earnest seeking of information. At Federal, State or local government level, we in Australia go through myriad inquiries. My concern is that current decisions are made on assumptions rather than fact and that some in the community believeÂ· that those perceived as having great wealth should be first ones to pay more taxes, and those perceived as having little money should pay fewer taxes. The trouble is that we 'perceive'; we have not got those facts. As the bishops stated, the last time there was a wealth inquiry in this nation was in 1915. What is the fear of the Government? The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is a 3 112not inexperienced. The last Treasurer to of serve nine days less than nine years was Sir Arthur Fadden; our current Treasurer in just over 12 months time willpass that record of Sir Arthur Fadden. There has earnbeen time under this Administration forÂ· a wealth inquiry to be drawn to the attention of the House. So there must be some fear about having a wealth inquiry. Is it revjust too easy for this House to have an it inquiry into the poor, because the poor are used to being inquired about. But the rich, or those that hold the wealth, be it public or private, have all the means and infacilities to hide the wealth that they own the wealth to protect that which is theirs. I will give two examples of inappropriate decisions being taken because of a lack of correct information to put before Government. The first was the decion eligibility for Austudy for those in rural communities. After the facts came out and the senior bureaucrats and the Executive Government had made their redecision, the concerns and the effects on people were drawn to the attention of our of Federal Government Executive, which changed its mind and, while not dropping the whole of the assets test, certainly changed the rules so that more people would be included. It should have known it would have to because of the number of rural students who actually attend tertiary colleges. It seems to be much easier for students in' city areas to get a tertiary education than it is for those in country areas. The second example can be found in today's newspaper headline, 'Recession tax stall on luxury car sales'. None of us minds having a bit of a shot at those people who drive luxury cars; in fact, my own leader has had a past association with a Ferrari. But what happens when political decisions rather than decisions on the facts are made? I would love to read out the whole article, but do not have time. In one paragraph, it says: The Government is now faced with a likely enue loss from the crippled luxury car segment of at least $350m this year. So a decision taken based on envy has now backfired on the Government to the tune of $350m a year. I personally do not have a concern for the Ferrari or Porsche driver, but I have got a concern for the guy who cleans the windows of the dealership. The article says that some dealerships face oblivion. From a social justice point of view, this Government has failed in many areas. I perceive-but I have not got the facts before me-that since 1983 the rich have got richer, and we are sick of hearing it, and the poor have got poorer. That is my perception. But the Government is standing against an inquiry into wealth or poverty or how money distribution is handled in Australia. I wonder whether it really wants to know the facts. I wonder whether the Government is saying, 'Look, if we have this inquiry, we will have to face the Australian people with the facts of what is really happening'. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I stand here on behalf of the window cleaner. He is the most important person in Australia because if he has got a job, we are all doing well.",56
31,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,58
32,Mr LANGMORE,DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH,"1 congratulate the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent), on his support of this important motion. I particularly congratulate wholeheartedly the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) on moving it. It is a most timely motion and one on a very important subject. It is timely, as the honourable member for Corinella said, because of the Catholic Bishops' report Common Wealth and Common Good, which has recently been released. This is a particularly valuable report. It is accurate; it is careful and balanced; it is based on a sound theological foundation of the church's social teaching; and it arrives at very reasonable conclusions. It begins with some very striking information about the distribution of wealth in Australia. As the honourable member for Corinella said, we rev- do need an inquiry-and this report emphasises that-because we do not have complete and accurate information but we do have estimates. One striking estimate, which is generally regarded as indicative, shows that the top 5 per cent of wealth holders hold about 50 per cent of Australia's total wealth! Five per cent hold 50 per cent of the wealth. That is a terrible indictment of our country. The least wealthy 30 per cent hold no net wealth at all. That really is an appalling situation. The report by the Catholic Bishops goes on to point out that corporate wealth is usually controlled by senior executives rather than by households or shareholders, and that too is a source of inequality. It makes estimates of what has been happening recently about the distribution of income and wealth and it comes to the conclusion that high income households have received a higher proportion of income, the situation of middle income households has been deteriorating and lower income households have remained roughly constant. So it is the high income earners who in the last decade or so have been improving their income situation at the expense of the middle income earners. Middle income earners have been losing their position. The report goes on to discuss the social teachings of the church. Anyone who is interested in the moral dimension of polsystem. itics will find them very striking. For ample, various encyclicals have talked about the primacy of labour over capital and, whilst recognising the right to vate property, emphasises that that right is limited and conditional. The present Pope, in his two social encyclicals, the report says, has emphasised human dignit ity, work, solidarity, and the preferential option for the poor. The idea of the prefwere erential option for the poor is something that is embedded in Christian teaching, and the church emphasises that in its work. . The report also talks about the growth of individualism during the 1980s. During the 1980s we went through a decade of more self-interested individualism than ever before, with destructive conseof quences for the confidence of large bers of people that society will normally operate fairly and in a way which distribthe utes the benefits of economic activity uitably. We in Australia are in danger losing our tradition of egalitarianism through over-emphasis on rampant indical vidualism and minimally constrained interest. As Australians, we must both draw on and strengthen our traditions of mateship and fairness by giving them fresh change and effective expression through new polAustralia. icies and institutional arrangements. The report concludes with some very important recommendations about in which Australia could become a fairer Wealth society. It is those recommendations that I would like particularly to dwell on beopportunities cause they represent the applications of these the report that are most relevant to this House. The report talks about emphasistax. ing the concept of the common good and linking that with the ideal of solidarity, and that those concepts should be the basis for any action taken to redistribute wealth inÂ· Australia. Then, on the basis that general principle, it goes on to some quite specific recommendations about tax and social security. For examwe ple, it says that the taxation system should be reordered so that high income earners cease to receive advantages at the expense of low income earners. In other words, is arguing for a more progressive total It does not just single out in,come extax; it looks at every aspect of tax. It is very important to bear in mind when considering indirect taxes, which priwere mentioned by the previous speaker, that the danger of indirect taxes is that they tend to be regressive. That does not mean that they cannot be introduced, but does mean that they could only be introduced in a just and fair way if they linked with a whole series of other changes to the tax system that ensured that the tax system in total remained progressive. It would become more progressive if the recommendations of the Catholic Bishops were to be accepted. The bishops go on to recommend that the tax burden on middle income earners should be lightened-something that lots people in the community would welnumcome. But then they argue-and this is perhaps their key recommendation-that introduction of death duties or some eqother form of wealth tax be given serious of consideration. They are careful about how they phrase that; but that is a quite radisuggestion. It is a suggestion that I selfpersonally and many of my colleagues wholeheartedly support. It is a necessary if we are going to have the kind of equitable tax system that we need in One of the striking quotes from the paper on taxation published by Treasury at the time of the National Taxation ways Summit in 1985 is this: yields benefits over and above the income derived from it, including power, independence, and security. It can be argued that benefits confer an additional taxable capacity over and above the capacity to pay income Moreover, wealth yields an income without any current sacrifice of leisure. So because of those kinds of factors it is important that we plug the gaping hole in our tax system and introduce an inheritof ance tax. We are one of only two Western make countries that do not have any form of tax on wealth. Without a tax on wealth cannot have a tax system that is an adequate redistributional mechanism that ensures a fair and just society. The way to do this would be, as the report suggests, it through an inheritance tax, because that tax involves few administrative problems and is only collected when estates change hands, and therefore does not interfere at all with investment by entrepreneurs or with economic incentives. Inheritance taxes are consistent with the democratic principle of attempting to move closer to equality of opportunity. An inheritance tax could appropriately be collected on estates of over $1 m with suitable modifications for family farms and small businesses, so it would not make an impact on the great majority of people although it would be a way of ensuring that vast accumulations of wealth do not go on growing and growing. The introductionof an inheritance tax would shift the burden of taxation to those most able to pay and that is the central principle, the bishops argue-and so make the tax system a little more progressive. It would make a significant contribution to reducing inequality. The time has come to look again at the appropriateness of introducing an inheritance tax. That would be one way of reducing the dangers that exist to the strong egalitarian traditions which represent one of the central foundations of Australian life. Those traditions are being threatened by the amassing of huge fortunes. As the previous speaker says, there has not been an inquiry into the distribution of wealth since 1915. It is very important that we pick up the bishops' recommendation that there be such an inquiry, and it is also important that that inquiry look at the possibility of an inherfrom itance tax. I strongly endorse the bishops' recommendations.",58
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH,"Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Head Injured Children",60
34,Mrs GALLUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I intend to use the grievance debate today to speak on behalf of the parents with disabled children in my own and neighbouring electorates. On 23 January I attended a meeting of the Head Injury Society of South Australia. A young girl who had been injured in a car accident told the meeting: There is nothing to do, nothing to keep my mind active. Once you leave hospital everyone forgets about you. No one tells you anything. If only there was some ongoing therapy, some long term therapy, to help you get a bit better. A man with head injuries said the same thing-there was no help, no ongoing rehabilitation. He said: We're alive-so big deal. What are we supposed to do all day? Sleep? The rest of those at the meeting had children with head injuries, again mostly from car accidents. One couple had looked after their head injured son for 21 years. They were tired and scared of the future, and angry. Anger was a very common emotion at that meeting. There was a sole mother, no longer young, who had a 6 foot 2 inch son confined to a wheelchair. Sometimes the frustration of knowing what he can no longer do makes him violent. She has to feed him and lift him, and she has had six stomach ulcers. A father with a head injured daughter said his wife was not present-she has been hospitalised six times stress. Their comments were all similar. The parents wanted respite. For some it was just temporary respite-two weeks to gather energy. Others were getting old, and wanted to see their child established in a home where they knew he or she was cared for and safe. They wanted to know why there was no ongoing rehabilitation for their injured children. They wanted activities for them. But most of all they wanted an answer to the question: What will happen to my child when I die? The parents of head injured children say that they have been forgotten; that out of all the groups with disabilities, those with head injuries have been overlooked. There is no argument from the service providers. As far as services are concerned, the service providers tell us that those with head injuries are not even at a point where the intellectually disabled were 10 years ago. Yet from the parents of intellectually disabled children I have heard the same pleas for help. In South Australia special schools will no longer accept intellectually disabled people after they are 20. A mother rang my office to ask what she would do with her daughter then. Despite the recent rhetoric from the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) about opportunities for people with disabilities, the reality is that for the majority of people there are none. A father asked me to write a letter of support to get his son, who is now 12, into a community home by the time he is 18. He really did not hold out much hope; there are so few places and so many people waiting for them. In the disability area the difference tween the rhetoric and the reality has left parents confused. On one hand they have read the 1983 handicapped programs review, the 1985 New Directions document, and the Disability Services Act of 1986, and its marvellous principles and objectives that were gazetted in June 1987. They hear the Minister for Community Services and Health talking about opening doors and stepping through. They hear about the 58 per cent real increase in funding, the 225 new employment services and the 112 new accommodation services. But on the other hand they look at their own situation which, for many, has changed very little. There is no question but that there have been achievements in the last four years. Attitudes have changed, new opportunities have opened up. Much of the drive for change has come originally from the parents who fought for the right of disabled people to live a full life in the munity. But in the drive to achieve deinstitutionalisation and community integration for those people living in institutions, the needs of many families with an intellectually disabled member living at home have not been met. Last month a group of parents with intellectually disabled children met in my office. A woman there said she almost wished that she had put her son in an institution when he was born because, as she said, 'Then he would not have to be so isolated, and neither would we'. Another mother who had fought constantly for her daughter said that she had reached the stage of saying, 'Will I kill my daughter or myself?'. Another has thought that she will have to take her son with her when she dies for fear of what will happen to him when she is gone. Most of the parents were tired, some were exhausted and some had learnt how to work the system. 'You forget about everyone else', one mother said, 'you just go out there for yourself and convince the service providers that your case is the worse and you need help the most'. That woman had attained a grant for her daughter to live in the community. But as she said, that sort of thing divides parents be- because the other parents ask 'why her child, why not mine?'. Parents compete for scarce resources; some succeed, some do not. They say there are new services, but more often than not families do not meet the service requirements. To quote one service provider, 'Parents do have a choice; they have a choice as to which waiting list to go onto'. There has been a great injection of funds into the disability area, but too large a percentage of those funds has gone on administration and a plethora of small programs, each with its own clerical support, some of which have worked and some of which have not. In a press release in November 1990 the Minister announced that he was setting up a new unit to provide expert technical advice to sheltered workshops to assist them in becoming supported employment centres. How much is that unit going to cost? When people are still waiting for basic services, com- when there are thousands of disabled people all over Australia who have no daytime activities, I question the appropriateness of spending sparse funds on a highly specialised unit such as this. Given a choice, everyone would rather have supported employment than sheltered workshops. But the reality is that there are families with children who would take what the Minister referred to in his speech to ACROD in November 1990 as second and third best, because second and third best are better than nothing. What drives parents is not philosophy but the desire to see their children out of the house doing something they look forward to and coming home at the end of the day feeling they have made a contributioo. . Parents are asking whether the commitment of the Minister is to individuals with disabilities and their families, or a structure that looks good and sounds impressive. There is a feeling that there too much focus on structure and too little on people. It is a cruel hoax to pretend that in these days of restricted employSouth ment opportunities and increasing dole queues there will be increased employtions ment for people with disabilities. The result of setting up such a grand structure with insufficient funds is that some people get a rolls royce service and others nothing. Let us look at the statistics. In South Australia alone there are 800 people with intellectual disabilities on the waiting for accommodation. Two hundred are sense. marked 'urgent'. It is estimated that there are 2,000 people with intellectual disabilcharge ities at home without any daytime activiing ties. There are no statistics for people with head injuries. But the demand for respite from carers from both areas weighs the ability of service providers provide it. Despite the hope, the promises and the rhetoric from the Minister, there is enough money to go around. This is not surprising: the disability area is an tremely expensive one and it will take years to bring about all the changes are needed. Yet the Minister talks about ideology, philosophy and metaphorical a ladders, and because of this parents are still hoping that next year they will respite, that there will be activities for promised. their children, that there will be accommodation for their children. But in South Australia this will not happen. In the disability area, the per capita equalisation scheme for the States means that South Australia will receive a negligible increase in funds in the upcoming year. For instance, it is estimated that in the whole area of accommodation for people with disabilities, South Australia will receive only an extra $70,000 for accommodation in the whole disability area. Already there are 800 people with intellectual disabilities waiting for that accommodation. The per capita equalisation funding has a nice type of logic about it. Like most to things the Minister has done in this area, it is philosophically pure. But life does is not fit neatly into the Minister's philosophy, and what he has not taken into account is that, unlike the eastern States, Australia does not have access to funds from large philanthropic organisaand major corporations. The per end capita equalisation scheme will be another blow to people with disabilities in South Australia and once again the reality get does not match the rhetoric. Finally, the intention of the Commonwealth is to hand over responsibility for much of the disability area to the States. list This type of rationality makes a lot of We do have duplication of services and there is confusion about who is in of what. However, while supportthe rationalisation of services in the disability area, this has other implications. One implication is that the Comoutmonwealth Disability Services Act 1986 to will become largely redundant. There is concern that in transferring responsibility to the States, the Commonnot wealth will avoid the hard question of how to match expenditure with rhetoric. exThere are deep concerns about the ability of the States to fund such areas as dis"": that abled accommodation, even with tied grants from the Commonwealth. There is fear that what the States receive will not be sufficient and they will never be able get to put into place what the Minister has",60
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Perseverance Corporation Ltd,62
36,Mr LAVARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"When I undertook a study of company law as a third year law student, I must admit I had rather naive views as to what a company was and what it was supposed to achieve. It always seemed that it was supposed to be a vehicle whereby people could invest money without the risk of unlimited personal liability. I always thought that shareholders were risk-takers inasmuch as they put forward their money and the product which their company produced or the service that it provided may or may not be successful in a marketplace. I also believed that directors were responsible for conducting the dayto-day operation of a company on behalf of the shareholders, the interests of the company as a whole, and not in their own interests; and that they supervised the management who were paid to run the company. Maybe as a third year law student I could have been forgiven for being a little bit naive, but the stark difference between the theory of what companies and the participants within them are supposed to do and the reality is extremely stark indeed. I want today to talk about one example which has been brought to my attention by a group of constituents who happened to find themselves minority shareholders in a goldmining company by the name of Perseverance Corporation Ltd. This particular company is quite small. It operates a gold mine in Victoria. However, it is a legitimate business and has reasonable prospects. The amount of gold which has been produced over recent years has provided the company with a fairly attractive cash flow. It would seem that this very attractive cash flow makes it an immediate target for takeovers, for it has been the subject of probably the most pronounced-or at least prolonged-takeover saga that we have seen in some time. . The saga began in 1989 when Perseverance was subjected to a bid by a company known as Yam Ltd. This takeover was largely successful and Yam ended up with about 73 per cent of the stock of Perseverance. However, a minority of around 25 per cent of the shareholders refused to sell. It seemed that tliey had some doubts that the interests of their company, which was actually producing and having a cash flow, were served by being taken over by a company which, while it had some mining interests, was absolutely without a cash flow. Their company was hardly going to be benefited by being taken over by what was basically a shell of a company. Over the next 18 months the minority shareholders within Perseverance launched a very spirited defence of their position. Earlier in 1990, Yam, having not been able to acquire 100 per cent of Perseverance, sold down its holdings to just under 50 per cent. However, those shares that were sold were picked up by the major shareholder in Yam-that was Mt Gipps-and also other individual shareholders of Yam. So, in effect, the major control of Perseverance remained with Yam. Behind both Yam and this other company, Mt Gipps, is another group known as Waverley Assets Management. This is a vehicle of a fellow by the name of Willie MCLucas. Mr MCLucas has rather a colourful past. He is based in Edinburgh and was involved with the spectacular collapse of the London broking house, Jacksons Ltd. It is alleged by the minority shareholders in Perseverance that Mr MCLucas has been busy in Australia in recent times. As well as being involved in Yam and now Perseverance, he has also apparently picked up interest in another five or so Australian mining companies. One of these companies was the Perth based Western Rare Earths. This company came to attention when it figured in a takeover bid for the infamous Independent Resources Ltd, which honourable members may be familiar with. The IRL group has probably been the most famous of the director led shareholder rip-offs which were the flavour of the month throughout the 1980s. The underwriter for this takeover bid by Western Rare Earths of Independent Resources was the same Mr MCLucas. Apparently, the plan was to add Perseverance to the list of companies MCLucas is taking over in order to actually get a company that did have a bit of a cash flow but the strong resistance put up by the minority shareholders. and their independent directors has stifled these plans. But do not fear; there are other ways, of course, to get at a cash flow of a company. One of the most popular ones in recent times has been the device called the management agreement which was, of course, made famous by a Mr Skase of Quintex fame. In the case of Perseverance, the management agreement involved a director and his private company called Juko Mining Management which is the vehicle of one of the directors of Perseverance, Mr Brian Phillips. Mr Brian Phillips got on the board of Perseverance through being a director of Vam and hence through the holdings Vam had in Perseverance.  be absolutely wonderful managers because from the period December 1989 to April 1990, which I think is about five months, his management company was paid the sum of $313,000 for its management services.",63

The new contract was to pay the company $1,000 a day for its services. However, they refused to come to that and the comparatively paltry sum of $20,000 per month is now being paid  Phillips is a director of Perseverance and hence not only should his management company be paid for its expertise; his personal expertise as a director also obviously has to be rewarded.

39,Mr KERR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Just a miserly pittance.,64
40,Mr LAVARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Well, if you add that onto what he got through his management company and no doubt what he got paid as being a director of Vam, I do not know whether the 1989-90 financial year has  However, also in the management services business is our friend Mr MCLucas and Waverly Assets Management. According to Mr Alan Carr, who is one of the independent directors of Perseverance, Mr MCLucas approached the company wanting a $lm service contract with Perseverance, to extend over a period of three years. For this, Mr MCLucas' company was to provide general corporate advisory and investment services and overseas representations. There was, of course, a large dispute between the independent directors and those who were loyal to Yam and, hence, MCLucas through the holdings, and this resulted in the intervention of the NCSC. A standstill agreement was placed whereby the board was to stay as it was and the shareholdings were to stay. An independent chairman was appointed to split the deadlock. That was a Mr Dixon who was formerly of Western Mining. That really probably should have been the end of this little saga, but unfortunately it was not. Having been stifled in an attempt to get their hands on the cash flow that way, 10 and behold both Yam and Perseverance became the subject of another takeover bid, this time by a British company, Butte Mining. Butte Mining, as much as one can find out, is listed on the London Stock Exchange. It has 115 million shares on issue and 1989 had a profit of Â£14,000. But despite its apparent insolvency, or at least the lack of ability to fund such a takeover, it is making a script swap for Yam and Perseverance. Naturally enough, Yam, which is controlled by MCLucas, has agreed to this. So effectively now Perseverance has been taken over by this third company, Butte. Of course, Mr MCLucas is also on a success retainer, that is, he gets another fee out of Butte apparently for being able to advise them, and once the script is taken up then he also gets paid for that, as well as his other service arrangement. So again we have the same scheme which I think we saw at the end of the 1980s continuing well into this decade.",64
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Victorian Government,65
42,Mr CHARLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"La Trobe) (12.51)My grievance today is with the Kirner Australian Labor Party Government of the State of Victoria, and any other State government which has the audacity to utilise our bureaucratic and Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) controlled industrial relations system to impose additional and unjustified taxes on business, commerce and industry. The Victorian publicly funded bureaucracy, built up over the last eight years of Labor control in Victoria, has determined that award superannuation contributions by employers are really income in the hands of the workers who are the beneficiaries of such awards and therefore subject to company payment of payroll tax. So now we have payroll tax on superannuation. If the issue were not so serious it would be almost laughable. Here we are, in the depths of a recession engineered by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), a recession we had to have, and the bankrupt, left wing, Halfpenny controlled Government of Vic- . toria has determined to tighten the screws on industry and commerce through the inflationary and discriminatory vehicle of an expanded State payroll tax. At a time when employment opportunities are contracting, this Government's mates in Victoria are increasing the tax on employment. The bureaucrats in Victoria have decided that because the Industrial Relations Commission agreed with the ACTU and the Federal Government that superannuation should become an award provision, then such a provision is actually wages in the hands of an employee, is deemed to be part of the payroll and therefore is subject to payroll tax. So we have the iniquitous situation where a centrally controlled bureaucratic system of wage determination has provided the vehicle whereby a State government, which has already failed as a financial manager, can now decimate private industry as well by imposing additional taxes in a time of labour shedding and major recession. This action will, of course, lead to additional retrenchments, additional costs to the public purse in unemployment benefits and further disincentive to industry. The Victorian Government's determination simply confirms my view that our internationally unique and centrally controlled industrial relations system has outlived its usefulness. Since I am today concentrating on Victoria, it is appropriate to examine the SPC Ltd versus John Halfpenny and friends dispute of last December. Honourable members will recall that the Shepparton Preserving Company found itself in financial difficulty and took its predicament, including all of the financial information, to all of its regular employees. Most would think that that action by management was both. responsible and fair. Discussions were held and agreement reached for changes in employment conditions, which all parties believed would reverse a potential operating loss and allow the company to continue trading without loss of jobs. The agreement between SPC workers and management to temporarily change some pay rates and conditions of employment in order to save jobs demonstrated real industrial responsibility and sensible democratic response to the difficult times that we face with our nation in recession. Unfortunately, John Halfpenny and other union officials intervened, caused a dispute and forced the matter to be taken in confrontation mode before the Industrial Relations Commission. The unions argued that employees had no right. to determine for themselves the value of their labour or the conditions under which they would work. It was argued that if such democratic agreements were allowed to be made, our whole centralised and highly structured wage determination system might be put at risk. It was also argued that SPC's financial problems were mostly of the company's own making so other solutions to its problems should have been found, whatever they might have been. It was clear to management and to the work force that regardless of the reasons for the financial difficulty, no substantial costsaving measures were available other than to change wages and conditions or to shed labour. I would have thought immaterial the reasons why a productive enterprise is in financial difficulty if in fact a solution to the problem can be found by agreement between the work force and its management and jobs saved as a result. But what seems so simple to SPC, its workers, and most Australians was not allowed to proceed because the Commissioner and the unions had been excluded from the negotiation and decision-making process. While ultimately SPC and its workers gained some temporary flexibility and cost savings through the agreement reached through the Commission, the only real winners from that exercise were some trade union leaders, whose power and influence have been further enhanced. It was the system that was seen by the unions and the Commission as having to be preserved and that has become so inflexible as to have outlived its usefulness. Paddy MCGuinness in the Australian on 5 January of this year said: But what has Mr Halfpenny achieved? He has shown that unions are prepared to both override the wishes of the employees of an enterprise and to interfere with their freely entered into ations and agreement with management. He has shown that the unions do not consider the employees of an enterprise to have any status before the IRC-representatives of the work force at SPC were excluded from the discussions in the IRC at the behest of the unions. You could not wish for a clearer example of the contempt in which the unions hold the individual rights of their members. He has shown that the IRC is an instrument of the unions to be used by them against their own members and that it will always fight the interests ruin. of the industrial relations club before those of individual employees and enterprises. Just to add insult to injury, Commissioner Donaldson of the IRC attacked media commentators and otherswhoever they might be-in his letter to the editor in the Herald-Sun on 9 January of this year. Mr Donaldson said: Some media commentators and others, anxious to focus attention on themselves, presumably for some purpose of their own, chose to misconstrue or misrepresent the circumstances of the SPC dispute before the Industrial Relations Commission. This is to be deplored. In some cases, their advocacy ignores that the awards of the Commission have the force of a law of the Commonwealth. If Commissioner Donaldson is arguing that the media should not discuss the inappropriateness of our industrial relations system because it is bound up in law, then we had certainly best change the rules. In point of fact, this side of the House would like to dramatically change the rules to allow exactly the kind of agreement made between SPC management and its workers to be the pacesetter of industrial relations cooperation and sensible labour relations. The rule of law and the right of individuals under common law are well recognised and over time have served well both individuals and our nation as a whole. We have one of the longest serving and uninterrupted systems of constitutional democracy in the world today. Our system has indeed performed admirably. However, our industrial relations system, our system of labour law, is antiquated and regressive. The fact that a State government can use the system to impose additidnal taxes on employers is just one more nail in the coffin. The original agreenegotiment between employers and employees at SPC was a true enterprise agreement for the benefit of both parties, and clearly is the way of the future. The decision of the Victorian Government to tax superannuation payments is illogical and regressive. Unless and until we learn to look upon industry and business as positive elements of our society-to be encouraged and not decimated-we will continue on our current path to economic Industry Policy-Transport System",65
43,Mr HARRY WOODS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am heartened by the intention of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to introduce to this House an industry statement next month. Also, I am heartened by reports that this statement is likely to adopt a tough approach to cutting protection levels. This new approach needs to be dynamic. It needs to reflect the changing needs of our primary and secondary inquires dustries. We cannot apply across-the-board rules for all industry. I see no need wholesale changes to current policy. Our trains. moves towards reductions to levels of protection are correct. To be a successful competitor in the international market, we need to encourage our industries stand on their own feet. As a government we can help them do that. Support for our industries does not come through tariff protection, and should not. It comes through improvetransport ments to infrastructure, multiskilling of our work force, and the encouragement efficiency in the workplace. We are althat ready seeing the benefits of multiskilling. That point was driven home to cently on a visit with one of the standing committees of this Government to the Port of Botany container terminal, where we were looking at rail, road and wharf interfaces. One thing that was pointed out to us was the staffing on the container cranes. They used to require a staff six-three drivers and three doing various ship, deck and clerical duties. Now those same cranes are staffed by three people and that can be seen as an improvement. I am not suggesting that further progress cannot be made on wharves and in other places, but we are moving in the right direction. Further efficiencies will be achieved through different means of handling conto tainers on our wharves. It may be that we will develop one major container terminal in Australia and rail transport those tainers to destinations throughout Ausrisk tralia. We also need to improve the tralia, methods of getting the goods from the farm or factory gate to the point of sale. We have to work out the most efficient way of sending our goods. The national freight initiative is going down the right track. The initiatives that are identified need to be implemented quickly. We need to develop rail lines that go straight to wharves without getting held up in subsidies urban rail networks. We need to make rail freight more efficient. We need to have longer trains, longer loops, and trains capable of efficiently carrying greater loads direct to wharves. To do this readditional spending and the allocation of funds to extend those loops so for they are capable of handling the longer This has been recognised by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) who, when in my electorate last month, to outlined major Commonwealth Government commitments to improve rail bridges and loops around Australia. The Economic Planning Advisory Council has esit timated that industry reform in the area could save more than $2 billion annually. The savings are only part of of the story. It is the competitive edge that improved transport system will give to our industries which will place me rethem on a more secure footing. It is imperative that we find the best ways to spend money on infrastructure. By doing this, we will be providing assistance which is equally as valuable to industries without making specific industries dependent on financial support from govof ernment and taxpayers. In other words, the Government should be doing what government should do, that is, spending money on roads and means of transport and not on aiding individual industries. As I said earlier, industry policy needs to be flexible. We do have a primary industry which supplies the domestic market. If that type of industry can be shown be efficient in relation to similar industries in other countries, and if those countries are providing those same industries conwith financial assistance and we run the of those goods being dumped in Auswe would be foolish not to provide some assistance for our own industries. If we do not do that, those subsidised products will be able to compete unfairly with products of our own domestic producers. The ultimate aim of any industry policy has to be to make our products more competitive on the overseas market. That cannot be done with tariff protection, suband the like. Those subsidies will discourage industry from looking for overseas markets and it should be remembered that there are no real beneficiaries pay of a tariff policy. The jobs. of the managers and the workers in protected industries become easy. They do not need to perform to their optimum level in order to stave off competition. In fact, they can' afford to be slack. They do not need to make an effort to export. The so-called benefits that those industries get from protection, of course, are borne by the rest of the nation. They are borne already by the ordinary people, who pay a premium price for the goods those protected industries provide, and they are borne indirectly by the exporters of other products which have no tariff protection or subsidy assistance. Australia's interests and the interests of the ordinary people of Australia are served best by the implementation of a policy of tariff reduction. This will give the benefits of cheaper goods for the people of this nation, produced by efficient firms, and greater volumes of exports in the long run by a more efficient export sector. We must not allow our resolve for these outcomes to be swayed by the uncooperative European and American markets. The benefits of less industry protection may not be easy to identify at present but they will be sizeable and lasting. It is to the credit of this Government that it has maintained a policy of reducing protection to industry. This has allowed and even compelled our secondary industries to become more efficient in order to compete on the domestic and world stage. It has been a big task. After decades of conservative politics and its ill-conceived but undying faith in protectionism we have become almost completely dependent on primary products. Those primary industries were paying for the protection we gave to secondary industry. It is granted, of course, that primary industry is something that we do well. But why stop there? Why did we not at that time teach our secondary industries that they, too, needed to be efficient in order to survive in a competitive world? The result of those policies placed our secondary industries decades behind our competitors. Had it not been for this Government, we would still be there. The policies of this Government are allowing industry to get on its feet. It is starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel as a competitor on international markets. In considering changes to industry policy we should be mindful of two concerns of a vast number of people in my electorate. The first is the vertical integration of industries by multinationals. Clearly, foreign investment is beneficial to Australia, but a point can be reached where we lose the benefit of that investment. If we allow these companies to control everything from primary production to the secondary treatment, shipment and eventual marketing overseas, we will be losing the benefits that that investment provides. If we allow an industry to develop a market stranglehold of a commodity, it will squeeze domestic producers out. It also raises the possibility of income which should come to Australia being piped off overseas to already powerful traders. The second concern is the question of resource security, about which I have some serious misgivings, particularly with regard to the forestry industry. I do not oppose resource security on an individual case basis. It is important that potential investors have some security that their investment is not going to be lost because of the whim of a government. Equally important, if not more important, however, is environmental security. If a rare endangered species or an area of valuable wilderness is found in one of those areas set aside for timber production, it must be saved. Resource security should be linked to a plantation policy by the company. I also have great difficulty coming to terms with the notion of a legally binding contract with the timber industry where the Commonwealth could be sued for the loss of area of production. The forests are, after all, owned by the people of Australia. I cannot fathom the idea that the people of Australia should be paying because they cannot supply those forests at some future date. For Australia to remain a successful world trader, it needs to enhance the current Government policies of reducing trade protection while protecting our own efficient industries. It needs to be well thought out and flexible. It needs to have vision. In that light, I am glad that the Prime Minister of this Government will make the industry policy statement next month, and not a Prime Minister from the parties opposite. Heaven knows what we would get then. I do not think that there is any real Opposition policy. The test of a government's mettle is in its ability to perform during difficult times. The fall in world commodity prices and a worldwide recessionary trend have made things difficult for the people of Australia and for the Government of Australia, but time and time again this Government has shown that it has the strength to make the hard decisions for the benefit of our long term future. I sit quite happily, and I am sure we on this side all do, to be judged during this difficult time by the people of Australia. Those opposite, whilst they can only manage to criticise, will stay firmly seated opposite. Families",66
44,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"MCPherson) (1.11)I assure the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) that the people of Australia would like him to be judged sooner rather than later. The family has long been recognised as the cornerstone of our society. Our laws, customs and social values revolve around the family. People always have, and always will have, children in order for mankind to survive as a race. Unfortunately, however, in Australia today children are becoming a luxury that many couples are finding it very difficult to afford. Today my grievance is for the Australian family. Just last night on the television news I saw footage of families: mothers, fathers and children going into a Melbourne mission seeking help, and a very tired and harassed clergyman insisted that he just could not keep up with the demands that he was getting for assistance. Since 1976-7\ family allowances have declined in real terms by 43 per cent, and the real value of the dependent spouse rebate has fallen by 37 per cent in the same period. Currently, taxpayers who support dependent children receive very little help at all through the tax system. The approach of this Government has been to treat children who are maintained by their parents as consumption goods that parents somehow purchase, in the same way that they may choose to purchase a car or home, if they can afford one. There appears to be no regard for the important role that children have in the future. In fact, it appears that those who choose to have children are expected to pay through the nose for the privilege of bringing up young Australians. Wages are not sensitive to family size, and the tax and social security systems make only token adjustments. Current disposable incomes do not allow families to live at the same standards as those of a single taxpayer who receives the same taxable income. The family unit has been neglected by this Government to such an extent that it is now under serious threat. Indeed, the hollow rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about child poverty rings in our ears as we constantly become aware of parents with children that they cannot afford to feed or clothe properly. It is not that these families are crying out for welfare; on the contrary, they just want a fair go. Since the introduction of tax concessions for children before World War II, and up to the mid-1980s, there has been a recognition that government has some responsibility to support dependent children through reduced taxation to families with dependent children. However, in 1987 the Australian Bureau of Statistics produced evidence that Australian society does not support families with children. This finding was part of the Bureau's fiscal incidence study, which was research aimed at documenting the overall interaction between taxation and social expenditure. The Bureau showed that there is no net assistance whatsoever to twoparent families with children. Everything that families with children get from the Government, they pay for fully in taxes, and that includes the cost of education. In fact, people who do not have children give no assistance at all to those who do. All the assistance that goes to less well-off families comes from other families. The largest transfer, that to parents who separate or divorce, comes from two-parent families. The three groups who benefit the most in our social security system are people without dependants, the elderly and parents who separate or divorce. It is not that these people may not be in some sense deserving but, ironically, the high incidence of divorce is often directly related to financial difficulties in the family. There are often positive disincentives for people to remain married when the welfare system makes alternatives more attractive. There is, as I said before, also a disincentive for couples to have children at a time when most economists agree that Australia needs to have a larger population. Economists and others cite the need for us to increase immigration levels in order to maintain population growth and age mix in the future. But surely a more attractive means of achieving this end would be to encourage more Australians to have children. Children are essential. Our population, as we know, is rapidly ageing and this problem, as is widely recognised, is going to present a huge problem for our welfare system in the medium term. I believe there are several ways that government could address this issue. One of the simplest ways is through taxation credits. Such taxation credits, I believe, would encourage two-parent families, both of whom are working, to have one partner choose to stay at home and manage the family. I hasten to say that I have got no qualms with the rights and the will of women to join the work force if they so choose. But it disturbs me very much that people who want to stay home and adopt a full-time parenting role-either men or women in that situation-are actually unable to do so because the family economy is such that they are both forced to seek employment in order to maintain a reasonable standard of living. Those people who support spouses and adult student children could receive a rebate equal, for example, to the standard unemployment benefit rate. There would be a cost to the public sector of supporting these dependants if they were not being maintained by taxpayers. There could be other tax credits for those who meet the social responsibilities for those dependent on them, such as child-care and education costs. I believe that a rebate in the pay as you earn system would not be difficult tp implement and the relief that it would provide for families would be enormous. In 1989, 51 per cent of children aged up to 14 years had both parents employed. Forty-two per cent had only one parent employed, and for 7 per cent neither parent was employed. The benefits of one partner staying at home, I believe, are tremendous for the rest of society. It means that a job is essentially vacated that might be filled by someone who is currently on unemployment benefits and wants to work. More than that, however, the social costs of poor parenting cannot be understated. Studies have frequently shown that children who lack proper parental supervision in their early years develop all sorts of problems that contribute to the crime rate, the divorce rate and the general breakdown of the family unit in future. Many of the patterns that we are creating within our current welfare system in fact are self-perpetuating. Currently,12 per cent of Australian children live in one-parent families. What the 1987 Australian Bureau of Statistics study showed was that there was, in fact, a subsidy for parents or couples who break up and a penalty for those who stay together. Single mothers-whilst we might be quite compassionate about their needs and the situation in which they find themselves, often through no fault of their own-are actually encouraged by the welfare system to remain single and, in fact, to have more children. Like all welfare, much of what we are doing today will affect the . way our children think tomorrow. It is self-perpetuating. If we encourage the fragmented family and provide disincentives to two-parent families, then surely the structure of our society as we know it will alter by degrees as we enter the next century. The Government-as far as I am concerned, still essentially stuck with socialist and humanist ideology-is, despite rhetoric to the contrary, anti-family. I am very proud to say that the Liberal-National parties recognise the importance of the family as the fundamental unit of society and our family action plan is a blueprint for a pro-family bias in our tax and social security systems. On top of that, our complete restructuring of the tax system and the introduction of a goods and services tax will be specially designed to ensure that families are no longer the net losers in the system. In this grievance debate today I want to say that I believe very strongly that it is time that the traditional role of the famlly was recognised by government and that families are given the economic benefits that they not only need, but also deserve. Wool Industry",69
45,Mr HULLS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"There are many hard working men and women in the wool industry in my electorate Kennedy who are understandably conthat cerned about the future of the wool dustry in Australia. The package of measures announced this week by the Minister for Primary Industries and ergy (Mr Kerin) will, I hope, stabilise the situation and ensure that recovery can begin. Hard decisions were necessary to address the critical situation facing growers across Australia. We all know that wool is of the utmost importance to our rural and national economy. It contributes about 25 per cent of the value of agricultural production. was, until the recent qrisis, our major port commodity, The wool industry is as old as the European occupation of this comes. country and its fortunes are indelibly linked with the fortunes of the nation a whole. For this reason, the idea of Ausessarily tralia riding on the sheep's back is deeply embedded in our national psyche. Every child in Australian history lessons still, am sure, learns the story of John and Elizabeth Macarthur and the birth of the Australian wool industry. Next year, after the centenary celebrations of the Australian Labor Party in Barcaldine, every Australian child will know the story of the great shearers' strike of the 1890s and the struggle for a share of the profits that led ultimately to the formation of the Labor Party. In the 1890s, the crisis involved the shearers' struggle for a share of the profits. Today, the wool industry as a whole is in the midst of another struggle and again it involves sharing the profits-and, this time around, sharing the losses as well. The Australian Wool Corporation has been around for a long time now. It began its operations in 1973 and since that time it has operated the reserve price scheme. The reserve price scheme functioned in conjunction with the wool tax on growers that was used to help finance the operation of the scheme and to market wool and wool products. As we all know, the scheme operated very successfully during the 1970s-so much so that, by the end of the 1980-81 season, the market support fund reached $492.9m. It was then decided to make the of market support fund a revolving fund so the growers' contributions to the fund incould be returned to growers. The first refund was made in the 1981-82 season when contributions from the 1974-75 seaEnson were returned. Each subsequent year until 1984-85, growers' contributions were refunded. By the end of the 1986-87 season, the market support fund had reached woolsome $1,150m and two seasons' contributions were refunded. Prices peaked in 1988 at around 1,250c. The increase in the floor price since 1986-87 has been a massive 71 per cent, so it was no wonder It that more and more farmers bought into exthe wool industry. It was booming, and the reserve price guaranteed healthy inWith hindsight, it is now easy to see as that the reserve price was no longer necreflecting world and local market conditions. This was perhaps recognised by the many Queensland wool growers who I voted against increasing the reserve price to 870c back in 1987. The high price for wool, and the high reserve price, encouraged an extraordinary rate of production that was exacerbated by unusually good seasons. China and the Soviet Union, two of our most important customers, then bailed out of the market. The Gulf crisis further constricted the market. In the meantime, cotton and manufactured fibres became more competitive. Wool is a special fibre that occupies a very special place in the marketplace. We may service 70 per cent of the fine wool market, but the critical competition is not wool versus wool, but wool versus other fibres. One of the fundamental problems with the Australian Wool Corporation's efforts to maintain the floor price by financing the stockpile is that prospective buyers finding the price of wool prohibitive have, in some cases, been forced to adjust to the use of cotton and manufactured fibres. This substitution must be halted. The crisis in the wool industry is one that is too important to play politics Livelihoods are at stake and the future of some country towns is also at stake. Tough decisions have now been made and it is incumbent upon all of us who are bona fide advocates for rural Australia generally, and the wool industry in particular, to pull together and restore certainty to the industry. Some members of the Queensland National Party areÂ· at odds with their Federal Leader on this point. Bob Katter junior, member for the Queensland state seat of Flinders, which is in my electorate, has been sayIng that as Australia is effectively the only fine wool producing country in the world, we should maintain the reserve price at any costat least I think that is what he is trying to say. As usual though, Mr Katter misses the point completely. We may dominate the world market in fine wool, but we do not dominate the world market in the production of high quality manufactured textiles and, as I said before, that is where the competition, like it or not, lies. Mr Katter has accused the Federal Government of undermining the wool industry. He should perhaps stop and listen for a moment to what his Federal National Party colleagues are saying. The Federal Opposition has recognised the seriousness of the situation and, as I understand it, has given conditional support to the proposed legislation that will suspend the reserve price scheme. Mr Katter should also stop and listen to what his own constituents have to say, instead of running around playing politics. There is an understandable sense of urgency among many of the wool growers that I have spoken to in my electorate. There is also a sense of having been let down, not by this Government but by their own industry leadership. When it became apparent recently that the Australian Wool Corporation was considering radical action, suspending sales and introducing its business plan, I was approached by many wool growers in my electorate. Nearly all of those wool growers that I spoke to acknowledged that there were valid argumentsÂ· for and against retaining the reserve price scheme. One with. grower from the Richmond district told me that there was a growing ground swell of disillusion with the Wool Corporation. He said the Corporation looked after, in his view, the interests of the big names in the industry at the expense of the smaller players. I was advised that the business plan prepared by the Corporation was not discussed or made available to grassroots wool growers. A number of growers argued for the retention of the reserve price. 'It has worked well for 18 years', they argued. Others basically in favour of maintaining the floor realised that it probably could not be retained in its present form. Others argued that a country like Australia just cannot afford to dictate market forces. They said that if we are to compete in the real world, we just cannot sit back and tell the world that it must buy our wool and that it must buy it at a specific price. I heard from wool growers in Longreach, Winton, Richmond, Cloncurry and Julia Creek. I spoke to previous members of the Wool Corporation and the United Graziers Association. I heard concerned, hard working women and men, whoargued rationally and without political point scoring for the need for some sort of action. Just about everyone agreed something had to be done. They called for strong leadership and direction. Virtually every grower I spoke to said that it was only this Minister who was able to supply that leadership. They said only he could take the tough decisions in the long term interests of the industry. I do not stand here saying that all wool growers in my electorate agree with the Minister's decision. They do not, and I will get the flak for that, and I am prepared to wear it. Nonetheless, growers know the Minister has made the decision in the interests of the industry. It astounds me that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has the hypocrisy to call for the resignation ()f the Minister when the Leader's own Party is supporting the Minister's decision. There seems to be a lot of confusion in the National Party about the decision to suspend the reserve price scheme, or maybe it is just Senator Boswell who is confused. Senator Boswell said yesterday on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio that the National Party has always supported a floor price-that is, until yesterday-and that now he does not have any problem voting for the legislationnot tl-at he supports the legislation, of course-and that the National Party is not split over the issue, although that is not to say there is unanimous support for the Government's decision. Senator Boswell insisted he was not confused at all. No wonder Queensland wool growers are disillusioned with the National Party. We must remain aware of the fact that this debate is being carried on in the eyes of the international community which is the marketplace. Stability is essential. Hard decisions are necessary. It is now essential, I believe, for the Australian Wool Corporation to play its part by at last grasping the nettle and producing an appropriate plan in conjunction with the Government to reduce its debt and the current stockpile. Only when this is done will stability return. For its part, the Government will contribute $300m towards a supplementary payments scheme to wool growers who sell their wool during the . remainder of the 1990-91 season. Like the product itself, the wool industry is resilient and will reassert itself and survive.",71
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Before I call the next speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy should withdraw his al1egation of hypocrisy against a member of the National Party.",73
47,Mr HULLS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes, I withdraw that statement. High Technology Manufacturing",73
48,Mr MCGAURAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Gippsland) (1.31)Mr Deputy Speaker, unlike some of your colleagues who sit in that chair, I have an immense respect for your even-handedness and willingness to call members of the Government to account in a way that is sadly lacking on other occasions. I wish to grieve today on the issue of high technology manufacturing. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, it was once envisaged that Australia's economic and industrial future would be charted by the development of a new generation of high technology manufacturing. These new industries were known as sunrise industries. They were vigorously promoted by the former Minister for Science and Technology, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), whose own sun, ironically, has now well and truly set. The substance, as it was, of this new hightech vision of the industrial future was a spin-off of the great advances in knowledge-based industries elsewhere in the world. Increasingly, over the course of the last two decades and more, successful economies have exploited, firstly, innovative product development; secondly, advanced and flexible manufacturing processes; and, thirdly, high return, small to medium volume, niche markets. Once there was a worthy vision of how Australia might escape its apparent dependence on low value-added high volume exports of raw resources by mimicking these developments. Once there was an image of Australia's thinly spread, poorly equipped, domestically oriented manufacturing sector being born anew. It would have its second chance as an innovative, flexible, knowledge-intensive industrial base upon - hich Australia's economy would rise and nse. Responsive to fast-moving market opportunities abroad and capable of adapting to new product designs or product innovation, it was anticipated Australia would at long last come to possess a gen-Â· uinely export-oriented advance manufacturing sector. This was an optimistic and traditionally liberal progressive view of the future. It is a view of the future I hope will still come to pass, but it is a vision which is increasingly elusive, increasingly out of reach and far from being realised. Governments have a right and a responsibility to chart futures for the nation, but they also have a duty to set in place . the various policies and programs at all levels which will drive that vision of the future. Futures are built not on wishing and talking, but on hard public policy work which will create the conditions for change. Regrettably, the Government betrayed its own vision of the future. It has been perfectly capable of talking about the future and about the potential of change to rebuild Australia. In fact, the Government is overburdened by talkersall who possess different visions, by the way-but it has been a government incapable of bringing change. I readily concede that the process of establishing the conditions for industry development, especially high technology industry development, is not easy. Sectoral industry strategies have their place, if carefully designed, but they need to feed off broader policy initiatives which address macro and micro policy settings. If this does not happen, if the overall across-economy conditions are not supportive of the secure investment climates and improved productivity, the chances of building up the real base for a particular industry or industry grouping will prove difficult indeed. Reports in today's Age of the conflict between the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) on this very matter attest to its importance. Indeed, we learn of a recent Cabinet meeting where the Treasurer sarcastically questioned the Minister for Science and Technology: 'Simon, why aren't you Minister for Industry if you are bringing this submission to Cabinet?'. We are not told what the reply by the Minister for .Science and Technology was, but he would at least have thought to himself: 'Well, I soon will be. This Ministry, this junior Ministry, is merely a stepping stone'. That was, of course, the import of the Treasurer's rhetorical question to him. Mr Deputy Speaker, I repeat: unless the tailored industry plans, especially the tailored sectorial plans for high-tech industries, are locked into a deeper competitive economic framework, little can be expected. Structural economic change in industry policy must be intertwined. Despite this being a truism for many, it is still a point lost on the Government. Let me give the House an example: Australia has great potential in various areas of the information related industry. As it is an area in which Australia has a trade deficit of $4 billion, expected to be $10 billion by 1996, it is also of critical economic significance. The Government has had in place an industry strategy designed to consolidate its areas of strength and provide the conditions for establishing smaller start-up companies within the domestic market. The objectives of this strategy are important, but that very strategy has been torn apart by the Government's failings on broader economic strategy. As the industry was struggling to gain its footing in a highly competitive market, it was hit by high interest rates and the recession. This has savagely damaged the fragile local industry, particularly the software and component sectors which depend on continuing demand from users. The disruption in demand caused by the recession is crippling these fledgling industries. Growth in the Australian information industry sector has been slashed by half as a result of the recession, representing a loss of $11.5 billion. How does the Government reconcile its deliberately engineered recession with the impact this will have on emerging local information related industries? Mr Taylor-It cannot.",73
49,Mr MCGAURAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As the honourable member for Groom so rightly points out, it cannot. Already, in the past year, the industry recorded its first drop in profits in 12 years. Its growth has fallen below the consumer price index at 5.7 per cent, investment has fallen 13 per cent and is still falling, imports massively outweigh exports-$444m versus $2.4 billion. Business spending on computer systems and networks is at an appallingly low 1.3 per cent and falling. Overseas companies spend up to 10 times this amount. The collapse of economic activity caused by the recession has also struck at the skills base in the industry. Though the long term skills needs of the industry are formidable, the irony is now that computer programmers and others skilled in the computer sciences are being retrenched. As an example of this, witness the closure of the Commonwealth funded Victorian computer industry training course which was terminated because it was-and I quote from the December Bulletin of the Australian Computer Society-'an unfortunate casualty of the recession' . Again, I pose the question: how does the Government reconcile the need to maintain and develop the skills base for the information sector with its economic policies which are driving the computer programmers onto the unemployment queues? Of course, the recession has also slugged a myriad other high technology related industries, too. Black and Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd pulled up stakes from its high-tech Croydon plant in Melbourne in late January, preferring to import its power tool product rather than manufacture locally. Black and Decker was doing everything right: it had enlightened, experienced management which had put in place a coherent technology and business strategy; it incorporated advanced management training; it was a state of the art plant which used robotic production lines; it had a reputation for keeping its overheads down and extracting every efficiency possible; and it produced a product which retained its commercial prominence because of a constant push to improve quality and design standards. In short, it was the sort of high-tech plant which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, dreams about at night. It was the sort of plant we need to clone and see take root in the economy by the hundreds. But it went under. Why? It could not compete on a costs basis with internationally manufactured products. The company could not win the big international contracts because it was uncompetitive on price. Why? According to its former Managing Director, :Kevin Cashman, falls in protection were taking place without offsetting or compensating microeconomic reforms. Moreover, he pointed out there had been no improvements in labour costs. The costs of operating in the domestically operated transport network, especially the waterfront, had robbed the company of its price competitiveness. In addition to these micro level difficulties, Black and Decker was hit by macro-economic disadvantages, such as prolonged periods of high interest rates and high exchange rates. What chance did it have to perform? Mr Deputy Speaker, this is not an unusual or atypical story. Australian firms do not need handouts, they simply want to be free from basic inefficiencies in the economy. Plenty of studies indicate the difficulties in competing on price as a major obstacle in winning a bigger share of export markets-a point with which Kevin Cashman of Black and Decker would no doubt concur, as would many others in the industry.",75
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr us Scott}-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Sunscreens,75
51,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker, in the limited time. I have I would like to bring to the attention of this House the fact that most Australians would have noticed and felt the pinch of the outrageously high price of broad spectrum block-out sunscreen this summer. In Australia's climate, and with our high incidence of sun cancer, sunscreen is now being marketed and priced as a luxury item when it should be classified as a necessity for daily life. Two out of every three Australians will develop skin cancer. More than 140,000 people already have skin cancer, and 1,000 people die from the disease in Australia each year. The skin cancer mortality rate is higher in men than in women and the incidence of melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, is rising at a rate of five to six per cent per year. According to our Australian Cancer Society, melanoma is the third most common cancer in women and the fifth most common cancer in men. It is also the most common cause of cancer death in 30-to 40-year-old persons. There are plenty of campaigns warning Australians of the dangers of the sun and the necessity to wear sunscreens to avoid skin cancer. Most Australians want to follow this advice, until they go to buy sunscreen and discover just how unaffordable and unrealistic the prices of most of the products are. The Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, in conjunction with the Victorian State Government's Office of Prices, has put out a brochure entitled, 'How not to get burnt buying sunscreens'. The brochure states: Sunscreens are often sold like cosmetics with a high price and lots of promotion . . . Some $5 million will be spent by the larger manufacturers to promote their sunscreen products. Not all of this goes to promote the most effective products or to ensure people are aware of the risks of excessive tanning. Last year the New South Wales Cancer Council decided to produce its own sunscreen following many complaints from the public about the high cost of sun block-out products. Consequently, the Cancer Council produced a 125 gram tube of factor 15 broad spectrum block-out sunscreen for $3.50 and a 2.5 litre pump pack for $40. Unfortunately, these products are available only from the New South Wales Cancer Council by mail order or by going to the Cancer Council's office in Sydney. Although the New South Wales Cancer Council is looking at extending the outlets from which their sunscreens can be bought, no decision has yet been made to go ahead with this. How can families struggling on low incomes afford to spend a minimum of $7.49 for a small bottle of sunscreen for their children, often up to twice a week? These people want to protect their families and themselves by purchasing the most effective products, but often they find they cannot afford such luxury items. The New South Wales Cancer Council said that if cheaper sunscreens are labelled as having a sun protection factor, or SPF, of 15 and as being broad spectrum, they would have to be as effective as the most expensive brands because there are very strict compliance standards in, Australia for sunscreen manufacturers. People do not have to get sunburnt to develop skin cancer. It is the cumulative effect of years of exposure of UVA and UVB that causes the common types of skin cancer we know about. We need only stay in the sun for a fraction of the time it takes for our skin to go red to get a dose of UVA and UVB potent enough to start damaging the skin's cells. A tan does not prevent skin cancer. It is the attempt to develop and maintain a tan that has caused the current epidemic of skin cancer in Australia. If more people could afford sunscreens, more people would use them and, hopefully, more people would avoid skin cancer. According to the position paper by the Australian Cancer Society, the cost to the community of treatment of skin cancers and related lesions varies between $ 100m and $400m annually. Medicare estimates that a minimum of $15m was paid out in benefits in 1989-90 for the treatment of skin cancer. Unfortunately, the exact total cost to Medicare for skin cancer treatment is extremely difficult to gauge as the removal of non-cancerous skin lesions are included with the figures for skin cancer treatment. I would like to stress that the only people benefiting from the new era in skin cancer awareness are the doctors and the manufacturers of sunscreen who appear to be producing their products as cheaply as possible, but then charging exorbitant prices for them at a consumer level. I believe the relevant Ministers now should look into this grave problem facing our society and the Prices Surveillance Authority should hold an official inquiry into the outrageous price of sunscreens in Australia. I commend the Local Government Association of New South Wales, which I have written to and which is going to take on board the distribution of sunscreen pro ducts on behalf of the New South Wales branch of the Cancer Council. I commend it for this initiative and I hope in the future, particularly in New South Wales, more people will have the New South Wales Cancer Council product available to them for purchase. It is, as honourable members would realise, a lot cheaper than the product they can purchase now.",75

53,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A couple of weeks ago I pointed out in a communiable cation to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) jecting. that Australia had the opportunity to take a major lead in the Gulf oil spill clean-up by offering to Saudi authorities an Australian made 100 per cent organic anticoagulant product, Sokerol, manufactured at Tin Can Bay in Queensland. Instead, we had a low-key announcement that a Cairns jecting. based and New Zealand managed company was to provide supplies of a German backed and United States developed perate product, Elastol, held in that city. I also informed that Sokerol management was approached by Elastol management inquiring whether Sokerol could be mixed with Elastol to enhance the latter's sorbent qualities. It seems to me that Elastol has some deficiencies. Australia is missing a golden opportunity to utilise a proven domestic product, Sokerol, which is already accepted under North Atlantic Treaty Organisation standards, and that the national economic and international environmental benefits are being lost I ask the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) a couple of very basic questions: what is the Government doing to assist Australian enterprise to make its contribution in correcting this environmental disaster, and are not Australian made products good enough?

It is not uncommon for residents to lose telephone service for days at a time. in conFor example, if the exchange lines go be down on a Thursday, there is no prospect conof having them fixed over the weekend and .the community is completely isolated .. Tel-com's answer in the past has been to deduct the time the service was not operatingÂ· frpm the rental portion of people's accounts. If an emergencY' occurs, there is no way help can be obtained from outside the valley by phone. This is a small,isolated rural community that does not even: have a resident doctor. I find it amazing that in an era of satellite communications a rural community can be so disadvantaged because of antiquated exchange equipment. There are agricultural businesses in the area working hard to establish markets overseas-and I say working hard because they are trying to make contacts and get their names known without the benefit of international subscriber dialling and fax facilities. Imagine the furore that would occur if a city business was not able to have access to these facilities that are taken for granted by so many people.

Ex-players and officials from all over Australia will come together to relive the deeds of the Wondai Football Club. They will recall the day in 1970 that Wide Bay played the touring Great Britain rugby league team at Wondai. They will remember those players who went on to play for the district, Brisbane, Queensland and, of course, Australia. They will also remember a young fellow who did not stay long as he moved away with his parents; this is the town that gave Mal Meninga a taste of rugby league football. The reunion grew from a small group wanting to meet some old friends to a much larger gathering. On Saturday night, 500 people will attend a dinner. Over the weekend functions will be held, to celebrate. one of the driving forces in South Burnett football. The love of football has also led to wider community involvement by the people of this district. I congratulate the organisers of this important event for the Wondai district and wish them well in promoting the game of rugby league. I am sureÂ· that with this continued support we will see many more great footballers come from the Wondai district. Payroll Tax",79
65,Mr COWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In March, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is to make a statement on the economic situation in Australia. I appeal to him, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Government to look very closely indeed at the effect of the payroll tax in each of the States of Australia. In the early 1970s the Commonwealth passed back to all the States the responsibility for payroll tax. It is a very important source of income for the States. But the fact today is that it is a tax upon employment, a tax upon salary and is certain to have a most disastrous effect on the cost of industry . I could stand here and name types of industries and names of industries that have been severely affected, and many have gone completely out of operation. I appeal to the Government to look at the tax system generally within Australia so that the States can lift the tax, thereby assisting industry within the country to compete with other countries around the world. The effect has been particularly disastrous in New South Wales where a concession has been taken away from manufacturing in country areas. I know that within my electorate of Lyne a number of the industries are putting pressure upon me and the local State members of parliament concerning the matter. It is a most important one.",79

67,Mr WEST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, in the Gulf war the air and missile strikes intensify as a ghastly ground war grows daily more imminent. Now civilian casualties are compounding as exemplified by the fiery deaths of hundreds in a Baghdad shelter. And as the probably of a protracted air and ground war increases, so too does the risk of war aims being expanded beyond the liberation of Kuwait to the invasion and destruction of Iraq. The longer the war, the greater the magnitude of postwar problems and the more difficult it becomes to solve them. Now is the time to push for settlement. Sooner or later there must be a negotiated peace, so why not now? Even as the United Nations Security Council now meets and as the economic missiles of the Gulf war also strike countries including this country, Australia must more forcibly demand, along with other nations including Iran and the Soviet Union, a peace packagea peace package which can be put forward which includes Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, an international peace conference to progress an Israeli-Arab settlement and a regional security arrangement that can obtain secure borders throughout the Middle East for all Middle East and Persian Gulf nations.

Adelaide Peace Rally Mr JOHN SCOTI' (Hindmarsh)- Mr Speaker, the Adelaide Advertiser, a Murdoch publication, effectively censored a peace rally of over 10,000 people in Adelaide on 19 January. I wrote to the editor but he refused to publish my letter. My letter was as follows: Dear Sir, I must complain over what I consider to be censorship. The failure of the Advertiser on Monday 21 st January 1991 to report on one of Adelaide's biggest Rallies for Peace held on Saturday 19 January, 1991, can only be construed as censorship. In times of war censorship of vital military information can be justified, but to attempt to ignore the fact that over 10,000 concerned citizens of this State marched for Peace must be a new low even for the Advertiser.

They were placed in the very difficult position of having to determine what was acceptable behaviour and what was not. They were constantly under pressure in removing people who went too far across the guidelines. Of course, if that kind of behaviour were to happen always in the gallery it would put at risk the right of that the public even to participate in the parliamentary situation. I thought the Courier-Mail put it well when it said: Parliamentary democracy is badly served by the intervention in the chambers of extraneous people. Public galleries are there for observation, not participation. Arguments are not won by the level of noise generated but by the logic and common sense. Ballots depend on votes, not decibels.

72,Mr HAWKE,MIDDLE EAST,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have seen the reports of this horrifying incident and I have been briefed this morning by our intelligence people. Obviously, like everyone in this chamber, I have been moved by these tragic and unnecessary deaths. As I said only yesterday, honourable members will recall, we have feared that many innocent civilians would be killed in this war. I also said that allies have targeted military and strategic targets and have done all they could minimise civilian casualties. I can say the Leader of the Opposition that from the evidence I have seen and from the evidence I have been given this morning, I accept that this attack was mounted by the allies only after they had legitimately and justifiably concluded that the inindustry. tended target was of military significance. Obviously I can say to the honourable gentleman that I was concerned to get full a briefing as I possibly could on this matter because I know that all honourable members would share the concern that I feel-and that I know the Leader of the Opposition would feel-about the deaths of so many civilians. I repeat to the honourable gentleman that, on the basis of the briefing I have been given, I believe that it was legitimately and justifiably concluded that this was a target of tary significance.

NA NA  tion of the Minister for Transport and Communications been drawn to calls for a further liberalisation of Australia's aviation regime? If so, is the Minister able to provide information to the chamber on what action, if any, the have reGovernment intends to take?",81
73,Mr BEAZLEY,AGREEMENTS,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I have a number of calls for liberalisation, effectively unilaterally by Australia, of our bilateral avjation agreements-or, indeed, abandonment of the process of bilateral international aviation agreements-by the Opposition spokesmen in the aviation area, tourism area and others, based on a document to that effect from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. That extract from the OECD as report on tourism policy and international tourism is a fanciful reflection of a utopian world. It ignores the reality that the all countries with any aviation industry to speak of trade aviation rights bilaterto ally. Within that framework, enormous to liberalisation is taking place around the globe; nevertheless, the bilateral framework remains intact. No country walks away from that position because all countries recognise that to do so unilaterally would massively disadvantage their own We as a Government are in no way embarrassed by our record in providing as opportunities for the tourism industry through the international aviation sector. When we came into office, there were, under bilateral agreements, some 24 services operating international airlines into Australia. That has risen to 40. In the year ending June 1990, 8.6 million international passengers travelled into and out of Australia, but, because of the arrangements that we had come to under those milibilateral arrangements, capacity was this agreed at 17.1 million. Twice as much capacity was agreed to under international aviation arrangements as was actively utilised in entering into Australia. More than five million additional seats have been negotiated by this Government over the past four years. I think it would assist honourable members if I were to table a document that has been given to me by my Department which details the capacity which is available and the extent to which this is taken up. I think if honourable members take a look at this document they will see that there is a massive supply of capacity under those arrangements in comparison with what has been taken up. Also, if honourable members and others study this document now that it is available, they will have questions to ask the tourism industry as to why it does not target more innovatively those countries to which capacity is available. For example, it is a source of disappointment that in a place such as India effectively all operations have been hauled off and there is no encouragement for Indian citizens to enjoy the benefits of tourism here. When one contemplates the fact that there are at least 30 million Indians who-by any standard appropriate in this country-are well off, there is a substantial opportunity there for people to take that up. I think the time has come in this debate for some serious attention to be paid by the tourism industry and other complainants, such as the Opposition spokesman, to study what is actually available and start to target tourist activities to that availability, instead of constantly blaming the Government, which has negotiated such wonderful opportunities for them through those bilateral aviation arrangements. On top of the bilateral aviation arrangements is a whole raft of liberalised charter policy, which is also being applied and which is important when servicing areas that are not necessarily wellserviced by regular carriers. I have a further point on this matter, and that is theÂ· question of prudent management of our airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, with regard to the policies that are now applied to its partial privatisation. Quite evidently, if anybody were to go through a process of almost uniquely unilaterally tossing over bilateral aviation arrangements, probably the dumbest point at which one could consider doing that would be at the point at which one intends to sell a substantial portion of one's airline. I note that the Opposition has a policy of privatising not just 49 per cent of Qantas, but 100 per cent. If this reflects the Opposition's tactical approach to how it proposes to dispose of that-that despite the fact that there is double the capacity actually being utilised in bilateral aviation arrangements it will nevertheless encourage subsequent purchasers of Qantas to enter a field which we have decided will unilaterally disadvantage Qantas-it says a great deal about the systematic way in which the Opposition has approached its own attitude to the question of privati sing that operation. As I said at the outset, I hope that honourable members will take the opportunity to study those figures and talk to tourist authorities about the opportunities that are being presented in this area which are simply not being taken up. NA",81
74,Mr TIM FISCHER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I refer the Treasurer to a statement he made in Parliament on Tuesday, when he said: Under this Government people can go out and apply for jobs with a reasonable expectation of getting one. In view of today's figures showing that unemployment has increased by almost a quarter of a million people in the last year and in view of the story which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald showing a 16.1 per cent increase from last year in the number of people registered as unemployed with Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) offices in New South Wales, can the Treasurer tell these people just what kind of 'reasonable expectation' they shouLd have about finding another job in the current climate? Again, what went wrong and, incidentally, when was the last time the Treasurer spoke to an unemployed person in the electorate?",82
75,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,The last series of points the honourable member made about the CES offices is simply wrong. ./ That part of his question is dead wrong. What I said was that in the Government's period of office people could go out. and reasonably expect to get a job. With the creation of one and a quarter million jobs how could he attempt to claim that was not true?,82
76,Mr HAWKE,UNEMPLOYMENT,One and a half million.,83
77,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The Prime Minister has handed me the figure. Since April 1983, 1.57 million jobs have been created. Yet the Leader of the National Party has the hide to get up and ask these questions. That is about five times the employment growth in a seven-year period that the Opposition was able to manage. Why would I not be entitled to claim that people in this country have been able to get up and seek a job with a reasonable expectation of getting one? Of course, they have because we have had record employment growth and record participation. That is by people in the work force looking for work, both men and women, but particularly women. Today's employment figures show that employment fell by 29,000. That is to be regretted. In the previous month, in December, it rose by 26,000. Employment has fallen by 3,000 since November, which means quite a number of people have been out there seeking and getting jobs in the meantime. Does the Opposition want to talk about comparing similar episodes? In the year to March 1983 when the Opposition was in office employment fell by 187,000. In the year to January 1991 employment fell by 39,000; yet it fell by 187,000 in the Opposition's last year.

79,Mr LES SCOTT,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"Has the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs seen media reports of an alleged drinking binge in the town, of Wiluna in Western Australia? Are those claims correct?",83
80,Mr TICKNER,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his question. As honourable members would be aware, I have attempted to go to great political lengths to avoid cheap political point scoring in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. I assure the House that I intend to continue in that mode. As I answer this question, I wish to commend the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs and the Leader of the Opposition for their constructive role in attempting to work with the Government to find common ground in relation to the proposal for a council for Aboriginal reconciliation. Having said that, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by the honourable member for Chisholm's recent media release and some of the publicity that occurred both before and after that news release. The shadow Minister accused the Government of 'gross irresponsibility with the lives of a group ofWestern Australian Aborigines'. He alleged that Aboriginal people in the Western Australian town of Wiluna had gone on 'a drinking binge' after receiving a combined tax refund of $128,000. He said that this was a disgraceful state of affairs. The comments were apparently based on a news report by a commercial television station in Perth. It is somewhat unfortunate that the honourable member did not check the facts before making his statement. The honourable member for Chisholm said in his release, and some media outlets reported, that 'the Government handed over $128,000 in tax refunds without a thought to the consequences'. He said it was inconceivable that no-one 'in Treasury' realised the damage that could have been inflicted on this community by such a huge tax refund. The honourable member for Chisholm said that the community received 'normal benefits in the form of food vouchers'. The first point to be made to the honourable member for Oxley is that the Treasury does not administer the tax Act. That is, of course, a matter for the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner of Taxation. More importantly, contrary to the allegation made, the Wiluna community has not received food vouchers for normal benefits. Let us be clear that this was hot a case of a government benefit being paid to an Aboriginal community. This was not what Channel 7 disparagingly called a handout. This was 'a payment to a group of Australian people of their tax refunds; to which they were legally entitled and which they are entitled to spend in any way they see fit, as can every member of the Australian community. It was a refund of an overpayment of tax paid as a result of employment by these people in community enterprises. The honourable member for Chisholm said: A discussion should have been held with Aboriginal community leaders on what could be done with the money to benefit the community before it was handed over. With respect, this Government is not, and should never be, in the business of telling any group of people how to spend their tax refunds. This applies as much to Aboriginal Australians as it does to every other Australian. J want to refer with great approval to the words of Gordon Bryant, quoted with approval by the Leader of the Opposition in the condolence motion on Tuesday. These were Gordon Bryant's words: We cannot, however, decide for the Aborigines what they want. And if we supply too often what we think they need, we may be wasting our resources and delaying their real progress. rigines must regain autonomy and a sense of control over their lives and future. I agree with those sentiments. The Wiluna matter deserves to be set straight. On receipt of the money in question members of the community paid many thousands of dollars into a community store for payment of accounts owing and into other community enterprises. Other amounts were used to purchase clothes, cars, bicycles and toys. Many thousands of dollars were saved. Yes, it is true that a group of people in that community spent an amount of money-what some people might regard as an excessive amount of money-on alcohol at the local hotel. The fact is that alcoholism is, of course, a very serious problem in a number of Aboriginal communities, as it is in non-Aboriginal communities. This is an issue that is being tackled by the Government, with the support of the Opposition and with the support of Aboriginal community health workers. It is a complex problem. It is not one that can be quickly solved. Most importantly, it is not one that can be solved by selecting one group of people in society and denying them the legal payment of their tax refunds. Most importantly, it is not a cause which is served by the making of statements that are inaccurate and which compound false community prejudices and stereotypes about Aboriginal Australians. NA",83
81,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMY,"My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister recognises that bankruptcies have increased by 56 per cent in the last year.

Did those opposite have )lnything to say then? They were mute, as they should have been. They should have been ashamed of the fact that their record in the creation of jobs was so abysmally poor that this Government, with this Treasurer, created jobs not only four times faster than they did when they were in office but almost twice as fast as the erage for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. There was not a word then. It is not surprising that there was that silence, because their record was so appalling. I have given an account to this House of why these steps were necessary to slow down demand in this country, and unfortunately why, necessarily associated with those actions, there has been a rise in unemployment. I have made the point that this Government would have been the more irresponsible if in fact we had not been prepared to face up to the hard decisions. It was a hard decision to take the decisions we did to increase interest rates, to tighten monetary policy, to meet the challenge confronting us. But let me conclude by saying that the Leader of the Opposition comes to the dispatch box and asks this question, fresh from his fiscal triumph of backing down on the War Memorial's decision to raise funds for admission charges.

She said they had met at the War Memorial Council meeting on 23 November last year and had made their decision to charge fees on the basis that they would have agreement from both sides of politics. So Dame Beryl rang Dr Hewson to tell him about this decision that was going to raise money. She told me this in the context of making it quite clear that she believed that my Government had been extraordinarily generous to the War Museum. She thinks we have been very generous, and that the decision to charge fees was no reflection on the Government; they wanted to do some extra things. What happened in the conversation was very interesting. Dr Hewson responded and said, 'It is a jolly good idea'. But that was not the end of the conversation. Dame Beryl thought perhaps she should contact Senator Jocelyn Newman. Dame Beryl said, 'Shall I contact Senator Newman?'. And what was the immortal reply of this Leader of the Opposition? He said, 'Don't worry, I'll look after Newman.' Well, the Leader of the Opposition looked after Newman. She did you like a dinner, Professor.

90,Mrs JAKOBSEN,ECONOMY,"My question is to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services. Is the Minister aware of media reports alleging that Australia's system of drug regulation is unduly impeding new therapies needed by the Australian community? Is the Minister concerned about the accuracy of these reports?",85
91,Mr STAPLES,ECONOMY,"I thank the honourable member for Cowan for her question. Yes, there has been a spate of media stories and statements by various people, who are often representatives of drug companies, alleging Australians are being disadvantaged by our drug evaluation process. Claims have been made that Australia's drug evaluation process is too slow and requires unnecessary information from drug companies. I am concerned that we are now witnessing a growing trend of drug evaluation by media interview and by conference speech rather than by medical and scientific analysis. Of greater concern to me is that this drug evaluation by med'is is so often based on a serious lack of depth of analysis of how and why the drug evaluation' processes of Australia and other countries are as they are. Every drug evaluation system has to achieve a balance. of highest confidence in the safety of product against claimed or demonstrated benefits. Dr Bob Woods-Is that why we wai t six or seven years?",86
92,Mr STAPLES,ECONOMY,"I will come back to that in a minute. Let me look at some of the claims. The most common assertion is that Australia's drug evaluation process causes unnecessary delays .. 'Delays' are primarily related to the evaluation process in Australia. It is very much a decision of when individual companies decide where and when they apply to market new products in. the world, but of course that was not explained by the manufacturers or by recent ni-dia stories. It is also very difficult to make international comparisons, but it does appear when one considers the date of application that Australia is not out of step with comparable countries in terms of the time it takes for new products to get through the evaluation process. A recent report on the 7.30 Report referred to products being under evaluation for up to 10 years. The time involved is usually due to inadequate applications. One drug mentioned was erythropoietin, which has been the subject .of many representations by honourable members. It has been delayed because of the inability or the unwillingness of the company involved to provide answers to an important safety matter, despite repeated requests over a long period. Opponents of our drug evaluation system like to leave the impression that the Australian system had at no time protected the Australian community from unsafe products, and there are those who argue that we should just accept the evaluation processes of other countries. So let me give the House an example. Zimelidine is a drug for treating depression. It was licensed in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1981 and in Sweden in 1982. A general marketing application was rejected in Australia in 1983 on the grounds of safety, and later that year that drug was withdrawn worldwide because of the incidence of convulsions, liver damage and neuropathy. I shall mention another couple of examples: benoxaprofen was licensed for sale in the United States of America (USA), the UK and Canada. Australia's Drug Evaluation Committee rejected the application on safety grounds and it was subsequently withdrawn worldwide because of liver toxicity. Osmosin was licensed in the UK and the USA. It was rejected by Australia's drug evaluation process and not was subsequently withdrawn worldwide because of a high incidence of gut perforation. . They are clear examples, only. but a few, of what Australia's drug evaluation has done to protect not only Australian citizens but also people right around the world. That does not mean that we will not be working to minimise delay, but we will not do it at the expense of the health and confidence of the .Australian consumer. At the moment Europeancountries are working to harmonise their drug evaluation requirements as they move towards that single market in 1992. We will be watching that process and the developments in other countries. We already have reciprocal agreements with several countries. However, we are not looking for regulation for the sake of regulation or cost control. Our drug evaluation processes give Australians probably the greatest confidence in the safety and efficacy of drugs of any people in the world. We will continue to streamline our drug evaluation processes, but this Government will not allow 17 million Australians to unwittingly become guinea pigs for drug companies and have to pay for the privilege of it at the same time.

93,Mr REITH,AUSTRALIA,"I refer the Treasurer to an interview that he gave with John Laws last November 1990 in regard to the State Bank of Victoria when he said: The other State Banks are just not in the same position because they have never had a Tricontinental, they have never had a merchant banking arm losing a couple of billion dollars. I ask the Treasurer: given the fact that the Reserve Bank of Australia has a supervisory role and that there were numerous press reports about the level of bad debts within the State Bank of South Australia and its wholly owned Beneficial Finance Group, why was he unaware of the problems facing these institutions back in November?",87
94,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"I do not recall that Beneficial Finance Group has a couple of billion dollars in bad debts or that it is the principal cause of the problems o(the State Bank of South Australia; it is a contributing cause. It has had a finance armBeneficial Finance; it has losses, which is not unusual in the current climate for a number of finance companies that .tend on riskier business at higher margins. What I said then was substantially correct. The only thing I could add to that, having been apprised of the fact that the State Bank is now looking at loss provisioning of the order of $1 billion, is that Beneficial Finance obviously played some role in that, but as I understand it, the preponderance of that role has been played by the State Bank. I am not responsible: that is, I am not the shareholder in the State Bank of South Australia. Mr Downer"""":""""""You are the Treasurer. Dr Woods-You are the regulator.",87
95,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order! The honourable member for Mayo and the honourable member for Lowe will cease interjecting. NA  the Minister for Transport and Communications. Can the Minister advise the House of the progress in the sale of Aussat?,87
96,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSSAT,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, the process is proceeding very well. The legislative product of that will be obvious in this place in the next couple of months. Expressions of interest were lodged with the Department by 11 January 1991. More than 30 responses have been received, including from a significant number of well known international telecommunications companies. The Government is also very pleased to have received submissions from major Australian industrial and financial companies, .with many indicating that they were in the process of forming consortia to bid for Aussat. A few overseas corporations which previously showed interest have withdrawn. The Government does not consider that these withdrawals in any way jeopardise the successful completion of the sale process; they were anticipated. There are now in the international telecommunications business a substantial number of opportunities to buy into the processes that we are going through here; indeed there are opportunities to. buy into monopoly situations which are effectively privatising themselves. So it was to be anticipated that a number of companies would pull out. We are pleased that there is a substantial number left in. We expect very serious competition. in this process as we thin those numbers down to several from which we ultimately intend to get the successful purchaser of Aussat. NA NA",87
97,Mr REITH,AUSTRALIA,"My question without notice is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement in the House that after he found out about the financial circumstances of the State Bank of South Australia on 31 January, he said-and I quote from his answer: I then spoke to the Governor. I told him Premier Bannon had told me and he said that yes, he had been aware of some deterioration the quality of the Blink's book, that the Reserve Bank had tried to get some guide as to Bank's book was performing . . . When did the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia first know about the financial problems of the State Bank of South Australia? Why did the Governor not inform the Treasurer of his concerns earlier?",88
98,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"I do not know when he knew and he is not bound to inform me of his concerns. He is charged under a statute to operate the Reserve Bank Australia as its Governor, with a board. Included in its operations is this notion of the supervision of the banking system and the voluntary supervision of these State banks. But there is a notion develsponse, oping that in some way the Reserve Bank of Australia is responsible for losses private banks. On this day there will be some bank lending money. A commercial loan will probably be taking place today, maybe this hour. Of what interest is that to Governor, to the Reserve Bank Board, or to me and how can we know, other than for the general prudential standards of book? Now, in the event that that loan turns bad, that can have nothing to do with Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank, as the Governor said in his own speech: In a sense shareholders are expected to look themselves, caveat investor. We are not charged with protecting banks from losing money . . . So one has to understand what 'supervitaken sion' is about. But this notion of the honourable member opposite that superdo vision is a responsibility on the part the Reserve Bank so that banks do not lose money is of course rubbish. NA NA",88
99,Mr WRIGHT,QUEENSLAND,"I direct my question without notice to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services. I refer the Minister to the public concern that has been expressed by the Premier of what Queensland, Wayne Goss, and the Minin ister for Education, Paul Braddy, and also to the representations that have been made how the to the Government by Queensland Federal members regarding the inadequacy of university places in that State in comparison with other States. I ask: what action is being taken to try to give Queensland a fairer share-that is, for 1991-and what action or plans are afoot to ensure that we are able to increase our share in future years?",88
100,Mr BALDWIN,QUEENSLAND,"I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his question. It is true that there has been a degree of of public controversy of late about the level of growth in higher education in Queensland. Some concerns have been expressed by the Queensland Premier and Queensland Minister. Just by way of reI think it is worth pointing out, firstly, that the Commonwealth does acof knowledge that Queensland does require a share of growth in excess of its population's share. I think Queensland accounts for some 17 per cent of the country's at population. For 1991, we are allocating the 25 per cent of higher education growth and, over the course of the 1991-93 triennium, we are allocating, I think the figure its is, 23 per cent of growth to Queensland. So we do acknowledge that there are some special factors operating in Queensland that warrant it receiving a share of growth the above its share of population. I think it is also important to stressand this is something which has not been after adequately recognised by either the Queensland Premier or the Minister-that there is a range of factors that have to be into consideration when making decisions about higher education growth. We have a process in order to arrive at of these decisions which involves extensive consultations with the States. It involves taking into account a range of factors. Those include present unmet demand; the rate of year 12 retentions; and the prospective population growth and prospective trends in participation. Really, a number of States could choose to take selectively certain of those factors and mount a case for greater growth. One has to look at all the factors-and I would point out that Queenslanders, in particular, have been focusing on the unusually high rate of year 12 retentions in Queensland and the consequent relatively low rate of transfer from year 12 to higher education. That is one indicator. It is nificant; we acknowledge that; and in consequence of acknowledging that, we are gi ving Queenslanders a greater share than their population share of higher education growth places. I might also just conclude that the Commonwealth has indicated to the Queensland Government that we are prepared to look at that matter again within the context of post-school education more generally, including T AFE. One really needs to consider these things in conjunction. Queensland has a relatively poor record in providing TAFE places, and that is an issue that needs to be addressed also and one needs to consider that together with the argument for or against further growth in higher education. We have allocated growth for the current triennium. We have a rolling triennial system for allocating growth places in higher education. That system is one which has been very well received and is generally well regarded throughout the system, and it would take a very strong case indeed for us to start fiddling around with those triennial growth allocations at this point.

101,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIA,"I ask the Treasurer: is it a fact that the State Bank of South Australia failed, as agreed, to pre-notify the Reserve Bank or failed to take account of the Reserve Bank's views about its loans totalling more than 30 per cent of its capital to one corporate borrowing group? If so, will the Treasurer inform the House why that did not start alarm bells ringing in the Reserve Bank, in his office, in his department or in his head?",89
102,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"Again there is the notion that I am supposed to walk around with a weekly understanding of the transactions and elements of books of each bank.

107,Mr SPEAKER,LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,I think the honourable member's time might be up.,89
108,Mr HARRY WOODS,LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Will the Minister inform the House of recent changes in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) industry in Australia? Will the Minister respond to reports that some LPG is being exported for sale in overseas domestic markets at prices lower than the price in Australia?,89
109,Mr GRIFFITHS,LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"I thank the honourable member for Page, your esteemed excellency. Export prices for LPG to our major market in Japan, as many honourable members are aware, closely follow world LPG prices. Most domestic producer prices also now reflect that indicator. However, in the past there may have been cases where shipments, particularly of butane, which I stress were only surplus to Australian market requirements, were exported at prices somewhat below average world market prices. This is certainly not the case at present, as some press reports would have it. IÂ· am informed that our LPG exports are commanding a premium above average world prices. Allegations that LPG is being sold overseas at prices cheaper than in Australia overlook a number of important factorsfor example, insurance costs, freight charges, distribution costs and so on. By way of comparison, metropolitan retail LPG prices in Japan range from A60c per litre for autogas to $A1.30 for LPG cylinders, which, as honourable members will be aware, is well in excess of Australian prices. With prices rising internationally quite rapidly in the latter half of 1990, LPG exports are set to make a significant positive contribution to our balance of payments. In the context of the first part of the question from the honourable member for Page, the liquefied petroleum gas industry was deregulated in relation to both prices and exports from 1 January 1991, and from that date the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) ceased to determine the maximum wholesale prices which producers charge for LPG. That is, the industry is now free to negotiate market prices for that product. The Customs legislation has been amended to re-ove export controls on LPG, but exportsÂ· will, of course, be subject to the Government's policy prohibiting exports to South Africa at this point. In place of its previous role, the Prices Surveillance Authority, in conjunction with State consumer protection authorities, is undertaking increased monitoring of prices to ensure that there exploitation of consumers. If it does find that there are prices Â·in excess of what is reasonable, it has the power to ensure that the marketers are declared under the provisions of the Prices Surveillance Act, in which case they would be required to seek approval of the PSA for any proposed price increases. In conclusion, it is worthy of observation that deregulation in this area will serve Australian consumers well in the medium to long term. It is a very long term decision. The point I make in closing is that, in relation to the existing frastructure and its ability to meet the requirement of distributing this product in the next decade or two, it was very important to ensure that there was a degree of profit in the industry, which would be a condition precedent to the very substantial infrastructure investment requirements we will have to have to ensure two things. One is the cheap prices we have had historically for consumers in this country. More importantly, I think, we have to ensure that the prospect of this country having to import LPG-and that is a possibility if the status quo were to be retained-is not confronted in the next few years.

110,Dr HEWSON,SUPERVISION,"In view of the fact that the Treasurer seems intent on washing his hands of the circumstances and difficulties associated with various financial institutions, is the Prime Minister completely satisfied with the system of prudential regulation and supervision as it operates in Australia today?",90
111,Mr HAWKE,SUPERVISION,"Let me say first of all that I am completely satisfied with the answers that have been given by the Treasurer to the pathetic questions that have come from the other side of the House. The Opposition singularly has been unable this week in any way to shake the confidence of the Treasurer on, this matter. I think that is a reflection of two things: the Opposition's woeful inadequacies and the strength of his position. Obviously the Treasurer and the is no Reserve Bank of Australia will keep a continuing view of the way in which the existing system operates, and I have no doubt that should the Treasurer and the Governor and the board of the Reserve Bank come to a conclusion that there is any need for a review of the existing arrangements they would proceed to make such a recommendation and that that would be undertaken. To this point, that has not been done, and I therefore come to the conclusion that they are satisfied and properly satisfied.",90

114,Mr ONEIL,ROAD FUNDING,"The Minister for Land Transport would be aware of the blatant political campaign against the Federal Government by the motoring organisations, vis-a-vis the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia, regarding road funding. Would the Minister outline to the House the Federal Government's program for road funding?",91
115,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROAD FUNDING,"I think some of those State motorist organisations want to remember what happened in New South Wales. In New South Wales, in the last elections for the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) and for the first time since the 1940s, those conservative elements that have entrenched themselves in those State motorist organisations and have taken advantage of all the finance and facilities to misrepresent our position were devastated. The motorists reform group won three out of those six positions and, as a result of that, have quite clearly served notice not only on the NRMA in New South Wales but also those other State motorist organisations that if they want to adopt a partisan political stand it could well work to their detriment. I have indicated that each of them represents probably the most privileged and exclusive club in Australia. It will change and has changed already. I have found, as one would expect, a much more objective, dispassionate and fair response from those people in the NRMA in New South Wales since we devastated them. Mr Hawker-'We'? You said 'We'.",91
116,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROAD FUNDING,"The honourable member for Wannon, who is one of those people with responsibility in this area, writes letters to the newspapers continuing to make the claim that this Government has been responsible for reducing the level of funding for roads. He knows, because he looks very closely at the evidence, that that is not correct. In fact, since 1983, the amount of money which the Hawke Government has put into the IS no national roads system in today's dollar terms represents a sum approaching $12,000m-a record level of funding for any comparable time in the history of the Commonwealth. When we compare our record with that which was established by the Fraser Government, our level of funding has been 20 per cent higher. Just to give the lie to the claims which the honourable member for Wannon and some of his colleagues continue to make, let me give the figures for the last three years. Three years ago, the total amount of money which we put into the road system was $1.25 billion. That was at the Federal Government level. Last year it was $1.34 billion. This year we put $1.6 billion into land transport. This year's figure alone represents an increase of 13 per cent in real terms over the level last year. Not only have we increased the aggregate amount, but we have targeted into the whole system some specialised programs. We have put another $300m into rural and provincial roads. The honourable member for Grey knows about that because he has benefited from it. One of the chief reasons we have increased the level of funding is that he has made out such a powerful and compelling case for us to do so. Not only have we put that $300m into rural and provincial roads, we have also put in another $110m for black spots to make it possible for the States to identify and correct those death spots on their road networks. And an additional $85m has been put into urban public transport, bringing that amount to a total of $200m. There has been one Prime Minister in Australia's hi-tory who has firmly committed himself to the whole question of road safety, and that is the present Prime Minister, with the black spots program. I have given public recognition to the Prime Minister for this, and I do so genuinely. I was delighted to have the privilege of being able to introduce that program, and I am delighted as well to be able to identify it as the Prime Minister's black spots program.",91

135,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The critical need for more enterprise bargain"" ing as the employment situation worsens. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",93
136,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,"1 do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that of all the things that the Hawke Government has done since it came to power in March 1983 the one that it boasts about the most-and we had an,;, other demonstration of it today-the one thing that represents, in its eyes, the jewel in the Australia Labor Party crown over t1,1e last eight years, is what this Government believes it has achieved on the employment front. I start my remarks on this matter of public importance by acknowledging, quite freely and without any kiI).d of rancour or in any niggling way, that over the last eight years there have been 1112 million jobs created in Australia. I am quite happy to acknowledge to the House and the Government that over the last eight years this Government has followed policies which have played a significant role in producing 1.5 million more jobs in Australia. However, I want to draw the House's attention to the circumstances in which these 1112 million jobs have been created because those circumstances are very relevant to the matter of public importance which is currently before the House. There has been a cost involved in creating those 1.5 million additional jobs. Whenever the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gets up and boasts to this side of the House that he has presided over the creation of 1.5 million additional jobs over the last eight years-and he did it again at Question Time today when he was praising the performance of his Treasurer (Mr Keating) whilst refusing to condemn the evident failures of the Treasurer-the one thing that he and his colleagues stubbornly refuse to do is acknowledge the cost of creating those additional jobs. Again today he refused to do that. Some people might say, 'Good heavens, how on earth could anybody ever talk about the cost of creating 1.5 million jobs? How could anyone be so callous and coldhearted as to suggest that there can ever be a cost?'. Of course, the good old faithful honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) nods his head in agreement. There has been a cost and that cost has been the unsustainable expansion of the overseas debt of this country. That unsustainable expansion of our overseas debt threatens the ultimate strangulation of the Australian economy. It is a very short sighted Prime Minister, a very narrowlybased policy and a very short term economic ideology that measures success totally by the given amount of gross domestic product expansion and the given amount of job expansion within a finite period. Ultimately, over the months and years ahead we will pay the price as a nation in terms of living standards, of personal economic disaster, of asset deflation, of personal wealth depletion, of the unsustainable policies of expansion that were put in place by this Government after it was elected in 1983. Anybody can create a degree of economic growth. Anybody can generate a given number of jobs if the. Government is prepared to borrow from the .rest of world as though it is going out of fashion. 1 find it ironic that all of this week the Treasurer-he ought to be renamed P. P. Keating, Pontius Pilate Keatinghas been coming into this House and say:ing, 'I have got nothing to do with the economic disasters of financial institutions in this country'. He said again today and he said it earlier this week, 'If entrepreneurs, bankers and financiers are stupid enough to borrow beyond their capacity to repay then be it on their own heads; don't expect me or the rest of the community to bail them out'. Is it not strange that the very behaviour he berates in others and separates himself from is the very economic behaviour that he has presided over for the last eight years? Over the last eight years the Treasurer has done nothing but preside over the unsustainable lending practices of the Australian nation. That is what he has done. That expansion of our nation's debt underwrote the early growth years of the Hawke Government and therefore underwrote the early growth in job creation over those years. No wonder, 1 say in my remarks, that of course there have been 1.5 million jobs created. I, like everybody else, am pleased for the people who have enjoyed that job creation. But there has been a cost. That cost has been the quadrupling of our overseas debt. That cost has been a wages system that may have restrained real wage increases. I acknowledge that. It has also been a wages system that has produced some of the lowest productivity levels in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development area. That is why I bring to this discussion of a matter of public importance up-front this whole claim, the proudest claim of all, the jewel in the crown of the Labor Government-the creation of 1.5 million jobs. I simplyÂ· say to the House that 1.5 million jobs have been created over the last eight years, but they have been created at the cost. of an unsustainable expansion of this country's overseas debt. The protracted recession that we are now in and are likely to remain in for months aheadÂ· is a direct product of that unsustainable expansion. The Prime Minister himself has repeatedly said, and said as late as today, that he had to slam on the interest rate brakes because we were importing too much. In other words, the overseas debt had reached an unsustainable level and we had to start the long and painful process of winding it back. One of the elements of pain in winding back our overseas debt will be the destruction, sadly, of many of those 1.5 million jobs. We have seen it again today in the unemployment figures. I will not weary the House with the statistics, except one that represents the sharp end of the human misery of unemployment, that is, that over the last 12 months there has been a 7 percentage point growth from 18 to 25 per cent, that is one in four, of the number of young Australians between 15 and 19 who are now out of work. Let me say one other thing' to the honourable gentlemen opposite who may be tempted to draw some comparisons between the employment record of this Government and the employment record of previous governments. Let me say to the honourable member for Gellibrand, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table, that one does not make a faithful comparison of statistics between two periods of time by taking the peak during period A and comparing it to the peak during period B which this mob opposite has done with just about evant economic statistic. What one does is look at the trend for the whole of period A and compare it with the whole of period B. One finds that the average level of unemployment under the previous Government was 5.8 per cent-Dr Charlesworth-And climbing.",93
137,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,"And the average level of unemployment under this Government-let me pick up the interjection of the honourable member for Perth-is 7.7 per cent and climbing very much higher. In other words, the Government's unemployment record is 2 percentage points worse than ours was, and that is measured up until August last year, when the peak of unemployment was 7 per cent. Having dealt at some length, but I think appropriately, with the infatuation of the Government with only one aspect of its economic performance over the last eight years, let me pick up some of the language that has been used by the Treasurer and by some economic commentators around Australia about the recession. They have said repeatedly that it would be a great pity if out of the pain of the current recession there were no gain. I think the honourable member for Perth, being occasionally a very reasonable man, would agree that if we go through the pain of a recession there ought to be some gain out of it. For three months the Treasurer thought the gain would be a 20-year breakthrough on inflation. That went out the window yesterday. The truth of yesterday's inflation figure is that it was the previous quarter-the 0.7 per cent-that was the aberration. I would have liked a better inflation figure yesterday. Everybody on this side of the House would have liked a better inflation figure. But the fact is that even if we throw out the almost one per cent for oil, the figure is still down to just under 2 per cent. Even if we get Ilh per cent over the next two quarters, we will be struggling to get to 6 per cent. When we look at countries such as Japan and the United States, we see that 6 per cent is pretty ordinary. It does not represent every rel- the 20-year breakthrough. The one area that is left for this Government to confound its critics is to do something about freeing up our labour market and introducing some enterprise bargaining as the way to make industrial relations arrangements in this country in the years ahead. The current economic downturn and. the current economic recession offer to. this Government an unprecedented opportunity to seize the initiative on the industrial relations front; to use the greater flexibility that SPC Ltd demonstrated is clearly available to introduce some enterprise bargaining. On 12 March the Prime Minister has his last political opportunityÂ· to salvage his economic credibility. That economic statement on 12 March is the last opportunity for this Prime Minister to salvage his econ()mic credibility. If he can speed up the process of micro-economic reform; if he can give a sense of economic direction to this country; most importantly of all, if he can recognise ,the solution to Australia's industrial relations challenge, the solution to our productivity challenge, the way in whiCh to convert the pain of rising unemployment induced by the recession into the gain of an enterprisebased industrial relations system however much he may be in love with the processes of the accord, however. much in his one dimensional way he may see the accord in terms of job creation and shut out the debt accumulation consequences and the productivity loss consequences of the accord; if he can recognise that there was a time for the accord, that that time is now past and this is the time and the opportunity to change our industrial relations system, he will strike a blow towards restoring what is a heavily dented reputation for economic management. Every honourable member opposite knows that the economic credibility of this Government is inÂ· ruins. It lies as a smoking ruin all around the country. But the Government can do something about that. In the process it can not only do itself a good turn politically, but also do the country a good turn. It is at times of economic recession that people are prepared to accept change. I believe there is a growing realisation in the Australian community that the way to induce a productivity break-out, the way in which to compete and ultimately beat the rest of the world through productivity and-effort, is to encourage an industrial relations climate in this nation where individual owners and their employees get together at an enterprise level. They tell the Industrial Relations Commission, the unions, the employer organisations, the governments, the professional do-gooding industrial interferers to go away and leave them in peace to work out their own destiny to their own benefit, and to the benefit of our nation's productivity.",95
138,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,"The theme of the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard); seemed to be that this Government has an infatuation with employment growth, has not been concerned about other aspects of the economy and ought to be doing something about enterprise bargaining. Let me just say, firstly, about this so-called tuation with employment growth that it has, of course, been a very important objectiveof this Government to rectify the deficiencies of the previous Government in respect of employment. That Government showed itself incapable of generating consistent and substantial economic and employment growth. This Government, of course, has been very successful in reversing that abysmal failure of the previous Government, to the point where, as has been mentioned in Question Time, there has been very substantial growth of employment-indeed, a higher rate of growth of employment than in any other country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in the last seven or eight years. That, however, has not been the sole focus of this Government's attention in any way. We regard it as exceedingly important to provide jobs for those who want them, and of course the fact that there has been this 11/2 million growth in employment has been very important to us; but it has by no means been the sole feature of our concern. A major feature of our concern has been to rectify the structural deficiency of this economy which is attributable to the Government which preceded us and to the governments which preceded us over most of the postwar period. Of course, for 30 of the 33 years before this Government came to office, we had conservative governments running this country, essentially establishing the kind of economy which we would have in Australia in the postwar period, and it was, as everyone now acknowledges, an economy which was structurally deficient-exceedingly so. When the Opposition spokesman was Treasurer, he was already running up 6 per cent of gross domestic product balance of payments current account deficits as a representation of the growing deficiency and structural problems of the country, and overcoming those only by pushing the economy back into recession. It has been this Government's concern, very much-far more so than any previous government in the history of this country-to rectify the structural deficieninfacies which have given us the balance of payments problems and the foreign debt problems, to put the economy on a basis on which we could get sustainable growth, and to do that in a way which would not give us the current account difficulties. That, of course, is a long term turnaround in the nature of the economy. We see that particularly in areas such as that of protection. Only Labor governments have really moved against the high level of protection for manufacturing industry in this country which was developed by conservative governments, particularly in the postwarÂ· period. They were quite happy to see manufacturing industry develop under very high tariff walls and therefore be totally non-competitive with foreign goods. They did little, . if anything, to turn that situation around. The Whitlam Government tackled it in a fairly dramatic way with a 25 per cent tariff cut. But the real, consistent attempts to change the environment in which Australian manufacturing industry develops and to put it on an internationally competitive basis by forcing it to face up more and more to lower levels of protection and, therefore, to worldwide competitive prices has been made by this Government through continual reduction of levels of protection. It has been a major development. Of course, it takes time for that to have its impact in terms of producing a more competitive level of manufacturing industry, but we are seeing it happen; we are seeing manufactured exports grow. One can see it in the car industry, which has historically been a highly inefficient one but which is now gradually becoming more export oriented. It is starting to produce more and more parts, indeed whole cars, for export and increasingly it will be able to do so. We will continue to give the car industry that impetus. It is not, however, just the car industry; manufacturing industry generally is increasingly being put in a much more competitive position. There is a whole raft of structural changes taking place at present under the heading of micro-economic reform. I am not going to go through all the details, but I can say quite adamantly that no government, and certainly not the Fraser Government, attempted anything like this kind of approach to put the economy on a much more efficient basis. In the area of wages policy and industrial relations policy, despite the title of the matter of public importance (MPI), which referred to the 'critical need for more enterprise bargaining as the employment situation worsens'-which took up about two minutes of the Opposition spokesman's address-the fact is that in the area of industrial relations and the labour market, this Government has done more than any predecessor government to introduce labour market flexibility. In the last two or three years there has been a dramatic change in what is happening in our workplaces, and this has provided the basis for a very substantial move to enterprise bargaining and enterprise based labour market arrangements the like of which we have never had in this country-certainly not in this century. Yet it receives no mention from the honourable member for Bennelong. I do not know whether he knows what is happening out there, but what has been happening in our workplaces and in the framework under which they operate is dramatic change. It has come about through the structural efficiency principle being applied as the form in which wage increases are taking place in this country. It has required all the awards to be amended so that the multiplicity of narrow classifications are to be changed to broad classificationsJn the metal industry it has meant that approximately 300 classifications have come down to 14. It has meant multi skilling of the work force. It has meant a need for much more training of the work forceall of which will increase our skill levels. It has also meant workplace flexibility. The awards generally these days include a clause called the award modernisation clause or the enterprise flexibility clause, which enables anÂ· enterprise to rearrange its activities in a way which will not be in accord with the award but will be allowed, by the process of this clause, to apply at that enterprise. That indeed, I believe, is a very substantial step towards improving labour market flexibility. It is something which has only been in place in the last year or so but it already has resulted in considerable developments in various industries. That will als6 be the focus upon which the wages system will now develop. Certainly in the national wage case now going on there is very wide agreement, indeed virtually unanimous agreement, between the parties, and that is not just the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) but also the employer organisations. There are some differences between the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia (MTIA) and the other employer organisations, but they are only about how one records the outcome of the enterprise negotiations. Apart from that, there is pretty much substantial agreement that there should be a move to enterprise based wage negotiations. It is also very much the agreed position that those enterprise based wage negotiations should take place within a framework set out by the Industrial Relations Commission. It is the job of the Commission in the current case not to decide whether there should be enterprise b-sed wage negotiations, but what the guidelmes are under which they should .take place. In other words, the very thing that the honourable member for Bennelong is calling for is in fact now taking place with the agreement of all of the parties. The only matter at issue is the detail of how the agreement will operate, not whether it will operate. Members of the Opposition get up and beat their chests about how we need all this and how the 12 March statement is really the Government's opportunity to show it is serious. The Government has been making statements about this for ages in national wage cases. In supporting the developments over the last few yearsindeed being a major impetus for those developments-it has certainly encour:"" aged the move to enterprise based negotiation. Where we differ very much from the Opposition is in the way in which we would see those enterprise based arrangements taking place. We would certainly not support-nor would any of the employer organisations of which I am aware-the idea which I still understand to be Opposition policy, that it would basically allow enterprises to go off and negotiate, regardless of any guidelines. In other words, enterprises would not be constrained in any way by the need to have the endorsement of the Commission or to operate within a framework; they would simply go off and do their own thing entirely. If that were to happen there would be legitimate concern among the employer organisations of this country. When the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer in the previous Government, there was an attitude of 'go out and do it in an enterprise negotiation style' for a short time. This resulted in a 17 per cent wages blowout which not only blew out wages but also blew out the Fraser Government and greatly damaged the Australian economy. It is of great concern to all parties not to see that kind of thing happen again. So they all want a framework; they all want guidelines to be laid down. One .of those guidelines-which all parties agree on-is that wage increases at the enterprise level should be based on achieved productivity. They should not be based on some vague calculation and some dressing up of the situation, but achieved productivity and efficiency from the structural efficiency principle application at the enterprise. I believe that we are now looking at the development of a very substantial change in our wage fixing policy. It provides an enormous increase in flexibility in the marketplace within a framework which gives assurance that we are not likely to see either the. kind of wages blow-out which has marked attempts to go down' this path before, nor the kind of exploitation which could occur where unions were weak or non-existent and tough employers were able to put exploitative conditions on their workers, which would be possible under the Opposition's proposals. No-one in the industrial relations arena wants that. The Government certainly does not want to have those outcomes; it wants an outcome which gives flexibility but also gives wage responsibility and social responsibility so that we do not have exploitation and we do not have wages blow-outs. This is the path down which the Government is now moving. I believe that, although the guidelines have not yet been finalised, there is substantial agreement about them amongst the parties. There are some areas of disagreeinent but essentially we are looking at, quite clearly, the move to a situation which is unique in our history this century. It is certainly unique under the umbrella of the arbitration system in which we will probably see a possibility for national wage increases applying across the board, but with increasing emphasis on the wage decisions being made at the enterprise level. So this is a very dramatic development. However, if we were simply to adopt the approach of the Opposition, perhaps we should be looking at what happens in countries like the United Kingdom (UK), which has our kind of union structure, although our union structure is also changing fairly substantially, but is historforms ically a craft-based union structure. In the United Kingdom, we have observed inflation running at 11 per cent recently, and what has been driving that inflation is wage increases growing at around 10 per cent. In recent times in the UK there have been wage increases over 10 per cent. British Airways has just had an 11.2 per cent wages increase in line with the retail price index; Ford UK has just had a 13.4 per cent increase linking its wages to the retail price index. Is that the kind of come the Opposition would like to see happening in this country? Clearly, it would be absurd for us to allow that kind of development. What we want is a development in which we have wages responsibility, labour market flexibility, and a much more efficient work force operating on a basis which will increase productivity. Of course, whether it does that or not must depend in the end on both the management and the unions, and the employees in the workplaces seeing it as being in their mutual interest to increase productivity. With wage increases based on achieved productivity increases, we feel sure that we will see a substantial increase in productivity flowing from this wages system.",96
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,99
140,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,"The speech that we have just had delivered to us by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) shows the reason why the Government's credibility in the community is rock bottom at the moment. We have had the most extraordinary claim made that this Government has actually implemented significant structural reform in the economy in a way that will settle this economy in place for the next decade. Now, we have not seen that reform at all. That is precisely what has been missing in the program of this Government-and nowhere more so than in the labour market. In countries like Great Britain and in Europe we have seen the structural reput in place; we have not seen them here-and the measure of the ineffectiveness of the policies of this Government, particularly in the area of the labour market, is the figures that have been released today in relation to unemployment. I will particularly concentrate my remarks on the effect of this Government's policies on the young people of this country . We have had a youth unemployment rate announced of 25.8 per cent, and it may well reach 30 per cent before this recession is over. We would not be having unemployout- ment rates of that dimension had we had the sorts of reforms of the labour market that this country so desperately needs. We have become accustomed over the years to seeing these figures released month after month, figures which show that, relatively, youth unemployment is significantly higher than adult unemployment. We have become accustomed to these figures, and there may be many people who think that somehow or other this is inevitable; it is just a fact of economic life that a higher proportion of young people, rather than adults, are going to be unemployed. This is not an inevitable fact. This was not always a fact of the Australian economy. Before the years of the Whitlam Government there was not this significant difference between youth rates of unemployment and adult rates of unemployment. Since that time, the structural changes that have taken place in the balance of power in the economy, the growing power of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the grip of the centralised wage fixation system, the demand for national uniformity and the pressure of the trade union movement to collapse the differentials between youth and adult wages have built this into the economy. Until those fundamental facts are changed, we will not see the youth unemployment rate properly addressed and descending to the sort of levels that we expect when we see adult unemployment rates. The fundamental problem with the Australian economy, which is measured in these figures, and these figures are the measure of the failure of structural reform, is the Government's failure, and it arises from the kind of government we have. The Minister for Finance', who is at the table, is indeed one of the representatives of the corporate state-the alliance between the ACTU and. the' Government.",99
141,Dr HEWSON,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,He knows better than anybody else ..,100
142,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,He is a foundation member of the club. .,100
143,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,"A foundation member, as the honourable member for Bennelong says. He is a member of the group which has orchestrated national policy to suit its own interests, to suit its own power. Those who have suffered and paid the price are the young people of this country. Until employers get the right to settle wages and salaries in a sensible manner appropriate to the skills and the experience of those they are seeking to employ, we are not going to be able to solve the problem of finding jobs for Australia's young people. Young people have suffered under this Government both directly and indirectly. "" I want to make some remarks on the capacity of the educational and training institutions of this country to adjust to the needs of young people under the centralised labour market arrangements that have been imposed by the accord and Labor's corporate state. When we look at our educational institutions-whether they be secondary institutions, tertiary institusolved tions or the technical and further education (TAFE) institutions of this countrywe see that all of them are operating under the straitjacket of the centralised system. A report of the National Institute of Labour Studies at Flinders University was handed down by the Government in the past few days. This shows that there is going to be a massive shortage of academic staff in this country over the next decade-perhaps a shortage of up to 20,000 staff. They are not going to be produced by the higher education, instituti-:ms of this country. That is clear from the report. They are not going to be able to be hired from overseas. The inevitable consequence of this will be a decline in the .standards of education offered to the young people of this country. We had a report towards the end oflast year from a committee chaired by Ivan Deveson, the chief executive of Nissan Australia, on the training systems of this country. That report says that Australia is at the back of the pack in training. After seven years of this Government, Australia is at the back of the pack. The Government has been relying on TAFE to do the job. What did that report say about T AFE? It said that T AFE was so tied up in the rigidities of labour market regulations that it could not hire the staff and it could not exercise the management flexibility it needed to offer the courses that Australian employers are looking for. So for all the rhetoric of skilling Australia, of educating Australia, we find that the agreements and the backroom deals on which this Government is based are squeezing .out opportunity at every level. The Deveson report said that the literacy and numeracy of young people is one .of the country's most fundamental problems-seven years after this Government came to power. And what do the Government and the ACTU say to the employers of the country? They say, 'Employers, you pay fOf it; you solve the problem'. Ivan Dev.eson and his committee did not have any doubt: thisÂ· is. a job that has to be by proper reform by the Government. It is not something that the employers of this country have to be asked to pay for. The very sorry consequences of the losophy of this Government are being borne, above all, by the young people. There is a call for flexibility for employers in the workplace-not theÂ· bureaucratireference. cally managed enterprise agreements unproach: der national mega-unions that the Minister at the table supports; not a philosophy governing employment in this country which says, 'Employers and employees cannot be trusted to make agreements their own account. We will impose the guidelines. We will tell them what do it do'. Until we get this philosophy changed, we are not going to see the opportunities for young p(!ople opened up. To say that flexibility means lower wages for young people and that the coaemployees lition believes in lower wages is nonsense. What we want and have not got in this country is wages relative to experience and ability. The only wage that is devasmission, tating to young people is the zero the wage of unemployment. We cannot accept these figures, because they show that the way in which the labour market in this country is organised at the ment is absolutely unsatisfactory to build the strength and future of this country. This country desperately needs reform. needs structural reform in many areas, but there is no area in which it needs it more than in reform of the labour market which . will open for young people the doors to enterprise and opportunity.  (3.36)-1 haye listened with interest to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). In the main, with. . their contributions were the same old tired story. I remind the chamber of the wordwhat ingof the matter of public importance that the Opposition has brought before the chamber this afternoon: The critical need for more enterprise bargaining as the employment situation worsens. The honourable member for Bennelongof the architect of the worse unemployment in this nation's history; the architect the highest prospective Budget deficit this nation's history; and the man who supervised the greatest contraction in economy since the Great Depressionpoorer phiputs a matter on notice before the House of Representatives and manages to devote a rather cursory three minutes to the issue, and then almost by way of passing It is the same old tired ap'The accord is evil, end the accord, the accord is the cause of all the difficulties of every person in this country, why do we not just let employers and employees get together and do their own on thing?'. In other words, the honourable member for Bennelong is saying, 'Just let the powerful out there exploit the powerless'. Nowhere in small business do I hear any support for that kind of approach. Small business does not want to sit down with four or five employees, a dozen or 22 employees and say, 'Listen, George Howard, we have got a good thing going here. Let us get rid of the arrangements with the Arbitration Comthe Department of Industrial Rewage, lations and the Department of employment in New South Wales and the union and employers association. You and I should just sit down here, Miss Geormogina Howard, and do a deal on how much I think you ought to get and how much you ought to work. I think you ought to It be working a few more hours. You are really not doing enough. You ought to be staying a little bit later at night'. That kind of approach is really out of the nineteenth century. Nowhere in this country have I found support of substance for that of approach. In fact, small business appreciates having sothe orderly arrangement across the wage system. It has got some idea of what it has got to compete . . What we in this country all want-and this Government wants most of all and is encouraging more than any other government-is an improvement in efficiency and productivity. We go about it either by confronting people, pulling out the lash and threatening to put them out work or in a way where we try to provide better training, fair opportunity of and fairness in the wage system. It is not in a matter of the powerful getting a good deal and the less powerful doing the same the kind of work in another place getting a deal; it is a matter of providing training, opportunity. and encouraging dustry and the work force into improving the way that they do things. The honourable member for Bennelong made two very significant statements. I wages policy. will dwell mostly on his remarks, because the honourable member for Goldstein really did not address the matter listed before the House. He addressed imporogy. tant issues, but not really the matter fore the House. The honourable member for Bennelong said that in times of nomic recession people will accept change. He had earlier said that he wanted indifuture vidual employers and employees to be able to sit down together and do their own thing-work out their own deal: 'Let's a deal, John'. The significant thing about that is that all the way through the past couple years the Opposition's complaint has been that the Government has not been tough nomic policy. enough on monetary policy, on fiscal policy. In other words, the Opposition wanted a greater contraction in the economy. It wanted recession, it wanted greater recesand sion, and the record shows that was its measure back in 1981-82. that is the course it followed previously. It is clear from what the honourable member for Bennelong said that it wanted that bejob. cause it creates the climate in which people will have to cop what is dished out to them. In contrast to that is what this Government has been doing in consultaand tion with employer associations, the trade union movement and people who are inmiddle volved themselves-working uhder the umbrella of the Australian Industrial Rebut lations Commission-so there can some consistency in terms of macro-ecocannot nomic policy. There is, of course, one flaw in everything. The honourable member for way; Bennelong arid the honourable member for Goldstein said it: they have no wages policy. They suggest we should just throw it out and let it rip. As the Minister Finance (Mr Willis) pointed out, they should look at what is happening in United Kingdom and the kind of wage increases that have been gained over there by those who have the industrial musmanagement cle-not by the battlers or the poor inworking. in the small retail stores, but those with the industrial muscle. Nowhere in the comments of the two previous Opposition speakers was regard given to The fact is that the Opposition does not have a wages policy; it has a preference for some employers and a piece of ideolIt cannot come to grips with the fact be that in this country employers want stability. They want improved productivity ecoand improved efficiency, but they also want stability, because, whatever the ahead of them, they can plan for whatever the arrangements are whilst we are improving them. Through award redo structuring, this Government has created that climate. In a time of a very tight labour market, .tllrough the accord it has of managed to contain wage growth to manageable levels in terms of macro-ecoThe Opposition does not have any policy or approach to that issue. As I move around industry, it is clearer and clearerI have said so on previous occasions in this chamber-that there is a willingness in the work force to accept change, to lift performance, to get on with the That is happening in numbers of industries, companies and corporations that .the Minister for Finance referred to. But there is substantial opposition to change an inability within management, particularly in smaller firms and within management, to change. The climate is there; the opportunity is there; there has to be a will. If managers do be not move, nothing moves. Employees go to management and say, 'Look, boss, there is a better way of doing this. I think we ought to rearrange our shifts this I think we ought to spread our working day between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. and combine our over-award payments, allowances, meal breaks or whatever the other for arrangements or ingredients are. You ought to combine all those together, and the we will work any time in a 12-hour period'. That is pulling an example together. That does not come from the floor; has to provide that. That people leadership is not being given. I believe that the Opposition in this place and in this country would better serve Australia if it faced up to the reality that the opportunity for improvement is there. It is occurring apace in some tries and in some firms where there is will to do it, but the Opposition should give support and encouragement to firms, management and industry associations to get in, give that leadership and initiate that change. There is a willingness cept change. There can be the creation of career structures, better reward for better skills and the introduction of training. It is all very well for the honourable member for Goldstein to refer to the employers having to pay for training-I think that is what he was referring to; I do want to misrepresent him. If that is case, he ought to refer to employers who are providingÂ· well above their of training whilst many others in the system are riding free. The opportunity is there.

Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",103
146,Mr WILLIS,RFEDWARDS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Appropriation Bill (No.3) seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1990-91 totalling $234.1m. The Bill provides for certain proposed expenditure for the ordinary annual services of government, in addition to the amounts which were appropriated by Parliament at Budget time. Appropriation Act (No.1) 1990-91 contains provision under division 310 for an Advance to the Minister for Finance of $170m to enable the Minister to make money available, inter alia, for expenditure which is urgently required and was unforeseen at the time of preparation of the Bill for that Act. However, departments have foreshadowed likely calls on the Advance, prior to the availability of funds from the Additional Estimates Bills, which significantly exceed the funds remaining in the Advance. Forecast requirements amount to some $291.6m prior to the beginning of June, whilst only $84.4m the Interior Ministry in Riga, Latvia, on 20 January persons were killed andiline injured; against the democratically elected Parliaments of with universally accepted principles of human and violence against the peoples of the Baltic states; conjunction with other democratic states, to protest and in international human rights forums; and the peaceful transition to independence of those elected Parliaments, a desire for selfTime allotted-any remaining private Member's business time.

The sum appropriated 1990-91 to the Advance to the Minister for Finance in Appropriation Act (No.2) 1990-91 'under division 868 is, of course, not available for expenditure for the ordinary annual services of government. Passage of the present Bill will alleviate pressure on the Advance. The amounts in this Bill are being sought in advance of the Additional Estimates to meet urgent requirements which have arisen as a consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year. The repercussions of the invasion, of the subsequent United Nations (UN) sanctions against Iraq and of the current hostilities in the Gulf to end the illegal occupation of Kuwait will affect Australia for some time to come. This Government has played an active role in support of the United Nations sanctions. That role has not been without cost. The Bill now before this HOllse provides for $181.4m for payment by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board, which were insured under the national interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act. Iraq discontinued payments on its wheat debt after the imposition of the UN trade sanctions, and it is now considered unlikely that any payments will be made in the foreseeable future. This amount, to meet the Government's immediate obligation under national interest insurance provisions; is payable prior to funds becoming available under the Additional Estimates and is to meet payments falling due on the first of each month. An additional payment of $29.7m will be required in June, and this will be included in the Additional Estimates. Further claims, totalling $247m in 1991-92 and $34m in 1992-93 at current exchange rates, are anticipated. These will be handled in the course of the normal Budget appropriation processes. The Bill' also provides $52.7m for the Department of Defence to meet equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Defence Force to the Middle East. In addition to the costs of the deployment itself, additional expenditure has been incurred in Australia through the provision of stores and the fitting of additional equipment to vessels to counter the increased threat in the Gulf, and through the extra training and exercises conducted to ensure that our ships were at a full state of readiness before they reached the Gulf. Total supplementation for Defence costs associated with the Gulf deployment amounts to $68.9m in 1990-91; the balance of $16.2m will be included in the Additional Estimates. A further $27.5m will be provided in subsequent years: $23.6m in 1991-92 and $3.9m in 1992-93. The Government has brought this Bill before the House now because the amounts included in it are being sought in advance of the Additional Estimates to meet urgent expenditure. I am confident that honourable members will join me in supporting this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Kernp) adjourned. ' ARTS, SPORT, ENVIRONMENT, NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mrs Kelly, and read a first time. Second Reading",107
147,Mrs KELLY,LEGISLATION,"Canberya-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) (3.52)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Arts, Sport,' Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 amends six Acts, and repeals one Act, of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories portfolio. The repeal of various borrowing provisions in the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Northern Territory (SelfGovernment) Act 1978 are the result of last year's decision by the Loan Council that the States and Territories will gradually assume full responsibility for raising and servicing their own government debt. In this context it is no longer appropriate for borrowings by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Northern Territory governments and their statutory authorities to require the Commonwealth Treasurer's approval, nor for there to be standing provisions in the self-go vernmert Acts for the Commonwealth to guarantee such borrowings. These provisions will therefore not apply to borrowings made after 30 June 1991. The repeal will not affect the Commonwealth's power under other legislation, current or future, to guarantee Territory borrowings for special reasons, nor.liinit the borrowing powers of the ACT or the Northern Territory. The amendment of section 14 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 will enable the Legislative Assembly of the ACT to legislate to establish a superannuation scheme for members of the Assembly and their dependants. Section 14 must be read together with section 73 of the ACT SelfGovernment Act. Section 73 provides for the remuneration of members to be determined either by the Remuneration Tribunal or by enactment of the Legislative Assembly. There is currently a Remuneration Tribunal determination in force and there is conflicting legal advice as to whether an enactment could be made. Paragraph 14(1) (c) provides that a member vacates his or her office if the member: takes, or a-rees to take, directly or indirectly, remuneratIOn, allowance, honorarium or reward for services ren?ered in the Assembly, otherwise than under section 73. . Honourable members will understand that given the conflicting legal advice in rela- threshold. tion to the position of sections 14 and 73 as well as the risk to members of the Legislative Assembly who may receive what could be unauthorised benefits was thought advisable to include new - ubÂ­ sections 14(3) and 14(4). These subsecof tions specifically exclude a superannuation scheme for members of the ACT Legislaof tive Assembly and their dependants from the provisions of section 14, and hence also from the provisions of section 73. The amendments to the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989 will bring reports on the financial transactions and state of. affairs of the Australian Sports Foundahon under the reporting requireLibrary. ments of section 63M of Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901-called the Audit Act. The Commission has viously included this information volunstatutory tarily in its annual reports, but it has dec-ded to formalise the arrangement following a request from the National Audit Office. It is also consistent with the ernment's policy of applying to. all monwealth statutory authorities the provisions of either Division 2 or Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act, which apply to public statutory authorities cluding related bodies corporate, such the Australian Sports Foundation. The amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 correct two minor drafting errors. They do not affect the meaning or application of the Act. The Bill includes a number of amendments to the National Library Act 1960. tralian Most are minor technical corrections and its improvements. TheÂ·amendment to secsupply, tion, 7A of the Act increases the power the National Library of Australia (NLA) . . and dispose. of assets' and to to putchase enter mto contracts, wIthout the need to commercial basis. obtain the approval of the Minister, from $50,000 by amount of money or value of property involved, as is currently provided, to $250,000. This new threshold will reflect the present scale of the any Library's financial operations and correct the effect of inflation on the previous limit which has remained unchanged for 18 years. The 1988 review of the NLA supported a substantial increase in' the Among the amendments to sections 15 ACT and 17E, and in new section 15A, is the removal of the requirement that the it Governor General notify in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette the vacation office and resignation of members of the Council, and of the Director-General the Library. The removal of this requireI?-nt fr?m the Act was deemed appropnate, gIven that gazettal is not practice for other statutory authorities. New section 21 of the Act will make the provisions of Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901 apply to the National This is in line with current Government practice to apply the provisions of either Division 2 or Division 3 of Part preXI of the Audit Act to Commonwealth authorities. New section 21A been provides the Library with a power to invest money held by the Library, other than. on trust, that is not immediately GovreqUIred - or t-e purposes of the Library, Comon deposIt WIth an approved bank, in Commonwealth securities or in any other manner approved in writing by the Treasurer. This power is similar to that given into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as Authority under section 54A of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. New section 27 A will allow regulations to be made for the supply of liquor on Library premises, similar to that provided in the National Gallery Act 1975 the National Museum Act 1980 and the'AusNational Maritime Museum Act 1990. This will provide the Library with own independent power over the sale disposal, possession or control of of liquor on its premises, and allow it to operate its catering facilities on a more New section 27B will extend the regulatory powers to control the movement and conduct of persons on Library land and buildings, similar to those in the tralian War Memorial Act 1980, the Ausunder tralian National Maritime Museum Act 1990 and the National Gallery Act 1975. The new section will allow regulations to be made to increase security to ensure the future safety of the national collection Library materials and to prevent trespass to restricted areas. The final amendment to the Library Act-to section 28-will increase the maximum monetary penalty limit for ences against the regulations from $100 this Bill. to $500, as well as removing any reference to terms of imprisonment. This will journed. provide a more appropriate penalty and make the limit consistent with that of other cultural institutions, such as the Australian National Museum, the War Memorial and the Australian National Maritime Museum. The Bill also includes a number of amendments to the National Parks and Message Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 to achieve two objectives. The first of these objecRegulations tives is to allow all money collected the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service from leases, licences, permits and other authorities be used by the Service in the pursuance of its nature conservation role. This achieved by removing the current requireafter ment in subsection 46 (2) of the Act that all such money be paid into the dated revenue fund, and specifying instead, through an amendment to subsection 46 (1), that the money must paid into the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund. The second objective is to allow the Director of the Service invest money that is held by the Service but is not needed immediately. This is achieved by removing the prohibition investment currently contained in section 49 of the Act and adding a new section 49A. Section 49A specifies that money standing to the credit of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund that is activity .. not required immediately for the purpose of the Fund may be invested by the Dithis rector with an approved bank, in Comened monwealth securities, or in any other manner approved by the Treasurer. This power is also similar to that given to AusGreat Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority section 54A of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. As well as allowing interest to be gained on money held in the Fund, this provision will allow the Director of the Service to accept beof quests in the form of shares, securities and other forms of investment. Finally, the opportunity is taken in the Bill to repeal the Darwin Lands Acquisition Act 1945, which is entirely spent. I offpresent the explanatory memorandum to Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adNA NA",108
148,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,"I move: That the House, having considered Senate No. 145 of 20 December 1990, approves, in accordance with section 2 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the Therapeutic Goods as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 by No. 394, as approved by the Senate. The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 was passed by the Parliament in December to 1989 - At that time the Senate amended the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 to prois vide that the Act will commence the day regulations are made, pursuant to the Act being approved in the same form consoliby both Houses of Parliament. The Senate considered that any regulabe tions may be so substantial that they should not commence until positive approval of Parliament is obtained for the to regulations. In May last year the Senate disallowed previous therapeutic goods regulations to provide the opportunity for on further public consultation. As many members will be aware, the intervening period has seen much public debate and extensive consultation with interested parties, and revised regulations reflect this It is certainly a matter of regret that in hiatus many people have been frightinto believing that the intent of the legislation is to somehow deprive them of access to the alternative therapies from the when they clearly derive considerable comfort and support. Patients have been encouraged to believe such bizarre interpretations that the purpose of the legislation is that natural remedies will only be available from doctors on prescription, that all herbal products are to be irradiated and the practitioners will not be able to tell their patients what a product is It is indeed a very sad commentary that some practitioners, hopefully a small minority, have misled the people for whom they profess concern in such a cynical fashion often to further personal motives. Clearly, there are some people out there, be they manufacturers, practitioners or distributors, who feel so insecure in their practices that they eschew all thought of their behaviour coming under the simplest scrutiny. These people simply emphasise the need for such scrutiny. In the meantime their more proficient colleagues, who acknowledge that the standing of the alternative therapies is at least partly dependent on the standard of the products they use and recommend, are being constructively involved in assisting to identify and resolve genuine concerns about the regulations. The public debate has introduced many extraneous issues and it has proved necessary to continually remind people that the purpose of the legislation is simply to establish one national system to ensure that the public is protected from substandard, unsafe and ineffective therapeutic goods which are supplied commercially to practitioners or consumers, that is, to provide a level of protection which is taken for granted in many other countries. Therapeutic goods, although used to improve people's health, do involve an element of risk because they are intended to manipulate or augment normal body processes. In Australia at present over 100 therapeutic goods are recalled from the market each year because of hazards to consumers. Many manufacturers do not operate at internationally accepted standards of manufacture. The supplies of some products make extravagant or inappropriate claims to the public. Some suppliers promote products to inappropriately trained practitioners, thus encouraging these people to treat serious medical conditions. An independent analysis of products demonstrates that many products do not reach appropriate standards of quality. At a time when there are moves tofor. wards international cooperation in the regulation of therapeutic goods, Australia has been hindered in its participation in these developments because of the lack of a national system of regulation. For instance, our membership of an international group which deals with manufacturing standards of therapeutic goods has been deferred until the Therapeutic Goods Act commences. It is now 10 years since the State and Commonwealth health Ministers in conference agreed that Australia needed to bring together into a national single regulatory system the various regulatory aspects of therapeutic goods currently resting with different levels of government and characterised by their many inconsistencies and gaps. It still comes as a surprise to some to learn that the new Act and its regulations do not introduce any regulatory requirements which are not already in existence in at least some part of Australia. The development of the Act has given the opportunity to review the level of regulation of therapeutic goods and indeed there will be a lessening of current requirements in some areas where this is not detrimental to the public interest. There is, of course, one aspect which might be deemed new. While some States have been charging registration and licensing fees these have not been of a scope currently proposed. Nevertheless, such action is in line with efforts to better target the source of Government cost and is consistent with international trends in this regard. Many correspondents have made the point that the more potent drugs represent a higher risk than do the many products which may be purchased over the counter of the local pharmacy or health food shop. This is readily acknowledged and specifically reflected in the legislation which provides the ability to require different levels of pre-market assessment. level of scrutiny applied to a new orthothe dox drug and to a new herbal product very different. For example, mo-t therapeutic devices and many alterna-1Ve me?icines are listed rather than regIstered the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This means that they are subfirst jected to a low degree of scrutiny, such checking for compliance of standards quality prior to marketing. However certain factors can predicate the need f-r a higher level of scrutiny. For example, where an alterJ?-ative cine contains a substance which has been scheduled by the National Health and Medical Research Council because of its toxicity or an alternative medicine tended to be used to treat a serious medpathic ical condition it is necessary to establish the product's safety and effectiveness, its registration involving a mo-e det-llescrutiny is obviously appropnate. SImIucts larly, a product may contain substances which by themselves do not represent risk but because of poor manufacture may have wide variations in the amounts of the active ingredients or may be adulterlisting ated or contaminated with other subfor stances. The manufacturing controls designed to ensure therapeutic goods are manufactured in a reliable and reproduthe cible manner. The regulations also contain restrictions on the promotion of products to the lic to ensure not only that the adverhsmg of products is truthful but equally imporcharge tant that promotion does not encourage inappropriate self-diagnosis and treatover of the product. ment where the input of a trained health care practitioner is necessary. Promotio? of goods to trained health care workers IS exempted from these requirements. Induction cluded in the exemption are alternative therapy practitioners registered und-r State or Territory legislation. However, is recognised that few alternative therapy goods practitioners are registered at prese-t. price standards. Until registration is more generally avallable it is therefore proposed to allow the alternative therapy industry to self-reguMedicines late advertising of products to practitionbeen ers on the understanding that the medicines practitioner community identifies an apthe The propriate level of accreditation and that manufacturers will put a code of adare vertising conduct into place.

Membership of committee will include representatives of the manufacturers and practitioners and they will shoulder the heavy responsibility of consumer protection by reviewing primarily new herbal products. I will personally appoint the members of the .Committee. Following discussions with the Australian Democrats, the Government has undertaken to amend the regulations during the autumn sitting, as we are doing now, to reduce the annual licence charge for a manufacturer with an annual turnover of $50000 or less to half that which would apply otherwise; and to exempt from licensing manufacturers of components for therapeutic devices where these components come into direct contact with body tissue or body fluid. As Sir Humphrey Appleby would point out, the first line of defence against any proposition is to claim that there has not been adequate consultation. Despite a history of consultation extending over a number of years, such a claim might have been arguable with regard to the earlier regulations. However, it certainly would have no legitimacy whatever in relation to these regulations. We have all been flooded with comment on the legislation, albeit a lot of it based on pure misinformation. There have been literally hundreds of meetings and conversations centred on issues of concern and exploring solutions thereto. Such dialog.ue - ill be an ongoing process after the legIslatIon becomes operative. Let us now consider the positions of the groups affected by the legislation. I shall deal first of all with the manufacturers and sponsors of therapeutic goods. They have always supported the purpose and needs of the legislation. They have been rightly critical of the frustrating and often expensive differences between State, Territory and Commonwealth requirements. They will be contributing 50 per cent of the costs of the program but they have had direct input into the distribution and the impact of fees and charges through the industry-government consultative committee. They have been provided with representation on most statutory committees and, in the case of non-prescription medicines, on the evaluation committees. Their exports will be more readily accepted on overseas markets because of these Australian controls. I refer next to the practitioners, who will have protection from unsatisfactory commercial products. They will receive product information - afeguar<f:ed by .the industry's self-regulation. TheIr serVIces will be sought for the treatment of appropriate medical conditions because the public will not be encour,,;ged by p-o.duct promotion to self-treat senous condItions. They will participate in the statutory and evaluation committees. The consumers at times are almost forgotten by many, but they are the focus. of the legislation. They will have protection from unsafe, poor quality, ineffective therapeutic goods. They are not adequately protected by the current contr-ls. They will be protected from. false or - nÂ­ appropriate product promotIOn. DespIte some outrageous claims to the contrary, they will not have large price increases for products inflicted on them. The fees and charges should be reflected by only a few cents per product. We will certainly be watching to see that this is not used as an opportunity by sponsors to extend profits while blaming the Government and these regulations. Let me reiterate the purpose of the legislation which is often forgotten in the public debate. The purpose is to regulate in the interests of the consumer the quality, safety and efficacy of commercially supplied therapeutic goods. As I mentioned earlier, the distortions of this purpose that have occurred are remarka-le. This legislation does not have any cymcal hidden agendas. It is simply consumer protection legislation that is necessary to afford the Australian public the level of protection taken for granted in most of our industrialised partners. After years of deliberation, with 12 months having elapsed since the enabling legislation was passed it is now til!le to move to a m?re efficient and effective way of regulatmg therapeutic goods in this country. I would like to take the opportunity of acknowledging the high level of. co-per-Â­ tion between all States and Terntones m developing this truly national system to replace the currently uncoordinated systems of State, Territory and Commonwealth controls. I would like also to express my appreciation to those people in the industry, practitioners in particular as well as manufacturers, who, despite the incredible hype and exaggeration of some people, have settled down to dealing with the issues one by one in a very professional manner. I think those people are a credit to their industry and to the process. I commend the regulations for the approval of the House.",110
149,Dr BOB WOODS,REGULATIONS,"We are addressing the approval or disapproval of regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act. Surely I did not hear the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) properly. The Minister stated that he was going to amend the regulations. They have not even been introduced yet. Clearly they are flawed. I understand that the Minister has written a letter to that effect to the Australian Democrats, saying that he will agree to amend the regulations because they are flawed. The Minister nods his approval. It must be some sort of record for this place to amend regulations before they have even been introduced.  Dr BOB WOODSAbsolutely hopeless. In view of the limited time available I will address one aspect of the regulations, the pharmaceutical industry aspect, and my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) will address some of the other issues relating to the alternative medicines aspect. As we have said many times in this place and elsewhere, we agree with the principles of the legislation, which are to streamline the process for approval and evaluation of drugs, to make them more efficient, and to make sure that there is a universal system in Australia, instead of the current system of different standards and different regulations in each State. Sadly, however, there is no indication at this stage that that will happen. Indeed, the Minister's own Department, when asked last month about this matter, indicated that there were no agreements between the States about abolishing their regulations. So at least in the short term we will have a duplication rather than a simplification of the regulations governing this industry. The regulations are supposed to provide efficient protection for consumers. Yet on countless occasions when we have asked the Minister for examples of what is actually wrong with the industry and to give us examples of areas where there might be a need for increased protection, he has mentioned things such as bits of broken glass in a few herbal products. When he is asked for specifics, they are not produced. A lot of this is rhetoric and empty propaganda. Sadly, by no stretch of anyone's imagination will these regulations achieve what they set out to do. What they should be doing is improving efficiency, not just increasing bureaucracy. As the Minister has pointed out, there will be a signifi<;ant increase in the fees charged for evaluations and other similar processes. The total burden will be in the order of $30m. Where are the benefits of this? Where does the money come from? Where does it.go to? I will tell honourable members whete the money ,comes from. Basically, it comes from industry and therefote, of course, from consumers, to whom it is passed on. Where does it go to? It goes to a very non-productive bureaucracy. The therapeutic goods administration is indeed a very non-productive bureaucracy. I was interested to look up the staffing levels of the therapeutic goods administration. I note that in 1983 the number of staff years-in other words, full time equivalent staff people-was 95. It is now up to 337. I wonder what they all do? Is there a better service? Is there more protection? I do not think anyone would claim that there is better protection at this time as a result of that enormous increase in the bureaucracy. As the Minister mentioned, it is empire building in the true Sir Humphrey mould. He would be proud of the Minister, even though I have to acknowledge that not all of that has gone on under the present Minister's administration. Have we got a more efficient service? The answer clearly is no, we have not. Have we got a faster service? The answer is no. Will either of those aspects change under these regulations? No, they will not. What we will have is more red tape strangling the bureaucracy. The effect of that red tape will be more costs, pushing Australia even further into the Third World in terms of pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical companies will still face delays. There is no guarantee in these regulations, contrary to requests from the industry, that the actual time taken to evaluate applications be defined, that there be targets for the administration to aim at and to be measured by. Contrary to requests from the industry, these have not been forthcoming. What we face here is an increased bureaucracy for the companies to wade through-extra costs for no benefit. The companies have said, as the Minister has pointed out, that they do not mind extra costs if in fact they get a better system, if there is indeed streamlining, if indeed it is more efficient, if drugs are made safer and made available more appropriately to the people of Australia. They have no problem with that. What they have a problem with is contributing half of the $30m-$15m or $16m-themselves for no benefit whatsoever. The Minister touched upon this today in his answer to a dorothy dixer in Question Time. He did not mention the extra red tape that has occurred, or a whole range of other things. He did not mention, for example, that a company with which I was in contact a few weeks ago put in an application for a drug to be approved in Sweden. It had to supply 30 volumes of information. Thirty volumes is a hell of a lot of information to supply. It came to Australia. For the same drug, same application, it had to supply 55 volumes. We are talking almost of roomfuls of information here. It is no wonder companies get frustrated and do not submit their drugs for marketing here in Australia until late. As the Minister pointed out, part of the delay is indeed with the companies because they do not submit their drugs for early approval-but they do not submit them early because they know the red tape they will face. They put their priorities elsewhere, where they know they will be approved in a reasonable length of time, and subjected to a reasonable evaluation. One of the problems, of course, in the process is that Australian bureaucracy evaluates every single one of the thousands of patients, in many cases, who ever received the drug during its evaluation period. There is no sensible reason at all why they cannot accept overseas evaluations of that data. There is no reason for them to be so slow. Indeed, I believe there is an arrangement with Sweden and one or two other countries in regard to this matter. The agreement was that there would be a bilateral acceptance of each other's evaluations-we would accept the evaluations from Sweden and Sweden would accept the evaluations from Australia. The fact is that Sweden has accepted our evaluations, and has no backlog, and as far as I am aware, we indeed have not accepted a single one of the Swedish evaluations at the last time. I checked. I do not think anybody seriously doubts the thoroughness of those processes in Sweden, and indeed in a number of other European countries in particular. Contrary to what the Minister impUed today, nobody-except perhaps for the AIDS lobby-is suggesting that overseas decisions regarding approvals for drugs be accepted; nobody would accept that. We should not relinquish the right to make decisions about which drugs are available in Australia. What we want is a simple, efficient system, free of red tape, which provides adequate safety at a reasonable length of time. The Minister cited the example of erythropoietin, and claimed, I think, that the data had not supplied vital information. I understand that the information which was not supplied was whether the ampoules were sterile. I mean, what drug company does not supply sterile ampoules? It is rather like asking whether Labor members would do a deal. Of course they would; they always do. According to the company-and I have not confirmed this with other sources-the administration did not even ask for that information until 21/2 years after the initial application. If it is so important, why did it wait so long to ask for the information? There is a whole range of other examples. What about Deprenyl? Deprenyl is an anti-Parkinson's drug. It is very good when used very early in the disease. Approval was first applied for in 1984. It was applied for twice subsequently. The timing of the use of the drug changed from being used later in the disease to being used earlier in the disease, but the drug itself and its effects, and the side effects, are all exactly the same. I understand that Depranyl has now just been approved-in 1990; at the end of last year. That is after six years. There is a whole list of other drugs which are not available or restricted. I have a list of some of them here which relate to my own particular specialty in terms of anticancer drugs. There is one in particular, which is going through the process slowly, called Ondansitron, which is a very important part of anti-cancer therapy. That drug may be lifesaving. It may mean the difference between life and death. Why can those sorts of drugs not be speeded up? It is reminiscent to me of a drug called Cis-platinum, which, in the late 1970s-prior to the present Government taking over, but with the same administration-was not approved for a number of years, even though this drug was lifesaving for men with testicular cancer. It literally saved their lives. It made the difference between life and death for a number of men. The rumours floating around in the medical community were that a number of doctors actually smuggled the drug in and were wanting to be stopped and harassed. I do not know whether those rumours are true, but certainly the frustration was so great that a lifesaving drug was not being made available to Australian young men that doctors were reputedly reduced to such extreme levels. There is a whole list of other drugs here. Busulphan is on the Minister's list, not as a drug which is not available, but the Minister has restricted it; he has an IPU on it. It has been available since the late 1950s. I mean, it is as safe as houses when used by somebody who knows what is going on with chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is what it is used for. It is crazy that either the drugs are not approved, or if they are, restrictions are put on them which are entirely inappropriate. The Australian community, sadly, as a result of this approach really does have second rate drugs in a number of areas. The bureaucracy perpetuates this, and in these regulations will perpetuate it even further by adding on top of all of the red tape extra costs to companies, and indeed to patients. We will finish up-as we are seeing already-with a smaller market here because this is not attractive to overseas companies. With a big bureaucracy and small profits for the companies, therefore they say, 'Why should we bother with Australia; we will do the other countries first'. Eventually we might, if we are lucky, get around to having access to some of their newer drugs, which in many cases are worthwhile. I think there has to be an assessment of the value of the drugs, as well as the side effects of the drugs. It is interesting to look at the contradiction in government approaches. I understand there have been-to put it politelysome discussions between the Minister's department and Senator Button's department, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Quite rightly, Senator Button is trying to remove some of the barriers to the development of the pharmaceutical industry in Australia. It currently has a turnover of around $2 billion. Exports, I think, are around 10 per cent of that, around $200m. So it is a small but a very worthwhile industry-one which could be greatly expanded. Senator Button has introduced a number of items, such as the Factor F procedure, which has been widely accepted by the industry as encouraging export markets in particular. So on the one hand we have Senator Button doing thatand in principle we would agree with a lot of what he is trying to do-yet on the other hand we have this Minister's department strangling a developing industry with these extra regulations which are not going to offer extra protection to any single individual in this country, be it on the company side or on the consumer side. It is going to be worse than that. All export products, as a result of these regulations, will now have to be registered on the Australian register. In fact, I think Minister mentioned this and claimed it as a plus. All that that constitutes is burden, because those companies will still have to not only register on the Australian register but also register in or satisfy the requirements of the country they are exporting to. There will be two sets of regulations. Indeed, at present-because there are still all the State regulations in place-there may be several other sets of regulations they will have to comply with as well. It will certainly restrict research and development. There is a cost of $10,000, or slightly more, for every clinical trial application. Why should one do a clinic-l trial application here for a small drug If it is going to be done in another overseas country just as well, far more quickly and for nothing? Certainly this is not encouraging Australian research and development, and that is something which we should do. For example, in the United Kingdom the applications are free for clinical trial approvals, and they are guaranteed to be evaluated within 35 days. Why are there no performance criteria? Why has the Minister ignored the suggestion from the industry that there be progress payments so that actually fees are received according to whether evaluations are carried out on time? What is happening about the duplication of regulations? Perhaps the Minister will address that. I am sure in the longer term the States will diminish and demolish their regulations, and make sure that complementary legislation is passed. I understand some drafts of this have been sent to the States. There was no mention in the Minister's speech as to whether that will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. All these items need to be addressed. There are a number of items in the alternative medicine area. My colleague will touch upon these in more detail. For example the GMP code-the code of good manufacturing practice-imposes unnecessary requirements on a number of herbal and related companies, particularly small ones, and there is, indeed, very limthe ited cause for concern over the standards of most of these products. There is an extra concern, of course, about TMECthe Traditional Medicines Evaluation Committee-and the fact that it is not going to be allowed to evaluate vitamins and nutritionals. I understand, of course, that in many eyes, vitamins do not fall into traditional medicine, but there is certainly an overlap here, and I think this is an issue that the Minister has not addressed. On the question of advertising, passing on information regarding products to retailers, retailers at this stage are not allowed to receive information unless they also happen to be a practitioner or have the appropriate qualification. A large number of retailers are not qualified. SurelyÂ·it would be possible to institute some system of associate membership, or recognition of their particular skills, for this group. Strictly speaking, of course, they will not be allowed to receive information; in practice, of course, that will be bypassed. All in all this is such a disaster for the traditional medicine industry that one company, RP. Scherer Pty Ltd, said that it had decided not to proceed with a development project which would have invested some $25m in the State of Victoria. And, goodness knows, the State of Victoria needs all the help it can get at present. The company is refraining from proceeding with that $25m project simply because these regulations would make the company uncompetitive. Although there are some other minor reasons, that is the thrust of the company's complaint and the thrust of the reason why it is not going to proceed with that project. The bottom line of these regulations is to ask whether they will improve the industry. The answer is no, they - ill not. Will they make better drugs avaIlable to the public? The answer is no, they will not. Will they offer worthwhile, balanced protection to the public? The answer is no, they will not. Will they maintain freedom of choice, particularly in relation to herbal and alternative medicine products? The answer is no, they will not; there will be a restriction in the number of products available. Will they strengthen the industry? The answer is clearly they will not. Will they increase exports? The answer again is clearly they will not. What they will do is simply to impose a bigger, more intrusive bureaucracy. They will increase costs to both the companies and the consumers and they will restrict the choice. The regulations should be disallowed.",114
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REGULATIONS,Mr Cowan)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,118
151,Mr WALKER,REGULATIONS,"One hears some negative people in this place, but the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) is the most negative speaker I have ever heard. That is not surprising, of course, coming from the Opposition. The passage of the Therapeutic Goods Act through the Parliament has not been without its difficulties. Much of the opposition came from producers and practitioners of alternative medicine products who were concerned that their products would be more expensive and harder to get at and that naturopaths, homoeopaths and herbalists would not be able to practise. But that has not been the case. It was not the objective of the legislation, which was directed at unifying laws throughout this country. One of the great problems of Australia that have impeded our industry and our progress as a nation is having a Constitution whereby we have six or seven sets of different laws, in conflict with one other and causing manufacturers of products tremendous problems in complying with them. The purpose of the legislation was to eliminate that particular problem. As the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) pointed out, there is not one of the provisions in these regulations that does not appear somewhere in the laws of Australia at the moment. This set of regulations seeks to unify those laws under one simple set that everyone knows and can comply with. The objects of the legislation were directed at ensuring that drugs and products, including herbal remedies, homoeopathic medicines and vitamin mineral supplements, were safe, effective, of high quality and marketed in an honest and responsible manner. It is fair to say that the Opposition opposed the legislation merely on ideological grounds. The Opposition is opposed to unnecessary regulation, particularly when its friends in industry feel that they may have to contribute something to that regulation. The Australian Democrats were initially extraordinarily suspicious of the hidden agendas and unforeseen implications that they thought might be in the legislation, although their views changed as discussions ensued. The Bill eventually passed the Senate with the support of the Australian Democrats in December 1989, but only then on the basis that the regulations with which we are now dealing had to be approved before the Act was promulgated. The regulations duly appeared early in 1990 but were disallowed in the Senate in May of that year-the Democrats on that occasion taking the view, like Sir Humphrey, that the community had not received sufficient opportunity to consult with the Government and the legislature about their ramifications. I suppose that is fair enough in an area like this, because consultation is very important indeed. The extraordinarily lengthy consultations that occurred throughout the Australian community at least had an educative effect, and many of the myths and shibboleths that were being put up against these regan- ulations evaporated as people understood what the true objectives of the laws were. However, the Opposition, true to its beliefs, continued with its ideological view, asserting as it does today that the regulations are too restrictive and that they place unnecessary controls and red tape on industry-'So we lose a few lives, but that is okay. Provided profits are up, that is good'. The Opposition was not concerned that other countries were also looking at these sorts of substances and applying strictions to them and that perhaps if did have an orderly industry, our export industry might well be more successful the long run. The Opposition foresaw that the new code would create problems in the export industry, and that again was repeated day, and would give an unfair advantage to imports. The Opposition argues that the new fees and charges will inhibit new overseas wonder drugs coming into the country, as they will not be trialled because it is easier to trial them in tries that have no regulations. This is fectly true, and the drug companies of world do that. Of course there are some great disasters in some of these countries where these drugs are trialled. I do not want my constituents being guinea pigs that for the trials of foreign drug companies. If that is what the Opposition wants Ausstudent tralia to be, then so be it; but I am pleased that the Government of Australia at the moment does not take that particular VIew. The Democrats were reassured to a carcinogenic considerable extent by the amendments that are before the House in the form the new regulations and the promised amendments. There are further amendtarragon ments which are part of that arrangement with the Democrats. That may surprise the honourable member for Lowe-that often fatal to humans. the Government has given undertakings to make further amendments in due course-but that is not an unusual procedure in any of the parliaments of this country. The Democrats have conceded it is imcase, portant that these regulations pass as soon as possible to restore certainty and to pel much of the misinformation and many of the myths that have been mischiethat vously circulated by the coalition and ers. They should be put through the House now, and if there are further amendments down the track they should occur then; but the whole scheme should not be held up for a few amendments. The regulations before the House are directed at controlling the manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic goods reway that will give protection to conwe sumers. They will ensure that products are pure and not deleterious to conin sumers, not only by imposing standards on the products but also by ensuring hygiene in their manufacture. The advertising controls are directed at toridding the community of the quackery that has traditionally beset the industry with con men peddling lantana cancer cures, miracle hair and virility restorers and the like. It may be okay for the Ophere position-it certainly was okay for the counformer Premier of Queensland who was perquite happy to promote those sorts of the miracle cures-but it is not okay for the Government and the people of Australia. There are many decent but simplistic souls in our commlJnity who take the view if a substance is natural, it is safe but if it is synthesised, it is dangerous. Any of history would know otherwise, as natural poisons have played a role in determining the fate of many a monarch, emperor and politician. Tobacco is a natural substance, but its effects are responsible for the deaths of mi;lny Australians each year. A of wide range of innocent natural herbs and substances including mushrooms, pepper, and honey carry traces of carcinogens and other deadly toxins, which if concentrated can prove dangerous and Once we accept that these substances can be dangerous, the Government has a duty to protect consumers from misuse. The honourable member for Lowe and the Opposition do not feel that is the but any sensible person in Australia would agree that if people are likely to disdie or be seriously injured by these substances, government has a duty to ensure they are properly controlled, reguothlated and well and properly marketed. I know that the Opposition objects to controls on the marketing, but this is an area, as I said, of con men and quackery where all sorts of wild and outrageous claims are made. People are taken in by advertising campaigns and they purchase these inappropriate goods which are either in a useless or damaging to them. A great deal of consultation has occurred in arriving at these regulations. The process was meaningful and it involved representatives of the industry, practitioners and consumers. These amendments are the result. There were many significant amendments and concessions that were made in that process and I think it is important to mention a few of them. There has been an exemption from the professional advertising provisions extended to members of the identified homoeopathic and natural therapy associations; a number of additional nutritional substances merely have to be listed instead of having to be registered; appropriate recognition has been given to manufacturers of alternative medicines by giving them a position on the Therapeutic Goods Committee; arguments about the impact of fees and charges were listened to and adjustments made in the scales, notably reduction of licensing charges on manufacturers of herbal and homoeopathic products; the annual registration charge has been waived for low turnover businesses; the production and processing of raw herbs for licensed manufacturers has been exempted from the codes and generous extension of time has been granted to manufacturers of dried herbal goods before they have to achieve the new standards; and a new committee has been established for the registration of traditional medicines. Its membership will include both manufacturers and practitioners. Also, the licence fee on small manufacturers, those with a turnover of $50,000 per annum, has been halved; and manufacturers of components for therapeutic devices which directly contact body tissue or fluids have been exempted from the licensing provisions. The extensive dialogue which produced these amendments will not cease on the passing of these regulations and no doubt further amendments will be forthcoming as the scheme beds down. One of the fallacious arguments that has been trotted out by the Opposition is that consumers will be burdened by huge price hikes because of the new fee structure. The facts are that the fees represent only a few cents per item-a small price, I would submit, to pay for the protection consumers will have from unsafe, poor quality and phoney goods. The role of practitioners will be enhanced, not only because they too will receive truthful product information and be protected from bad products, but also the public will be seeking out their services rather than relying on products promoting self-treatment. Practitioners will also have a say on the various committees regulating their industry. Manufacturers have an interest in seeing uniform Australia wide legislation in place. It is true that they will be picking up half the tab for the system of registration, but they know that they will now have a real say in the committees that will be making the important decisions on the future of their industry. There is really nothing in these regulations, as I said, that has not been in the laws of the States of Australia in the past. These are simply a set of uniform regulations imposing controls that are very much needed in this country. The Government is to be congratulated on introducing a truly national system which can only be in the interests of the industry and, most importantly, Australian consumers. . . Mr CHARLES (La Trobe) (4,43)-The therapeutic goods regulations which we are examining today are intended to empower the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. In one way or another each and every Australian is affected by the implications and impact of these regulations. All of us at some time or other use therapeutic products, whether by choice or prescription. In May 1990, the coalition was able to effect disallowance of the regulations as then presented. It is a pity that the Government has not used the intervening months to take into consideration more of our objections which were based on community and industry input. If it had not been for the unscrupulous Australian Democrats ignoring the pleas of their constituents, selling out their traditional voter base, we would not be debating these regulations today; so much for keeping them honest. The views of those Australians whoÂ· choose to use alternative therapies and alternative medicines are clearly being ignored. The purpose of the Act is to secure the protection of individuals in relation to the supply and manufacture of therapeutic goods by providing a national system of control encompassing equality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods for use in and export from Australia. No one would disagree that protection of the public, both practically and through advertising guidelines, is important. But we also have an obligation to draw the line between individual choice and bureaucratic regulation. The State, represented by the Federal Government, does not have the right to rule and regulate every vestige of community life. Our obligation in this Parliament is to provide frameworks within which people can choose the type of health care they desire, whether it be mainstream medicine with its use of prescription pharmaceuticals or alternative therapies with nutritional supplements and herbal remedies. In a letter from the Natural Medicine Defence Movement the opinions of the wider natural therapy industry are made very clear. The letter says: In general the Natural Therapy Industry applauds and welcomes the aims of the TGA and its associated Regulations of one uniform national system of control for the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods. However, the legislation which has been passed (TGA) and drafted (TGA Regs) to achieve these aims have gone outside of their field of reference and inso doing affect greatly the manufacturers and practitioners of the Natural Therapy profession and ultimately the public. This is because this legislation affects 'tools of trade' of a Natural Therapist-ie: the therapeutic goods that he/she uses. Thus when some 'tools of trade' are no longer available because they are uneconomic for a manufacturer to produce, or if he does it is too expensive for the client/patient, or they are on the registrable list, reg. the amino acid methionine] then the natural therapists may find him/herself in the situation where he can no longer operate financially and ceases his practice. Hence the public no longer have 'freedom of choice' of their health practitioner . . . Australia has an international reputation for providing high quality, clean herbal products yet these regulations may just be the beginning of the end for what was an emerging and expanding herbal export industry. These regulations have the potential to impose draconian restrictions on many people in our community who seek an alternative to manufactured, highly potent pharmaceuticals when choosing their method of health care and those who endeavour to provide the raw materials for that choice to be available. The Act to which these regulations attach raised considerable turmoil in the community. It was seen as unwieldy, bureaucratic government interference in public choice of alternative health care.Â· Pharmaceutical manufacturers and herbalists alike, threw up their hands in horror at what they saw as Big Brother legislating to protect the public from the perceived manipulation by a small minority of unscrupulous pedlars of wonder cures. A national system that is uniform, efficient and streamlined is an admirableÂ· objective. However, these regulations effect just one more layer of bureaucracy. They are anything but efficient, anything but streamlined, and will not produce national' uniformity. I understand from the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia that: . . . there is still little evjdence to show that the States will all draft and pass the various complementary legislation or repeal existing legislation which is necessary for such a system to operate. Mr Deputy Speaker, what is this Government really about when it introduces regulations that are only an excuse for imposing another level of bureaucracy that the becomes self-generating-regulations for the sake of regulating; public servants creeither ating more jobs for more public servants in order to impose an even greater number of oppressive regulations on the already overburdened private sector and small business. In Australia today, we are attempting to develop an increased productivity in order to pay for the lifestyles which we expect and enjoy, lifestyles which we accept as our right, but which our forebears fought the elements and governments to develop. We are the envy of maqy of our international neighbours because of the freedom and space which we take so much for granted. But this Government is throwing more and more money into regulations which will impose restrictions unnecessarily on a whole range of therapeutic goods, regulations that will severely restrict people's right to choose alternative methods of health care. I would have thought that in this day and age, when the demand on the health dollar exceeds supply, regulations to restrict the production, advertising and sale of non-pharmaceutical benefits scheme items would be discouraged, not imposed. Imposition of another level of bureaucracy for the sake of it and charging a fee for service to the tune of some $ 15m-plus per year is surely an act of lunacy. Dr Gerda Mark of the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health is reported as saying that to build a similar infrastructure to that of the United States Federal Drug Administration would require enormous investments. Pharmaceutical companies are hopeful that reciprocal agreements can be negotiated in order to minimise lead times for new and old products with overseas regulatory agencies such as the Federal Drug Administration. I am concerned that these regulations will become an administrative nightmare imposing unnecessary restrictive practices on a newly emerging preventative health care industry to such an extent as to kill it off before it has the opportunity to mature. One. medium sized manufacturer whose current manufacturing practice already exceeds the guidelines proposed by the regulations advises that his cost pursuant to item 10, schedule 3, for testing, clinical trialing, listing, inspecting era could quite easily reach $14,000 per item for a product containing an amino acid. The regulations lump potent pharmaceutical drugs, nutritional supplements and herbal products all in together for extremely doubtful end community benefit. If the Act and regulations function to truly rationalise the regulatory framework in all areas and for all devices and if they were fair, then there would be a positive end cost result. We would then have increased efficiency and superior service with minimal government interference in personal choice. These regulations will have the opposite 'effect. They will impose more bureaucracy without any real beneficial outcome to the consumer. It will take an unbelievable amount of time to get approval for clinical trials for products already trialled internationally. Questions have been raised as to where the advertising ends and editorial begins. The publisher of the Australian Wellbeing magazine claims that where an editorial is placed opposite an advertisement for a similar product, that editorial is deemed then to be advertising. One will find that in section 3(1) of the Act. There is a distinct bias in this regard against nutritional supplements and in favour of the magical powers claimed by some foodstuffs. Although the therapeutic goods. administration (TGA) advises that the Minister has announced he intends to set up a traditional medicines evaluation committee to evaluate herbal and biological products which will need to be registered, the industry believes that unless that committee is a statutory body set up by legislation then its future survival is doubtful Considering the manner in which the Government has relentlessly pursued the introduction of these regulations, it would appear their fears may, indeed, be well grounded. Furthermore, the evaluation of nutritional and homoeopathic products will be left to the PMAC in Victoria, which the alternative medicine industry believes is counterproductive and even suicidal due to the PMAC's reputation for being biased against that type of product. et cetThe argument is that the PMAC is not only biased against alternative medicines and remedies, but has no expertise in the field of nutritional medicine which is a highly specialised field. Foods are excluded from the Act-section 3 (1): interpretations of therapeutic goods-yet fructose, glucose, lecithin, fish oil and pectin are all listed in schedule 3, part 5, as substances which must be listed. The issue of delineation between foods and therapeutic goods has been raised several times with the TGA, but no clear guideliries have ensued. For example, foods that are claimed to have certain properties that have the potential to lower blood cholesterol levels are supposedly making a nutritional claim and are not covered by the Act. Yet if that same product is manufactured into capsule form and makes a similar claim, it is required to conform with the Therapeutic Goods Act and these regulations. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: is glucose a food? Concern has been expressed that only toothpastes containing fluoride as the sole active ingredient are exempt from the licensing requirements. The heavy metal fluoride is a known allergen yet is free to be used, whereas a toothpaste containing an active herbal ingredient will have to be listed. Similarly, antiperspirants containing inorganic salts of aluminium, zinc or zirconium-all metals which have proven side-effectswill not have to be listed, whereas herbal alternatives will fall within these regulations. Despite repeated requests to the TGA, there is still no definition for bioflavanoids, yet they are expected to be listed. Concern has been expressed regarding inconsistencies between schedule 1, part 3, and schedule 3, part 2. These will still need to be ironed out. Although registered and listed products will have unique numbers, the issue of which numbers are to be used on such substances as vitamin C when used as a preservative in food requires very specific clarification. It is clear that the regulations still contain many items of contention from both the pharmaceutical manufacturers and alternative therapists point of view. Until such time as these matters are satisfactorily dealt with, I cannot support the regulations. I believe we should be moving for a full parliamentary inquiry into the whole issue of therapeutic goods and their impact on the health care industry and preventative medicine. I would like to close by saying that one of the least expensive changes we could make in this country to reduce health care costs would be to increase our efforts in the area of health promotion and disease prevention. On the one hand, we have in place programs such as 'Life. Be in it.' and, on the other, this Government is prepared to stifle the growth of a health care industry that works with the whole person in the pursuit of wellness. The old saying that prevention is better than cure is to be encouraged, not stifled by overregulation. Once again, I implore the Minister to reconsider these regulations.",118
152,Mr NEWELL,REGULATIONS,"I rise to support the regulations that are coming through today. It was sometime during last year that the Senate disallowed the previous therapeutic goods regulations to provide the opportunity for further public consultation-and there is no doubt that the Government did engage in consultation and has taken on board some of the opinions of people who are involved in the industry. It certainly pleased a lot of people in my electorate who took the opportunity to consult with me and pass on petitions and letters of concern which I forwarded through to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples); they are certainly very pleased, that he has acted upon their concerns in the intervening time. With that public debate which occurred in that time and the consultation which occurred, the revised regulations certainly reflect the concern that the Minister has felt-and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) pointed out that, in that intervening time also, there was a lot of superfluous material that was raised or issues that were raised, and not all of it has come from those users in the industry, but a lot has come from the industry itself. In overcoming that sort of propaganda it proved necessary continually to remind people that the purpose of the legislation was to establish a national system to ensure that the public was protected from substances which may be unsafe or ineffective and which are supplied commercially to practitioners or to consumers. It is that level of protection, which we tend to take for granted in a lot of industries, that is being implemented here with the therapeutic goods regulations. Although therapeutic medicines and modern medicines are being used to improve people's health, there is a certain amount of risk involved because medicines manipulate what happens in the body . Very few medicines, whether natural medicines or industrially produced medicines, do not have that effect. People's different genetic make-up can result in different effects. At a time when there is a move towards international cooperation in the regulation of this industry, the passing of these regulations will ensure that Australia is able to participate in international developments to regulate the industry. Certainly our membership of that international group will be able to go ahead. The honourable member for Robertson pointed out that the implementation of these regulations signals a giant step wards cooperation between State and Commonwealth governments. In particular, health Ministers have been consulting overÂ· a number of years on this matter. I am pleased to say that at last we are getting towards the stage where we will have some results for the industry and for consumers in particular. The new legislation will replace the different Federal, State and Territory legislation, which tained some potentially dangerous problems in duplication and loopholes that affected consumers and the industry. The Minister also pointed out that the new Act and its regulations do not introduce any regulatory requirements which are not already in existence in at least some part of Australia. I find that amazing. The development of the Act has provided the opportunity for a review of the level of regulation of therapeutic goods. Indeed, it has been pointed out that there will be a lessening of current requirements in some areas where this is not detrimental to public interest. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was' most concerned about the aspect of regulations. He described them as regulations for regulation's sake. However, we have to keep in mind that we are working in the public interest. During the period of consultation since last May, the Minister and the bureaucrats, as he described them, have taken on board the concerns of the industry; and the Government has acted. Following on from that, one aspect that might be deemed to be new is the registration and licensing fees, to which the honourable member for La Trobe referred. Certainly some action there is in line with efforts to target better the source of government costs, and it is consistent with international trends in this regard. I remind honourable members on both sides of the House who are concerned about this that, regardless of the nature of the medicines we are talking about, whether they be registrable or listable, there is still some risk involved for some people taking those medicines, although for most people there is none. However, to- we have to weigh up the costs to the taxpayer if we do not regulate. Much as people might malign the bureaucrats and the industry and the intervention of government, I think it is only fair to put on record that we regulate not for the sake of regulating but to try to mitigate that risk. Thankfully, the regulations now provide for different levels of registration and conscrutiny. Where a medicine contains a scheduled substance, whether it is toxic or an alternative medicine intended to be used in the treatment of a serious medical condition, it is now necessary to establish the product's safety and effectiveness, and registration involving more detailed scrutiny will be necessary. At the same time, a product which does not require that sort of registration or scrutiny can be listed and continue to be used. A lot of products do not present a risk. However, as has been pointed out, even if a product does not present a high level of risk, we have to make sure that it is manufactured and distributed in conditions which do not lead to any sort of contamination. One concern expressed in the debate related to the restrictions on advertising. I am pleased that the regulations contain some restrictions on the promotion of products to the public to ensure that the' advertising is truthful. Equally important, the promotion does not encourage inappropriate self-diagnosis and treatment where the input of a trained health care practitioner is necessary. Following on from that, certain aspects of advertising are exempt from the restrictions. For instance, the promotion of goods to trained health care workers is exempted, which is fair enough. Included in that exemption are alternative therapy practitioners registered under State or Territory legislation. Also taken on board was the fact that few alternative therapy practitioners are registered at this stage. Until registration is more generally available, it is nice to know that the alternative therapy industry is to be allowed to selfregulate the advertising of products to practitioners on the understanding that the practitioner community identifies an appropriate level of accreditation and the manufacturers put a code of advertising conduct into place. Again, I think that is a result of the good Minister's preparedness to consult with the industry and the consumers. Provision has been made for the two bodies, the National Conference of Natural Therapies and the Australian Homoeopathic Registration Board, to fulfil the first function by providing a list of associations for inclusion in the regulations, which has been done, and for the Nutritional Foods Association to have responsibility for the second function. I am also pleased to see that the discussions with the industry and practitioner groups have resulted in a number of amendments to the regulations. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) made much of the purpose of the amendments and what that meant for the legislation and the regulations. With the Board in place, it is only fair that there should be provision for regulations to come forward as the Committee consults with the Minister. The extension of professional advertising exemption to members identified by the Homoeopathic and Natural Therapy Association is to be applauded. The provision for homoeopathic products provided to practitioners to be treated as listable rather than registrable is commendable, as is the complete exemption from product certification and licensing requirements of many of the more dilute mixed homoeopathic products. The acceptance of various additional nutritional substances for listing rather than registration has met with approval by practitioners and consumers. People have been concerned that vitamins and herbal remedies would become more expensive, and they have indicated to me that they are pleased with some of the changes that have come about through the regulations. The representation of manufacturers of alternative medicines on the Therapeutic Goods Committee did allay a lot of fears that the Therapeutic Goods Act was an instrument of industry and not in the best interests of consumers. People have indicated to me that the adjustments to the scale of fees and charges, including those reduced licensing charges for manufacturers of herbal and homoeopathic products, and the waiving of the annual registration or listing charge are quite satisfactory. This listing charge would constitute some 2 per cent or more of the value of the annual wholesale turnover of the product. These aspects have gone a long way towards satisfying those people in the therapeutic goods industry. Probably the matter which has most allayed their fears is the establishment of the Traditional Medicines Evaluation Committee, with the Minister appointing various members. That Committee has certainly gone a long way towards ensuring that the regulations and the ongoing amendments or changes to the regulations have input from and are under some sort of control by the industry. That particular matter was welcomed by both myself and the industry in my electorate. It is probably a little harsh to say this, but there is no doubt that prior to the reexamination of these regulations the Government, in its determination or zealousness to see the industry brought up to standard and on a national and international basis whereby we could hold our heads high, did act a little bit quickly and hastily. Certainly the Traditional Medicines Evaluation Committee is a step in the right direction towards healing that breach which developed to some extent between the people practising natural therapies and the Federal Government. The formation of the Committee, following consultations, ought to be applauded. I compliment the Minister on his rethink because it gave so much heart to those people who persevered with their arguments, petitions and letters and organised all that support. I know they are very pleased that these regulations have been changed and are finally going through the House. Lastly, there is little doubt that natural therapies will play an increasing part in the lives of people throughout Australia. As the honourable member for La Trobe pointed out, it gives people a choice of medicines. That must not be disregarded or downplayed. It is most important that people are not channelled into industrial medicine but do have a choice and can rely more on the traditional aspects of medicine. After all, these traditional medicines we are talking about have been around for several thousands of years. The modern medicines that most of us are used to have only been with us for 100 or 200 years. So there is a great deal of experience there which we must not disregard. I am pleased that the Minister has listened to the industry and has instituted this Committee, and over the next few months we will be looking at how the industry channels concerns to the Committee, which will consult with the Minister, to see if any regulations need changing in the future.",123
153,Mr BRADFORD,REGULATIONS,"MCPherson) (5.13)I was interested to hear the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) speaking on this debate this afternoon because his electorate, which forms the northern part of New South Wales immediately to the south of mine, will be a very health conscious area, and many residents of the electorate of Richmond will be the sort of people who rely heavily on natural therapies and remedies. I hope that the honourable member for Richmond understands that he may be doing a disservice to many of his constituents by supporting these regulations. I wonder whether he has in fact consulted widely with the people in his electorate. I suppose that even people in his own home town of Mullumbimby, which is not an average little Australian village by any means, are very health conscious. I was quite astounded to' hear a short time ago the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) congratulating everyone who had been involved in the process of establishing these regulations, including, I assume, congratulating himself, for reaching what he termed some agreement. Yet my impression of what has gone on out there, and is still going on out there, in the real world is to the contrary. The Minister assures us that there has been substantial agreement at the last minute in consultation with, of all people, the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats have agreed to support these regulations, and they have apparently become acceptable to everybody, but I assure the House and the Australian people at large that they certainly remain unacceptable to the Liberal-National Party Opposition in the House of Representatives. After all the aggravation-and the Minister refers to the years that this matter has been going on-that this matter has caused those involved in the traditional therapies' professions and so on, the Minister assures us that all is now rosy. We heard that if it is not all rosy, it will be very soon. The Minister says, 'Trust me in respect of this matter'. I wonder whether we really can. The Minister summed the matter up as being a matter of consumer protection. We are talking about consumer protection. But I need to remind the Minister that there are both costs and benefits associated with any regulation and ultimately we must make, hopefully, an objective assessment whether the costs outweigh the benefits. In this matter there are considerable costs associated with overregulation. The type of bureaucracy that these regulations create has already been alluded to and is quite staggering, to say the least. As far as I can estimate or calculate, the cost of implementing and enforcing the regulations is between $30m and $32m per annum. The cost of maintaining the regulations each year will be almost as much. Yet the fees and charges that are being imposed on the industry are expected to raise between $16m and $17m. In other words, not only is the consumer directly affected by the inevitable increase in the cost of vitamins, herbal products and therapeutic devices but also, of course, a proportion of their taxes is being spent funding an unnecessary bureaucracy which brings ultimately limited, if any, real benefits to the consumer. I do not think that we on this side have ever disputed, and certainly the industries involved have not disputed, that there is a demonstrated need for a national system of control relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic products. I think it is fair to say that there has been a general recognition by all parties involved of a need for a national system of regulations of some sort. The Opposition has supported the objectives of the Therapeutic Goods Act in broad terms and generally the concept of these regulations. But we have not supported the details of these regulations and the way in which this Act will be implemented. It is not surprising that many health conscious people also live in my electorate of MCPherson which, as I have said, is adjacent to the electorate of the honourable member for Richmond. It is a very attractive environment that helps promote a healthy lifestyle, and alternative medicines, as both preventative and curati ve measures, are very popular. I am pleased to say that several businesses have been established in my electorate dealinwith herbal therapeutic goods and many health food stores abound in most of our shopping centres. However, the Government apparently has a real problem with the growing emergence of the natural therapies' profession and the growth of the therapeutic goods industry. I admit, and I think everyone understands, that we ought to be concerned about so-called miraculous cancer cures and preying on the desperation of those suffering from ill health. As I have said, none of us has any argument with protecting people from the sort of people who promote those types of cures and remedies. What we are saying on this side, and what has been so ably said by the previous two speakers on this side, is that we simply believe in this particular case that the Government has gone right over the top in regulation-if you like, has thrown the baby out with the bath water. Let us look at the way that this Act will be administered and get an idea of the extent of the bureaucracy involved in it. There will be a therapeutic goods committee. We are good on using abbreviations these days. This committee will be the TGC. There will be an Australian drugs evaluation committee, that is, ADEC; a therapeutic device evaluation committee, that is, TDEC; and a traditional medicines evaluation committee, that is, TMEC. As I understand it, that committee, happily, will be constituted by people directly involved in the industry. It appears, however, that the Victorian Proprietary Medicines Advisory Council, the PMAC, will be reconstituted to become a Federal PMAC; as such, it will be the evaluator of nutritional products for the Government. In other words, that Victorian committee will be contracted to undertake evaluation on behalf of the Commonwealth. Everybody knows-and most of the input in my own experience with this committee tells me-that the six people on that committee as it is constituted have had a long term antipathy towards natural therapies and herbal remedies. The only concession that has been granted is that that committee will be extended from six members to eight; the additional two will have some empathy towards the products that they are dealing with. That particular committee's expertise lies in evaluating proprietary medicinesin other words, those that are patented. Surely, with the types of products that we are talking about here, it would have been wise to have extended the committee even further beyond the original six and now the proposed eight members. It seems to me that common sense dictates that people with expertise and interest in the alternative medicine industry should be consulted when examining therapeutic goods of the nature that we are looking at. I am not saying that they have not been consulted in the establishment of these regulations, because there has been a process of consultation-in the Minister's words, almost an ad nauseam process. We are talking about ongoing consultation with those who are actually involved. While I am talking about consultation, I believe the Government has failed to consult with the States on whether their existing legislation relating to therapeutic goods will be repealed or changed in order to act in a way complementary to the new Federal system. Many people within the industry are quite justifiably horrified at the prospect of having to manufacture and retail goods competitively within such a bureaucracy. Our bottom line concern centres on the establishment of these bureaucracies, the extent of the regulation that is being implemented. The bottom line, I suppose, in any industry-and certainly in Australia at this time with the manyÂ· problems that we have-must surely be competitiveness. This, of all times in Australia, is a time when we desperately need to encourage export industries. We have in some respects here before us some possibilities, some budding export industries. The fees and charges that are proposed in this legislation will certainly make our products less competitive on the world market. Although I cannot think of any reasons why, it makes me wonder whether the Government is not really determined to destroy this industry through over-regulation. Not only will the herbal-related industry be affected by the imposition of fees on individual products, but the cost of having to comply with the proposed code of manufacturing practice is estimated to cost some small manufacturers an extra 12 to 15 per cent of each product. In anybody's terms, that is surely quite a hike in the cost of a product at a time when most of the products are already priced close to the point where many people cannot afford to buy them-bearing in mind that they do not get any assistance from the Government in buying them in any case. On top of that, it will be illegal for any manufacturer to provide a health product retailer with educational material for the proposed uses of products. After having registered their products, gone through all the trouble of adhering to the code of good manufacturing practice, and still being in business at this time and having a product on the shelves, they will be unable to tell people how to use their product or what the apparent benefits of using it are. Quite amazingly, it will be illegal to claim that nutritional products have any value for the maintenance of normal health. This is despite the thousands of books that have been written and the extensive research that has been done on the importance of nutrition, just to pick on one small part of the argument. Considering the costs to the community in maintaining hospitals and medical treatment-and the Minister would be as aware as anyone of those costs-one wonders why the Government would spend millions of dollars to protect the population at large from nutritional products which have no harmful side effects but, rather, assist mental and physical health and well-being. The bottom line, as I said, really amounts to freedom of choice. We on this side of the House believe very strongly that consumers should be allowed to decide what products they want to use and should not be penalised through what amounts to a form of tax on therapeutic goods. I received a letter late last year from the Managing Director of a Queensland company called Natural Health Products Pty Ltd, which distributes vitamins and health supplements to 1,500 health retailers throughout Australia. Perhaps the Minister has already heard from Mr Bullivant. Of - all the input that I had on this matter, Mr Bullivant most clearly summed things up for me. He summed up the crux of our opposition to these regulations when he says: The freedom of choice to have access to a variety of alternative medicines and food supplements, as well as information for their uses, is essential. It is the basis of the democratic principles by which we live and by which our country is governed. It seems to me that the regulations that we are considering at the moment-and by not being aware of what changes the Minister is foreshadowing-actually diminish the value of those products for the people who want to use them. The regulations inhibit freedom of choice simply by making some things too expensive for people to buy and by putting out of business people who are struggling now. A number of manufacturers in my own electorate have told me that. Business is not good for them, they are struggling at this very moment to survive and honestly believe that they may be put out of business quite unnecessarily. Notwithstanding the Minister's earlier stated enthusiasm and congratulatory remarks to everyone involved that this was all over and the problems were all solved-or, if not solved, about to be solved-I want to make it clear to him that, from the input that I have had, many sections of the industry remain deeply concerned. The Minister should be aware of that, and I hope he is. The legislation that will be enacted and the regulations that will be passed, I assume, here today give bureaucrats a very powerful tool. If those regulations are applied rigidly-and that is with the sort of pharmaceutical philosophy-then there may well be some very real problems. There are some very significant differences between drugs and natural therapies. I think it is very important that the bureaucrats understand and recognise that. I am assured, for instance, that the national Nutritional Foods Association will be watching very closely.",126
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REGULATIONS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,129
155,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,"in reply-In response to some of the matters raised by honourable members in the debate on the regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, I would like to refer first of all to that raised by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) in relation to drafting changes. It is correct that changes are beingÂ· drafted in these regulations now, as honourable members would expect in most regulations from time to time. The whole purpose of regulations is to allow an easier change or transition. Regulations contain the details of the legislation and they are intended to be able to be amended quickly. The fact that the Government is preparing to make changes to the regulations demonstrates the responsiveness to representations, as the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) has just exhorted me to do. The regulations are of a relatively minor nature in relation to mainly a fee . in the case of a small manufacturer. I can say at this stage that that is the way in which we will address these issues. As situations change. and as reasonable concerns and, suggestions are put to the Government,_by industry, practitioners or consumers, the Government will respond to them because we recognise that we are dealing with a changing industry, changing perceptions and needs, and also changing international situations that need to be taken into account. I make the point that the cost burden is not $30m, as was expressed-that is for the overall cost of the regulations in Australia. The Government will be recovering 50 per cent of that cost and the fees and charges will be set by a unique industrygovernment consultative committee. I think that is something which the industry has been very much interest-d in and responsive to. Dr Bob Woods-Where is the money coming from? us Mr STAPLES-The Government will pay half. Dr Bob Woods-It is taxpayers' money.",129
156,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,"Yes, but obviously the industry itself will also contribute. The honourable member may want to end up with a totally free-wheeling, Third World, non-regulatory system, as some people would suggest, but that is certainly not what this Government is about. I now turn to the honourable member for Lowe's miscalculation with regard to staffing. First, I will put the matter into context. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States employs about 3,000 people. It has agencies that are similar to what we have in the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Countries comparable with Australia, such as Canada and Sweden, have therapeutics administrations which are twice the size of what we are suggesting. The honourable member for Lowe, has failed to take into account the fact that the vast increase in numbers, as he would see it, has been due bringing together a large number of various regulatory agencies relating to therapeutic goods and devices into the one body. These are not additional numbers-there has just been a reorganisation of numbers. There has been an increase of 40, out of about 360 in the therapeutic goods administration. Dr Bob Woods-Forty in the last year.",129
157,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,"Yes, it was in the last year, but what the honourable member for Lowe fails to recognise is that a large percentage of that increase has been offset by the fact that States are moving out of compliance monitoring of manufacture (New Drug Entity): Drugs-Lodgement to Decision on Acceptability . - Acceptance to ADEC* - ADEC to Approval** Total . . . . . . . .

As Tabled by Department of Community Services because of this legislation; so we are not seeing a very large net increase in the administration of this program-particularly considering the decreases in response time that will come about. I think there is a certain paradox in the argument that the Opposition is putting forward. First, it complains that drug regulation processes take too much time and then it complains when staff are added in order to speed up that assessment and regulation. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. If the honourable member talked with the industry he would find that it would welcome the speeding up of its processes and getting faster results rather than simply counting a few extra heads. The comment was made that performance targets have not been described. They have been described. They have been described in discussion papers to the industry. They were tabled by the Department of Community Services and Health in the Senate Estimates Committee hearing and they were also tabled in the debate in the Senate. I. seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table indicating performance targets. Leave granted. The document read as followsWorking days proposed current 30 65 200 300 120 180 350 545 120 165 30 40 130 170 40 60 20 around after 12 months operation Reinspection frequency 12 months will need to be revised. and Health in Senate Estimates Committee.",130
158,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,"I now turn to some of the other claims that have been made, particularly those made by the honourable member for La Trobe. He was concerned that the legislation will remove the consumer's right to choose his or her method of health care treatment and so on. It is all very well to give generalisations, as people often tend to do in debates on such issues, but where exactly in this legislation is the consumer's right to choose removed? In relation to all of these assertions regarding the right to choose a product, where does this legislation talk about the product use being discriminated against or restricted? The purpose of this legislation is to protect consumers from commercial therapeutic goods which are of poor quality or are unsafe or ineffective and to ensure that their promotion is truthful and appropriate. A restriction will apply only to products which do not meet these standards. Is there any restriction on practitioners? No, this is not dealt with at all by the legislation. Is there a restriction on the method of treatment? Again, this is not dealt with by the legislation. This is a part of the incredible misinformation campaign that has gone on against the introduction of the legislation. I know why there has been such a campaign. It is because many practitioners do not have the level of qualification that would be generally accepted when people want treatment for their health. A lot of people are concerned about the fact that the registration and listing of products, and this very process here, will put greater scrutiny on many practitioners in this country who have very little in the way of qualifications. One person may have done 30 or 40 years of work in this field, and due to a lot of study has obtained his or her qualification, and yet that person may be competing with someone on the other side of the street who read an article which appeared at the back of the Readers Digest or did a weekend course. That is the difference and that is what many people with low qualifications are concerned about-that this will eventually lefld to the States setting up better regulatory processes in order to protect the consumer. Let us not stray from the realities of life. A lot has been said about the Victorian Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee, including the claim that it does not have the relevant expertise. This committee has dealt with the Victorian registration system for proprietary medicines for a long time and has been very effective. I certainly understand many of the claims that have been made-that is not a suitable body to deal with traditional medicines-and that is why we set up the Traditional Medicines Evaluation Committee. The composition of the Victorian committee-soon to be seen as a national committee-is to be expanded, as has been indicated, by the addition of an expert in nutrition and a representative of alternative medicine manufacturers. The Traditional Medicines Evaluation Committee has been established despite claims-particularly by the honourable member forÂ· La Trobe-that it would not be. The committee has been established, primarily to evaluate herbal products, and the first meeting of that committee is to take place next week-so much for that rubbish. In terms of the evaluation committees, I will be looking at the performance of the Proprietary Medicines Evaluation Committee and I will be addressing the point about nutritional foods. I have given an undertaking to the manufacturers of nutritional foods that I will certainly be watching the processes there and, if need be, I will review those evaluative processes in the future. They understand that and they accept it-which is probably more important. It has been asserted that there is no reason why we cannot accept overseas evaluations. But there are some very good reasons why we cannot accept them. I gave one of those reasons in Question Time today and I will give a couple more now. Dr Bob Woods-Evaluations, not decisions.",131
159,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,It is the same thing. Dr Bob Woods-It is completely different.,132
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REGULATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Lowe.,132
161,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,"In Australia we go through a process of evaluation so that people get products which are safe and which do the job. There are numerous examples of pharmaceutical products that have been evaluated in other countriesevaluations by countries which people on the other side of the House would say we should just accept-which have been approved for marketing in those countries and which have subsequently been shown, often through evaluation in Australia, to be unsafe and they have been withdrawn from sale in those countries that had previously offered them for sale. The same sorts of examples occur in our traditional medicines and in other products in Australia. The products are now coming under some form of scrutiny in their manufacture. There are numerous examples, not just simply of contam i-ation. There should not be one example, If these products are being sold to improve people's health, of people's health being put at risk. We have brought these regulations into protect people. We are safer buying a pie in this country knowing full well what is in that pie-it is made according to good manufacturing standards; it is a pie that has been made in proper hygienic surroundings; it has certain levels of ingredients in itÂ· and it been sold in a proper way-than we are in buying many of the traditional products and medicines. - r Bob Woods-But can you give the eVIdence?",132
162,Mr STAPLES,REGULATIONS,"I can give the honourable member plenty of evidence. I will be quite happy to provide the honourable member for Lowe with a list of a number ?f ex-mples. I have already given some III thIS House. We are trying to achieve good manufacturing practices, things such as batch samples and records of dispatch which do not occur in many places now. As far as industry development is concerned, the honourable member for Lowe got it wrong again. Senator Button did not introduce Factor F. It was introduced by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) as Minister for Health. It was not in Senator Button's portfolio until a couple of weeks ago. In the intervening time since Factor F was introduced in 1987 it has been under the administration of either the honourable member for Bonython or myself. I suggested that it be transferred to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. That was done. But the fact is that this Government is committed to the development of the pharmaceutical industry. One part of that commitment is to ensure under our regulatory processes that products in Australia are fit for Australian and international consumption so that manufacturers can enter quickly into the international markets. We do not walk away from that at all. As far as the States are concernedclaims have been made on the other side of the House that there is no evidence to say that the States will not be introducing complementary legislation-the National Coordinating Committee on Therapeutic Goods ha- very re-ent1y been working through thIS. It IS qUIte clear that there is no disagreement on what the Commonwealth has put forward. Several States have already attributed their complementary legislation a high priority in this year's legislative program. Other States are expected to follow. A number of States are has waiting until the regulations go through the House today. That covers most of what has been discussed in this House today. It is quite clear that what we are seeking to achieve will be respected by the people of Australia.

164,Mr DOBIE,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY," Mr Deputy Speaker, little did I think there would be Hall, Steele Halverson, R. G. (Teller) an audience of this size for this issue. I shall continue with the speech I began last Howard, J. W. Jull, D. F. night on the issue of pulp and paper bleaching and its effect on the environLloyd, B. MCArthur, F. S. ment. I want to say at this time that I find difficulty with the three reports havMACKellar, M. J. R. MCLachlan, I. M. ing been combined in a cognate debate. Confusion is arising because some of us Miles, C. G. Nugent, P. E. wish to speak on each of the issues and that is just not feasible. A cognate debate Prosser, O. D. Reid, N. B. on three such important subjects, particularly the motor car industry report, is Rocher, A. C. Ronaldson, M. J. C. not appropriate. I believe the Government stands condemned for hiding the Scott, Bruce Shack, P. D. report on the motor car industry in a cognate debate.",133
165,Mr CADMAN,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,Well said.,133
166,Mr DOBIE,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable Truss, W. E. Tuckey, C. W. member for Mitchell for his enthusiastic support on that point. The report I will Wilson, I. B. C. Woods, Bob speak on is just an information report. Last night I discussed the issue of pulp. I guess the challenge we have to face is finding techniques that will have the least environmental cost. From reading this report, it would appear that we are still a considerable way off being able to respond to that challenge with success. Obviously, much investigation and research needs to be done. The report concedes that the effects of the discharge of organochlorins on the natural environment are not completely understood, nor can they be quantified. The report further admits that the effects of the eftluents from bleaching eucalypt kraft mills are largely unknown. This is the real problem as far as removing the harmful effects of bleaching on the environment is concerned. How do we employ the best available technology to reduce organochlorin emissions when the effect of such emissions is not known? This makes the project of comparing methods almost impossible, and certainly difficult. However, I note with some degree of hope the current Commonwealth Government grant of $7.7m over five years on a dollar for dollar basis with the industry and State governments to inquire into this problem. I applaud the objective to achieve the reduction of organochlorins produced in existing mills by a further 90 per cent and, in the longer term, development of organochlorin-free bleaching methods for eucalypt pulp. This is a noble objective and I wish it success. It is my personal view that the Commonwealth grant of $7.7m will lose value over the five-year period. It would appear that the bulk of community concern about discharges from pulp mills focuses on the effects of chlorfor ine bleaching. As long as there exists a demand for high quality paper, chlorine bleaching will exist to service that demand .. While research into alternative bleaching methods is important, equally critical is the consumer attitude to fine papers. I am pleased to note that the report canvasses this very point, namely, the shift in consumer attitudes to lower grade paper products. I shall return to that point later. The environmental impact of chlorine bleaching technology is of concern to many people. While the report does not offer a solution to the problem, its comments about alternative technologies are interesting. I commend it to the attention of honourable members. Organisations participating in the inquiry leading to this report offered differing views on the effects of organochlorin emissions from pulp mills. Not surprisingly, the evidence presented in the report is not supported by all organisations. Therefore, the basic problems of environmental costs associated with the chemical treatment of pulp remain. Of further concern is the fact that alternative technologies to chlorine bleaching also have potentially harmful effects on the natural environment. I regret to say that the two alternatives mentioned in chapter 2 of the report, namely, bleaching chemical pulps with oxygen or hydrogen peroxide and producing and bleaching mechanical pulps with hydrogen peroxide, both have serious environmental consequences. These include increased greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, and increased salinity where eftluent is discharged into rivers and lakes. I would argue that these environmental effects have been researched to a greater degree than has been the case with the effects of organochlorin discharges, and whilst they represent different effects, the threat to the environment is similar. The problem remains. I reiterate my support for the objective I mentioned earlier-namely, to develop organochlorin-free bleaching methods for eucalypt pulp. We must look at the market prospects paper when talking about the viability of non-chlorine based papers. Presently Australia uses both unbleached paper and nonchlorine bleached paper for newsprint, tissues, packaging and industrial papel's. After this year, the report estimates that unbleached or non-chlorine bleached papers will account for over 60 per cent of papers supplied to the Australian market. This can be seen to be a significant proportion, but the repQrt does identify the fact that there will continue to be a demand for chlorine bleached papers for printing and writing purposes. This demand exists both for reasons of quality, and also out of necessity, because bleached paper is required for storing information for long periods. I note with concern that the report identifies only a minor shift in community attitudes regarding bleached paper where demand has not contracted by any significant percentage. As Australians we have accepted lower grade paper for newsprint and packaging for some time, yet submissions to the inquiry seem to indicate we are not ready to substitute non bleached paper for fine papers for writing and printing. Regardless of who is to blame for this lack of change in attitudes, whether it is the consumers for refusing to use such products or the producers for failing to supply unbleached papers or to make consumers aware of environmentally friendly products, this is a worrying trend. It is something each one of us in this House should be concerned about. I believe this aspect of the report is important. While we can talk of available technologies to reduce organochlorin emissions and the like, a basic starting point to the whole area of reducing the environmental impact of pulp mills should be a shift in community attitudes about paper products. This, as I have said, we should all be stressing. I was pleased to read in the report that there has been evidence of a change in consumer preferences in tissue products. For example, Kimberly Clark Australia Pty Ltd identified this trend away from chlorine bleached tissue products and has stated that it would cease using chlorine for bleaching of its pulps at Millicent throughout last year. Johnson and Johnson, although not a producer of wood based tissue pulp, has also announced that it will no longer use tissues bleached with elemental chlorine. Its decision to cease the production of disposable nappies, for example, is a very encouraging, environmentally friendly initiative. These are the encouraging signs from the pulp and paper industry itself. As I have said in a recent speech, it is about time the en vironmental movement acknowledged those industries which have already included the environmental issues as part of their planning processes. There is still a concern with writing and printing paper, where there has been a fairly constant rate of demand, and any shift towards unbleached paper products has been slight. Australian Pulp and Paper Mills (APPM) estimated that the market for writing and printing matter was 740,000 tonnes in 1988-89, of which imports accounted for nearly 50 per cent. The national Paper Marketing Council of Australia has commented that Australians prefer whiter papers than Europeans, and the report notes the success of sales of recycled office paper in Germany, but there is no evidence of a great shift yet in Australia. I think this report tells us that we as consumers must adapt our tastes before we get too cross about the people who are emitting hostile products into our seas. We must show a willingness to move away from bleached paper markets, and move towards non-bleached duller paper for writing and printing. This is a significant way by which emissions of organochlorin can be reduced, and I would urge honourable members to consider that point in any future personal deliberations concerning paper choice. For example, in my last campaign I used 100 per cent recycled paper on all my campaign literature, which was extensive. Some of my envelopes were not of such material because of a shortage of 100 per cent recycled paper at that time throughout Australia. I do not have much time to speak here, but I would say that the issue goes beyond just criticising the paper mills. There is no question but that there are harmful emissions coming from their mills, and they know it. They have been changing their plans for a long time. But along with this demand on the paper mills to adjust, there should also be a demand by people who are environmentalists, such as myself, to acknowledge that consumer attitude changes are equally important. I am glad this report came in. I repeat my comment that I am very sad that the Government, or the management of the House, has not allowed separate debates to take place on each of the three issues that are being debated cognately at this time. I thank the House.",133
167,Dr CATLEY,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"1 would like to talk about the approach of the Industry Commission in general to the economic problems facing this country, and to the automobile industry in particular. Honourable members will be aware that I represent a seat in a State with a high level of protected secondary industry. But the seat itself contains little such industry. It is chiefly a trading and central business district style employer. Nonetheless, I may be seen, perhaps, as trying to represent special interests in the free trade protection debate. I hope that this is not the case, and I would like members to note that in many other areas of economic policy I have adopted what some of my colleagues have seen as an unduly dry economic approach in the interests of economic efficiency. I believe secondary industry is a particular phenomenon and does face serious problems and threats in the contemporary environment, and I believe it should be both nurtured and pushed to be more competitive. The Australian secondary industry basis exists because a portion of our large national economic surplus generated from primary industry was historically diverted to a protected industrial base, and was not just utilised to maintain existing or improved living standards. This welfare state was cosseted by a British imperial structure which has long since passed, and its core has now entered into the European Community. Clearly, opr industrial structure consequentially ha$ needed reform for some time, at least two decades, and delaying that reform has worsened the problem. The products of that industrial structure, it seems to me, are presently faced with three intersecting problems: cheaper imports, high infrastructure costs and uncompetitive production methods. The Industry Commission takes the view that secondary industry is no different from any other economic sector, and that automobile manufacturing should, for example, be subject to precisely the same kind of calculations as, say, racehorse breeding, on-course SP betting, pornography or laundry. I do not disparage these activities, but I do note that all developed nations with mass consumption patterns have a secondary industry base almost by definition, and for most the core of that sector, that industrial base, is automobile and truck production. The reasons for this are various, but two in particular stand out. Mass automobile production generates almost precisely the labour skills, technological levels and capital formations that are required to undertake the mass production of almost any item of mass consumption in a modern society . .It also provides the basis for further movement up the evolutionary ladder for the production of electronics, submarines, information technologies, aerospace industries, and so on. These are the kinds of movements up the technological and capital formation ladder that we should be contemplating in this country, and the automobile industry has, in part, given us the basis to ensure that happily they are within our grasp. In addition to that, motor vehicles are usually the second largest outlay that a household is likely to undertake in the modern world after the home. The production of motor vehiclespresently, anyway-receives natural protection against imports. If a country has a wholly imported automobile sales structure, this will add a heavy and continuing burden to a current account. Australia's industrial base, notably automobiles, has recently in the 1980s in particular been facing stiff competition from rapidly developing economies to our north. Japan was the initiator of a state orchestrated economic development model, which I spoke about last night in the adjournment debate, and this has often been/called export oriented industrialisation, but the classics refer to it more typically as mercantilism. My dictionary of economic terms defines mercantilism in the following way: Domestically, it promoted the interests of the mercantile classes with monopoly licenses and the depression of wages. The essence of the mer-antile t-adition was in international trade. To mcrease Its store. of bullion a country to enJoy a surplus in its balance of trade. To thi- end t-riffs were imposed to protect home export mdustnes and exclude foreign goods Exports of finished goods were encouraged and cheap markets of raw materials were secured by the colonial system . . . Keynes . .. showed that an underemployment equilibrium could receive an addition to effective demand from a surplus in the bala-ce of trade, thus raising the real wealth of a natIOn. This mercantilist model has been consciously adopted by other states in east Asia, often with the assistance of Japanes.e management, technology and capital, WhICh has moved offshore from what is now a higher wage rate Japanese economy, and a similar model has been consciously emulated, particularly in the newly industrialised countries of Korea Taiwan and Singapore and also in a rathe: different way in Hong Kong, because it is the entrepot for communist China and is more latterly being adopted in th- other Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) states. I had the good fortune to visit Thailand last November and saw the initial impetlfs of this ,industrialisation program, assIsted heavily by Japanese capital taking place around the metropolis of Bangkok wh-ch is a kind of emulation of the TokyregJon of 30 or 40 years ago. I visited TokYr last week and I could see how the development model might continue. Th-se econom-es - re the most rapidly growmg economIes m the international econom- and they ar- deliberately seeking out foreIgn markets m accord with mercantilist tradition for consumer goods in de.v-l.oped c<?untry markets, and they are utIhsmg a wIde range of subsidies-some of which are hidden from easy visibility but others of which are quite clear-in order to achieve market shares as their first task. It should be noted. that historically Japan did not accede to the General Agre-ment on Ta-iffs and Trade (GATT) reqUlrements until the 1970s when, its market access already having been substantially achieved, it then developed and began the fierce advocacy of a free trade philosophy to which it had not previously it was necessary for subscribed. An Australian industry structure constructed against the background of a welfare. - tate ..environment designed to maXImIse cItIzen benefits therefore faces competition from competitors seeking long term market shares in order to generate an economic surplus, and in the pursuit of which they will distort their economies by a variety of mechanisms, most of which involve the subvention of exports in some form. These competitors of course are largely - nconstrained by democratically organIsed welfare demands and they are able !o mobilise very substantial savings and ll-ve-t-ent levels and to deploy cheap and dl.sclphned labour forces in conjunction wIth that. The question we face is: how should Australia deal with its exposure to this international trade system? In the first instance, it should give no trade preferences to these countries and s-ould police anti-dumping regulations with great venom. It should also urge democratic and trade union rights on these economies as an adjunct in part to protecting its own economic base as well as projecting its human rights policy. Ii must also clearly ensure that infrastructure costs - hich - re imposed on its own productive mdustnes are kept to a minimum preferably to best international cost 'standards. This has been undertaken by this Government and under the pursuit of microeconomic reform has been continued at the b-st p-ce that can be mustered, given the hlstonc background of the kind of economy that we have constructed and it is doing so in areas as diverse as' education, co--unicatio.n-, transport and wage productIvIty bargammg relationships. It also involves changing national factor shares to the benefit of savings and investment and at the expense of government sector and consumption. This cheapening of industry inputs and costsa. process whic- the Industry CommisSIOn, I do note, IS continually urging, and quite rightly so-is to be welcomed, however awkward it might prove in the short term for the relevant management and labour forces in those sectors which, it must be recognised, have often enjoyed very extensive featherbedding. To this extent, waterfront and transport reform deserve our urgent attention. It is against this background that we need to consider the automobile industry. It has two distinct disadvantages. In the first place, it is concentrated in Victoria and South Australia, and it is widely felt elsewhere that both these States have been greatly assisted as tradable goods producers by the rapid growth of the national economy from 1983 to 1990, and they gilded their lilies by additional and now rather discredited financial stimuli of own. Secondly, the industry has a long history of crying wolf every til,ne tariff cuts are proposed, but after a series of them now nonetheless stands fairly strongly in its marketplace. So it is hardly surprising that the Industry Commission's interim report that tariff levels be cut from the present 35 per cent average to 15 per cent average by 1996 was greeted with wolf howls. The amended report No.5, which we are now considering, essentially recommends eight 2.5 per cent annual cuts to a resulting 15 per cent by the year 2000-that is, it delays it a bit-and that the 15 per cent duty free component input entitlement still be maintained. This is also raising wolf howls but they seem to be somewhat muted. We need a secondary industry base with automobile production at something like its core if we are to advance as a modern economy into the next century, but also that industry must be operating at something close to international competitive price levels. It does remain questionable to my mind whether Australia can actually achieve a full price competitive industry. Last week I visited the Nissan car plant in Japan. Despite media reports and the assurances from my colleagues, the technical level of production in that plant was actually well within the level to be found within those Australian plants that were known to me and fellow members of the delegation. In other words, the level of robotics and automation appeared to be no greater and the involvement of human beings, particularly in the final assembly stages, was no less. The decisive advantage appeared to be in the size of the production runs and thereafter in greatly reduced unit transport costs as a result of dockside location, automated storage facilities and a highly developed export shipping capacity. . I should add that if this industry-our industry-fails to achieve international price competitiveness in the Industry Commission report plan, we would be faced with disemploying about 60,000-odd Australians directly employed in the in their dustry and another 100,000-odd indirectly involved in the industry, which would involve, of course, great social hardship, and the potential balance of payments disaster which would result from the importation of most of our motor vehicles would be an additional disaster. I personally would be very happy if the penetration of the domestic market by domestic production achieved in motor cars, which is 70 per cent to 80 per cent, could be duplicated in the growing information technology. It would also at the same time nearly eliminate our current account deficit. The Industry Commission recommended rate of tariff cuts effectively directs the Australian automobile industry to undertake productivity improvement at about 3 per cent per annum quicker in the 1990s than it is anticipated Japan will undertake. This includes assumptions about successful micro-economic reform that are achievable but are outside carmakers' control. The maintenance of its 15 per cent component import capacity at the same time epsures that much of the improved productivity will come from sourcing overseas at the expense of domestic producers of components. . This is occurring at a rate of the shedding of labour already being undertaken and it makes it unlikely, or much less likely, that automobile manufacturers will be prepared to cough up the $150m required for each model facelift or the $500m required for a new model. So there would be a gradual external deficit move upwards in the sector; domestic production market penetration would decline; and future inquiries would start to inquire as to how Australians can be encouraged to buy Australian motor vehicles. We should pay more attention to the retention of the industry than to its marginal pricing; to its employment generation presumed effects on the GATT directed arguments and to its role in the external current account than to its notional level of subsidy; and that, in addition, some attention should be paid to its geographic concentration and the concentrated results of any dis employment. The Industry Commission report has resulted in a number of responses, most of which will be seen as self-serving by honourable members, coming from the manufacturers on the one side that want a 27 per cent resulting tariff level in the year 2000, through the unions, which appear to have adopted a similar kind of posture. The South Australian Government has adopted something of a compromise position, urging an eight stage 1.25 per cent annual reduction to 25 per cent average rate of tariff by the year 2000 as a means of maintaining efficiency pressures on the industry while retaining its existence. My own view is something like this: we need a more efficient economythere is no question about that and there is a pretty bipartisan pursuit of that objective throughout this House. We need one that can pay its way in the external marketplace, despite being confronted with mercantilist trading rivals, and we need one that can employ all the workers who require work. Unfortunately, however, the last few years have suggested that the Australian economy can only too readily achieve a very happy equilibrium at a very sus. tained level of external deficit, some, if not much of which is generated by the secondary industry deficit which can be reduced largely by the creation of import substitution industries. My view is that the automobile industry is already one of the most important import substituting industries that exist in this country and I would not be too keen to throw it to the twin wolves of its mercantilist competitors overseas and the tenured ORANI modellers. The industry may have been built in very different circumstances; it may have been built with built-in inefficiencies that we should now try and remove, but if it is reduced to a shambles, it will be an extremely difficult industry to reinvent in the prevailing economic and international circumstances.",136
168,Mr MCLACHLAN,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"1 also would like to address the report on the state of the automotive industry which was tabled in May 1990 and reports on the state of the industry in the year before that, so it necessarily reflects slightly happier times in the industry's fortunes than now. Nevertheless, that report warns of an apparent slow-down in the process in progress on rationalisation and peoplebased efficiency improvements, matters which I would like to comment on in a minute. Without spending too much time on the history-the good old days, perhapsin 1989 sales of passenger motor vehicles grew by 9 per cent and production by 14 per cent; exports grew marginally and price increases were held at lower than the consumer price index. Profits improved with plan producers reporting an aggregate profit of $127m on local passenger vehicle production and investment in the industry was strong, although stabilising from strong increases in previous years. As reported by the Automotive Industry Authority, there were even some encouraging signs of an improvement in vehicle quality with seven of the nine local models showing a reduction in their average number of faults. That is something to which this industry has been giving a great amount of attention in the last few years. It has had varying levels of success, but in some cases there have been very satisfactory levels of improvement and success. Nevertheless, it was still clear that ther improvement was needed to narrow the quality gap between local and imported cars. This requirement extended equally to local component suppliers. The Authority also drew attention to major international studies of car assembly plant performance which suggested that Australian plants faced a major challenge to close both productivity and quality gaps with overseas competitors. Two major reasons were identified for Australia's lagging behind: the low levels of automation and a failure to adopt the world best practice management techniques, with the latter category incorporating the need for improvements in factory practice, a more flexible work force and better human relations management. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) say that on his recent visit to Japan he found that some of those things did not look all that different from what one sees on the lines and on the shop floor in this country; I am pleased to hear that. Nevertheless, of course, there is the great difference which I will allude to shortly and that is the matter of productivity increases which can be made on the volume of throughput. However, the Authority finally reported on the people side of the industry and unfortunately reported that in 1989 whilst the sales outlook was rosy, working days lost per 1,000 employees in the industry rose by 92 per cent, in stark contrast to the manufacturing industry in general. There were problems also with continued labour turnover and absenteeism, problems which, unfortunately, from my observations of these plants, continue today. Since that time, of course, the economy has plummeted into a severe recession. Vehicle sales have fallen dramatically in the last few months and every day we seem to hear worse news of companies, both inside and outside the industryparticularly in this industry which is planning further retrenchments. Over the last six or eight months the Ford Motor Co. has either retrenched or plans to retrench around 2,000 people. Nissan Australia recently announced the retrenchment of some 750 workers. BTR Engineering has furretrenched 150 people and doubtless there are smaller concerns experiencing the same sort of problems. In these disastrous economic conditions, car makers find it difficult to see any upturn in sight with sales projected to slump by as much as 10 per cent this year. Of course, the industry has been focusing on the Industry Commission's inquiry into future assistance levels. Perhaps the timing is not quite ideal, at least from its point of view. Understandably in these circumstances, it is difficult for the industry to envisage how further reductions in assistance will help it. We have been urging the industry to take a larger, longer view, and put a more positive interpretation on the inquiry process. First of all, it provides a platform to focus attention on what is required to make the industry truly internationally competitive. Secondly, and more importantly from the industry's point of view, it provides at this time an opportunity for it to put maximum pressure on the Government to remove obstacles which impede progress towards this objective. I notice that the honourable member for Adelaide said words to the effect that micro-economic reform is occurring at the fastest rate we could expect, given the historical perspective from whence we come. I have to say that I disagree, because I believe that when one is behind the eight ball, one's chances of improving, of making the quantum leap, are much greater than, for example, if one is up at the level of productivity improvement of the Japanese at the present time. The reality is that every authority and everyone who has reported on this or any other industry in this country, has said that these impediments need to be removed. At the top of the list is the need for comprehensive industrial relations reform. The auto industry will not stand a chance, whatever else is done, if this is not accomplished very quickly. We have said for a long time now that our primary objective is to help industries such as the car industry. Those in the industry understand that; the car makers understand it; the - omponent makers understand it. In fact, some of the car makers have said to us that they want the right to make their own arrangements at an enterprise level with their own people as they think that that is the next big productivity breakthrough that they can make. It is my view that if one or two of them make it then the rest will follow. They will have to follow; they will be forced; they will be dragged through the door, so to speak. We have the opportunity to make a great leap forward in this respect. The other day when I was at the Ford plant in Geelong, the Managing Director of that company, Jack Nasser, told me that he felt that 40 per cent of its lack of international competitiveness could be dealt with by fixing what he called the 'people problems'. These are not just industrial problems; they are educational and training problems. I said, 'If you had the door shut and you were able to deal with these things in your own terms, make your own arrangements with your own people, train and educate them and get the educational qualifications through the door, how long would it take you to have this place running as you would like in an international sense?' He said, 'I think about five years.' Ford, which is not the least protectionist, nor known to be, of all companies in this country, says that there is yet another 30 per cent that it could pick up if interest rates, the cost of capital and the value of the dollar were at a more realistic level. So there are chances here for us to pick up 70 per cent of our international disadvantage, according to one of our major car manufacturers-certainly at the time this report was released. The Government has demonstrated in recent years-and I fear is about to demonstrate again-that it is prepared to reduce industry assistance without addressing the other areas. Just to pick one of them: if we do not do something about the waterfront, we will stand condemned by the whole of this country and future generations. We have an opportunity and we have examples all around us in other parts of the world where people have taken their opportunities and have achieved 100 per cent and 150 per cent and greater productivity increases in no time flat. We are shipping parts of cars from Tasmania to the USA cheaper than it is to ship them to Adelaide. It is cheaper to air freight cars to New Zealand in some cases to save money on trans-Tasman shipping costs. Those sorts of arrangements are absolutely archaic and must go. lt is incumbent upon the Government, the car manufactures and the whole of this industry to ensure that this unacceptable state of affairs-not only in the areas that I have mentioned but also in the other micro-economic areas, the structural areas-does not continue and to get rid of those costs which impede them. They have a great opportunity; the focus is on their industry and it is on all of those impediments. So I caution industry players against concentrating too much on the level of the tariff post-1992. We all know that a change in the exchange rate can remedy that in a week or two. I think it is fairly clear now that the Government is inclined to accept the Corrimission's recommendation to reduce the tariff to 15 per cent by the year 2000. It is not as fast as we would go. We would take it down to negligible levels, to 5 percentage points by the year 2000. The direction of the Industry Commission's report of recent times is correct, but these other areas simply have to be addressed. I think that we are at a most interesting time in the whole of the history of the automotive industry. As the honourable member for Adelaide has said, the Industry Commission's report has become a little more mild in its final report than it was in the draft. I think I read this morning that the Industry Commission Chairman of the time when the report came out, Mr Cole, said that, in some respects, people thought that the second and final report was a little more wimpish than the first; we, from this side of the House, would agree. But we think it is very important, indeed, that the arrangements for such industries which are necessarily going to have their protection reduced are transparent, gradual, that they are up there for everybody to see and that they are trusted. ""Whilst I do not expect that the Government will be strong enough to pick up our particular position and go all the way to negligible protection by the year 2000which it should-what it certainly should do at least in its own lights is to go all the way to negligible protection several years later, which is recommended in the final report. Of course, there are a number of things which could be done. It could invoke a goods and services tax which would, of course, help the car makers immeasurably. It could do all sorts of other microreforms which have been mentioned many times from this side of the House. With the same Industry Commission estimating that we could have, quite quickly, a national income gain of $22 billion or more than 50,000 additional jobs, greater take home pay and a 7 per cent reduction in the cost of living without even addressing the industrial relations reforms that are patently there for everyone to see, I think there is a great opportunity for this country if we were to pick up the recommendations which time and again have been made, not only by the Industry Commission, but by other consultants. I am not optimistic that this Government will deliver the necessary changesindeed, that it can deliver these changes that are necessary. So, to that extent, I fear somewhat for the industry's immediate future. However, in conclusion I express sincere hope that all the discussions and reports about the car industry are not wasted, and that words translate into actions, and that this industry is given a real chance of success which I sincerely believe it will achieve.

170,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I do so on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is currently chairing a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in New Zealand. The Minister has asked me to introduce this matter today to enable the Opposition time to give the Bill adequate consideration before it is debated next week. The Minister will be present to take part in that debate. The Bill will amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 to suspend the operation of the wool reserve price scheme (RPS). Suspension of the scheme will take effect as from the resumption of wool auction sales, expected to be 25 February. The suspension of the scheme will apply for at least the remainder of the 1990-91 wool selling season. The Bill will provide for the Australian Wool Corporation (A WC) to repay borrowed funds under a debt reduction program and to dispose of its wool stocks in an orderly manner in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister. It will also make provision for the Corporation to make supplementary payments to wool growers in respect of wool sold before the end of the 1990-91 wool selling season, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister. The Bill will further provide for ministerial power to appoint an administrator or interim board for the Wool Corporation, should that be required. This legislation is necessary to give effect to the Government's decisions earlier in the week on the future of wool marketing arrangements in Australia. Those decisions were very difficult and were taken only after very lengthy consultations by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy over a period of months with industry leaders, the board of the Wool Corporation and other members of the Government. The decision to suspend the operation of the reserve price scheme was, however, in the end, inevitable. It was no longer possible to permit the Australian Wool Corporation, on behalf of Australian wool growers, to go on purchasing greater and greater quantities of wool, levying higher and higher taxes, and incurring more and more debt to do so. The hope that consumer demand would recover and that the Corporation's stockpile and debt would be stabilised has not been realised. At a fixed minimum reserve price of 700c per kilogram, buyers of Australian wool have stayed out of the market. Against that, the efforts of both the Wool Corporation and the Government to maintain the minimum reserve price at 700c were simply not enough. Historical Background The situation in which the Australian wool industry now finds itself has been brought about by an unprecedented petitiveness combination of factors. While some of these factors have been at work over a number of years, some of the most signifand icant have had an impact only during the last year or so and, as it turned out, very difficult to predict. The reserve price scheme appeared to work well for a long period. Even so, it possible in retrospect to see the genesis present difficulties in events which ocsitive curred as long ago as themid-1980s. The introduction of floating exchange rates after 1983 put the reserve price scheme under pressure. It was no longer possible to provide price stability simultaneously to both growers and buyers. Stability of prices to growers was seen as a primary objective. The sharp decline in the value of the Australian dollar, which occurred in 1984-85 and 1985-86, therechanges fore meant that woolÂ·Â· became much cheaper in terms of buyer currencies. China became a much more important force in the market, and there was strong growth in demand in other Asian counpolitical tries. At the same time there were falls wool production in major competitive producing countries. As a result of these factors, the demand for Australian wool was strongly stimumand lated. These events in the market caused a degree of euphoria and over-optimism to develop in the Australian industry, which led ultimately to unsound decisions in the setting of the minimum reserve price. The minimum reserve price for wool was increased by the AWC between 198687 and 1988-89 from 508c to 870c, or by more than 70 per cent. The rate of increase over this two-year period was nearly twice as large as that of the previous six years. The 1989-90 floor price was, as a result, set far above the long term trendÂ· price for the first time since the introduction of the reserve price scheme in the mid-1970s. Effectively, the minimum reserve price had ceased to be a safety net to deal with sudden unexpected declines in price, but had become an instrument for chasing the market. . This began to seriously affect the comof the Australian industry. The high price of wool relative to competing fibres had the result that synthetics cotton became more attractive to processors. It also allowed other wool exwere porting countries to begin undercutting Australian producers. The much higher minimum reserve price, after a time lag, strongly discouraged demand and strongly is encouraged supply. The factors which had of previously worked in the market in a poway and to Australia's benefit now went into reverse. The value of the Australian dollar rose, and wool production in competitor countries increased. By the beginning of 1989-90, the market had become very vulnerable to the impact of unpredictable episodic events. A series of such events then delivered a series of further hard blows to the market in 1990. No-one could have predicted the that have taken place in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe. The Soviet Union withdrew from the market in mid-1990 as a result of internal difficulties and foreign exchange in problems. China further reduced its purchases on top of the severe reduction which had already occurred in the previous year. There was a slackening of dein Japan and in western Europe as a result of a warm northern winter. In Australia, 1989-90 turned out to be an excellent woolgrowing season. With low wheat prices there was little incentive for Australian farmers to turn to alternative forms of production. Finally, the invasion of Kuwait resulted in a further blow to the econorilicprospects in western Europe, Japan and the United States of America, and hence to market confidence .. Steps Taken by the Government and Industry over the Recent Period It became clear to the Minister and other members of the Government by late 1989 that the reserve price scheme was in trouble and that steps would need to taken to place it on a sounder financial footing by some combination of measthereby ures, including a possible reduction in minimum reserve price, an increase in the rate of wool tax, an increase in the Wool Corporation's borrowing limit and other supplementary measures to restrain suppile, ply and to encourage demand. The Government then took a series of steps, in consultation with the Corporaexpected tion and the Wool Council, overÂ·the next twelve moriths designed to bring the a:tion under control. It will be useful to recapitulate those steps. During April and May 1990 the Minister made persistent and strenuous efforts to persuade industry leaders to re-examine their assessment the minimum reserve priceÂ· should conAWC tinue at its existing level and to persuade the Wool Corporation Board to take the necessary commercial decision to allow the reserve price scheme to continue on sound basis into the future. As the House knows, the Minister wasÂ· unsuccessful these endeavours. In early May 1990 the Government had to take a decision in the context of legislative program on the maximum rate of wool tax for the 1990-91 season. The Minister announced in the Parliament that the Government would increase the max70 imum rate of tax to 20 per cent, but that the actual rate to apply would depend upon a suitable package of measures comto ing forward from industry to manage the situation. In late May 1990, after intense debate in the industry about the merits of maintaining or lowering the minimum reister serve price, the Government decided, with the greatest reluctance, that the Minister should direct the Corporation to lower floor price for the current season to 700c per kilogram. He did so to preserve the long term interests of the Australian wool industry and of the Australian community, given the significance and impact of that industry on the Australian economy. In giving this direction, the Minister to was acutely conscious that, with the minimum reserve price at 870c per kilogram, the price relativity between wool and other be competing fibres would have been locked in at historically unsustainable levels, preventing wool from regaining the competitiveness with these other fibres. He was alsoÂ· conscious that lowering the min,imum reserve price would limit the cost of further purchases into the stockand provide additional funds to meet storage costs. The reduced price was designed to send a price signal to growers to at least limit production. It was not that demand for wool would pick up immediately, but that demand would situreact positively after a time lag. In June 1990, in the face of continuing speculation against the minimum reserve price, the Government announced it that would guarantee the borrowings of the to $2.5 billion. At the same time, the Government decided that it was necessary to look at the longer term issues facing the wool industry. A committee of a inquiry into wool marketing was accordingly established, headed by Sir William in Vines, to report back to the Government by July 1991. After the blow to market confidence its which resulted from the invasion of Kuwait in August, purchase rates at auction 1?y the Wool Corporation increased sharply from about 40 per cent to about per cent. In the light of this further development, the Wool Corporation recommended, and the Government agreed remove, the ceiling on Wool Corporation's borrowings to head off further continuing speculation about the viability of public the reserve price scheme. In the context of that decision, the Mincalled for the Wool Corporation to submit a business plan outlining how the Corporation intended to manage its finanthe cial exposure for the remainder of 199091, and a three year strategic plan on how the Corporation intended to trade its way out of its difficulties over the period ahead. In the interests of widening the involvement of industry beyond the Australian wool producing sector, the Minister established an Interim Wool Industry Policy Council which brought in representatives of the downstream parts of the industry. In October 1990 the industry presented its business plan to the Government. The Government subsequently took and announced decisions the objectives of which were to contain Wool Corporation borrowing requirements, to hold grower equity in the market support fund at reasonably sustainable levels and to reduce wool production and in.crease trade clearances. These decisions essentially involved further increases in wool tax-the actual rate being increased from 18 per cenf to 25 per cent-the flexibility to further increase or introduce a surcharge on such taxes next season, marketing quotas, and a flock reduction scheme. After the Wool Corporation sought approval to commit to further borrowings, the Government decided in November that the Wool Corporation should be given a further opportunity to demonstrate that it could trade its way out of its difficulties at the current floor price. At that time the Corporation saw a prospect of a return to the auctions by buyers in December and early 1991-which are traditionally the peak buying months. The Government indicated that, while it had significant reservations about wool marketing quotas, it was not opposed in principle to the development of the necessary legislation, subject to being satisfied as to the detailed mechanisms. The Government made every effort to leave no grounds for speculation as to its support for the 700c floor, and the Minister led an industry mission to talk to major overseas buying countries to reinforce the position. Trade purchases at auction continued, however, to be well below the Wool Corporation's expectations. They improved in early January, but then they fell away again. The Soviet Union did not immediately take up our $400 million credit. The Corporation developed its longer term strategic plan, as requested. However, yirtually from the day the draft strategic .plan was first formulated the situation deteriorated rapidly, to a point where ultimately the Corporation found itself in a position where it could not bring forward a plan which it unequivocally endorsed. The plan was eventually put to the Minister, as a basis for discussion, on 1. February. On the same day, faced with having to continue to borrow to meet its statutory obligation to buy wool not taken up at auction, and with its total debt approaching $3 billion, the Corporation suspended auction. sales. Options Considered by the Government In its plan, the Corporation put forward proposals that the 700c floor price be maintained for at least the next season, the wool tax be set at 35 per cent, marketing quotas be introduced at 700 kilotonnes, backed by export controls, and the flock reduction scheme be further expanded, together with additional measures to enhance demand. As it was put to the Minister, tax and quota parameters in the plan represented the extent of the sacrifice which the industry itself could tolerate-and in some quarters even this was seen as going too far. The industry, not unreasonably, had done its arithmetic and identified a breaking point. Equally, however, the same principle applied from the Government's point of view. There had to be a turning point where we would be compelled to cut off exposure to the inexorable buildup in the Corporation's debt, guaranteed by the Government. The. view put to us was that any downside risk of increased borrowings would have .to be accommodated by the Government. Now, confronted with that prospect, the best advice available to the Governinent-and the Corporation did not disagree with this assessment-was that stocks overall could reach some 8 million bales in 1991-92, peaking at over 8.6 million bales in 1992-93, with a market support fund balance of some minus $4 billion in 1991-92. This was not a commitment, in effect a blank cheque, which the Government could with any sense of responsibility contemplate or accept. In essence, it was not possible to see how the Government, in an open-ended way, could agree that the Corporation continue to borrow money to keep buying wool at 700c. Moreover, the Government continued to have serious reservations about the acceptability of marketing quotas not least to increasing numbers of wool growers. It became clear that the Wool Corporation proposal was not viable. The Government examined a wide range of options in addition to the option of suspending the reserve price scheme. Many individuals and industry groups came forward with proposals. While many of these proposals had elements to address part of the problem, none in the opinion of the Government provided a feasible, comprehensive response. Approaches which phased in the lower floor price over the balance of a season, either in pre-announced steps or by a progressive lowering of the Corporation's buying rate, would not have brought the problem of speculation against the scheme under control. Even if these approaches could have been made to work, the Corporation's debt and stockpile would have continued to climb. Picking a new floor price, perhaps 500 or even 350c, would have involved a very strong risk of continued speculation against the floor. The Government's Decision It was clear that whichever course the Government chose would involve a long period of difficulty for the industry, with severe effects on grower incomes. The 4.8 million bales stockpile of wool held by the Corporation-more than a whole clip in some seasons-will take years to run down and will depress the market. The Corporation's current debt of $2.8 billion will also take years to reduce. After having considered all the options, the Government decided that there was no choice but to allow the market to set the price for wool. It was clear that there was a much better prospect of bringing both the Wool Corporation debt and wool stocks under control in the absence of a floor price and without the Wool Corporation buying in the market. However, we have no illusions about the impact of the Government's decision. Direct grower incomes from the sale of wool will fall sharply in the short term. Some will be hit harder than others and, in particular, the market price of the middle micron will probably be lower than those of other categories of wool. China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have been key markets for these wools, which now comprise a high proportion of the stockpile. It is in this middle range that the reserve price scheme therefore most notably masked demand. To give effect to the Government's decisions, a new part X, dealing with 'temporary provisions', will be added to the Wool Marketing Act, which will in effect suspend the RPS provisions of the Act until a date fixed by proclamation-see proposed new section 143. During the period of suspension the Corporation will not be permitted to buy wool-see proposed new section 143. To all intents and purposes, the Wool Corporation stockpile will be frozen, although the precise details remain to be worked out between the Minister and the Wool Corporation. The AWC's flock reduction scheme will be reviewed and, if it continues, will be scaled down and focus on animal welfare requirements. The AWC's proposed wool marketing quota scheme will not now proceed. Provision has also been made for the Minister to appoint for a limited period an interim administrator or interim board of the AWC-see proposed new section 147. These powers have been included to allow the Minister to ensure the ongoing operation of the Board ad interim and in exceptional circumstances. The Minister will have the discretion as to appointments. However, it is the intention that the Minister would consult with the industry in making such appointments. Wool selling arrangements to apply after 30 June will be finalised in April, after the Government considers the recommendation of the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing, which will now report to the Minister by 31 March. If there is to be any form of reserve price scheme from 1 July it will be self-funding and the floor price will be set conservatively against the then prevailing market prices. The Government has taken this course to enable the market to find its own level, thereby permitting the long term future of wool marketing to be decided in the light of market realities. Debt and Stocks Reduction Program The Government has decided that responsibility for the Corporation's debt and stockpile should remain with the Corporation. It is highly desirable that arrangements be put in place which will allow the industry to recover from its present situation in the shortest possible time and develop an industry structure which will maximise benefits to growers over the longer term. To this end it will be necessary not only that prices be set by the market but also that the Wool Corporation's stockpile and debt be reduced in a way and at a rate which will maximise grower incomes over the period ahead. Indeed, the proper management of the reduction in the Corporation's stockpile and debt will be as important to recovery in grower incomes as the pricing policy decisions will be. The Minister will issue guidelines in relation to the debt reduction program and the disposal of the stockpile-see proposed new sections 144 to 146. The Commonwealth and the Corporation will develop a management plan by early April, soon after the Vines report is received, to deal with debt management, stockpile disposal and Wool Corporation finances. The Government will lift the ceiling on its guarantee of AWC borrowings to $3.5 billion and extend its guarantee on all borrowings beyond 1992 for the period required to manage the run down of the industry's debt. Supplementary Payments Scheme The suspension of the reserve price scheme in mid-season leaves us with a potential equity problem. There will be two groups of sellers, namely, those who have already sold their wool at 700c, much of which has gone into the stockpile, and those who will be offering wool for sale between now and July. Those yet to sell would, in the absence of supplementary measures, bear the brunt of the initial market adjustment caused by accumulated events and industry decisions over the last two years. Moreover, the problem for some groups of growers in the middle micron ranges will be even more severe, since this wool is already in excess supply and could be passed inÂ· at auction or sell at very low prices. For these reasons, the Government has agreed to a supplementary payments scheme for the remainder of the season. The scheme will be administered by the Wool Corporation. The administration of the scheme will be in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister-see proposed new section 140. The cost of the scheme will be shared between the Government and the industry. The Government will contribute $300m-see proposed new section 142. The balance will be financed through the AWC by a combination of tax receipts and further borrowings, which the Government will guarantee. The wool tax rate will remain at its current rate of 25 per cent for the remainder of the current season. Underpinning the short term assistance provided under the supplementary payments scheme will be the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling program, under which the Government will provide assistance to those most affected in the wool industry and elsewhere in the rural sector. The Government will provide additional substantial funds for these purposes. The details of this will be worked out in the context of the Government's consideration in April of a submission by the Minister on rural incomes, which will include the question of the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling program. Research and Development and Promotion Research and development is critical for the long term future of the wool industry. The Government will be prepared to consider increase.d assistance for research and development to supplement industry levies, particularly in 1991-92. To ensure that research and development is not compromised by Wool Corporation funding difficulties, a Wool Research and Development Corporation will be established separate from the Wool Corporation. However, it may be expected that the Research and Development Corporation will share accommodation and administrative services with the Corporation, unless its own board determines that these services can be provided more efficiently by other means. Further improvements will also need to be made in Australia's wool promotion and marketing efforts and in the operating structure and capacity of the AWe. If I may sum up, the Government has been required to take some very tough decisions in order to secure the future viability and prosperity of the Australian wool industry. All the parties involvednamely, industry leaders, the Australian Wool Corporation, individual wool growers, people involved in downstream activities and the Government-must now work harmoniously together if the industry is to reap the full benefits of these decisions. There is no point in looking backwards or in engaging in a search for scapegoats. We have to press ahead together to see the industry through one of the worse phases of its long and proud history. A managed operation will now be put in place which will enable the industry to pull through in reasonable shape over the next five years and beyond. The industry will retain primary responsibility for its affairs while the Government provides the support necessary to manage the recovery. The decisions which the legislation before the House will permit us to implement are the correct ones for the industry, individual wool growers, end users and the Australian taxpayer. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. NA Report [COGNATE PAPERS: INDUSTRY COMMISSION-INTERIM NA NA AUTHORITY-REPORT] Debate resumed.",142
171,Mr CAMPBELL,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"Kalgoorlie) (8.29)In speaking in this debate on the reports of the Industry Commission and the Automotive Industry Authority, I want to say something about the philosophy of industry policy. These reports, good as they are in themselves, do not in my view go to the heart of our problem. Indeed, I do not believe the problem can be attacked on an individual basis, any more than it can be attacked by some of the simplistic policies put forward by the Liberal Party, such as a slavish adherence to free wage bargaining, one of the shibboleths and nonsenses those opposite come up with when they have not got a clue what to do. When the shouting and the tumult die, when the Ministers at the table have stomped through their little day, the reality is that all decisions-political decisions and, in fact, most decisions of society-are made either out of hope of gain or fear of loss. That is a very important observation. I am not saying that one or other of these philosophies is best; they - both have their place. Clearly, a time when wool prices are very high is not the time to promote policies based on hope of gain. We have this malaise in Australia. Both political parties are locked into a concept of fear of loss. When the economy is down, when unemployment is rising and when industry is certainly in the doldrums there is only one policy, and that must be a policy of hope of gain. We must set out with a determination to improve our position and develop our industries, not simply batten down the hatches. We are given a lot of reasons as to why Australian industry is not efficient. I would like to refer to a gentleman who I have mentioned before in this House- Mr David Mulroney. Mr Mulroney is a British mining engineer who is working in Australia. He is probably one of the half dozen experts in the world in deep shaft mining and in terms of frozen shaft mining he is probably the foremost expert in Australia. He has mined throughout the world-in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Europe-and he tells me that without any doubt at all Australian miners are the best in the world; not because they work the hardest, but because they work the smartest and the safest and because they think. His view is that he would rather work with Australian miners than anyone else in the world and that from Australian miners he gets productivity that is unobtainable anywhere else. He cites comparisons with South Africa, for instance, and states that Australian miners out-perform South African miners quite considerably in terms of production. This, I think, gives a lie to those who slander the Australian worker-people who go around and say that we just cannot be competitive in Australia. The reality is that Australian labour can hold its own anywhere in the world if it has the same opportunities and if it has the same capital investment-which, of course, is not occurring. We do not have the depth or the philosophy of capital investment in this country and we have to ask ourselves why this is so. If this country is going to survive and if we are going to overcome our current account deficit, we clearly have to reduce the current account. It has to be brought back into balance. How can we do this? We can adopt a policy of cutting back, raising interest rates to stop people buying things-which in turn inhibits production-and generally running down the economy. There is no doubt that in the long run this will reduce the deficit. But at what price? There is another alternative, and that is to be outward-looking and increase Australia's production-to sell more. The products that we in this country can sell in the short term are those which are produced by the timber industry, by mining and by agriculture. That is where Australia's short term interests lie. Yet every time we have attempted to develop these products, we have been thwarted by go vern.ments and oppositions which have kowtowed and buckled under to noisy minority groups and to ill-informed environmental groups-people who themselves are often in government employment or who are very often in self-employment, in professions, and who have gone out of their way to destroy the jobs of working people. It is an absolute shame that in this endeavour they have often been helped by the left wing of the Australiah Labor Party-a left wing that does not have the proud tradition of the Australian worker but now reflects the middle class, heart-on-the-sleeve attitude of the social worker and people of that ilk. I believe this is a great tragedy. We also have to look at the other institutions, such as the Industry Commission. What is its contribution? It is simplistic economic nonsense about the direction of resources to the most profitable areas. We have to look at the Resource Assessment Commission. What is its role? This is the body that has just come up with one of the most jumbled reports on Coronation Hill that one could imagine. These are the people who are holding Australia back-people like those in the Environment Protection Authority in Western Australia who are making political decisions about what are essentially environmental matters. That is an authority set up by a State Government and it is out of control. It has exceeded its charter and it is now on an empire building stunt. It is an authority which has openly boasted to me that it will be a brave Minister who bucks its decisions, no matter what its decisions are. We have to develop the export ethos in Australia. How will we do that? We cannot do it while we adhere to the nonsense of the level playing field. Playing on a level playing field might be terribly sporting, but we are the only people who play on that field. The world certainly does not. As I have said before, the Japanese play on the side of Mount Fuji kicking downhill with the wind behind them while good old Australia plugs along on the level playing field. We have to give advantages to our industry-there is no alternative. We have to have an industry policy that promotes industry and does not undertake industry. It is no good sending our industries to the graveyard if we really and truly believe in improving the standard of living for all in Australia and if we believe in creating jobs for the children of Australia. There has to be industry development. This does not mean to say that it has to be the willy-nilly .development that is caused by high tariff policies. Clearly, that is the wrong way to go. But where our industries are efficient, we should be supporting the.m. I am reminded in this case of the OKA Motor Company in Western Australia.., - a company that saw a niche in the market for a two tonne off-road four wheel drive vehicle which was capable of being driven on the roads. This niche is not filled by the Japanese, as they stick mainly to a one tonne. vehicle. This Company produces in Australia, under quite primitive conditions, a two tonne vehicle of the sort that is selling competitively. It has actually been bought by Argyle Diamond Mines Pty Ltd, which has expressed to me and to the company that it is extremely satisfied with the vehicle. It has performed beyond Argyle's expectations and has cut its maintenance costs considerably. I certainly pay tribute to Argyle for having the guts and the nerve that the Government clearly lacked, because the Government has given this company no assistance at all. This company will survive, and it will survive on its own endeavours. But it wouldÂ·Â·have been much easier, and it ;could have been producing much earlier and reducing the Australian current account deficit to a greater extent, had it had just a modicum of government assistance. If we are going to develop industry in Australia, itÂ· has to have the same sort of incentives as those that apply everywhere else. Japan, Germany and Europe all have capital write-off over four or five years. we are going to keep our industry efficient, this has to occur because the technology changes at this rate, and it is absolutely absurd to say that we are going to have efficient, industry and then not give it the ability to keep its equipment or its investment up to date. We also have to look at the cost of money in Australia. Industry overseas does get assistance. What happens in Australia? We say, 'You have to meet market forces'-market forces which we ourselves contrive; interest rates that we ourselves drive up with our policies. We say to industry, 'This is what you have to live with'. The problem is not so much in the area of these micro-economic reforms. Sure, they are important; sure, I support them; sure, they are coming. But we are using them as an escape. We are blinding our eyes to the realities of the situation, and the way we are going, when we get the market reforms in, there will be no industry left to respond to them. We have to look at this problem of expensive money. It is a great inhibiter. What do we have in Australia? We have a development bank which is an arm of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. It was set up, I understand, with a loan of $8m, which it has paid back many times. It pays the Commonwealth Government about $20m a year in profits. Today it operates as just another bank-it gives no particular incentive and it certainly does not lend on the merits of a program. It also has lending limits of $1 m, so if a person wants to borrow more than $1 m, that person has to go to Sydney to get the approval. The Development Bank has been a very successful bank-it has made a lot of money-but today it is certainly not honouring its charter. I believe there are many people in the Development Bank who would dearly love the opportunity to go out and do that. Where else does one go? To the Australian Industry Development Corporation? The AIDC is just another grubby merchant bank, a very profitable organisation, but one which has a profit motive, one which will not take any chances and which If will not take equity investments in industry unless that industry has shown itself to be absolutely viable and gilt edged. We need some initiative and some nerve in this area of financing. It will not come from the private banks in Australia. Deregulation has shown how irresponsible they are. If the Labor Government really and truly believes in promoting business it must look at establishing some finance mechanism for business. There are many other areas-and I will be preparing a paper on this shortly-where I believe we should be giving assistance to industry. I do not have time to go into them in this debate. However, I do want to mention small business. When people talk about small business and the local small business association we find that that association usually comprises a local estate agentnot a great contributor to productivity in Australia. I would say-and other such people. This is not small business; in my view small businesses are those in the 20 to 200 employee category. They are the people in this country who are not getting assistance. The greatest small business in Australia is the wool industry. There is no other small business that comes within cooee of the wool industry. Taken together, these small businesses form an enormous industry. It is an industry that has done Australia well. It is an industry that in the life of this Government has put something like $17 billion into the coffers in export earnings. Until June of this year there were no income equalisation deposit schemes working. It is an industry where participants paid very high taxes-they had no alternative. It is an industry which I believe the Government should be supporting wholeheartedly. It is an industry which we should be looking at through hope of gain and not fear of loss. I believe that we must now have a free market in wool, but we cannot have a free market while we have the loose cannon of the stockpile rolling around the deck. That stockpile cannot be in the control of the Australian Wool Corporation because it is a proven failure. It is a fraud and, in my view, if it were in the private sector many of its employees would be in gaol. Nobody in the industry trusts the Corporation and certainly neither does anyone in Europe. For our purposes Europe is most important because the Japanese understand the industry; they have never ever missed a beat. They know exactly what is going on. But Europe does not. Overall the European industry is bigger than that of Japan but it is fragmented. However, it is Europe that sets fashion and Europe that sets demand. I listened with interest to the speech of the Minister tonight. I believe it does not sit well with the policy of industry development. I will certainly be doing everything I can to make sure that that st6ckpilis locked up in a believable way so that our customers will know that they are not going to be undermined by sly sales or backdoor sales from it. In conclusion, I am sure that the great rural industries of Australia will survi'v-. Wool, wheat and export sheep areÂ· very depressed. But in Western Australia at least Bunnings Forest Products Pty Ltd, with its tree planting program, offers an option to woolgrdwers. I urge all wool growers to look very carefully at the economics of eucalyptus globulus. I believe that is an avenue that will provide them with an income with more sutety and better returns in the long term than just about anything else in the rural sector at the moment. ' ,",148
172,Mr DOWNER,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"1 would like to address my remarks to the Industry Commission's report on the automotive industry. I do so as a South Australian. I recognise only too well the vast importance of the.automotive industry to my own State of South Australia. Some of my constituents are employed in the motor industry at. Mitsubishi. Obviously, even from the point of view of my own electorate, it isa matter of some concern to me. To go one step further, in the long term South Australia's economy will be very severely affected if the motor industry, is not successfully able to become more efficient. On the other hand, South Australia's. economy may benefit enormously if decisions can be made in this country to make that industry more efficient. That, of course, is the great challenge which the Industry Commission's report has laid before the Government and the Parliament. It is one that this Parliament needs to rise to. We have to ensure that our motor vehicle industry in Australia can become internationally competitive. That is the benchmark. As we read through the Industry Commission's report, what would strike even the most protectionist of readers is that this industry is by no stretch of the imagination internationally competitive. Indeed, it survives because of a very high regime of protection. It is interesting to look at the figures that the Industry Commission's report uses to define that level of protection. It claims that the level of protection that the motor vehicle industry receives is the equivalent to about $l.6 billion per annum, that it is worth $25,000 for every employee in the motor vehicle industry, or is the equivalent of about $4,000 for every Australian-made vehicle which is sold. I accept, as I know all honourable members on this side of the House would accept, that we cannot just pull away protection from the motor vehicle industry without addressing the issues which are fundamental to the efficiency of the industry-that is, the issues of the macroeconomic settings of this country and the micro-economic problems that we have. If protection is to be withdrawn gradually from the industry, as the Industry Commission recommends-and that is the policy of the coalition-then those reforms simply have to be made. I think that is one of the strongest messages that comes through this Industry Commission's report. Firstly, I want to say a bit about the impact on the industry of macro-economic policies. I think this report, in both macro-economic and micro-economic terms, stands as an indictment of this Government's policies in both areas. As far as the impact of the Government's macro-economic policies is concerned, the Industry Commission identified three main problems. The first was the effect of the Government's high interest rates. The second was the effect of the high rate of inflation in Australia, brought about by Government policies. The third was the effect of a high level of taxes and charges in Australia, which is partially a State responsibility. As far as interest rates are concerned, the report has pointed out that these have had two effects. These arguments are as true of other industries as they are of the car industry. Firstly, the very high level of interest rates, axiomatically, imposes very high costs on the motor vehicle industry. The submission to the Industry Commission made by the Nissan motor company showed interest rate costs on Nissan's $523m re!equipment program added something between $34m and $60m to the overall cost of that investment. In other words, as Nissan put it, the penalty of high interest rates on Nissan was between $550 and $1,000 per car. This may seem an academic point to some people. Certainly the Australian Labor Party may think that this does not matter particularly. But it is worth reflecting that an industry which is challenged by the need to become more internationally efficient is being penalised, at least in the case of Nissan, by between $550 and $1,000 per car. Arguments about protection are nothing compared with the impact that those high interest rates have had on our motor vehicle industry. The second point that the report makes, which is a very important point, is that high interest rates have artificially held up the value of the Australian dollar. That has obviously made it much. more difficult for the motor vehicle industry to successfully export and, on the other side of the ledger, has meant that it is a lot cheaper for importers to bring foreign motor vehicles into Australia. The interest rates issue is not academic. It is a vastly important issue in terms of the ultimate objective which is to try to make this industry more efficient. Those high interest rates were introduced in order to try to resolve Australia's balance of payments problems. If honourable members read the submission about the motor vehicle industry to the Industry Commission they will see that it has had exactly the reverse effect and the balance of payments figures prove it. The second aspect of macro-economic settings that the report addresses is the very high rate of inflation in Australia compared with our major trading competitors. General Motors-Holden's Automotive Ltd (GMH), which has a very substantial facility in South Australia, has said that in 1990-91 the competitive position of its engine manufacturing facilities was reduced by $50 per engine, compared to other manufacturing countries, simply because of Australia's relatively high rate of inflation. I think that yesterday's consumer price index figure should remind us again how serious that problem is in terms of the long term survival of the motor vehicle industry. General Motors-Holden's pointed out that the high rate of inflation in Australia has been a boon to the German, British, South African and South Korean engine plants because, as I have already explained, costs in Australia were so much higher, partly because of inflation. The third aspect of macro-economic settings which has done the motor vehicle industry so much harm, according to the report, is the high rate of taxes and charges in Australia. Time does not permit me to say much about that except to quote from the submission by the Toyota company which said that taxes and charges in Australia are at a 'disproportionately high level'. As a consequence of that, those manufacturers were less efficient by international standards than they would otherwise have been. It seems to me that that is a pretty simple case to put, and the Industry Commission has put it very well. The Government's high interest rate policy, its high inflation policy and the level of taxes and charges imposed by Labor governments, both State and Federal, have simply made our motor vehicle manufacturing industry uncompetitive. That is something that I would have thought all members of this Parliament would be severely worried about. The point is that we can have academic arguments about all these macro-economic problems-and sometimes we do have such arguments-but when we get down to the level of a particular industry we can see what the direct effect of those policies is. These are not my views; these are the views of the Industry Commission, an independent body, the integrity of which surely the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) would not challenge. He has within his electorate a very significant motor vehicle manufacturing capability. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Kingston nods in agreement. The second aspect of the Industry Commission's report relates to micro-economic reform-Australia's failure to achieve micro-economic reform and the impact of that failure on the efficiency of our motor vehicle industry. There are a lot of examples in the report. I will just run through two or three of them. GMH has said that a better rail service in this country could reduce freight costs by 15 per cent. I do not blame the Commonwealth Government alone for the poor rail services we have in Australia. In fact I recognise that Australian National Railways has done a ""great deal to improve its efficiency. Some of the fault lies, for example, with the Victorian Government run V/Line. The simple fact is that it is an area of micro-economic reform which has progressed too slowly. According to General Motors-Holden's, inefficiencies in road transport have added another 15 per cent or so to the freight costs of the industry. It referred also to shipping costs, an issue frequently debated in this Parliament, which have had a devastating effect on the industry. Submissions suggested that the costs of transTasman shipping have added between $600 and $950 to the cost of transporting cars from Australia to New Zealand. Obviously, that makes it very difficult for us to maintain market share in New Zealand. What is also interesting about transTasman shipping is that 20 per cent of all motor vehicles exported from Australia to New Zealand are damaged on arrivalanother cost to be added to what potentially could be an important exportÂ· industry. "" One of the problems examined by the Industry Commission in some detail concerns inventory costs associated with a poor micro-economy in Australia. Motor vehicle companies have to keep very high levels of inventory because of problems on the waterfront, problems with shipping, problems with rail transport and the like. Again, that imposes very significant costs on the industry. The Industry Commission says that micro-economic reforms could increase output in the motor vehicle industry by 8.5 per cent, or 20,000 vehicles. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) may be interested to note this because I do not think he is very concerned about macroand micro-economic problems. I have never heard him worry about them. Such reform would add 4,000 jobs to the industry-if only the honourable member for Corio, who professes from his heart to care so much about the motor vehicle industry, and his colleagues would implement micro-economic reform and change macro-economic settings. Apparently, he is not very interested in that. The labour and management problems of the motor vehicle industry are also elucidated throughout the report. It makes very interesting reading. One of the problems we have with our motor vehicle industry, which I think is partly a management problem, is the very high level of labour turnover. A high level of labour turnover adds very substantially to costs. Of the countries the Industry Commission compares us with, we have by far the highest rate of motor vehicle industry labour turnover. It estimates that labour turnover adds something like $850 per car. The other issue the Commission looks at is wage costs. I have always been one of those members who has agreed with the proposition put by many people that Australians do not actually earn an enormous amount of money. The problem in Australia is not that we have very high wages, and that is pointed out by the Industry Commission report. The average Australian production worker apparently earns about $20,000 a year. In Japan he earns about $50,000. Honourable members would think from that that we would have a competitive advantage. But, in fact, we do not. Because there are so many other factors associated with labour costs, those advantages are completely destroyed. We have penalty rates, we have rostered days off, we have payroll tax and we have holiday loadings. We all know about them. They add enormously to labour costs in the motor vehicle industry. It is not the workers who get the money; in many cases it is the Government which gets the money. But whether it is the workers, the Government, or whoever, the fact is that total labour costs bear no relationship at all to the international environment. Labour costs, as a unit of output in Australia, are extraordinarily high, even though overall wage costs-as distinct from labour costs-are relatively low. I think this report should be compulsory reading for all members of this House. Indeed, I would commend it to the honourable member for Corio because he has a motor vehicle industry in his electorate too. Instead of rushing around telling everybody that we can save this industry with higher and higher tariffs, as the likes of the honourable member for Corio like to do, we as a Parliament ought to do the responsible thing and implement very substantial macro-economic and micro-economic reform so that we can clean up the industry and make it substantially more efficient. If that happens, we will not need tariffs at the level they are at today. We will be able, by reducing tariffs, to reduce economic distortions, and at the end of the day we will be able to raise the living standards of all Australians. I know that I am speaking in vain because the Australian Labor Party believes that its macro-economic policies have been marvellous, despite what the Industry Commission and just about everybody else says. The Government thinks its microeconomic reform is progressing apace even though micro economic reform is faster overseas than it is in Australia. That is the problem the Labor Government has. Therefore, unfortunately, we will have to wait for two more years before we can give the motor vehicle industry a chance to become the progressive, dynamic, job creating and wealth creating industry it really ought to be.",151

178,Mr JOHNS,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"That might help the if Hansard, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to address the other two reports nate debate; that is, the Industry Commission interim report on paper recycling and. the report on pulp and paper bleachcling ing and the environment. It seems to me that the debate about paper recycling and bleaching of paper The has now reached a much greater level of sophistication than it once had in the whether community. The very fact that a Treasnatural urer has taken such notice of the issue can and referred these matters to the Industry Commission demonstrates the imporrecycling are costless. tance in the community's mind of these two events and issues. I compliment the Industry Commission on both reports. They are purely interim; there is a great deal more work to be done. The beauty of both reports is that they show us the complexities. There are no simple solutions to the question of increasing the recycling of paper, or stituting for processes other than bleachenter ing of paper. Any gains to be made by either recycling paper or not bleaching paper are not nec'essarily cost free. that Industry Commission has given us some valuable evidence which will mean that of us now has to go away and sit think about these sorts of issues. When I was studying economics, we were always told about one of the famous contradictions: that whilst an individual might save more and thereby accrue more padwealth, if the whole community saved a more it would have such a depressing effect on the economy that it would put some people out of work, and eventually would save less and be less well off overall. Contradictions between the individual's wish to do well and the whole nation wishing to do well are also true in paper recycling, because we know that in the last 18 months everyone jumped on that bandwagon of recycling old newspapers. The amount of newspapers that then available drove the cost of cola lecting newspapers down, and many newspaper collectors went out of business leaving lots of us left with newspapers at the front door again. Those real, live price mechanisms have to be taken into account we are to make any sense of driving ourselves towards greater recycling of in this cognewspapers and so on. The marvellous thing about the recyissue appears at the very front of the Industry Commission report where the question is stated: important question for this inquiry is not whether recycling rates could be higher, but the Australian community would be better off if they were. Recycling can meal) that resources are tapped at a slower rate. It also defer the time when products enter the waste stream. Yet neither of these advantages of Now consider that-'Recycling can mean that natural resources are tapped at a slower rate'. We need to appreciate that there is nothing absolute about the whole question of recycling. At its best, it will simply slow the use of resources. At its worse, it will increase costs in other areas of slowing the use of resources. Also: 'It subcan also defer the time when products the waste stream' - which means, of course, that ultimately most of the things we use and produce will, at one stage or The another, enter the waste stream. So we have to keep that firmly in mind. There are no absolutes here. We can slow the use of resources, and we can slow down the rate at which goods enter the waste stream. There are not many ways in which we can absolutely stop' the whole game, despite what our friends in the Australian Democrats would argue about having a no growth economy. This is a good basis on which to start a debate on recycling. One of the better illustrations of this complexity of argument is on the question of energy and greenhouse gases. The Commission makes the following argument: It cannot be assumed that recycling saves compared with the production of paper from gin materials. It is true that the recycling itself is less .energy demanding than the production of mechanical pulp for newsprint. The use of electricity in pulp production will be 400kWh per tonne of recycled pulp compared .with 2400kWh for mechanical pulp. Chemical pulps require less purchased energy than recycled But the manufacturing process is just part story. The greatest energy .demands in paper cycling are from collecting and transporting waste paper. And it is muchÂ· harder to control the emissiorls of pollutants and greenhouse gases trucks than from power stations. It should remembered, however, that some transportation of waste paper occurs---even when it is not cled---to disposal sites. In other words, we really have to try to rope in all the costs of any notion that might have about the use or otherwise recycling. There are some very useful figures prowhat duced in this document, in table 3.2 page 53-'Estimated private costs in tralia of newsprint production'-and all these costs are expressed in an index moving from 100. It demonstrates that omies. one of the basic inputs in a wood pulp based paper, the fibre, can be measured at 27 units, but the cost of the recycled fibre is 60 units; The increased cost that recycled fibre mainly arises because the costs include energy and labour costs of collection, sorting, and transport to mill; so in fact the cost of using recycled fibre is 2.2 times the cost of a natural fibre. There are gains to be made. There are some gains in the use of chemicals, some gains in the use of energy, but there is the same use and c.osts in terms of labour, material and overheads, and depreciation; so the total all-up private cost of producing paper from recycled as opposed to wood pulp based paper is some l.1 times higher in fact. Then we have the other argument: those are the private costs, but what about the public and environmental costs of producing recycled papers? This is where. governments have to make sure that they impose some sort. of rest.riction-whether it is through cost or taxing, or the generation of penalties for pollution or whatever-that raises the real total cost of recycling paper and impose it. into the energy manufacturing Process. Again, the Indusvir, try ,Commission helps us understand that process we need to provide all of these costs. Despite the fact that nominally, at least, the private costs of recycling paper using primary fibres is higherÂ· than using recycled fibres, there is a proposal by A and pulps. M to build a newsprint mill in Albury, of the whereby it will spend $100m on a recyrecling and de-inking facility which will use the some 130,000 tonnes of waste paper, some from 70 per cent of which will be used newsbe paper and magazines. Of course, the process we shall have to go through is to assess recythe Albury proposal's environmental costs as well as its benefits, because the establishment of the plant will, at least on this we estimate, double the present level of salt of discharge from the pulp and paper mill into the Murray River. All the costs of we each believe to be this notion of at recycling-and it is a Â·.good notion of Ausrecycling-must be taken into account, otherwise we will come up with some very false notions and some very false econThe report mentioned some work by News Limited in cooperation with Fairfax Australian Consolidated Press in setting of up some newspaper environmental research. That work has now shifted on, and I can report that News Limited has the in fact established an environmental secretariat in Sydney. As yet I have not been able to visit that secretariat. Its purpose is to establisij.a database to provide information which will allow reliable decisions to be made concerning the most effective use of old newspapers. It illustrates, I think, that we are a long way out of that crude debate which we had over many years-especially heightened in the last couple of years-whereby we all assumed all was well provided we recycled more of our products, especially-in this casepaper. All is not well. The solutions are not simple. Each has to be costed very carefully before we will find any real gains from improved recycling. We should also remember that the Australian paper industry, broadly, does a great deal of paper recycling; it is just that the use to which it is put is restricted. So we have an enormous' amount of recycling for packaging and newspaper because the quality of paper can always be reduced to make a new product but it is very hard to sustain fibre quality in recycling. So as yet we are unable to use a great deal of recycled material, for instance, in clean writing paper, and this is where the consumer really needs to help and where governments need to continue to press the point, as this Government has. Unless and until consumers are prepared to use a recycled and unbleached material in the most important applications of writing paper, tissues and even toilet paper, then the producer cannot be expected to invest in that sort of process. I tUfn now to the Industry Commission report No.1, Pulp and Paper: Bleaching and the Environment. It appears clear that at present consumers are more comfortable with buying a recycled paper product but not necessarily an unbleached one. This is an entirely separate step in the process of having a more environmentally sound paper product industry. At the end of-the day one must ask: what products are commercially viable once recycling commences and paper products are no longer bleached? Table 2 in report No.1 gives us a lead. It is headed 'The estimated Australian market for paper 1990' and makes some comparisons between product groups like newsprint, tissues, printing and writing, packaging and industrial uses. It lists the tonnage of product in unbleached and non-chlorine bleached products versus the chlorine bleached products. For example, 480,000 tonnes of newsprint are produced as unbleached and non-chlorine bleached products. Only 70,000 tonnes are produced as a chlorine bleached product. , ' In other words, there is not much more to be gained in the whole debate on not bleaching certain products in the newsprint game. We have really gone almost as far as we can. It is not quite so true of tissues-107,000 tonnes of unbleached and non-chlorine bleached tissues are produced, but only 48,000 tonnes of chlorine bleached tissues are produced. So there is some way to go there, where the consumer has a definite choice to make, and we ought to be able to get that 48,000 tonnes of chlorine bleached tissues down to a much lower level. The major area for advancement is in printing and writing paper. Only 10,000 tonnes of printing and writing paper in unbleached and non-chlorine form is produce(j, ,but 730,000 tonnes of chlorine bleached paper is produced as printing and writing paper. That is the greatest area of change 'and one, I suggest, that is most open for consumers themselves. We can save 730,000 tonnes of chlorine bleached paper if we choose papers which are not treated, unbleached or non-chlorine bleached. Summarising these two good reports, the situation is not as simple as we once assumed. There are great gains to be made here but they have to be chosen carefully; we have to go through the entire costs and benefits of each choice we make.",155
179,Mr MILES,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"I wish to address my remarks to the Industry Commission report No.1, Pulp and Paper: Bleaching and the Environment. Australia is faced with a huge overseas debt. Today the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) refocused the attention of Parliament on what should be its key focus, and that.is this country's enormous overseas debt. If we are to handle the biggest problem that we have then we are going to have to take notice of what the Industry Commission reports tell us and use the best approach to get exports going. The debate this evening focuses partly on the pulp and paper industry. This industry has now been stymied for about five to eight years in this country by a debate which has centred upon emotion rather than science. Fortunately it can now be said that science has solved the overwhelming majority of problems in the pulp and paper industry. The world's scientific community, with industry, recognised there were certain problems. The scientific community, industry and technologists have set about trying to eliminate the difficulties caused by effluynt emissions from pulp and paper mills. Australia has a balance of payments problem of about $15 billion to $20 billion. Mr Downer-Twenty.",157
180,Mr MILES,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"Twenty billion dollars. If we can do something about the pulp and paper industry we can reduce the balance of payments problem by 10 per cent. At present Australia exports $368m worth of woodchips but does not add any value to that product. If value were added at the pulp stage, instead of exporting $360m worth of woodchips we would export $2.2 billion worth of pulp. That would be a very large turnaround. If we wanted to add further value to our resource and sell it as fine paper, that industry would have an export worth $4.4 billion. We would not only gain from downstream processing but also gain in import replacement. It is incredible that this country, with its vast land resources, technology and different tree species which are competitive in world markets, imports $1. 3 billion of pulp and paper. This industry alone could turn around our balance of payments by 10 per cent if we set our minds to it and removed those obstacles to getting on with the building of new pulp mills in this country. There is no doubt that that is the way we should develop our forest industries. The report has a summary of findings, and I want to quickly go through three or four of them. The first is that there is a continuing strol1g demand for chlorine bleached pulp and paper. Over the past few years some people have argued that the world is changing and that it does not want the type of bleached pulp that we are producing-that there is no need for a Wesley Vale pulp mill or a bleached kraft pulp mill in Gippsland, Victoria, because the world demand for bleached pulp is changing. In its report, the Industry Commission says that there is such a demand-a continuing, strong demand for chlorine pulp and paper. There is nothing wrong with that, except we know that historically there are some problems with effluent emissions from pulp mills that produce chlorine bleached products. That problem has now been overcome. I was absolutely fascinated by the time. I spent in Finland, where I spoke to a Green Party member of parliament. In regard to the by-products, the organochlorides-we have all heard a lot in the last few years in Australia about how devastating they are-he said, 'We now have the technology to adequately handle the organochlorides.' That comes from a Green member of parliament in Finland. So the world has progressed to a point where it can handle the problems that come from using chlorine. The second summary of the findings by the Industry Commission stated that global trends are for bleached kraft pulp. Some 75 per cent of the market is for bleached kraft pulp. Why is that? It is because that process produces the type of pulp that has the strength of fibre and the brightness that is in demand. So the global trend is not away from kraft pulp, as a lot of radical environmental people in Australia tell us. In fact, the' world will continue to demand kraft pulp at least up to the year 2000. Many of the radical environmentalists will say to us, 'Let's get away from wood pulping and go to other non-wood feed stocks'. The Industry Commission report tells us that the prospects for using nonwood feed stocks are small. I spent some time over the last six months visiting pulp and paper industry people throughout Europe and North America and no-one suggested that there was a great future in non-wood feed stocks for pulp. The last point I want to address in regard to the findings of this report is in regard to environmental. effects. The debate in Australia has focused on environmental effects to the detriment of our balance of payments, to the detriment of using this industry to reduce our overseas debt, to the detriment of putting people in employment, to the detriment of this country being at the cutting edge of competition in the pulp and paper industry. No longer are we operating in markets where the competition is between the States of Australia or between neighbouring countries. We are operatingÂ·in a global market in this area, as we are in most markets in the world. We are a global community and we have to be competitive with other countries, whether it be Canada or Finland or Sweden. In producing pulp and paper, Australia has to be competitive. I am disappointed in that part of the report dealing with environmental effects. The report says that the acute and chronic effects of organochlorides are not fully understood or quantified. It is really ing that it is not wise to continue the of thinking that we ought to give consideration to eucalypt kraft mills. The authors might not argue the point there, but the way in which they have put this gives ammunition to people who want to argue against any further pulp mills in Australia. Let us look again at that sentence: 'Acute and chronic effects . . . are not fully understood'. Do we know whether the acute or chronic effects of anything are ever fully understood? What does it really mean? That it has never been quantified? I do not think the acute or chronic effects of many illnesses in human beings have been fully quantified or fully understood, yet we have this type of comment in the report. The second thing the report says in regard to environmental effects is that bleached eucalypt kraft pulp is largely unknown. We know a lot about softwood pulp production and a lot about hardwood pulp production but not necessarily a lot about eucalypt pulp production. We do know that eucalypt is easier to deal with than softwood and most of the other hardwoods that are used. If we can understand the effects of softwood pulp production and other hardwood pulp production, we know that it is highly likely that the environmental effects of eucalypt pulp production will be less. So we ought not be too concerned about not knowing everything about eucalypts. Thirdly, the report says that it is difficult to quantify the levels of discharge of organochlorides from pulp mills. I find that quite amusing, having visited one pulp mill. A graph in the report deals with one of the chemicals about which many people are concerned, 2,3,7,8TCDD, an organochloride we can measure. The pulp mill changed its processes from June 1987 through to April 1990, and we can see from the graph that a discharge of 40 parts per metric tonne has been reduced to one part. The technology advances over the three years have reduced the discharge from 40 parts down to one part per metric tonne. That is an incredible change. Companies can measure organochloride say- output; changes are being made and we line are able to quantify the output. I think that to a certain extent this report is already out of date because new information available shows that we have passed that point. In regard to the absorbable organic halides that are discharged, we can also see from the softwood kraft pulp industry that if we substitute molecular chlorine with chlorine dioxide or if we go onto oxygen in the process of delignification, or bleaching, we can reduce the amount of organic halides in the effluent by at least two and a half to three times what was possible three years ago. The same situation applies with the substitution of molecular chlorine with chlorine dioxide and the organochlorides we put out. Some of the organochlorides have four molecules of chlorine, some three, some two and some one. We now know in the industry that it is the four, three and two chlorine molecules that are serious in their effect on the environment. The monos are' not so serious. We find that we can reduce the tetrachlorine, trichlorine and dichlorine molecules in particular and the ones that remain in the effluent are largely harmless. So a tremendous amount of progress is being made in the paper and pulp industry. As a Parliament, if we are concerned about our overseas debt crisis, we should be addressing the problems of this industry and ensuring that we establish pulp mills in this country.",158
181,Mr OKEEFE,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"1 take this opportunity to canvass the issues in this cognate debate on these three reports by firstly making the observation that, after six years, I think it is, in this place I am now finding this Industry Commission report process very debilitating. We seem to have this constant process where the Industry Commission brings forward a report which, to put it bluntly, scares the wits out of all sides of the respective industries concerned. It leads to an immediate rush to Canberra on the part of all people who have an interest in the industry concerned, and there is an intense lobbying of the political parties to make sure that no-one takes any notice of the report. Then, as the changes are made and as the stick-and-carrot approach that has emerged in this process over some years evolves, I think the Industry Commission itself tends to become debased as a vehicle for reform in our economy. I say that with the view in mind that the Industry Commission needs to take note of the means by which it might observe that that process is becoming a little stale, and that it needs something, I suppose, to intervene in the way it goes about things to bring more credibility to it. Having said that, I would welcome the chain of events that have taken place recently in respect of the recommendations about the motor vehicle industry, because for the first time, with its second report, the Commission seems to have been responsive to that earlier round of 'responses'-if I can use that term-and I think we are getting much closer to the mark. I would like to see much more of that take place in the first round, thereby saving the debilitating aspects of this process. I do not say that just to save everybody work. The problem that is being created out there in the economy among ordinary people, and particularly among the work force, is this constant worry about the future of their jobs, the future of their industries, and continuing concern about what the theorists in Canberra actually have in mind for them. So I think we have to be mindful of the process. I also think that not enough is said, either in this place or out in the community in general, about the real reasons for the need for Australia to go about gradually reducing its protective stance that has evolved in this country over those decades since 1945. I have just observed in the last few months of 1990 yet another round of protests-I think it was in Victoria about imported oranges. It does not matter what the particular issue is, we constantly have this concern raised about the problems faced in Australia as a result of imported products. I think the first thing that everybody in the Parliament ought to start with in explaining these things to people is that Australia is a trading nation. I think it is something like 80 per cent of the minerals that we dig up, the agricultural products that we grow and the other resources that we exploit which finishes up some way or another in exported commodities or products. It needs to be understood that our economy has been built very solidly on the ability to export these primary or first stage products. There are many people in the country who would say that it is very good for other countries to buy our products but we must not let them bring theirs back into Australia. What everybody needs to understand is that we are a trading nation; our economy is based very heavily on earning export income; and our people do like to spend lots of money on imports, the things that are exchanged. It is that balance between imports and exports that is in fact out of kilter in our economy, and that is what has led this Government down the road of what is now known in the community as 'value adding'. That is the principal drive that is behind these reports. It is the principal drive that is behind the whole economic policy. How do we as a nation, first of all, our priorities a bit so that we do not have all the eggs in the commodities and resources basket and the agricultural basket, but start to have other things-other goods and services for export-playing their role? How do we make that change? How do we add more value? I was at a meeting the other day when one of the elderly pensioners in my electorate said to me, ' Mr O'Keefe, nothing much has changed. We used to send iron ore overseas and we used to buy back products, and that's how Pig Iron Bob got his name'. I suppose we were all brought up at school on the puzzle: why is it that we grow the wool and send it somewhere else, and then we buy the jumpers or the other clothes back? Why have we not done more as a country to turn those products into added value in our own economy? The answers to those questions are what these discussions are all about. So I think we all need to do more to explain that to people, because there is still that tendency in the community to say, 'Let's stop the imports; let's keep the protective barriers in place'. We will go into ahother round of intense discussion and debate about this very process as we consider in particular the response to the Industry Commission report on the motor vehicle industry and the Automotive Industry Authority's report on continuing progress in the industry. I want people, particularly those in my electorate, to understand that, whilst we go through this process, we will be keeping a very close eye on the way that we do this and we will be maintaining the sensitivity which has been evident during the period since 1983 when the Government came to office. But we have to do these things and take these decisions in the context of world movement towards the freeing-up of trade. I welcomed the statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during Question Time yesterday when he indicated that there was some hope that the U ruguay Round of talks may in fact be revived, because Australia is a country that has much to gain from the removal of the corrupted practices, particularly in agrishift culture, which exist in the world at the moment. So if Australia is to go with clean hands to those kinds of forums and put the view that other countries must reduce their artificial and deliberate protection measures, then we too have to be playing our role in this. That is what I call the GATT equation, the equation on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I am on the record as saying in my electorate-and I reiterate this point here in the Parliament-that any fall in tariff protection that occurs in the post-1992 motor vehicle plan must be accompanied by other measures which will provide assistance as the industry works its way through the process of reform which was begun with the first stage of the motor vehicle plan in 1984-85. I do not think it hurts to recognise in this Parliament that yes, we do admit that car prices are too high in Australia, and certainly we need to keep focusing on the fact that the industry is not yet competitive by world standards. But five years ago, it was completely insular; in other words, it was totally protected and inwardÂ· looking against what was happening in world trends. Now all of us are fully aware of international standards. We are aware of what we have to compete against and we are aware of what has to be done to move in the right direction. In factories in my electorate, such as Flexdrive at Gisborne, VDO at Kyneton and Ford at Broadmeadows, we have seen substantial investment in training and staff. I have been to these factories and over a five-year period I have seen major changes in equipment and plant layout. These companies are now actually winning major export orders in the world motor industry. That is a very significant and different picture from that which existed five years ago. I acknowledge that this is not the time to turn our backs on these industries. As we keep our credentials in the GATT equation, we still have to keep in mind that the measures must be there to enable our manufacturers to sustain the progress that has been taking place. We also have to acknowledge that for many years Australia's high tariff barriers and quotas did protect the industry, but that meant that world trends in prices, design and quality were slow to reach our consumers. I do not think one can say that that is the case now, so I have no hesitation in saying that I recognise that the industry deserves our continuing support. I found myself in agreement with a number of the observations made by the honourable member, for Braddon (Mr Miles), particularly when he was talking to the Industry Commission's interim report on the paper pulp industry. I think it is important for us to know that these changes and effects are just as important, maybe even more important, in the field of import replacement as they are in export enhancement. If a company or an operation is not able to succeed even on home base, and compete on our local market against an external supplier who, when bringing products into Australia, has to meet the costs of transport to Australia, then has to put in place a distribution network and all the other things that are involved in that, there is absolutely no prospect of its being able to compete in world circles. To my mind, the highest priority is making sure that the so-called level playing field operates in our own economy and that these local manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services certainly are pushed to compete on' even terms with the rest of the world. But at the same time we must keep addressing the dumping practices that have taken place and the constraints that are on an Australian company, particularly the in-built factors of our economy-transport costs, interest rates, power and all the other associated business inputs that may cost more in Australia than they do elsewhere. They are all factors that we as a Government are prepared to acknowledge and to continue to work to improve. It may well be that people will look what I have said tonight and say, 'Heavens above! Fancy admitting all those sorts of things'. On our side of the House, we have been recognising these realities' an<;l working very hard during the last seven years to address them. We are seeing the results of that, and I think that is something we will take some pride in putting on the table for analysis in the economy during the next couple of years. In speaking to these reports, I just make the point that they are part of a process. That process does cause concern to people, but the end outcome is very positive.",160
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,Otder! The honourable member's time has expired.,162
183,Mr BRADFORD,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"MCPherson) (9.44)The Automotive Industry Authority report on the state of the automobile industry, which is under consideration at the moment, is in my opinion, a terrible indictment not only on the Australian automotive industry, but on Australia as a whole. For more than 40 years we have aided and abetted this industry. From a reading of the report-and I suspect that things have become worse since it was written, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) said earlier today-one realises that the industry is still a long way from being' internationally competitive or efficient on the basis of international comparisons. If assistance currently provided to the passenger vehicle industry were instead provided by direct subsidies, the cost to taxpayers would be a staggering $1.6 billion each year.' This is equivalent to around $25,000 for each job in the industry and $4,000 for each vehicle produced. I pose the question: why have we done this for the past 40 years? Historically, we dreamed of having an Australian motor industry with all its attractions, such as employing thousands of Australians. The dream began with the launch in 1948 of the car which was christened by Ben Chifley as the Holden. But today that dream that began in 1948 has almost become a nightmare. The costs of maintaining this inefficient industry seem to me to at far outweigh the benefits. As was observed in the Industry Commission Report No.5 of last year, 'there will be significant gains for the community as a whole' from further substantial reductions in protection. I take the point Australia that the honourable member for Burke which (Mr O'Keefe) made. On. the. ,Government opmentof side of the House, there has' been a o'gnition of the extent of' the problem. However, I do not believe that the stratI. egies that have been putÂ· in place to rect the problem are the right ones. that Projections from the ORANI model sugwith gest that the netÂ· effects in the longer of substantial reductions in protection would be to increase Australia's gross nabetter. tional product by between $640m and $985m each year. Cheaper. cars are of course an attraction and they will certainly result, although must be recognised that, given the prothere pensity to maintain or increase prices m the absence of any Government. conthese straints-we are certainly not advocating those-the result will b,e, in part, into creased profits to the industry. However these profits, created in part by a reallocatiol} of, funds previously going ernment, will provide .the impetus for the increased expenditure on research, opment and automation, which is an tegral part of the restructuring process. should be understood, however, that the net effect as far as Government is cerned may not be revenue neutral. The Garnaut report is an excellent treatise on the benefits of reduced protection. To some extent it has been, embraced the Government and certainly by the position. At least on our side of the we are talking about reducing tariffs very substantive way, but we are not talkeven ing about reducing them in isolation. The automotive industry report emphamoment. sises the need for improved industrial relations practices. I am pleased that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr C,rean) is at the table tonight. In light hIS most recent former vocation, I am sure that he is quite interested in these matters. I quote from the report. It says: I- the local industry is to close these gaps in hIgher levels of automation, improvements in factory practice, a more flexible work force and better human relations management are necessary. The Minister agrees with that. It goes on 'to observe correctly the following: has a unique industrial relations system has, in some cases, encouraged the develstructures which promote rigid work and management practices and adversarial relarectionships between people in industry. do not know whether the Minister agrees corwith that, but let me point out to him these sorts of practices contrast starkly the Opposition's policy, which will term radically change the industrial relations system in this country very much for the The report points to the need for greater rationalisation strategy in order to improve manufacturing efficiencies. In 1989 it the year in which the report was written' were seven vehicle assembly plant-nd with volumes under 90,000. Only one of plants operated on' a full. two-shift basis, and only two at that stage expected achieve above 100,000 vehicles per annum in the foreseeable future. How can we expect to compete on the international to govmarket when we operate in this way? Volumes and capacity utilisation in both develour vehicle assembly and component inmanufacturing plants are generally well It below the levels achieved by major overseas manufacturers. Given the size of the conlocal market, and allowing for planned export volumes, the industry will be una'ble to support this number of assembly plants through the 1990s. In fact, ideally by an Australian automotive industry with Opone or two manufacturers - ach producing House between 250,000 and 350,000 vehicles in a may be possible. I say ideally, because this prognosis for the industry assumes some radical changes to the industry culture and climate which exist at the . However, one wonders why companies like Nissan bother to produce motor veof hicles in Australia in the present climate. As I van Deveson, the Managing Director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing Co. (Australia) Ltd, has said: , . We're being asked to take on board reduced tariffs, increased import competition, world class cost and quality levels in an environment of unacceptable labour turnover, an internationally uncompetitive tax burden, high interest rates inflation, some of the highest transport costs 'it.he world, a craft union structure that has no relevance to today, and never-ending political procrastination about the tough decisions necesfall sary for macroand micro-economic reform. What a mouthful from Ivan Deveson the Managing Director of Nissan! Is he' not exactly right? Has he not hit the nail right on the head? He pointed out that one of the main difficulties in his industry, in which he is no doubt an acknowledged expert is the area of industrial relations. If we iook at three aspects of industrial relations we will see that each one of them is of great concern-firstly, training; secondly la-our t-rno,:,er; an-, thirdly, the lev-ls of mdust.n-l dIsputatIon. Firstly, the number ?f - rammg hours invested per employee mdIcates that, compared with our overseas competitors, Australia invests the - owest number per new employee on an mternationally competitive scale. This will change very little under the training guarantee scheme which, of course is the G overnment ' s panacea for all of our ' skilling problems in industry. Secondly, our labour turnover is considerably greater than that in the industry internationally. This directly reduces our compet-ti.veness by increasing recruitment and trammg costs-and indirectly through the. loss of valuable skills and experience. ',fhudly, the level of industrial disputation m the automotive industry in Australia continues to inhibit competitive perform-nce and c-iI?ples us in terms of improvmg productIVIty, quality and exports. Once agam, overseas manufacturers are not similarly constrained. The bottom line in the report, and I guess the reason for my opening remarks - h-n I said how devastating the report is m Its - on?emnation. of the industry in Austraha, IS that our mdustry is shown to be very poor and sadly lacking in just about every single respect. I acknowledge, and others today have said that there have been slight improveme-ts over the years and. so-e indic-tions that things were headmg m the nght direction, but the progress has been extremely slow. Commenting on efficiency, for example, the report says: All the Australian assembly plantswe are talking about !)evenin. the 10':"" automation category and there is potential for improvements in productivity to be achieved by moving from low to moderate levels of automation. On management practice, the report says: Austr-lian firms surveyed generally rated quite lowly m management performance compared with the rest of the plants m the world-wide survey. The report recognises that there is a need for improved management practices com-ined with higher levels of automation if Im-rovements . in efficiency are to be achIeved. As If all this was not bad enough, after the amount of subsidies that the industry receives each year and has received ea-h year for the last' 40 years, the Austrahan automotive industry still cannot come up with a product of comparable quality to motor vehicles produced overseas. In fact, the report points to 'the continuing existence of a quality gap between locally manufactured vehicles and vi!tua-ly all comparable fully imported vehIcles: There .have been marginal Improvements m q.uahty but, once again, they are very margmal. So how has all this wonderful dream we had of establishing a motor vehicle industry in this country that began 40 years ago come about? How does the industry manage to survive? How has it even got this far with such a poor record? The answ,er to that, of course, is self-evident. The mdustry has always been very heavily pr-tected by tariffs and import quotas. ThIS allowed the incumbent firms to make above normal profits by setting prices higher than marginal costs, free from the threat of external firms competing away those profits. Struc-ural reform began, as has already been saId a number of times in this de-ate, back in 1984 with the implementatIon of the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan. Two of the main aims ?f the plan were to increase product qualIty and produce cheaper cars. Of course neither of those aims has been achieved to any great extent in 1991 but there is still some hope apparently. ' Higher export. levels were encouraged as a way to achIeve better economies of scale, reducing marginal costs. We have achieved some exports. The plan also allows local manufacturers to import complete cars and component parts, free of import duty, equal to the value of their exports, effectively acting as an indirect subsidy. To hasten the process, the reduction of high tariff protection levels was essential. But-and this is the biggest of the lot-unless the macroand microeconomic reforms necessary are also introduced nothing is going to happen. We only need to look back to 1972 to see what will happen otherwise. Without tariff protection then, which was lifted by Whitlam and Cairns, the iapanese immediately dispatched ship loads of vehicles to Australia. Within days, thousands of new Japanese vehicles were being loaded off the ships onto the wharves in Melbourne and the market overnight was flooded almost with imported vehicles. Faced with the threat by the Australian industry to layoff massive numbers of workers, Dr Cairns and the Government reversed their decision on tariff reduction, and went even further by imposing quotas. Looking back, ironically, the first decision they made might have turned out to have been the correct one if they had stuck with it. There is no gain without pain, and we might be standing here today with a completely different situation on our hands. Mr N.A. Brown-They might have got out of government even earlier than that.",162
184,Mr BRADFORD,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"They may not have lasted until 1975, that is right. The Australian car industry is undergoing considerable structural reform, albeit slowly, as the report shows, and it must do that to survive. Industry rationalisation to allow economies of scale is essential to improve quality and for car prices to fall. Export opportunities are an integral part of this approach. However-and this is where the Government will not get the message and why its strategy is wrong-macroand micro-economic hurdles must also be addressed. Industrial disturbances in support sectors must be minimised and attention focused on ways to curtail worker absenteeism and turnover. It is a mixture of policy-and the Opposition will deliver that mixture of policy-not merely tariff reduction, that will provide the impetus for much needed change.",165
185,Mr MACK,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"North Sydney) (10.00)The Industry Commission's interim report on paper recycling forms part of a broader report into recycling of all kinds 'but' which the Industry Commission is to complete in 1991. The terms of reference for the Commission's interim report on paper recycling set by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) called for an examination of the effects of Government policies on paper recycling and the environmental and economic costs and benefits. The economic prospects for further recycling in Australia were to be considered, including the possibility of a world scale recycling plant, processing imported waste paper. A companion report Pulp and Paper: Bleaching and the Environment examines production of paper from unbleached and non-chlorine bleached pulp. While this is also an important document, I will address my remarks mainly to the recycling report. The Industry Commission's findings on the environmental impact of bleaching technologies are inconclusive, and not the last word on that subject by any means. Experience in Sydney with organochlorines entering the ocean from the sewers and contaminating fish on a large scale suggests that the environmental impact of pulp mills using chlorine for bleaching are likely to be severe. The Commission's findings on the market prospects for unbleached and non-chlorine bleached paper products are hopeful and it is true that, world wide, chemical pUlping and chlorine bleaching still predominate. But we may see the balance change in favour of cleaner technologies in the near future. The Industry Commission received about 250 submissions from a wide range of respondents. It is fair tei say that many people and organisations who want to see more recycling of paper waste in Australia would be disappointed with the Industry Commission's findings. They were encouraged to participate, they prepared substantial submissions, engaged in a consultative process and gave evidence at hearings. Some, notably the Australian Conservation Foundation, now see the Industry Commission as promoting the pulp and paper industry's line on recycling. The industry view is that Australian paper producers have always recycled and that the level of recycling is appropriate to market requirements, that the only significant unused paper resource is waste newspapers and magazines, that current industry plans for recycling are adequate, that there are environmental disadvantages to recycling and that recycling will best proceed if it is left to industry and market forces, with little to be gained from Federal Government interference. The Commission's report in effect supports the industry view. The Commission says it can see no justification for specific assistance to recycling activities even though the Federal Government has already given it in the form of a sales tax exemption on 100 per cent recycled papers. The Commission expresses the view that, if the pricing of waste management, virgin pulp and transport are right, an effective level of recycling will follow. I accept that these are essential elements of a recycling policy, but I doubt very much that they will be enough. It is hard to miss the message in the Commission's report that we should apply to this area the increasingly discredited and doctrinaire economic theories which have led us down the path of deregulation. The consequences of doing this in the banking and financial sector have not been encouraging, with many commentators now admitting that a less regulated industry and market have contributed to questionable lending on a large scale to finance unproductive corporate raids and takeovers, collapsing empires, massive losses and urgent efforts by governments using taxpayers' funds to rescue financial institutions. If we leave the decisions about paper recycling and the environment totally to the industry and the market, as the Industry Commission report suggests, I believe we will also suffer disappointments in that area and we will have to bear the significant environmental, financial and social costs. One consequence of the laissez faire approach may be that the recycling of paper will actually decrease over the next decade as cheap virgin pulp produced by low cost countries such as Indonesia and Brazil becomes available. Asian and Latin American nations are moving into the pulp market on a significant scale to take advantage of their available tropical forest resource and fast growing plantations. A . deregulated market in which the price of raw material for paper production is the main determinant rp.ay see these low cost Third World producers prevail at the expense of the world's tropical forests and the recycling industries of the developed countries. Decisions on the pricing of virgin pulp supplied by our State forests on waste management charges and transport charges are largely made by State and local governments and by the private sector. In identifying these as the mainÂ· elements needing attention, the Industry Commission is suggesting that the Federal Government has only a marginal role in recycling policy. I reject that view. Without a national policy and a national program of incentives and constraints, there is not likely to be satisfactory progress. Only the Federal Government can provide such a program. It is clear that Australia Â·cannot continue to approach its environmental problems on a fragmented basis, like a collection of leftover nineteenth century colonies. We need national standards and guidelines which recognise the reality that State borders are in most cases artificial historical compromises. They are inappropriate as boundaries for regulation and policy making. Only the Federal Government can take the national view. The Government seems to be slowly recognising this, and I refer to the repeated statements by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) foreshadowing the creation of a Commonwealth environment protection authority. A national environment protection authority would, I understand, set up national standards for the management of the Australian environment in such areas as water and air pollution and waste management. I certainly support the proposal for a national environment protection authority; I just wish the Minister would get on with producing the legislation for its establishment. If this is to be taken as a serious posal of the Government, then the environment protection authority, when established, must examine the problems of waste management and recycling and ensure that they are addressed to the full extent of the Commonwealth's powers. There are certainly heads of powers available to the Commonwealth under the Constitution to effectively enter this field and establish guidelines and standards which States would be obliged to follow. The trade and commerce power, including ,the power with respect to corporations, would be an important element, as would the various Commonwealth powers with respect to taxation, import and export licensing, external affairs and coastal seaboard. I note that the Industry Commission is undertaking a major survey of waste management for its main inquiry. I agree with the Commission's observation that there is scope for local councils to improve the efficiency of their waste management, including collection of recyclables. Local council and State government pricing of waste disposal to reflect the true costs, including the opportunity costs of 'land, operating costs and environmental costs, is certainly needed. I would go further, however, and suggest that the Industry Commission has not looked sufficiently at the underlying environmental problems that recycling is aimed at. I refer to the exhaustion of the natural resources and the degradation of the environment. We have to do more to wind back the volumes of raw materials that are being extracted from the environment, which then enter the waste stream to present us with such massive problems of disposal. Again this is something that needs a national approach, with an attack on the problems at a number of levels. Only the Commonwealth can do that. It is all very well to wave a finger at local councils and say that they are not charging enough to receive garbage and should put up their fees. But how much will fees have to be lifted? Enough to change patterns of production and conpro- sumption and make a dent in the demands on resources and the volume of materials entering the waste stream? That would take a very big increase, I suspect. The disincentive is applied at a point too remote from where the environmental effects are being felt, and too late. Raising waste disposal charges is appropriate, but it must be supplemented by attacking the subsidies that are inherent in waste generating activities at an early point in the process. The volume of disposables has been increasing dramatically since the 1950s to the point where disposal of wastes has become a global problem. This has led to the public pressure for recycling. The unrestrained tendency for industry to produce more and more disposable packaging has been fuelled by a massive subsidy in that the cost of disposal has been a public cost, not a cost to the industry or the consumer. Programs such as the 'Do the right thing' campaign have been financed by industry to ensure that the costs of disposal remain a public cost. For the Sydney region direct costs alone of waste disposal are now in the order of $150m a year. Many countries have now seen the futility of attempting to cope with almost unrestricted demand and have introduced packaging and product charges based on the volume and biodegradability of disposables. This results in an almost immediate reduction in the total volume of waste, as manufacturers rapidly redesign excess packaging and products to both reduce the volume and facilitate recycling. Australia must do likewise. Such a course will be difficult owing to the number of industry apologists in the bureaucraciesÂ· at all levels-particularly such organisations as the New South Wales State Pollution Control Commission. Industry organisations such as the Litter Research Association will do their best to prevent any such reform. A more stringent application of the 'polluter pays' principle must also be followed in the setting of water pollution charges for paper mills and in the pricing of energy. Consideration could be given to discouraging, through taxation policy and other means, those aspects of the process, such as chlorine bleaching, which are especially detrimental to the environment. Let us not forget either the enormous leverage that the Federal Government can bring to bear as a consumer. The Government should formulate and adopt a paper procurement policy that favours recycling and waste minimisation. Other governments around Australia should be encouraged to follow suit. Product labelling requirements and public education are further avenues for Federal Government action. Drawing all of these different lines approach together requires active considand in transport. eration of the issues and planning and consistent implementation over a long period. Rather than leaving it to the ket, there is a definite role for the Federal Government in formuhtting-in consulhave tation with community and industry groups-a sustainable paper industry plan. I hope that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and seas Territories and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) can cooperate in bringing such a plan to fruition.",165
186,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"-:-1 want to comment in this decountry; bate, which is a cognate debate encomvulnerable passing three reports-two from the emerging Industry Commission, which deal with the recycling of paper generally, and one the Automotive Industry Authority. It is clear that in this debate there has been common thread which one might not have thought of at first blush, and that is the very great importance of the increased efficiency of structural change in the omy-especially in combating inefficienhave cies in infrastructure, transport and on the waterfront and, further, in combating outmoded work practices of management and labour and restrictive union arrangestates, ments. This thread runs through the debate. I refer to the speech made by my colleague the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) when he was speaking to the paper industry report. The report deals with paper recycling and the prospects forÂ· additional production, sales and activity in that area. It concludes by asking the question: 'Are export subsidies the answer?'. The last paragraph then states: Export subsidies would do nothing to overcome the impediments to export caused by high freight rates and the costs and delays on the waterfront. Government attention to these issues would improve the competitiveness of all our exports, not just exports of paper for recycling. These are, of course, a couple of particular areas of so-called micro-economic reform. I do not want to get lost in the jargon, but what we mean by microeconomic reform is structural change for increased efficiency in particular sectors of of the economy, such as on the waterfront It is vitally important that we pursue these matters not only in the context in marwhich we find ourselves now at a time of deep recession-the recession we had to according to the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-but also in the context of the persistently high, and still very high, current account deficit and burgeoning overdebt. It is very important to come to terms with that overseas debt because it undermines living standards; by the mounting bill for debt service it conthe future development of this and, of course, it makes us very to external shocks, such as the world recession or falls in commodity prices. It is absolutely vital, as the from honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) stressed today during the discusa sion of the matter of public importance. The importance of these factors comes through in all of the reports which we are discussing-in particular, in relation to econthe paper industry. At the moment we a situation where we have very significant export in woodchips and that export realises a sum of almost $78 per tonne. If, as the Industry Commission there were increases in efficiency in transport and on the waterfront, if there were increases in efficiency in power generation and distribution-which is a section of the economy which is ripe for change and reform, particularly in pricing structures and interconnection between States where we could achieve lower power charges-and if, in this area, one could confront the extremist Green groups, we would make some progress. The argument in that area is changing out of sight with the progress of technology, as my colleague the honourable member for Braddon pointed out this morning. He was quoting the evidence of the Finland Kymmene Corporation and citing the projections for the volume of absorbable organic halogens-or organochlorides as we know them-which is falling very significantly and is approaching a very acceptable level compared with a few years ago. When one considers that as an argument against the Greens, and given an overall favourable economic environment-meaning low inflation and a competitive exchange rate-the investment in the necessary plants, hopefully world-scale plants, will foster exports, not just of woodchips at $78 a tonne, but of bleached pulp at $495 a tonne or even of fine paper at $995 a tonne; we can move up from $78 to $495 to $995. In aggregate terms, an annual export of about $360m in chips might be transformed to $2.2 billion in pulp or even an export of upwards of $4 billion-$4,000m-in terms of fine paper. This is the sort of change that a sound policy for the economy overall, for low inflation, a competitive exchange rate, and reform in the vital areas of transport, the waterfront and power, can bring aboutnot something in the form of hand-out export subsidies, which could barely scratch the surface. That is the sort of thing the Labor Party is talking about, and in fact was projecting for its 12 March statement. I think a bit more common sense is going to come into it. This would be a change in exports from a figure of, say, $400m up to $4 billion, brought about by the fundamental reform that must be implemented in this country if we are not to faU by the wayside and this current account deficit continues. Despite what has happened with the onset of the recession, it is true, as the Treasurer says, that the current account deficit has changed by of the order of 30 per cent-from the $2 billion level per month to about $1.3 billion. It has plateaued at $1. 3 billion; the adjusted figure for last month was $1.7 billion. That represents about 4 per cent of gross domestic product, which still means that the overseas debt will climb alarmingly as a proportion of GDP. Despite recession, we still have a current account deficit stalled at a level which is too high and is not sustainable. I said that there is a thread. Turning to the motor car industry, we have heard about some of the things that need to be done there. I want to draw attention to an excellent paper by Mr David Trebeck, which was delivered in Canberra only this week. In this paper he talks about the accord that exists-not the accord we are used to talking about in this place; the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), smiles because he knows all about thisbetween the Australian and New Zealand seamen's unions and the waterfront unions. It is an agreement that all transTasman freight will be carried in Australian and New Zealand-crewed ships. The effect of that is the familiar story that freight rates between Australia and New Zealand are about double the freight rate to Asia and about the same as those to Europe and America. An area of potential significant benefit . if this restraint were done away with is in the area of specialised shipping, particularly the transport of motor vehicles. That is why it is so relevant to this discussion tonight. It is suggested that in New Zealand there is a potential market for Australian-built cars of the order of 14,000, or a valuable export opportunity of the order of $150m. This would be far in excess of any sort of money we might try to put up by way of export incentive. Here is a real export opportunity. While I do not like to quote at length, from 1987 right up to the present time there have been continuous discussions between Australian and New Zealand Ministers, between officials and between trade union representatives, 'seeking to do something about it. But absolutely nothing has happened, and so we retain the situation set out in the Industry Commission's report. It states: Existing shipping arrangementstotally unchanged after four or five years of effort to do something about ithave been totally inadequate in several respects: (1) Total capacity offered by existing shipping operators appears to be just over 5,000 in 1991 with no proposals for this to be increased. Freight rates of $A950 per car compared poorly with the cost of shipping cars from Japan to Australia; That cost is less than $600. That could become roughly the cost trans-Tasman. There are no shipping services from Adelaide to New Zealand. So we have to ship a vehicle at a cost of $11 0 to Melbourne first and then pay that other cost. In addition, becauSe of the nonspecialised transport, 20 per cent of vehicles that are shipped are damaged, there are footprints all over the bonnets and roofs, they have spray damage, and so on. Here is a valuable opportunity for the export of Australian cars which is completely negatived by this arrangement. The whole export opportunity goes begging. The point is that quick-fix measures of export incentive hand-outs and things of that nature will not combat Australia's very difficult situation. It is a matter of getting the fundamentals right, getting inflation down and productivity up, particularly in areas where there is great need for the elimination of inefficiencies in infrastructure, as well as dealing with other factors affecting the supply side of the economy, the inflexible industrial relationssystem-although honourable members should not hold their breath because nothing has been done-and other such factors.

NA Motion (by Mr Crean) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Beneficiaries' Entitlements",168
187,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) relating to an anomaly in the method of calculating fortnightly payments of annual entitlements to beneficiaries. Just to give an example, a single beneficiary under the social security pension scheme receives an annual entitlement of $7,584.20, or $291.70 per fortnight. That fortnightly rate is calculated by dividing the annual rate by 26. A single beneficiary under the veterans affairs pension scheme who receives the same amount annually, $7,584.20, also receives $291.70 per fortnight. Once again, that is achieved by dividing the annual rate by 26. If one happens to be a single beneficiary of the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme and, say, one receives the same amount, $7,584.20, the formula for the calculation of that entitlement is quite different. In fact, the beneficiary receives $290.90 per fortnight, which is an annual difference of $20.80. The method for calculation of that entitlement is expressed in the formula in the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation as 14 times P-P being the amount per annum of the benefit-over 365. If we do those calculations on exactly the same amount, we find that there is a difference of $20.80 per year. Now, of course, the defence force retirement scheme is for people who have retired from the Services. However, for someone in the defence forces, for example, a new enlistee in the Army with an annual salary of $17,285, plus allowances, the calculation for his fortnightly payment under that scheme is, once again, his annual salary divided by 26. There is a difference in the calculations for active defence services personnel in regard to their fortnightly entitlement compared with those who have become beneficiaries of the Defence Force retirement fund. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are many thousands of beneficiaries of the Defence Force retirement fund. It is obvious that not only are these anomalies present in this particular area, but also, I believe, there could be anomalies in a number of other entitlement calculations-similar to the one I have referred to. I put it to the Treasurer that he should look at the annual entitlements and the methods of calculating fortnightly payments to beneficiaries and ensure that the formulas are brought into line. World Swimming Championships",170
188,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, many of us who are fortunate to live in Perth, like you do, had the opportunity in the first two weeks of January to watch the World Swimming Championships which took place in that city at that time. Tens of thousands of spectators attended the championships, which were a remarkable success. Indeed, it is a tribute to the organising committee, in particular Tom Hoad, that the organisation and planning turned out so well. It is also important to note the contribution made by the Federal and State governments to the running of those championships. It was a fantastic event and there were a number of fabulous performances. In fact, almost every day a world record was broken at the Superdrome pools. When attending those championships and talking to people involved with swimming, I became aware of an interesting statistic. Of the 38 members of the Australian team at those championships, only five were Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) scholarship holders. Certainly, the impression that many of us have had in this country is that the AIS in a number of sports is leading the way in respect of producing elite performances. When one looks at swimming programs around the country, one sees that the majority of swimmers come from Queensland and New South Wales. Even in Western Australia, where we have a relatively small program, we find that for a cost of about $140,000 the Western Australia Institute of Sport program provided six swimmers for the Australian teammore than the Australian Institute of Sport, which spends four or five times that amount of money. Indeed, if we include the long distance. swimmers, we see that Western Australia provided eight swimmers for the team. A view I formed as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into sports funding and administration-that is, the Martin Committee-which looked into the funding of elite sport was that we should look very closely at the concept of the Australian Institute of Sport and the way in which its residential programs are operated. It is my belief-it has been for some time; indeed, it was one of the recommendations of the Martin Committee-that there should be an increased decentralisation of those programs. It was interesting to note that the .Australian Swimming Coaches Association has put forward that view. When one looks at Australia's geography, at its climatic and regional differences, it only makes sense that we should be providing elite facilities for those who live in the major cities to enable them to achieve excellence. Swimming is just another example of this. From speaking to coaches it became clear that there was a common view that the allocation of dollars to a centralised program in Canberra was not necessarily the most efficient way that that could be done. We have seen other examples of this-for instance, in the gymnastics program. I refer to the success that the Western Australia Institute of Sport has had with its gymnastics program. The demands of swimmers and other athletes are so great that the dislocation necessary to remove them to a central program area and the changes and disruptIOn to their family life and other factors - elating to their lives need to be taken mto account. I am not advocating that the centralised program for AIS swimming in Canberra should be abolished I am saying that that program needs to be targeted. It needs to be competitive with other programs around the country. There need to be no disincentives to swimmers to stay where they are rather than come to Canberra. They need to be given the same opportunities wherever they are to pursue excellence. Indeed, the best ath-etes need to be supported. We .do not Just need developmental programs. It is important that Australia Swimming Inc. the former amateur body, understand this. It can choose the best model for swimming. It should not feel that it is held to ransom by the AIS. It is clear that swimming is one of Australia's pre-eminent int.ernational competition sports. It has led m producing Australia's profile as a sporting nation. It is important that - ustralia Swimming Inc. understand that It should be the body that decides the best m<;>del. It is clear that, in regard to A,:!s.tralIa's geography, decentralisation crItIcal to producing and providing the best opportunities for elite performers to reach their potential. It is my hope and certainly it is the view of the Go-ernÂ­ ment, that we should provide those opportunities in a decentralised way. We should support the best swimmers. We - hould allow the coaches to do the best Job by providing those opportunities.",171
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Paper Pulp Mills,172
190,Mr MILES,ADJOURNMENT,"This mornmg I was cut short when speaking on a !epo,rt on a parli-mentary trip to Scandmavla. I was talkmg about a visit to one of the pulp mills in Finland. I wish to make a few more comments in that regard tonight. I was saying that we visited Kuusankoski, a town of about 30 000 people which has a company called' the Kymmene Corporation, which actually has the largest fine paper machine in Europe. It produces around 500,000 tonnes of paper a year, which involves a very substantial quantity of pulp. We were shown around by that company and shown the upgrading that has taken place. The mill was started inÂ· the 1890s. It was a pleasure to be in an upgraded mill that was so clean. I mean clean in regard to the floor and to the whole operation in general. 'we had disc,ussiot?-s about the corporation's difficultIes wIth organochlprins and dioxins. I think that people in Australia are pretty well aware of the comments which have been made about dioxins. So I thought it would be worthwhile letting the Parliament know some of the information we received at our briefing there. Fi-st of all, i.f - e think we are going to be kIlled by dlOxms from pulp mills, all of us would have been dead long ago. We get 98 per cent of our dioxins exposure from our food. This information is from the United Kingdom Environment Agriculture and Fisheries and Health departments. That is quite an incredible statistic. Let us look at some examples of this. For e-a-ple, in J:I-llan.d, there is 80 parts of dIoxm per trIllIon m human breast milk is In Sweden it is 20 parts per trillion. Iany pulp or paper products, it is. between zero and 20. In other words, even in - uman breast milk there is actually four tImes the amount of dioxin that there is in any pulp or paper product made around the world. The chances of anybody being affected. by the dioxin w-ich comes from any of the kraft pulp mIlls around the world is very slim. Because many of us are not well trained or educated in the scientific - reas of our community, we need to realIse that alth<?ugh there are radical groups who would lIke to use chemical terminology to bebogey chemicals, as a parliament and as governments we have to be very careful to make sure that we do our homework so we are not fooled by these groups which form within our community, and which are, I believe to the ultimate detriment of our whole - ation. The second matter on which I would like to comment is the standards people were requiring of the pulp mill to be established in northern Tasmania. One of the debates was about how much organochlorin was going to be put into the ocean. The environmental movement in Australia was arguing it had to get down below 0.9 or 0.8 of a kilogram per tonne. At the cleanest pulp mill in Finland in this regard, in 1989 output was around 4.9 kilograms per tonne. At the same time here in Australia the environmental movement was demanding 0.9. The company was able to say 1.3. The most up to date technology existing in the world was being put into that pulp mill. It really is a disgrace that governments procrastinated over updating technology in this nation of ours which would have been much cleaner and much better for the environment. NA Mr ELLIOTI' (Parramatta) (10.42)Tonight I wish to raise an issue relating to both the Royal Australian Navy and the links it has with my electorate, Parramatta. During January we had the decommissioning of the third HMAS Parramatta, and last Saturday we had the eighty-first anniversary of the launching of the very first HMAS Parramatta. I raise these matters tonight because there is considerable interest and enthusiasm to have the Navy name a fourth HMAS Parramatta. This is a matter I have taken up with the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), and I seek to pursue it here tonight. It is worth noting that the link has stretched for 81 years between the Parramatta area and the Royal Australian Navy, and, of course, the link between Parramatta and naval pursuits goes back much further than that, given that the colony was founded by Governor Phillip back in 1788, so naval links with my electorate have stretched from that time. Those links have ensured, certainly in the 81 years we have had the Royal Australian N-vy and the electorate of Parramatta linked in name, that the Parramattas have contributed significantly to Australia's war and peace defence efforts. The first Parramatta played an active role through much of the First World War, and after that as well. The second Parramatta was lost in World War II; it was indeed the subject of the greatest wartime loss of any ship of the Royal Australian Navy. The third Parra matta, which was decommissioned in January, has also given distinguished service to Australia in various theatres of war and in various peacetime roles during the time it has been in active service with the Navy. In the approach that I and other people from the area have made to the Minister, we have identified the unique history of the linkage between the navy and our city. We have also identified the importance of maintaining that link. The Parramatta branch of the Returned Services League of Australia has been very active in seeking to pursue this link. I am very pleased to say that the response to date from the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, has been very positive. I have suggested to him that one of the ANZAC frigates which is being built should be named 'HMAS Parramatta IV' in order to keep the close association of the service and the historic city of Parramatta going. It is worth noting, as part of that process, that the Navy and the Minister have been very supportive of and sympathetic to that suggestion. I hope that, in the fullness of time, the unique relationship that has existed in the past will be maintained in this way. Today the Navy, including the HMAS Parramatta crews, has enjoyed the freedom of the City of Parramatta, and has participated actively in many ceremonies to commemorate that freedom of the city which the Navy has, and just as importantly, in playing an active role in events which are significant to the historic community I represent. It is with those matters in mind that I note that one of the great virtues of being able to maintain this link arises because we already have various memorials and various aspects of the Parramattas located within the area. Indeed, we have the stern of the first Parramatta located in a garden at Queens Wharf in Parramatta. We also have the bow of the second Parramatta located there. Those links ensure that each year, when we have a special anniversary service there to remember those who were tragically lost in the torpedoing of the second Parramatta in 1942, they are properly remembered, and that the people of the community are able to value-as they do very greatly-the worth of the Parramattas and the naval link. I urge the Minister and the Government to take on board the suggestion of naming one of the new ANZAC frigates 'HMAS Parramatta IV' so that this very close link and special relationship that has existed throughout the last 81 years will be maintained for the good of all those who recognise the great contribution the Royal Australian Navy has made to Australia, in this particular case, by maintaining its close association with the electorate of Parra11latta.

Mr BeddallThe Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The formation of the Purchase Australian Office was announced in a Joint Ministerial Statement in the House of Representatives on 3 October 1989. (2) The role of the Office was outlined in the Joint Ministerial Statement of 3 October 1989 as follows: 'This new and entrepreneurial organisation will be established in the Department of Administrative Services to develop a role in promoting Australian and New Zealand industry in Government and Government business opportunities to industry. It will help to educate business about Government buying, without cutting across what is already being done in Government departments and agencies. A 008 number has been installed in the new office to handle queries from local suppliers. 'The office will take on the role of designated body under the National Preference NA Agreement to investigate any complaints of discrimination. 'It will manage a public sector education program. 'It will work closely with those agencies in Government with specific industry development functions, such as the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and Austrade, and with the purchasing community generally. 'It will also join in investigating other suggested initiatives, such as strategic purchasing by Commonwealth and State Governments to develop local industries. And it will develop links with the Industrial Supplies Offices.' (3) The Office is a part of the Department of Administrative Services. (4) In 1990-91 the Purchase Australian Office has a budget of $240,000 for its public sector campaign. (5) The campaign, with the theme 'Offshore?

(The Purchase Australian Office was established in the Purchasing Reform Group.) The newsletter is also distributed to other people and o-ganisations as required. (b) The campaign material was sent to Senior Executive Service officers; and local purchasing officers and technical specification writers nominated by various portfolio departments and other Government agencies. This material was part of an educational campaign announced in the Joint Ministerial Statement of 3 October 1989. See also footnotes (1) and (2) to (a) above. (c) See (b) above. The material was sent to officers with purchasing related functions. Apart from the Senior Executive Service, the officers were nominated by departments and agencies. Copies were not sent to departments or agencies for general distribution. There were 3846 officers on the mailing list. The cost of mailing is shown in (a) above. (6) Yes. The Minister for Administrative Services recently issued Commonwealth Procurement Guideline No. 12 'Australian and New Zealand Supplies', which provides guidance on application of the Australian and New Zealand supplies policy. The guideline, issued under Finance Regulation 42, was tabled in the House of Representatives on 20 December 1990. Changes to the Government's policy regarding Australian and New Zealand supplies were announced in the Joint Ministerial Statement of 3 October 1989. The Statement included a commitment to a public sector education campaign about buying local products. As a Government organisation, CSIRO, along with other Commonwealth departments and agencies, was approached for a list of purchasing officers to which campaign material could be sent. That mailing occurred from mid-August to early September 1990.
