1,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I wish to ask tha Minister of Trade and Customs if he is aware,12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No question*; at least, there will be no answers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION S.",12
3,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. In the Age of Thursday last is a report of our proceedings of the preceding night, in which this passage occursProbably, the fiercest outburst of Opposition rage was that heard at 9 o'clock, when Mr W. H. Irvine was on his feet. He was replying to Mr Hughes, who had moved an amendment. ""We intend to put this motion through,"" he said, in his iciest tones, ""and if members are going to waste the time of the Committee The rest of the sentence was drowned in the uproar that followed it. ""Bully,"" shouted some one on the Opposition front bench. ""You are not in Ireland now,"" roared Mr Finlayson. Whoever may have wished that the At torney-General was in Ireland, the remark was not made by me.",13
4,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It was I who made it .,13
5,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It did not occur to me to connect the action of the At torney-General wit h Ireland. not make any comparison between his action and what happened during even the worse days of coercion.,13
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memher is not in order in going beyond a personal explanation. . Mr Fenton - I desire to make a persona] explanation. I was not allowed during the turmoil on Wednesday night to do so, though I then endeavoured to put my complaint before the Chair, that Ministers had refused to carry out the promise that they had made to allow ample debate on the Postal Voting Restoration Bill . When I found that, in stead of that promise being carried out, the closure was applied, I made use of a certain expression, applying it to the statement of those. on the Ministerial bench. I used it when smarting under a sense of injustice, because a promise which had been made had not been kept.",13
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should like to say, by way of personal explanation, that the action of the Government was taken because Ministers did not think that the condition which they had i m posed on the debate was being conformed to by members of the Opposition. MEMBER'S ATTENDANCE.",13
8,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I ask you, Mr Speaker, when is a man in the House and when is bb o u t ! Yesterday I was here, but I did not come in here. If a man is in the House, and is not in when the House opens, does the day count?",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I do not rightl y . understand the question. The honourable member asks me when is a member in the House and not in the House. He says that he was here yesterday. If he desires a reply, I hope that he will state his question more lucidly. TREATMENT OF OPPOSITION .",13
10,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I should like to auk the Prime Minister a question. It does not relate to a matter of party i m portance, and is one which I think he will answer. I ask if he has noticed thati the new President of China, to get r i d of the Opposition, has ejected the whole crowd? Does he intend to follow thati course ?",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would again point out to the House that it is distinctly out of order, and has been ruled so many times, not only by. myself, but also by I would other occupants of the Chair, to ask questions of a frivolous or ironical character. Such questions are not in order. NO - CONFIDEN CE MOTION .",13
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I ask the leave of the House to address a question to. the Leader of the Opposition before he begins his speech. Leave granted.,13
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should like to know from the right honourable member whether there is any chance of soon putting a termination to the debate which he proposes to initiate ! There are two motions on the notice-paper, both of which are censure motions. Unless something is done in regard to them, there will be opened up an almost interminable debate, the end of which no one can foresee. We are nearly at the end of the year; our business is still uncompleted, and I ' do not think that we ought to tolerate much furthe r debate on these matters.",13
14,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Is this a question or a threat? Do what you like.,13
15,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,Clos e the debate today.,13
16,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Surely the Prime Minister will give us a few days?,13
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am ' very much obliged to the honourable member for Gwydir for permission to do as I like. I want to say that unless we understand that there is to be a reasonable period put to this debate, the Government will not permit it to continue indefinitely.",13
18,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,We do not favours from you.,14
19,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Hav e you the vote?,14
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I must insist on quiet being observed.,14
21,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I understand that the Prime Minister got the leave of the House to ask me a question. I ask you, Mr Speaker, and the House, whether he asked the question ?",14
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I thought I did. Mr W . H . IRVINE - He asked whether the debate might be expected to conclude today.,14
23,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Nothin g of the sort. Other honourable members,14
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I want, honourable members clearly to understand at this early stage of the proceedings that I shall not permit the continuance of the disorder that has characterized our proceedings for some time past. able members will not obey the call to order, I shall take steps under the standing order to enforce obedience to my directions.",14
25,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I thank you, sir, for protecting me from interruptions. I ask you whether you heard any question put to me by the Prime Minister? The At torney-General says that the honourable gentleman asked me if I would agree to conclude the debate today, but no such words were uttered by him.",14
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then you what I said ?,14
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the Prime Minister puts that question, I shall answer it .",14
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Why ask what said, if the right honourable member knows?",14
29,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I heard threats and sundry statements. If the Prime M in ister was prompted afterwards, that has nothing to do with me.",14
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Don' t be ridiculous.,14
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Speakin g in my official capacity as Leader of the Opposition, I repeat today what I said yesterday, that the debate will be a reasonable one, and I think ought to conclude in the early days of next week. I think that a fair arrangement. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I should like permission to address yet another question to the Leader of the Opposition. Leave granted.",14
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I presume that the statement of the right honourable [106]- 2 ask any member applies to the discussion of the first notice of motion ? arranged Mr FISHER - To the discussion of the motion of which I gave notice.,14
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the right honourable member speak in regard to both discussions? Notice has been given by members of the Opposition of two censure motions.,14
34,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Onl y one censure motion on the Government. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The other is a censure motion, too, and this is the point, that the discussion of it will also consume the time of the House. That is what I want to be clear about. It is the only interjecting, thing that I care about.",14
35,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Althoug h this conduct is extraordinary, it is nothing unusual in this Parliament. My reply to the Prime Minister is that the Opposition will afford him every facility for coming to a If honor- conclusion on this and all other motions without delay.",14
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What does that mean ?,14
37,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Does it mean that the debate wil l conclude on Tuesday or Wednesday?,14
38,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It means that there will be no waste of time. In a deliberative assembly matters will be discussed in a proper manner, and a decision will be arrived at without delay.",14
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,All I have to heard say is this,14
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister may not speak again except with the permission of the House. Is it the desire of I honourable members that the honourable gentleman have leave to speak?,14
41,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"We never "" gag."" Leave granted.",14
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Interpretin g the notions of the right honourable member as to what reasonable time means in the light of what has already taken place this session, this Government will reserve its right to terminate this debate at any period it thinks f it .",14
43,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [10.43] - I move That the Government does not possess the confidence of this House. A f t e r these extraordinary preliminaries, members will not be surprised if there are some further surprises in store for this Parliament.",14
44,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,We are getting accustomed to them.,14
45,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On e might have expected the Prime Minister to know yesterday the policy of the Government and the course that he intended to pursue. Wheu I gave notice of my motion, he asked me whether I thought the debate on it could be reasonably concluded today, and I said "" n o ."" He asked when it would be concluded, and I said that I thought it would be finished in the early sittings of next week. I adhere to that, because it is necessary that honourable members should be afforded an opportunity of being heard on important matters of concern to the people of this country. The Prime Minister stated then that the Government were most anxious to get on with public business. But immediately the House rose, his colleague in the Senate, Senator Millen, moved that the Senate, at its rising, should adjourn u n t i l the 19th inst.",15
46,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,It does not say much for his intelligence.,15
47,Mr IETSHER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member for Grampians ask the House and the country to believe that Senator Millen acts on his own individual responsibility, and not upon instructions by his Prime Minister ? Is that the way in which this - Government carries on its business ? Does the reputed leader in another place act upon his own responsibility, while the Leader in this House takes action upon his individual responsibility, and then corrects it next day? We are beginning to learn something. We are securing in formation which we did not expect. There is no justification at all for the plea of urgency in this chamber whilst another place is not sitting. But whether that be so or not, the promise made by the Opposition in this House will be kept. We keep our promises.",15
48,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,It was repudiated by the honourable member for Barrier.,15
49,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable memher for Kooyong knows that we keep our promises, whether they be for us or against us.",15
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And promise 1,15
51,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is only fair that the Prime Minister should know what it is. Apparently he has forgotten what I said yesterday. I then stated, and I repeat the statement, that we should conclude this debate in the early sittings of next week.",15
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And the debate on the next matter ?,15
53,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I shall deal with that when it comes before the House. It is not before the House now, and it would be foolish for me to discuss that, or any subsequent business except the Government business, with which it is my duty to deal at present. I draw attention to the fact that the action of the Government has made this assembly no longer a deliberative one. It is just as well that the people should know that, unless this Parliament is restored to what it was, and must ever remain in a free community, the interests of the citizens of Australia will suffer. Corruption can, and will, creep in , unless honourable members are free to express their opinions in this House.",15
54,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,W it h o u t any limit?,15
55,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that the Standing Orders place a time l i m it on speeches in this Chamber, and that no honourable member can trespass beyond that limitation which is provided for by this Parliament. If the Government were honest and straightforward in the matter-if they thought that the time allowed was excessive-the y ought to amend the Standing Orders, as other Governments have done. The excessive use of the closure has been in the interests, not of public business, but of the political views of the present Administration. Speaking recently in his own Legislature on the matter of closuring even great questions, Sir Will f r i d Laurier, who is certainly au authority not to be lightly set aside, said that his Government, during his twenty years of leadership, had never once moved the closure, although it was provided for, and there was an occasion when the Opposition in the Canadian Parliament held up a measure for over six months without allowing a single line to pass.",15
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Would the r i g ht honourable gentleman mind telling us why his party brought in the closure standing order ? what is the Mr TUDOR - We did not bring it in .,15
57,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As the honourable member for Yarra says, we did not bring it in.",15
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Labour party insisted on its being brought in .,15
59,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister asks why I supported the passing of the closure standing order. The closure, in my opinion, is a perfectly proper piece of machinery to prevent deliberate and w i l f u l obstruction. But during our term of office we passed eighty odd measures with out once applying the closure. those measures was passed only after the Opposition of that day had opposed it for twenty-three solid hours.",15
60,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,For forty-two hours.,16
61,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Quite so. passed after a continuous sitting of fortytwo hours, during which the Leader of the present Government kept his party here to oppose us. We never even thought of applying the closure so long as we believed that honourable members had anything useful to say. We maintained the traditions of Parliament as a deliberative assembly. vernment has lost them. I believe it was at the suggestion of the present Prime Minister that the closure standing order was brought in .",16
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What ?,16
63,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Was not the honourable gentleman a member of the Standing Orders Committee which suggested it ?,16
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I through. I will tell the right honourable member who suggested it . Let him look at an honourable member now sitting in the Opposition corner.,16
65,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I voted against it.,16
66,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As usual, the Prime Minister wants to talk while I am speaking.",16
67,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1 1 remind the right honourable meinber that he put a question to the Prime Minister.,16
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I say again that I did not support the closure standing order, eitlier in Committee or in the House.",16
69,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask, is it connow tended that a reasonable debate took place on the Loan Bill before the plication of the closure? any Government proposals which ought to be l e ft open to full , free, and open sion they are its financial measures. The Loan Bill , which was introduced by Treasurer provides for an appropriation of £3,080,000 . The right honourable member moved the second reading of the Bill one afternoon, and when he resumed his seat 1 replied to some stateday, ments made by him, which were likely to leave a false impression in the fore, minds of the people, and which should be at once refuted. Having made that part of my speech, I asked for leave to continue my remarks at a later date. The Minister of Trade and Customs was then the only member of the Government One of present. I subsequently asked the Prime Minister to be allowed to continue my speech in accordance with what has been the practice of this House from its inception. That request was refused. The It was question, "" that the debate be adjourned,"" was then put, and it was carried against the Government. At the very next sitting the closure was applied. It must be said to the credit of the Prime Minister that it was not moved by him. He did not seem to desire to support the moving of the closure.",16
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am responsible This Go- for it , all the same.",16
71,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Of course the honourable gentleman is. The Prime Minister of the day, whoever he is, must be responsible for what his Ministers do. The Prime Minister tells the world that he is responsible for the action of his Ministers.",16
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not want any credit for not having moved the closure. opposed it all That is what I meant.,16
73,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is the first principle of responsible government that the leader of a Government shall be responsible for everything his Ministers do. The At torney-General took the business out of the hands of the Prime Minister, and moved the application of the closure.",16
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Absolutel y incorrect.,16
75,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It was interesting to notice the eagerness with which the Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Honorary Minister vied with each other subsequently to get in first with the motion "" that the question be put . "" Sometimes all three of them were on their feet at the same time trying apto catch the eye of the Speaker or the If there areChairman, and to move "" that the question be now put . "" They seemed to think discusthat there was honour attaching toi t . They wanted to be in touch with the real the leader of the party. I admit that the honourable member for Darling Downs, after making three or four unsuccessful attempts to get in with the motion, seemed to be very crestfallen until the following when he had the good fortune to catch the eye of the Speaker, and therethe privilege of moving for once the I thought application of the closure.",16
76,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would remind the right honourable member that it is not necessary for an honourable member to catch the eye of the Speaker in order to move the closure. An honourable member is not called, but can rise and interrup t a speech with such a motion.",16
77,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am the last, as you know, sir, to come into conflict with an opinion expressed by the Chair-eve n if it be what I may call an extra opinion - bu t I understand that you can hear nothing unless you see something, and unless an honourable member catches your eye he cannot move even the closure. We shall, however, leave that matter, for it has nothing to do with this debate. The point that I wish to make is that the closure was moved by the Attorney-General, and was moved to stifle discussion, and not to secure the passing of the Bill . There is in the Loan Bill an item which is new, and for supporting which not one honourable member opposite has any warrant. The elections of 1910 were fought largely on the question of the Financial Agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, and, secondly, on the question of the use of loan money for defence purposes. The country gave us a substantial, solid verdict on that question. Under this Loan Bill loan moneys are appropriated in respect of ordinary defence expenditure. Yet no honourable member of the Opposition was given an opportunit y to discuss that particular item. When the matter came before us in Committee- a place of which you, sir, have no cognisance- I tried to catch the eye of the Chairman because I desired, by moving an amendment, to enable a discussion to take place upon the question. then, the question was at once put, so that I had no opportunity to discuss it . There has been introduced into the Loan Bill a proposal which may lead to unlimited expenditure on ordinary defence purposes, and may thus violate the principle that has been agreed to by a majority of the electors.",17
78,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"What does the right honourable member call "" ordinary defence purposes"" ?",17
79,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is fair, I think, that I should explain. I have stated my position again and again, but I shall state it once more. A Government which pledges the credit of the country for ordinary annual defence services, except in time of emergency-o' f war or impending war-is a Government that should not be permitted to remain in office in a country such as this. Ordinary defenceexpenditure means equipment, the purchase of land for buildings, and even rifle ranges and manceuvre areas-thes e are ordinary services of the country. If we pledge our credit in time of prosperity, when there has been left to the Government a surplus of £2,653,000, and when the Government are spending over £4,000,000 more than we did last year, how can any one expect the resources of the country to meet the demands in future years? The Government have gone back directly on theverdict of the people, and they have done this purposely, willingly, and determinedly; indeed, I believe if they had the opportunity they would do it again. At the last election the cry was raised that the previous Government had been extravagant, and that if honourable gentlemen opposite were returned they would reduce expenditure and conserve the people'smoney-that they would not go in for an expenditure of anything like £21,000,000 or £22,000,000, but would protect the interests of the people in this respect. Well, the present Government came into place-thoug h not into power - and they sit there today, not by virtueof a majority of the electors. They hold tlieir places with a minority vote in this House, and in the other House, so far as the electors are concerned; and from that point of view they have no warrant,, in my opinion, for carrying on the affairs of the country. They are quite entitled, being in office, to carry on thegovernment within the rules of thisEven House, and within administrative rules,, as they think best in the interests of the country; but beyond that they have nowarrant at all.",17
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did the right honourable member know that when he suggested that we should try?,17
81,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"My contention is that the Government have no warrant in carrying on the government to alter the policy of the country, and, in endeavouring to do so, to suppress debate. Tlieir attempt to rouse the country against the alleged extravagant expenditure of the previous Government has absolutely failed. They are asking Parliament to expend over£4,000,000 more than was even proposed on the Estimates last year, and the proportion set aside in the Loan Bill for defence expenditure is totally and absolutely unwarranted. I should like tobriefly refer to what the Treasurer said in introducing the Loan Bill . The right honourable gentleman certainly left the impression on the minds of honourable members and of the country that the late Government, during their term of office, had largely increased the loan indebtedness of the people of Australia. That is not so. According to the Constitution, the Commonwealth had to take over the transferred properties' indebtedness, together with the Northern Territory expenditure, under an agreement, and all the loan expenditure, which it was undoubtedly due to the Commonwealth to take over. We expended out of revenue for loan purposes some millions of money, which, in my opinion, were properly expended in the services of the country. The Treasurer also said just enough to leave the impression that during our term of office we had added £637,000 to loan expenditure in the Northern Territory. We did nothing of the kind. That was an indebtedness incurred by South Australia, and we simply took it over as part of the indebtedness of the people of Australia. In these matters we did not add a single penny to the debt of the Commonwealth; so that that may pass. We expended £200,000 out of our annual income in reducing the transferred debt of the Northern Territory. Treasurer stated that the indebtedness of the Commonwealth is now about £22,000,000; and that is quite true. I mention this to honourable members, and to the electors, for the reason that a large number of the supporters of hon'-orable members opposite, and their press advocates, have paraded the fact that, during our term of office, we incurred a liability on behalf of the Commonwealth of some £20,000,000 odd. We have i curred no new liabilities; but the people of the Commonwealth, through this Parliament, have become responsible for that sum, instead of the various States remaining responsible to the money-lender. That is the absolute and known fact, although it lends itself very easily to misrepresentation.",17
82,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,When did - one misrepresent the right honourable member in this connection ?,18
83,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is a sorry matter that these things have to be stated again and again for the protection of honourable members, and for the benefit of the people of the country who do not know the facts. I come now to the Electoral Bill. When the present Government came into office, the first statement they made to the country-as the honourable member for Ballarat, particularly, wil l remember-wa s that it was their business to purify the rolls, and then go to the country. The Honorary Minister alleged that the rolls contained an excessive number of names, and that many thousands of persons had abused their trust by voting doubly. However, since that time, the Government have not proved a single one of those allegations. They submitted a Bill , in which they made provision for an alteration in regard to the attestation of postal votes, to the extent of preventing the attestator getting possession of the ballot-paper. We were told that this was an essential part of the amendment of the Electoral Act ; but later we find the Government coming down with a Bill of one clause, in which they eliminate that proposal, though it was said to be essential, and thus leave the practice just as it was before. On this point, we did not have the slightest explanation-no t the merest informatiou on the point, or any reason was given; and, although they said the old provision was unworkable, The or, rather, was not safe, we find it proposed to be restored by the use of the "" g a g . "" There is another Bill that we are promised, which might have met the same fate as the Loan Bill and the Electoral Bill if this motion had not been submitted. That is the Bill to be called the "" Government Preference Prohibition Act 1913,"" and its one clause is in these termsNo preference or discrimination shall he made n - for or against any person in relation to any employment hy the Commonwealth or by any Department or authority thereof, on account of his membership or non-membership of any political or industrial association. As I read this proposal of the Government, it means Mr W . H . IRVINE - The right honourable member cannot anticipate thati Bill in this debate. any - Mr FISHER - I think I can. I think the question is before the House. Perhaps it is just as well that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General should have time to confer.",18
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We have nothing to do with the right honourable member; let him get along with his speech.,18
85,Mr FISHER,Unknown,We do not know whether the consultation has to do with me and the House or not.,19
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the orable member in order in animadverting on the fact that I am having a little talk with my colleague ? Do not the rules of order in this House permit of my speaking to my colleague ?,19
87,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is entitled to speak to his colleagues provided he does not interrupt the course of the debate. I understand, however, that the honourable member for Wide Bay thought that the consultation had some reference to him, and that he, as a matter of courtesy, paused for a moment or two.",19
88,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I did not wish to in terrupt the conversation. The Attorney General suggested that I was not in order in referring to the Bill in this debate, but you, sir, took no exception to my doing so; and I thought that, perhaps, the Attorney-General was going to raise a point of order. This important Bill , in my opinion, strikes at a principle by which the Labour party, at any rate, are prepared to stand.",19
89,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The right honourable member will not be in order in discussing' the principle of a Bill already before the House, though he would be in order in referring to the question in general terms.",19
90,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It will be sufficient to point nut what I think the proposal and the policy of the Government mean. I take the Bill to provide that any employee of the Government, in any capacity whatever, may not, by any act of any person in the Commonwealth, whether he be a Judge, or any one else, have the rights and privileges and protection of the laws that are enjoyed by ordinary persons engaged by private employers. Mr W . H . IRVINE - A p a r t from the Standing Orders, you are in au awkward position in trying to discuss the matter before it is introduced.",19
91,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On anything the At torney-General says I place the greatest weight; but, at the same time, this is an occasion when we must deal with the policy of the Government, and I can get ample warrant for what I am saying, not from what is in the Bill referred to, but from what was in the manifesto submitted by the Government at the beginning of the session, when they introduced their policy. So the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister need not be looking up authorities.",19
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Attorneyright honGeneral and I are not discussing the honourable member, or what he has been saying. He can rest his mind as to that.",19
93,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I may be allowed to quote one or two things the Prime Minister has said about preference to unionists. I am sure he will forgive me for saying that, in his past, he has expressed many opinions, both personally and otherwise, with regard to preference to unionists. He is reported in the Argus of 16th July of this year to have said I want it to be understood that this Government is making no attack on unionism. That is the last thing we have in mind. We have every sympathy with industrial unionism. There never was, and there is not now, any intention to take steps to bring down wages or interfere with unionism in any way. The Honorary Minister, Mr Kelly, speaking two days earlier, saidUnionists and non-unionists will be treated alike.",19
94,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,That is what they are trying to get at.,19
95,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"They are not. We find the Prime Minister saying furtherEvery citizen who seeks public employment has an inalienable right to have his application decided solely on its merits. Why, then, prohibit his right to go to the Arbitration Court, as any other man can do ? Why should not the casual employee, digging a drain for a conduit, have the right to go to the Arbitration Court, and get the protection of the Court, like any other employee?",19
96,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Who says that he hasa uot?,19
97,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The proposal of the Government is that they are prepared to penalize private employers-if it is a penalty for the Court to decide a matter-bu t they are not prepared.to guarantee to the workmen in the Government employ the same protection as workmen in private employ can secure. This proposal, with a pretended plea to make every one equal, is, apparently, a determination on the part of the Government to differentiate between Government employee's and private employees, to the detriment of the private employer. Why should we put a burden on the private employer, a contractor, for instance, that we will not put on our own Government. I have often said that Parliament is the most incompetent Court to deal with in dustrial matters, and the transfer of the decision as regards wages and conditions of labour from Parliament to a Court is one of the best things that has ever happened. The Court can examine every trade and every industry, and determine what are fair and reasonable wages and conditions, and if it does so every reasonable Government and Parliament will see that the award of the Court is carried out. But the Prime Minister went a great deal further in his earlier days before he came into contact with the gentlemen now surrounding him. He said that when he was the secretary of a union he took good care that no unionists would work with non-unionists. They took most drastic action to see that that was carried out. He also said in the Chamber later on that if he were in the same position today he would do the very same thing. But he is not in that same position; he is today with other people, and so he does the very opposite. He is a veritable Vicar of Bray in the matter; he will do anything for the company he is in. As secretary for a union he would fight for that union, and speak for it in the most manly way; he declared that unionists were better than non-unionists; he quoted Gladstone and Thorold Rogers to show that the unionists had done more for the world than, perhaps, any other body the world had hitherto known, and that they were expected to do more in the future; and he said that the attempt to victimize unionists was an attempt by selfish employers to degrade unionists and destroy them, and keep from them that to which they were justly entitled. But now that he is in a position of trust and honour, he is prepared to go back on all that, and to declare that unionists may fight in their unions, that they may be victimized, and that they may secure the passage of legislation through Parliament; but that when he gets the opportunity he will wipe out that legislation and prevent unionists being treated even as fairly as others. His colleague, the Attorney General, is not in that position. He does not believe in any pandering or in any special legislation for the protection of unionists.",19
98,Mr WEST,Unknown,Excep t for the protection of the legal fraternity.,20
99,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The legal profession, with which the honourable gentleman is associated, have ample protection. They take care that their preference will be ample and sumcient for them. The Prime Minister, on the plea that preference to unionists is unjust, because public money is used to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists, has gone back on every profession he made when he was a unionist and until he took office on this occasion; and he does not seem to be in the slightest way ashamed of it. It is too late in the day for any Government or any Parliament to try to crush out unionism or unionists. The path of the progress of the world is strewn witli the bodies of those who have been victimized-and their children too-in getting to the stage of industrial unionism that we have now reached, and I feel sure that whatever the attempt of the Government may be, the Democracy of Australia will take care that the rights of unionists are protected, not only as regards private employment, but also as regards public employment. The proposal of the Government is intended to prejudice the electors of the country, and to hit at the unionist and place him at a serious disadvantage. . I pledge myself to do all I can to make it absolutely impossible for the Government to carry out their policy in this regard.",20
100,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,It is intended to protect public funds.,20
101,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Her e we have a charge by the honourable member for Wimmera.  was the originator of trades unionism in Victoria.,20
102,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,20
103,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The suggestion of the honourable member is that the proposal of the Government must be accepted in order to get honest work out of unionists. The charge is absolutely unwarranted, and it is one that the Prime Minister and his colleagues will not try to prove. In his earlier days, the Prime Minister said that unionists had to work harder than free labourers. I agree with him. The Prime Minister knows it is true today. Let any honourable member on the Ministerial side become a prominent unionist, and see whether he can get off with less work than the average free labourer. Let them experiment in that way, and see whether the Prime Minister was not right in what he said in his earlier days. It seems to be a popular cry at present to denounce the unionists as loafers, and so on. We heard a great deal of that during the election. What proof have we since the present Government came into office that it was so? is not the slightest proof that any abuse followed the recognition of unionisbic principle, or that during our term of office men were allowed to draw public money that they did not earn. As a matter of absolute fact the unionist has always to earn his money much harder than the privileged non-unionist. The Prime Minister at different times during the last fifteen years said that he was against unionists working with non-unionists, the reason being that non-unionists were used by employers to reduce the wages and conditions of labour of unionists; and now he is doing his utmost to compel unionists to work with non-unionists in the Public Service. What right has he to do that? If he believes i u the principles he has hitherto enunciated, he ought not to be a party to this measure. I can only conclude that he has been driven into this position by those with whom he is now associated. "" Mr FALKINER - Canno t a man change his mind-hi s opinions and his principles ?",20
104,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Nobod y will object if the Prime Minister gets up and says honestly that he has changed his mind. He said-and I quoted, the statement because it was important-that the Government did not intend to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists. That was before this Bill was introduced; but now this Bill is before us as a declaration of policy, and the proposal, if it means anything, is to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists. rate, supposing that we brush that point to one side, what remains of his declaration that no unionist should be asked to work alongside of a non-unionist ? Underlying this proposal, I believe that more astute members of the Government than the Prime Minister himself have in view an industrial conflict by which they hope to gain politically. If the statement is true, that a unionist cannot honestly work with a non-unionist, there is bound to be trouble in the Public Service.",21
105,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Do vou say he can ?,21
106,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think he can, in our Public Service. A member of the honourable member's profession may and does go on strike. Does the honourable member remember how, not long ago, in this State, a member of his high, honourable and learned profession, being retained to There defend a person on a capital charge, went on strike just before the case was brought on?",21
107,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"H is "" screw "" was not good enough.",21
108,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Balaclava, who is always fair in his interjections, has named the very reason given by the legal gentleman-that his fee was not large enough. If thehas unionist, who has only his hands between himself and the starvation of his wifeand children, protests, a great body of the jiress, and a great number of the representatives of the people here, howl him down as a striker, but if he happens to belong to a learned profession, or be in a good position in society, he can refuse to perform the services of his office, and still remain a gentleman. The other day we learned from the honourable memberf or Wentworth that the Government, since they came into office, had saved the country £126,000 . Much has been made of this statement; but when the honourable member for Grey interrogated the Minister of External Affairs on the same point, the Minister said there was no „ truth in that matter-that there was nosaving at all .",21
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did he say that there was no truth in it?,21
110,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"He said that there was no real saving at all-that the Minister of Home Affairs had made a mistake, and that it was a mere transfer of the work from the Soutli Australian Government to the Commonwealth.",21
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Quot e the stateA t any ment. The honourable member is making a complete misrepresentation.,21
112,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not want to misrepresent anybody. I wish to deal with several of the Prime Minister's statements, which I have had no opportunity to discuss. One is his statement, often, repeated, that, if the Opposition had been in office, they would have imposed extra taxation during this Parliament. That may be the Prime Minister'sopinion, but it is against the public policy of the party. No such proposal would have been made, and no fresh taxation would have been imposed. It is a cunning insinuatory suggestion to the public that Codlin is their friend, and not Short. I think they will beinclined to change their friends soon if they get an opportunity. Another extraordinary and unusual statement madepublicly by the Prime Minister was that i when he came into office he found a set - of papers minuted by myself regarding the transfer of Admiralty House, and it was only by his strenuous action and careful consideration that the Commonwealth was not robbed of the value of that property. There is nothing in that file of papers to warrant the statement. It is another attempt to mislead the public as to the facts. I would ask the Prime Minister to p ut the papers on the table of the Library.",21
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am prepared to - do so.,22
114,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The question of the - Commonwealth and State's right to the property was negotiated for a considerable - time.,22
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You conceded the whole question. Y o u proceeded to a valuation.,22
116,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"A valuation is absolutely necessary in connection with the transfer properties. For three or five years we were examining the values of the properties of the States for the purposes of transfer, and therefore, in this case, it was necessary to have a valuation, but there was no proposal with - the intention of coming to an - agreement for the Commonwealth to pay for that property if it belonged to our-selvesThe question at issue was whether the transfer was to the Commonwealth from the Imperial Government or to the State, and whether in the latter case it had to be transferred to the Commonwealth From the State as their property. I hope this debate will give the Government the opportunity they have been seeking for a long time to get to the country. If they have any honest intention to do so, I think they will get their opportunity. One cannot believe that they intend to suppress discussion in this House on the casting vote of the presiding officer. One cannot believe that it is the ambition of a party which claims to be a Liberal party to prevent free discussion here on matters of public finance. The - Government have no policy. What they have is a mere tentative policy for the time being, and the spectacle that we have seen in this House lately must have been painful to most constitutionalists who have witnessed it . We have over thirty honourable members on the opposite side of the House representing various constituencies, holding divers opinions, - sitting silent when important subjects are 'brought forward, being asked by the Whips to say "" A y e "" or "" No "" at the direction or whim of the Government, and being led across the House to vote without any independent judgment whatever. Occasionally we hear a murmur of dissent from one member or another, but it never goes beyond that. That is not the attitude of men who desire to again visit their constituents. That is not the attitude of a Government who feel themselves embarrassed by the present situation, and wish to consult their masters again. This taunt by the Government of a desire to go to the couutry when they are ready is the merest pretence. Theirs is the responsibility, not ours. The weeping and whining of the Prime Minister to the press, that he will not be allowed to go to the country on his own terms is not in keeping with the dignity of the office that he holds. He has often referred to my dignity, and he will pardon me if I refer to it once in respect to his office. He is Prime Minister, and, I believe, he is proud of it . If the Government think that the electors should be again consulted, why do they not consult them ? The Opposition are prepared to give them every opportunity to do so. There has never been a Government in this Parliament who have bowed their necks so much to the press of the country as have the present Government. From the most important to the least important member of the present Ministry, not one of them says anything in this House which he considers smart criticism of the Opposition without looking up to the metropolitan press gallery to see whether the press are taking notice of what is being said. The Government have been entirely guided by the press. By looking at what appears in the press from time to time, the Opposition can tell what the policy of the Government is to be. We have seen them change their policy in a day, and in an hour, at the dictates of the great metropolitan press of this country. What happened only today? The Prime M i nister, taken off his guard yesterday, moved the adjournment of the House. It was evident that that did not meet with the views of his Cabinet or the approval of his press supporters, and today we have witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of a Prime Minister interrogating the Leader of the Opposition three or four times in order to cover his retreat and protect his position. Honourable members and the public should bear in mind that this humiliating spectacle has taken place in the National Parliaright ment of Australia. It is a degradation to which I venture to say no previous possessors of the high offices held by M isters have ever submitted to, and trust none will ever submit to such degradation in the future. It is due Australia, and to the Federal Parliasponsibilities ment, that those holding office as M isters of the Crown should possess some sense of national responsibility.",22

Th eir sole consideration is the promotion international complications. of legislation and administration which will lead to the improvement of the social conditions of the people, and stand to the credit of the nation.

Mr JOSE PH COOK - Referenc e has what been made to the enormity of the wishes crime of applying the closure in can this House. I shall uot debate inatter, because I do not attempt seriously to reply to the statements which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. They do not deserve serious reply, for the reason that they made first of all on my suggestion. have already been replied to scores times during this session. Not one single new question was suggested or propounded by the riglit honourable member. simply gave us a re-hash of the same old "" trip e "" that we have heard during past four months. I wish to say that whatever has been done in regard to application of the closure has been done in an attempt to expedite the public business of this country. My right honthat particular occasion. orable friend said that his Government passed eighty-three Acts during the last Parliament without the imposition of the closure. We have scarcely been able to pass one Act this session without its plication. Why? Simply because of the difference between the attitude of the Opposition towards his Government and but the attitude of the Opposition towards this Government. There can be no other reason. We have not been blocking public business. We have been endeavouring push it through. If the right honourable member was able to get eightv-three through this Parliament without the application of the closure, the Opposition his Government must have treated him infinitely better than the present sition is treating us. His statement, therefore, carries its own condemnation, and is the clearest of all imputations the fair and reasonable conduct of the Opposition in this Chamber. Now, with regard to the closure and application. Under this heading T merely wish to utter a half-dozen sentences. busiFirst, as to the gentleman who, of all others, is most responsible for the closure t being brought into existence- I refer to Mr Watson. Speaking in this House on the 16th November, 1905-as will be seen by reference to Hansard, page 5294 Half-a-dozen honourable members mav be actfrom the best possible motives, being thorconvinced lhat they are justified in using every weapon which presents itself for preventing certain legislation from going through. I make charge against their bona fides. But repre.Government becomes impossible when it lies in the whim of a few individuals to say legislation shall pass. That is a condition of things of which no honourable member who well for the institutions of this country look upon without foreboding and without that trying to lake steps to alter. We did take steps to alter and stop the drearydrip of discussion which has proceeded in this Chamber for four months, a and the application of the closure was It of was not, as my right honourable friend has suggested, applied without my consent, and in spite of me. Nothing of the He kind. It was I who first suggested the application of the closure. I am responthe sible for its imposition, as any Prime Minister sliould be. I may tell the right the honourable member something more-that the Attorney-General wished to be very much more gracious to the Opposition on He was prepared to let them go for two or three hours longer. I thought they had gone long enough in the interests of the count r y , and I am responsible for the first apapplication of the closure. Indeed, I am responsible for every application of it . I wish to say that the Government did their duty. W it h these things cleared out of the way, while I had prepared a reply to an indictment of the Government had it been seriously made, I absoto lutely refuse to waste the time of the country in taking anv further part in a Acts discussion of this kind. Mr HUGHES rWest Svdney) [12.7] to The Prime Minister, having nothing to say in answer to the charge made against Oppohim by the Leader of the Opposition, and being unable to trust himself to make the answer in which he usually indulges on when charges are made to which he is unable to reply, has sat down. In doing so he is acting in harmony with the its character which he has lately assumed of being furiously desirous of getting on with the business of the country. The most serious accusation which can he levelled against any man in public life is that he obstructs the transaction of the business of the people. I think, perhaps, that I may be permitted on this occasion to review the present position, so far as it affects the conduct of public business in this House. The Leader of the Opposition has reminded the Prime Minister that parties in this Chamber are evenly divided, but that, as a inatter of fact, the aggregate votes recorded for members on this side of the House at the last election was greater than the aggregate vote recorded for honourable members upon the other side. ",25
143,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"H a p p i l y this is a matter which is not susceptible to the closure, which is open to investigation, and which will stand all the investigation that the honourable member or anybody else can give to it . It is a fact that honourable members upon this side of the House did secure more votes than did honourable members upon the other side. ",26
144,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In this House parties are evenly divided. In the other Chamber the position is very well known. There are twenty-nine senators who belong to the Labour party, and seven who belong to the Liberal party. It is a fact that on the appeal to the country at the last election the returns show a clear and overwhelming majority in favour of the Labour party. I am not now speaking of the eighteen men who remained, but of the results of the last election, and I say that in the Senate Labour was returned with au overwhelming majority .  for Labour was 13,000 less than that cast for the Liberal candidates.",26
145,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The figures are, as T have represented, so far as the aggregate vote is concerned. The Liberal senators went to the country, and were decimated. The Government are in office. They have a majority of one. The situation is unique in this Parliament, and almost unique in Australia. The Government are carrying on the business of the count r y. They came into office on the 25th June, and they have been in office ever since. They have had as full control of the business of this House from the moment that it met at the beginning of the session as they have today. We are now told-and the whole show that we have seen played here for the last week or so has been intended to create the impression-that the business of the country is being ruthlessly and relentlessly obstructed by the Opposition. What are the actual facts ? For the state of public business today the Government are entirely responsible. They put their programme in the Governor General's Speech, and set it before the country. I ask honourable members to say what effort they have made to give effect to that programme? The most serious indictment I can level against the Government is that they have been absolutely treacherous to the constituencies of the Commonwealth. They were returned to power upon what I shall show to be false pretences. The greatest inducement which any party can offer to a man in these days is that it will - if returned to power - cos t him less in taxation than he has been paying, and that it will reduce his cost of living. There is no argument known to man since first speech was given to him which is so effective as that which touches his pocket. The Government, headed by the honourable member for Parramatta, swept over the country on this one cry-that the Fisher Government had been guilty of reckless extravagance, and that if returned to power they would in troduce economical and good government, and that they would reduce the taxation of the people. They said that the cost of living, which was towering so high, was due to the Labour regime, and the legislation of the Labour party. Upon that cry they were returned, and in spite of their pretexts, and of the fact that they have at their back the press of this country, by which alone they are enabled to live, and without which they would not be here for twenty-four hours, they have utterly failed to even attempt to fulfil their solemn pledges. I ask them to say what attempt they have made since they came into office to reduce the cost of liviug, or to decrease taxation ? They have done nothing. There has never been a Government which, in such short time, so completely violated its pledges to the people. The position would have some tinge of humour were it not so tragic. An Administration returned to reduce public expenditure has increased it at a greater rate than any that has ever occupied the Treasury bench in this Chamber. So much for that. Now for the charge of obstruction of public business levelled against the Opposition by the Government. There never was a jnore baseless charge. Ministers, from the day on which they met Parliament, have heen able to determine the order in which public business should be taken, what the hours of sitting should be, what business pressed through, and so on. What have they done? They have adjourned the House on every conceivable occasion; they have sat as few hours as possible; they have done nothing to push on public business, They have deliberately wasted the time of this House by futile attempts at legislation, which were never honestly pushed home; and by leaving high and dry on the shoals of time the measure on which they had staked their existence, declaring it to be the first necessary step in the direction of reformI refer to the Electoral Bill-the y have exposed to every man who is not purblind the insincerity of their professions and the hollowness of their actions. introduced in place of what they promised two quack measures, with which they hope to delude the people into thinking that they are honestly carrying out their pledges. The Prime Minister spoke of the weakness of the indictment of the Leader of the Opposition. weakness of the right honourable member's indictment was this: that he spoke the truth , and was courteous, and, perhaps, too mild, in his language. He did not insult the Prime Minister. .not remind him of the depth of the turpi tude to which he has of late so frequently descended. The Prime Minister, confronted with his past, refuses to recognise it . He has ouly one answer to every argument- I am wrong, he has two-hi s answers are, "" That the question be now put , "" or "" The honourable member is in sulting."" Upon those two answers he rests his case. The Prime Minister pretends we have obstructed necessary legislation. us see. When the Labour took office in 1910, it had a programme of which it was not ashamed. measures having been put before the country, had received the of the people, and it came to Parliament to give effect to its The most important of these measures were those providing for land value taxation, defence, the establishment Commonwealth Bank, and the establishment of a note issue. Ministers Mr Hughes. set to work to place those and other similar measures on the statute-book. They did not place a Bill on the table merely to deceive the people. They pushed on with their measures day after day, and had the satisfaction of closing the session of 1910 with the bulk of their programme on the statute-book. That was the record of men who were in earnest and f a it h f u l to their pledges. But on the other side there is not a man who is not perjured, so far as his electoral pledges are concerned. Honourable members opposite told the people what they would do, but they have not kept their promises. They have made no attempt to keep them. But, on the other hand, they have done that which stifled free speech in this Parliament. The honourable member for Werriwa, for example, stood for independence of thought and action. He would have nothing to do with Caucus chains and They have fetters, that prevent expression being given to a man's inmost and best thoughts. He was for liberty of speech and action. He was for lightening the taxation of the people, and for reducing the cost of living. But today he sits behind his Government, manacled and fettered, The only and is not permitted to say that which he would give ten years of his life to be able to say, knowing that, if he said it , he would be blotted out from the political life of this country. What does the He did party opposite, that pretends to stand for freedom of thought and action, do when any of its members dares to say a word against the ukase or mere ipse dixit of its leaders ? What did it do to the honourable member for Flinders, the very apostle of liberty, when he made his famous speech at Korumburra ? It compelled him to eat his words. What did it do when the honourable member for Parkes stated that he was willing to follow Mr Reid if he knew which way Mr Reid was going? The press supporting the party at once Let said, "" This is not the time for indepenGovernment dence,"" and he was made to eat his words. What is being done now in New Its South Wales, where Sir Willia m MCM i l lan has declared that the Liberal leagues endorsement have been packed, and that there is no chance for independent thought and mandate. action? He is vehemently demanding freedom of speech and action, and is not tolerated by the Liberal party. of the Those of us who know the honourable member for Werriwa are aware that it resolutely is not his nature to sit quiet, and that he now does so because he dare not speak. Por he cannot approve, yetdare not disapprove, the actions of this Government. What a position for a free man! I would not do what he is doing even to stay in political life. The At - two days this week. torney-General poses as a man of bold,independent thought. He came into the House a little while ago and said, "" Here is the Electoral Bill ; help us to make it a better measure; we shall welcome improvements."" We know what happened the other night, and how the honourable member's promises were carried into effect. W it h other men what has happened might be excusable; with him it is inexcusable. We are charged with obstruction. The Government have made no honest attempt to carry on the business of the country. It has wasted its own time and the time of the House. has not done what the Labour Government did in 1910. That Government sat until its business was finished. That is the proper way of transacting business. When we met Parliament in 1910 we had a big programme of work before us, but we sat in the morning and transacted our business in a business-like way, remaining until it was finished. When I hear from the present Prime Minister the charge of obstruction, I say that it is as out of place on his lips as the devil would be in a Methodist chapel. There was never a more deliberate waster of time, never a more persistent obstructor than he. If this Government had desired to press on with its programme it would met in the morning at half-past 10, and, if necessary have sat late, as the Labour twoI Government did, but it has never made any effort to press on with its business. What happened yesterday is an instance the of its readiness to waste time. did the Prime Minister adjourn the tinued. . . . House when the right honourable member for Wide Bay gave notice of hia motion of in operation. no-confidence? The Prime Minister says that it was customary to do so. Good God 1 Is precedent to be thrown in our faces by such a man at such a time ? Are be given to it . the rules that govern debate amongst decent men in deliberative assembles, and bility which he has trampled under foot, to be made an excuse for the honourable member's action in wasting another day? A f t e r his action during the past week he should have some better excuse. he not been anxious to do what his friends wanted-to go to the races-h e would have proceeded with the business of the country. He adjourned the House over Cup Day. That is to say, he has wasted Y e the says we waste time! This is the state of public business at the present time: The Government have deliberately refrained from pushing on with the legitimate business of the country, aud at the tail-end of the session not one of the pledges that it gave to the people has been fulfilled. But it wishes to create in the minds of the public the impression that it is desperately anxious to keep its promises, and now poses as a strong, resolute Administration determined, in the face of the most relentless opposition, to force its measures throughParliament. What an insult to the intelligence of the It people. If those measures were of national importance, affecting the lives and in terests of the people, and necessary to prevent some great disaster, the situation would be entirely different. If the Opposition were holding up proposals for lightening the burden of the people and reducing taxation; if we were trying to strike a deadly blow at the Tariff, the position would be different. But the bulk of the people are not the least concerned about the two measures that have been paraded before the country, and are being used by the Government as a stalking-horse.",26

First of all , I claim that if today's incident was anything, it was an interruption of business under the Standing Orders. The Prime Minister admits it , and so do all honourable members, and Mr . Speaker held that he was imperatively pleasure bound to strictly read the wording of the standing order under which he acted. object, Mr Therefore, this was an interruption of business under the Standing Orders. says, in the paragraph to which I have referredOn every day of the week, except Saturday and Sunday, the working hours of the House are subject to the following regulations :-Busines s is interrupted on Munriny, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at eleven o'clock, when, if the House be not engaged on exempted business (see p. 2«6), the Speaker rises from the chair and interrupts the business then under consideration; or if the House be in Committee, the Chairman leaves the chair to make his report to the House. On Friday the moment of interruption is five o'clock. Then comes the following sentence: The business under consideration at the moment of interruption stands over until the next sitting, or such other sitting as the member in sharge thereof may appoint. I hold that this leaves me, as the mover and the member in charge of the motion, to fix when the discussion of it shall be resumed by the House. That is definite and distinct. Mr W. H. IRVINE - What is standing order?",33
251,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Our Standing Orders lay it down that where they are silent on any particular point the procedure of the House of Commons, as laid down by May, shall be followed.",34

253,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does the Attorney-General say that because we have no distinct standing order the right of the person in charge of the motion is abrogated ?

256,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No . There would be right to complain on Tuesday.

I would probably have lost my right altois my point as to the gether. W it h all due respect to torney-General, I would fai l in my if I did not strive to protect the rights of minorities, when the law is, as i to be, according to the procedure laid down in May. I call the attention honourable members to the fact that today's procedure is not only new, but any motion ? has no parallel in any Parliament. I do not question Mr Speaker's reading of direct standing order under which he has given his decision, but it is incumbent upon the Opposition, when the Government are not inclined to protect minorities, to see that every opportunity is availed of within our Standing Orders to protect the rights of not only the present Opposition, but of any Opposition that may follow. It is a mere statement of fact that Oppositions have a habit of becoming Governments, and Governments have, regrettably to them, the habit of becoming Oppositions all too soon. the The principal purpose of standing orders, rules, practices, and usages of free Parliaments is not to protect majorities, but to protect minorities. I think it was Mr Speaker Braud who, when charged by some honourable members of great in fluence in the House of Commons with not having leaned in his decisions towards the Opposition, said, ' ' I feel it to be my duty to give the benefit of the doubt to Oppositions or to minorities, for the reason that the majority can protect itself."" The basic principle of that decision has immortalized that Speaker. But if things go on here as are indicated, there is a tendency that only one party shall be heard in the House, and that is not the minority, and not the Opposition. The decision on this matter will affect not right, only the present, but the future, and I hope it will not be treated as a party inatter.",34

260,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It applies to motions in the terrupted by Standing Orders. It is notcontended that my motion was not interrupted by the standing order. The closure was not moved; no other action was taken; the Speaker simply held that there was an automatic close of the debate after the lapse of two hours.,34
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is not the position that you talked out the motion?,35
262,Mr FISHEE,Unknown,"The position was that, notwithstanding my many experiences, I relied upon the honour of the Prime Minister to carry out his promise.",35
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There was promise.,35
264,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member made a distinct and definite promise that of my motion would be taken as a want of confidence motion. I ask Mr Speaker, on the point I have raised.",35
265,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But the standing order says it must be done before the exstatement. piry of the two hours.,35
266,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the standing order says that, I presume Mr Speaker will be the able to say so; but, in my opinion, the standing standing order is silent on the point. I think I may reasonably assume that I days, have every right to fix a date for the redays, sumption of the debate, and, therefore, consideration move That the resumption of the debate be made an Order of the Day for Tuesday next.",35
267,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"On a point of order, I am not sure whether the question is now put by the Leader of the Opposition as a point of order, or a substantive niotion, but in either case there is a point of order raised by it.",35
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. Let us have this matter clear. The Leader of the Opposition rose to a point of order, but concluded by moving a motion.",35
269,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The practice of the House is that no motion can be debated unless it is stated from the Chair. I have not yet stated any question to the House. Mr W. H . IBVINE - I propose to take a point of order as to whether the motion can be put. The honourable member for Wide Bay is perfectly familiar with the practice universally adopted, and always adhered to, that before the time expires for dealing with matters of this sort the honourable member in charge of it has the riglit to move that the ness be made an Order of the Day for some other date. That was not done, and I submit that it cannot be done now. There is in the Standing Orders a clear, sure, and explicit answer to the question of order raised by the honourable member. The honourable member has read a passage from May to the effect that on every day of the week, except Saturday and Sunday, the working hours of the House are subject to the following regulations: Business is interrupted on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 11 o'clock, when if the House be not engaged on exempted business the Speaker rises from the chair. Then this is the no passage on which the honourable member reliesThe business under consideration at the moment interruption stands over until the next sitting, or such other sitting as the member in charge your ruling, thereof may appoint. May is merely a text-book, and we must naturally look for the authority for that That is to be found in the margin which apparently the honourable member overlooked. The reference there is to standing order 1, appendix 1. In same volume of May we find that order 1, rule 3, is as follows: At IT o'clock on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesand Thursdays, and at 5 o'clock on Frithe proceedings on any business then under shall be interrupted, and if the House be in Committee the Chairman shall leave the chair and make his report to the House, and if a motion has been proposed for the adjournment of the House, or of the debate, or in Committee, that the Chairman do report progress, or do leave the chair, every such dilatory motion shall lapse without question put. Rule 6, the particular authority for the passage upon which my honourable friend relies, is as follows: All business appointed for any sitting and not disposed of before the termination of the sitting shall stand over until the next sitting, or until such other sitting on any day on which the House ordinarilv sits, as the member in charge of the bu-iness may appoint.",35
270,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The practice of the Senate here is exactly as I have stated.,35
271,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I do not think we are concerned with the practice of the Senate, because we have our own Standing Orders. The passage in May on which the honourable member relies is merely a transcript of Standing Orders in force in the Imperial House of Commons. We have not those Standing Orders in our own Standing Orders busi- at all; but we have one specific standing order which prescribes that, "" If all business shall not be disposed of two liours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon shall he interrupted, and, unless the House otherwise orders, the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation, but if there is no Order of the Day, the discussion of motions may be continued."" It happens that there are several Orders of the Day at present before the House.",35
272,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That standing order is silent on the very point I have raised. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - It is not silent. It is explicit that, as soon as the Orders of the Day have been disposed of, the consideration of motions may be resumed. That is the simple and clear answer to the honourable member's speech, so far as it related to a point of order. So far as it related to a motion, I submit that the time for moving that motion has passed.",36
273,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is contended that the point of order taken by the Leader of the Opposition is invalid, in that it was not taken within the period set forth in standing order 119. That standing order obviously relates to motions which are treated in the usual way; but it was impossible for the Leader of the Opposition to have interrupted the proceedings in this case within the two-hour period, because he had the assurance, so he says, of the Prime Minister, that it was in tended to carry the debate on until next week. I u those circumstances, the honourable member is robbed of a real right by a technicality which is only operative by reason of the fact that an understanding between the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition was not observed.",36
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I rise to order. The statement that I arrived at an underfidence. standing this morning with the Leader the Opposition has been continually rei peated .,36
275,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! This is not a point of order. It is distinctly against the Standing Orders for an honourable debate. tnember to interrupt another honourable member who is speaking to contradict something he has said.,36
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I assure you, that that is uot the point. Honourable members interjecting,",36
277,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"This is another illusin tration of the confusion that is likely arise owing to a number of honourable members shouting across the Chamber making it absolutely impossible for Speaker to know what is going on. I have also complaints from the Hansard staff that they are unable properly to motion. carry out their work because they cannot hear what is going on, and cannot bo responsible for the accuracy of reportsmade under such disturbing conditions.",36
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My point of order is that, after repeated denials on my part of a statement attributed to me, the honourable member has no right to reiterate it.",36
279,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is customary for an honourable member to accept another honourable member's denial, and not refer to the matter again.",36
280,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I simply said that the Leader of the Opposition had stated that, there was an understanding. I am not responsible for the statement. I accept it, and the Prime Minister may contradict it afterwards.",36
281,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is not a point of order.,36
282,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I only hope that, whatever treatment is meted out to me, will be meted out to the honourable member.",36
283,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may be assured that it will.,36
284,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is not denied that the Leader of the Opposition's point of order would have been sustained had it been taken within the time. The whole question, then, is that, had he or some other person, before the expiry of the two hours, moved that the resumption of the debate be fixed for such-and-such a day, there would have been an end of it . You musb take cognisance of the circumstances, which are these: The Leader of the Opposition on Thursday gave notice of his in tention to move a motion of want of conThe Prime Minister then moved of the adjournment of the House, accepting t as a want of confidence motion. Again today he put the question to the right honourable member, as he did on Thursday, as to what were to be the limits of the The honourable member cannot deny that. Clearly, the last thing he contemplated was a proposal to apply standing order 119. The honourable gentlesir, man has been in this House, as I have, since its inception, and he knows that standing order 119 has never been used this connection before. Therefore, the to right honourable member for Wide Bay could not have anticipated that the and standing order would be brought into the force, and it was not enforced until the expiry of the time allowed under the standing order for the discussion of the I submit that if justice is to be done, having regard to all the circumstances and to the practice which here has the force of law Mr W . H . IRVINE - What does the honourable gentleman call the practice?",36
285,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I hope the honourable gentleman, will permit me to proceed. 1 cannot move that little motion of his. I say that the practice has the force of law. Prom time immemorial the right of the Leader of an Opposition to move a motion of want of confidence has been recognised and honored. In this case it has been recognised by the Government, since the Prime Minister upon notice of the motion given moved the adjournment of the House and adjourned the consideration of public business, which, it is admitted, it is urgently necessary should be gone on with. This being so, and the motion having been recognised in the way in which all such motions are recognised, how can the Attorney-General contend that the practice of the House has been abrogated because the right honourable member for Wide Bay did not submit a motion for the resumption of the debate on his motion in time? He could not have done so. Standing order 119 has never previously been enforced in connection with such motions, and he was told that this motion was to be treated as a vote of censure. As a matter of fact the standing order was not enforced against it until the expiry of the time. I call your attention, sir, to our own standing order 257A, under which it is provided that no member shall speak in a debate on a motion of "" n o confidence "" for more than one hour and thirty-five minutes. I wish to look at the inatter fairly, and ask whether that standing order can have any relation to a motion, the debate upon which must be begun and concluded within the space of two hours? Mr W . H . IRVINE - But it need be begun and concluded within that space.",37
286,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Her e we have a House of seventy-five members, every one of whom has a right to be heard, and if they occupied only five minutes they would more than exhaust treble the time allowed understanding order 119. If standing order 257A has any relation to the facts as we know them, it must exclude from the operation of standing order 119 a motion of censure. right honourable member for Wide Bay had, therefore, the best of reasons for believing that his motion was not one which would be affected by standing order 119. Since he could not have known that it was intended to apply standing order 119 to the motion and set aside standing order 257A, I ask you to give him the right that belongs to him as a representative of the people- a right which he could have exercised had he known it was intended to resort to such practices as have been resorted to in this caseand permit him to fix a time for the resumption of the debate on his motion of censure. If that is not done the position of the Ministry will be unique. A motion of censure suspends all legislative and administrative operations.",37
287,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order . The honourable gentleman will not be in order in proceeding on those lines.,37
288,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"There is no doubt about it . I ask you, sir, to look at this point: If the debate on this motion is postponed it must come on at some time. If not the position will be most extraordinary. The motion being postponed, it must eventually be decided, and u n t il it is decided the Government will be unable to carry on the administrative and legislative business of the country.",37
289,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,37
290,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I ask you, sir, in all the circumstances, to decide in favour of the point raised by the right honourable member for Wide Bay.",37
291,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I am prepared to give my decision now.,37
292,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I hope, sir, you will not refuse to permit me to speak.",37
293,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! If every member of the House claimed the right to debate every point of order that was raised by another honourable member, there not would be no end to the proceedings. There is no such right given understanding order No. 286, which requires the Speaker to give his decision after the member rising to order has stated his point. The Speaker does sometimes out of courtesy, or if there is a doubt in his mind, allow a limited debate, but in such cases it is usual for the Speaker to intimate when he is prepared to decide a point of order raised.",37
294,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Y o u allowed others to The speak on the point, and I think you should allow me.",37
295,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I have been prepared to give my decision from the moment the point of order was raised.,38
296,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Has it been prepared beforehand ?,38
297,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Once more I call attention to the fact that the Speaker is on his feet and has three times called for order. I hope that order wil l be preserved. The honourable member for Wide Bay has raised a point of order, and the House is entitled to hear the point of order decided in silence. I am prepared to decide it . W it h regard to the point raised, first as to the honourable member's right to move a motion fixing the time when the debate on his motion may be resumed, the honourable member is relying upon a reference to the practice of the House of Commons given at page 214 of the 11th edition of May, dealing with the interruption of business under the standing order. Our own standing order No. 1 readsIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by sessional or other orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament. In this case specific standing orders have been adopted by this House. This, therefore, is not a case in which we need have recourse to the rules, forms, and practice of the House of Commons relied upon by the honourable member in the reference quoted from page 214 of May, b ut which I had looked up during the luncheon hour, and before the honourable member referred to it . Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",38
298,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I hope that honourable members do not take exception to the Speaker trying to inform himself upon points of procedure. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",38
299,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is, I take it , a viously dealt with. part of the Speaker's duty to inform himtraverse self, as far as possible, of the proper practice and procedure. In pursuance my duty, I have done so. I hope that honourable members will not make that duty more difficult than it ordinarily Every one will admit that I have to carry out my duties under most extraordinarily trying conditions. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. "" Mr SPEAKER - I wish to point out that the reference which the right hontinue orable member for Wide Bay quoted from page 214 of the 11th edition of May, not with our Standing Orders or practice, but with Standing Orders and practice of the House of Commons.",38
300,Mr FISHER,Unknown,1 said so.,38
301,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is so; the honourable member did say so. I point out that they do not apply in this case. This is a case in which provision is made under our Standing Orders to govern our procedure in connection with motions. I call attention once more to the fact that the nature of a motion has nothing to do with the application of the Standing Orders. W it h regard to the point raised by the honourable member for West Sydney, directing my attention to the limitation put upon debate on a motion of censure, I remind the honourable member that standing order No. 119 existed before any limitation at all was put upon debate, and when a motion might have been debated for practically as long as the honourable member on his feet was physically able to continue debate. Standing order No. 119 saysI f all motions shall not have been disposed of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon shall be interrupted, unless the House otherwise orders.",38
302,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That is the point, and you will not allow the honourable member for Wide Bay to ask for an order.",38
303,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The standing order continues-^and unless the House otherwise orders, the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation.",38
304,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Finish , finish.",38
305,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The rest of the standing order is immaterial to the immediate point at issue.,38
306,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Is it i,38
307,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was, perhaps, not in the Chamber when the matter was preI do not wish to a ruling already given, but only to deal with the new point of order raised of by the honourable member for Wide Bay. I have looked into our own proceedings in the past, and the practice has always is. been that whenever motions were liable to interruption by the expiration of two hours from the time of the meeting of the House, the honourable member then speaking, a few minutes prior to the expiration of the time, has asked leave to conhis speech, and that the debate on the motion be resumed or made an Order dealt, of the Day for a future sitting.",38
308,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Not a no-confidence motion.,39
309,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have already pointed out that the question whether the motion is or is not a motion of no-confidence does not affect the point, because the standing order distinctly applies to all motions, and makes no exception in favour of any motion, even if moved by a Minister. May I remind honourable members that no later than the closing days of last session a motion was on the business-paper in the name of a Minister of the Crown, relating to the electoral divisions of Queensland. The motion was moved, and I see by the report that, it being two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House in accordance with standing order 119, Orders of the Day were called on, and debate was interrupted on that motion. I mention that one case as being typical of many others, some of which I have marked in *the volume of our records of Votes and Proceedings before me. It is within the knowledge of honourable members that in the case of private members' motions debated on Thursday afternoons, the debate automatically ceases at the expiration of two hours, and it is the usual practice, if honourable members desire the debate upon a motion to be continued, to ask that it be made an Order of the Day for another day before the expiration of the two hours. If that is not done - before the expiration of the two hours, it is too late to do it afterwards.",39
310,Mr FISHEK,Unknown,Do you distinctly rule that all action must be taken within the two hours?,39
311,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I was just about to say that it seems to me to be imperative under the standing order that, if any action is to be taken to secure the continuance of debate upon a motion, it must be taken within the two hours specified under the standing order. That is my ruling. Mr Speaker MCDonald dealt with this very point in October of 1911, in connection with standing order 119. It will be found on pages 1947-8.",39
312,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I wish to deal with something entirely new. We have created a certain situation as the result of an unprecedented use of the Standing Orders. At the present moment I take no exception to your ruling, sir, or to the ruling just given to the effect that, the two hours having elapsed, the honourable member in charge of a motion cannot now say when that motion shall come on again. I desire to draw your attention to standing order 119, which provides that, after the expiration of two hours, the debate upon a motion, not having been completed, shall be interrupted, and then the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation. That is as clear as it is possible for language to be; but I ask you to note the intervening words "" and unless the House otherwise orders."" First of all, the standing order interrupts the debate upon a motion, and that, in this case, has occurred. After the interruption, if nothing intervenes, the Orders of the Day are to be taken in rotation. But there is a possibility of something intervening after the interruption, and before the taking of the Orders of the Day in rotation, because the standing order specifically provides that the Orders of the Day shall not be taken in rotation if the House otherwise orders. It is therefore competent for the House to otherwise order.",39
313,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Before the operation of the standing order.,39
314,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am' afraid that the Attorney-General's desire and prejudice are leading his thoughts. The standing order is as clear as it can possibly be. In the first place, at the expiration of two hours, if the debate upon a motion has not concluded, it is interrupted; and, secondly, the Orders of the Day must then be taken in rotation, unless something intervenes. I repeat that the standing order specifically provides for something else intervening, namely, for the House otherwise ordering. It is therefore possible for the House to intervene at the present juncture, because the debate upon the motion of censure submitted by the Leader of the Opposition has been interrupted. Subsequently, the Orders of the Day must be taken in rotation. I submit that it is competent for the House at this stage to otherwise order, so far as taking the Orders of the Day in rotation is concerned.",39
315,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! That is absolutely the point of order which I have just decided. Before giving my decision I read the words which the honourable member has stressed several times, and I pointed out that the House must otherwise order before the expiration of two hours.",39
316,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The standing order does not say so. Mr SPEAKER, - I hold that it does. And previous Speakers have determined the matter in the same way. also been the practice, and on every occaannounced. sion when it has been desired to continue a debate, before the expiration of two liours, a motion for adjourning the detoo late. bate has been moved, and the House has ordered what was to be done in regard to it.",40
317,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I hope, sir, that you will allow me to complete my remarks. There is not in my mind any desire pute your ruling .",40
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is doing that.,40
319,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"In respect of the motion submitted by the honourable member for Wide Bay, I admit that it was necessary ing my ruling now. for him to take action within two hours, otherwise he lost his opportunity of doing so. But the words, "" and House otherwise order,"" I submit are connected with the subsequent words, "" the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotaorder. tion.""",40
320,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am sorry to interanother rup t the honourable member, but the words "" unless the House otherwise order,"" clearly relate to the preceding words to all motions which have not been posed of two liours after the meeting of House.

I have no righ t to make a concession . to any honourable member, except by leave of the House, and it is only by leave of the House that I can do it . I said as a matter of courtesy, I would overlook the fact that several points of order had been raised, and allow the honourable member to give notice of his motion, because it affected myself, but if an objection is taken to his doing so, I cannot allow him to proceed, because the standing order says that objection to the - Speaker's ruling must be taken at once, and notice of dissent given. is an objection to the honourable member .giving notice of his motion at this stage, I cannot accept it .",42
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I object, and rise to a point of order.",42
359,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I rise to a point of - order. W it h the greatest respect, may I ask you, sir, whether I did not ask that I should have the right to do what you speak of, and whether you did not reply, "" Yes,"" no exception being taken by honourable members at the time to what was proposed ? You had just decided what I considered to be a point dealing with the same standing order. I shall be sorry if the matter cannot be adjusted, but I do not wish to press things any further. You having said "" Y I thought that I had the righ t to move my motion, but if that is not so, I have nothing more to say.",42
360,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I accept all the blame for what has occurred. What has happened is my fault, because I have allowed honourable members too much latitude and to proceed in an irregular way. I express my regret for what has occurred, but objection having been taken' to the giving of notice of a motion of dissent after debate has ensued, which the honourable member desires to move, I cannot do what, personally, I was willin g to do in the matter.",42
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I desire you, Mr Speaker, to settle a point which is of. the utmost consequence to the conduct of public business in this House. At half-past twelve o'clock today, a decision was given by you, and now, at nearly half-past three o'clock, points of order are still being debated arising out of that very decision.",42
362,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,There was a breach of f a it h on your part.,42
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I submit that it is not in order, and not in accordance with the practice of the House, for points of order to be raised in connection with a decision which has been given. It is a that, well-known parliamentary practice",42
364,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. »,42
365,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I can hear only one point of order at a time.,42
366,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I rise to a point of order.,42
367,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I can hear only one point of order at a time. The honourable member will resume his seat. If there Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am intervening only in the interests of the business of the country.,42
368,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is not a point of order.,42
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My point of order is that no point of order can be taken on the decision of Mr Speaker. There is only one way of dealing with a decision to which objection is taken, and that is by giving notice of dissent from it .",42
370,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"W it h regard to the point of order which has been raised, I understood, when honourable members rose, that they were not proposing to deal with my decision.",42
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have not finished stating my point of order. I wish to e s , "" say, in the interests of the country, and only in those interests, that if this course of conduct is to continue, the Government cannot do business.",42
372,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,What is the point of orderl,42
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The point of order is that no point of order on a decision should be accepted, otherwise nothing is gained by any decision, and the business of the country is unduly delayed.",42
374,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am going to carry out the Standing Orders and decide the point straight away without delay. It is, I take it , that I have no right to allow points of order to he raised after I have given a decision?",42
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Point s of order on that decision.,43
376,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is perfectly r i g h t; but, as I have previously stated, when the points of order were raised, those who raised them distinctly said that it was not tlieir intention to traverse any ruling that I had given, but to raise new points. The Prime Minister himself has taken part in the raising of points of order, and therefore he is doing what he is now complaining of others doing.",43
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a personal explanation, I wish to say that I have not attempted to take, any point of order on any decision of yours, Mr Speaker, either today or at any other time.",43
378,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I rise to a point order.,43
379,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, whether you will be good enough to say whether the motion which I moved at the beginning of the sitting, affirming that this House has no confidence in the present Government, will , under your ruling, become an Order of the Day, and, if so, when it will come on for discussion again? Can you assist the House in this inatter ?",43
380,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"A motion cannot become an Order of the Day except on the order of the House, which must be made within the time specified in the standing order, but the discussion of the motion can be resumed after the Orders of the Day have been dealt with. motion will take its place after the Orders of the Day and other business. It goes to the bottom of the paper, as decided by practice already established.",43
381,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [3.24] - I desire, witli your permission, Mr Speaker, to ask the Prime Minister whether he will be good enough to say whether, with a want of confidence motion hanging over him",43
382,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot, without consent of the House, permit a question to be put to the Prime Minister now. The Orders of the Day must be called on.",43
383,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I desire the leave of the House to ask a question.,43
384,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the desire of the House that the honourable member for Wide Bay shall be permitted to ask a question of the Prime Minister ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",43
385,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Leave granted.,43
386,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It will facilitate business, I think, if I address a question to the Prime Minister, through you, Mr . Speaker, to ascertain whether the Government propose to continue to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth or to take other business until the want of confidence motion now before the House and partially debated has been dealt with . The procedure is most unusual, and I shall be very glad to know whether the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, and those behind him, proposes to deal with that motion straightforwardly today, or when, and what attitude he is going to assume with such a motion hanging over the heads of the Government ?",43
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Hav e I permission of to answer that question, Mr Speaker?",43
388,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the pleasure of I ask the House that leave be given to the Prime Minister to reply. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",43
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [3.26] - My answer is that in view of the fact that we have already had two motions of censure, that the Opposition have tried on three distinct occasions to take the business out of the hands of the Government, and have succeeded twice-that in view of the exceptional circumstances, and having regard to the late stage of the session we have reached, I decline absolutely to afford any further Government time for The the discussion of motions of censure.",43
390,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Would I be in order, Mr Speaker, in moving that all the Orders of the Day",43

400,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Yes .,44
401,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"This is a matter to be decided not by the Speaker, but by the House. The question is that Order of the Day No. 1 be postponed until after the consideration of the no confidence motion.",44
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to order. I submit, sir, that it is not open to an honourable member of the Opposition at this stage to move any such motion.",44
403,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is the honourable member questioning Mr Speaker's ruling?,44
404,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! This is a point of order.,44
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If it is open to an honourable member to do so, where is the value of the Government placing its business on the notice-paper? I urge, moreover, that the Minister in charge of the Order of the Day has priority in any case. The Leader of the Opposition, therefore, has no right to intervene, and has no right to be permitted to intervene, to prevent priority being given to the Minister in charge of this measure. I submit that the Minister is entitled to proceed with this motion which has been made an order of the day, especially as he has been called on. The Attorney-General, technically speaking, is on his feet at this moment in charge of this motion. . Mr JENSEN - Le t Mr Speaker decide.",44
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am reminding Mr Speaker of a fact which he has forthat gotten, that he has already called on Minister in charge of this Bill. [107]",44
407,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is so.,44
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Mr Speaker has already called on the Attorney-General to proceed with the motion for the second reading of the Bill. It is, therefore, not open to any honourable member to intervene with a motion of this kind until the Minister in charge of the Bill has resumed his seat.",44
409,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Mr Speaker,44
410,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister's point of order is sustained,44
411,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Oh !,44
412,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I ask honourable members how it is possible for the Speaker, or the Fresidiug Oflicer of any Assembly, to keep his mind in such a clear condition as to follow the proper order of business whilst a volley of interruptions is going on without intermission. Ever since I took the chair this morning I have been subjected to an almost continuous series of interruptions. May statesWhen an Order of the Day has been read, it must thereupon be proceeded with, appointed for a future day, or discharged. The Speaker, therefore, calls upon the member in charge thereof, no other member being allowed to interpose unless with li is consent. . . . I had momentarily overlooked the fact that I had called upon the Attorney General, who was in possession of the floor, when the honourable member for Wide Bay rose. The mistake is mine. I admit it, but plead extenuating circumstances. The Attorney-General had the first call, but the honourable member for Wide Bay intervened, and, through inadvertence, I called upon him instead of on the Attorney-General. Mr W. ' H .

424,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Now that the House has resumed its normal condition of placid equanimity, I shall proceed with my little non-contentious measure. I feel sure that a few words from me on the the subject of preference to unionists act as a soothing syrup to honorablo bers opposite.",45

453,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The decision just given is with regard to the time at which a certain proposal shall be discussed, and has nothing to do with the motion of censure, that includes charges of maladministration, as well as condemnation of the political proposals brought before Parliament. The Government have failed in their administration. They have tentionally and wilfully misrepresented the country in their administration of postal aud other matters, and this has been brought home to the people of Australia clearly and distinctly by the many illustrations that I have given in the House. They came in ostensibly cleclaring that they would have pure rolls; but the only evidence of their intention in that direction is to strike off the names of people who are entitled to be on the roll, showing clearly that their administration is even worse than their proposed legislation. If the Ministry can go on with a motion of this kind hanging over them, the people of Australia are being represented by a Government with less conscientious scruples than any that has yet held office in any of the States of Australia.",47

I have been prevented from speaking for over a week; but this House is no longer a deliberative assembly, and, judging by the actions of the Government, it will never become one until we have an opportunity of appealing to the people.",48
480,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [4.0] I am sorry that, under your ruling, one is not able to refer to some of the things that took place today. I shall content myself by a reference to Rasselas, the Prince of Abyssinia- a work written by that greatest of Englishmen, Dr Johnson. Abyssinia is a country which, in many respects, resembles this. It has had its ups and downs, and its waves of democratic government and autocracy. men who fought and achieved liberty and progress, and it has had its petty and contemptible tyrants who have trampled the liberties of the people underfoot. Time does not permit me to quote more than one of the incidents in the history of that nation. A f t e r the rise of Prince Abouti , in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, a wave of Democracy spread over the country, accompanied by happiness, peace, and prosperity. But there arose a man who appealed to the people under the most specious pretexts, and brought about the country's downfall and the destruction of the people's liberties. The foundations of representative government were established in Abyssinia, and from that place we derive all those excellent institutions which distinguish our present era; but this alleged reformer, under a pretext of establishing freedom, denied even the I simply right of free speech. On one memorable occasion, even a meek and orderly protest made against his intolerable tyranny was stifled under a blanket of technicalities, which were gathered up by his subservient tools. Although the story of the manner point in which free speech had been stifled was a long time in finding its way outside the walls of the Parliament of Abyssinia, eventually it did find its way to the people, and the people were amazed and indignant. They then rose up and put an end to that Government and its subservient instruments. That is a brief episode from the history of an interesting period of Abyssinia, which I hope may have some bearing upon the present situation. I hope that when we meet again, wiser counsels will have prevailed, and that, at any rate, those who now masquerade as the friends of freedom and liberty will at least have the decency to show themselves as they are. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear.",48
481,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"As for the Attorney General, nothing that I could say would paint the honourable gentleman as he is. There are plenty of men whom I can excuse, but the honourable gentleman is past excuse. I do hope that when we meet on Tuesday, we shall remember that this is a deliberative assembly, that free speech will once more be permitted, and that we shall not be mere pawns on the chess-board, moved about at the will of an intolerable tyrant.",48
482,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [4.7] - I It has had wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a matter of very great importance. I refer to the continuance of the quarantine embargo upon Sydney. Last week the honourable gentleman stated that a Commission was to be appointed to consider the matter. I have my own views as to the object of the Commission, and I believe it is not creditable to those who have moved in the matter. Since the Commission was suggested, I understand that the State Government of New South Wales has decided not to be represented upon it, and' as it cannot, in the circumstances, represent the whole of the State, I ask the Prime Minister not to appoint the Commission. I ask the honourable gentleman, on the contrary, to follow the precedent set in America. In 1900, the State of California was declared under quarantine owing to an outbreak of bubonic plague. The health authorities of California represented that there was nothing in the conditions then existing to warrant the quarantine of the State, and the President of the United States removed the quarantine within forty-eight hours. That is a precedent which I ask the Prime Minister to follow in this case. He must know, as well as any one else, that the epidemic at present existing in Sydney does not warrant the flying of the yellow flag over that city. I believe there is not a medical man in the whole of New South Wales who would advise the continuance of the embargo. Many persons occupying high and honourable positions in the State, and who have the interests of New South Wales at heart, are agreed that there is no warrant for the quarantining of Sydney. The embargo has been continued now for a sufficient length of time to justify the Government in removing it. I hope that otlier honourable members, who. like myself, have the honour to represent a portion of Sydney, will take action in this matter. Owing to ill-health, I recently spent a week in Sydney, 3nd devoted my time to interviewing commercial, professional and industrial residents of that city. I found that they were all agreed that the quarantine should not be continued. The commercial houses there are having their Christmas trade absolutely blocked. Shop-keepers in certain towns outside Sydney are displaying cards in their windows notifying the public that their goods have come from Melbourne, and not from Sydney. When we find people taking such an advantage of the unfortunate condition of Sydney under the quarantine proclamation, I make an appeal to the Prime Minister, as a Christian, if he has any Christian spirit, and if there is a soft spot at all about him, to put an end to such a condition of Mr West. things. From a sanitary point of view,. Sydney is one of the most advanced cities in the civilized world, and the yellow flag should not continue to fly over it . The cases of disease which are occurring there are not small-pox, but a form of German pox well known to the medical profession. I need not say that I have no great opinion of the members of the present Ministry. I consider them incompetent, but if there is one member of the Government who, more than another, deserves to be spoken of in that, way, it is the Minister of Trade and Customs. I do not think any other Minister would have been so callous or would have so disregarded the advice tendered him in connection with this matter. At the instigation of one official and a doctor in Melbourne, the honourable gentleman has done something which I feel sure he is now sorry for. We know the old saying, that ""the King can do no wrong."" Ministers who represent Sydney and suburban constituencies have certainly remained extremely quiet in regard to this embargo. They have not discharged theirduty, because the quarantining of an area within a radius of 15 miles of the General Post Office in that city not only affectsthe people who reside within that area, but casts a stigma upon the whole of Australia. Their action tends to create an impression that a portion of this continent is so dirty-that it is so far removed from the ideal of cleanliness which is next to godliness-that it is necessary to have the yellow flag flying over it. If you, sir, had not had such a difficult task to discharge today, I should have used stronger language in condemnation of theaction of the Government, and probably would have provided you with an opportunity of calling me to order. I trust that I have made some impression on the Prime Minister. I have known him for a long time, and I never thought, when I met him in the coal mines, and when helooked as thin as a slate, that I would have to appeal to him in this way. I trust that even at the eleventh hour he will acknowledge that there is no necessity to continue the embargo which has been placed upon residents within an area of 15 miles of the Sydney General Post Office.",48

495,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I shall reserve my remarks on the Prime Minister until hia return. I was about to refer to the habit which Ministers have developed of going round Victoria and making speeches to the Women's National League. I would direct the attention of our friends, who come from all parts of the State at this festive season, to the fact that the Government cannot carry on business. They prate about their desire to pass legislation, but their protestations are mostly sham. They are mere theatricalism, because there are plenty of measures which could be brought forward and discussed. But Ministers do not bring forward any measures to be discussed. They ought to bring forward some Bills which are practically of a non-party character, and which could be discussed in a cool way. But, instead, they bring forward measures which are calculated to excite the anger of honourable members on this side of the House. I have come to the conclusion that honourable members upon both sides of the Chamber ought to turn their attention to the necessity which exists for the creation of new States. That is an important matter. I ask them to realise that Australia is nearly as large as the United States, that it is larger than Europe, and that it has a population of less than 5,000,000, most of it congregated in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and the other capitals of the States.",50

We say that we should have a new State, taking in the central portion of Queensland, and the people of North Queensland are anxious that there should be created another new State thero. Instead of wasting its time in wrangling over questions such as those which have been prominently brought before us by the Government, we ought to deal with great national questions like the creation of new States.

The Senate might have got through the Postal Voting Restoration Bill during the fortnight for which it has been adjourned, and it could then have proceeded with other business.

That is one of the great disadvantages under which the people of n central and northern Queensland labour, and which is preventing the progress of lands of the this great country. What is the use of encouraging immigration if we do notprovide immigrants with land when they come here; and what is the good of giving them land unless we provide them with local government? If the Rockhampton Post-office requires a broom at the present time, it has to send to Brisbane for an order to obtain it ; but I am pleased to say that the Postmaster-General has decided, so I understand, to create three divisions of the Postal Department in Queensland, showing that he appreciates the vast extent of that great State.",52

I shall deal now with another question, which, - perhaps, concerns the greatest number of people in the community. I refer to the high cost of living. The Postmaster-General will not mind if I say that I think his efforts to reduce the cost of living have, so far, not shown any appreciable result. He has, I believe, introduced a reform in the postage stamp, hoping thereby to reduce the cost of flour, butter and bread; but the price of butter is fixed by the price in the London market. I have come to the conclusion that if we desire to reduce the cost of living, we ought to do so by means of the States and the municipalities, because I do not see that we can do much in the matter federally. I am in favour of increasing the powers of the municipalities, and would advocate the payment of aldermen, in order to induce them to give greater attention to their business, and to have the choice of the people enlarged. I have no desire to reflect on any individual council or councillor, because, as a rule, the majority of aldermen are actuated by the highest public rrotives and patriotic spirit.",53

I have been an alderman myself, and I never worked harder, though I do not think my work was appreciated asit ought to have been. I always seem to get into Parliaments or assemblieswhere there is trouble. I do not know why this should be, but when I becamea member of the Brisbane City Council, three aldermen - Alderman MCMaster,. Alderman Eraser, and Alderman Raymond-resigne d as a protest against theconduct of Alderman Higgs; and I can only say that if I could do anything to bring about a similar result with my honourable friends opposite, I would most assuredly do it. Contractors, landlords, and others sometimes secure election to city councils, and then devote the whole of their effortsto keeping down the taxes on the landlord, or getting work done "" ag'in their own door,"" so to speak. They have no desire to improve the cities, because that might mean that they would have tospend a little more on their own properties.",53

I deem it my"" duty to endeavour to prevent slums in the towns, and in the country my desire is that the people there shall have all the comforts of civilization. It is often a great privilege for a boy or a girl to bebrought up in the country, but I should like to give country people every facility in the way of education, improvement, and enjoyment. On all sides we hear cries about increased rents, and the increased cost of food and clothing. As to the rents, I submit that the municipalities ought to endeavour to get the ratepayersto consent to the expenditure of publicmoney in the erection of cottages, and' thus enter into competition with thelandlord. As to the price of food, T direct attention to what is taking placein Europe. The American Meat Trust has control, pretty well, of the whole production of the world, and various causes contribute to keep up. the prico of meat in Europe. Certain municipalities in Berlin, Charlottenburg, and - elsewhere, I saw from a cable a few months ago, have decided to import Australian mutton in large quantities in order to meet the prevailing scarcity, and to reduce the present high prices. - order to meet the trusts and combines, which, at the present time, are levying taxation on the oublic of Australia and elsewhere, I believe it will be necessary for municipalities to establish shops and distributing houses so that goods may he obtained at reasonable rates. The Western Australian Government have made an attempt by opening a butcher's shop in Perth, and, though I believe they did succeed in reducing the price by 3d. per l b . , the combine has been .able to interfere and prevent their getting supplies. . However, we must not be in any way disheartened in the good work of municipalization by the action <of a few trusts or combines; and before very long it will be necessary to adopt .some method of dealing with American trusts. There is not so much cheering now amongst pastoralists at the introduction of .American methods into We cannot keep down the price of foodstuffs unless we act as I have suggested. Could not the municipalities distribute pure milk ? At present we see the spectacle of a dozen carts crossing one another f if t y times in the morning, doing work that could be done regularly by two carts distributing from a municipal dairy, and thus avoiding the great waste of effort that now exists in the distribution of the commodity. The same would apply in regard to the distribution from butchers' and bakers' shops. Though honourable members opposite think these matters most heterodox, they must realise that what I suggest is bound to come.  into our own businesses.",53
520,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member is correct. In their businesses, able members avoid waste of effort - competition. Instead of having a dozen boards of directors and a dozen companies - dealing in the same concerns, they have - one board of directors and one company, part. thus avoiding the former waste in canvassing, in advertising, and in a dozen - different directions.

The National Parliament has reached a deplorable stage, when members who desire to bring under the notice of Ministers and the country the grievances of some of their electors have to wait for the motion to adjourn the House before they can be heard. All I regret is that I am keeping the officers of the House here by speaking at this late hour. Had the right honourable member for Swan been Prime Minister the trouble to which I wish to refer would not have happened, because he would have risen to the occasion like the big man he has always been in politics, and prevented it . During the regime of the Fisher Government it was to get decided that any man, no matter how poor or humble his parents were, capable of passing a stiff examination, could become a commissioned officer from the ranks. Many young men who are becoming officers in our A r m y today are the sons of poor parents; but since the present Government have been in power I am informed, on reliable authoritynamely, the father of one of these boysbhat a lad, who passed an examination, and became a lieutenant, paid for his own uniform, on the understanding that the money would be refunded to him; but month after month goes by, and he cannot get a refund. The father, poor as he is, put his hand in his pocket clothe this young man, who is taking share in protecting the country. The reason this matter is not rectified appears to be that the Minister of Defence thinks more of adjourning the Senate and trotwhich ting away to garden parties, or elsewhere. Consequently, important defence matters no longer receive the personal attention of the Minister, with the result that people cannot get that to which they are justly entitled. I hope the day is not far distant when the Minister will bring his Department up to date, and tinctions not allow these unfair things to happen. I regret very much that the honourable member for Indi, the honourable member for Wannon, and other young members who have interested themselves in rifle ranges-somethin g that suits their own class of people-d o not say a word on .hebably half of these young men, who are not getting a fair deal at the hands of Minister of Defence.",55

He says that he is a poor man, cannot afford to pay a considerable sum to provide his son with a uniform, and that when he has done so the Government should refund the money. Honourable members opposite have now a Government in power that suits them, and they will not say a word. They are ruled by the iron hand of the Attorney-General. I never hear the honourable member speak or see him come into the House but in imagination I hear the clink, clink, clink of the leg-irons, which in the past were worn by people who lived to in some countries. I am reminded also his of the play in which Nell Gwynne and Judge Jeffries appear. I hope the Prime Minister will convey to the Minister of Defence my protest against the way in young men who are willing to give up their time to the Defence Department are being treated. Some honourable members desire that only the sons of the rich should hold positions in our Army, but in these enlightened days, and in this country, we have done away with the class disthat used to prevail, and now the only way to secure promotion in the Army is by passing the necessary examinations. I hope we shall never have a return to the class distinctions of the past, but I cannot forget that there are members supporting the Government who would prolike to have a law adopted here like the law in force in Germany, where a the young man is not allowed to become an officer unless he can prove that he has blue blood in his veins, and is not allowed to marry until the name of the lady he wishes to marry is submitted for the apof a committee of the Army. In that country the officers are kept distinct the from the rank and file, but, thank God, we have done away with such class distinctions in Australia.
