16,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister the Navy what action has been taken his Department in searching for the Canastota, the Fitzroy, and another vessel recently lost. Has the Navy done everything it could by way of search?",20
17,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I told the House yesterday that the Navy had done all it could in searching for the missing vessels. When I read.in the newspapers of the shipping disaster which occurred recently on the New South Wales coast, them. I immediately instructed the Naval Board to send a vessel to render assistance, if possible. The Marguerite was .thereupon despatched to the locality where the steamer Fitzroy was supposed to have foundered, and made a thorough search, but without finding human bodies or being able to do any good. I have since received the following letter preciation of the services thus given: North Coast Steam Navigation Company Bear-Admiral Dumaresq, H.MNaval Establishments, Dear Sir, By direction of our board of directors, I desire, on behalf of the company, to convey you the appreciation of the directors and of the relatives of the unfortunate peopio who 'lost their lives, at the offer to dispatch one - of His Majesty's ships in a prompt endeavour to render whatever assistance was possible on the scene of the disasters to the vessels - OUT Jack and Fitzroy. You were good enough to send HMAS. Marguerite to sea, intimately connected with those unfortunate casualties realise that the Department Navy placed their services for immediate posal in an effort to minimize, if possible, of life. I have the honour to be. As I said yesterday,- whenever we hear that a vessel is in trouble and definite information is available as to the locality of the disaster, a war-ship, if in the braced - vicinity, will be sent immediately to render aid.

23,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"the Acting and those Prime Minister, upon notice I. Are there permanent officers in the Comof the monwealth Public Service who are married dismen with children under fourteen years of age, loss and who are not receiving the basic wage and child endowment as laid down by the Government last year? Tours faithfully, (Sgd.) W. C. STUREOCK. 2. If so, did these men, who, it is understood, are all members of the Commonwealth Public Service Artisans Association, approach the Arbitration Court last year, and did Mr Justice Power refuse to make an award as to wages owing to the large number of trades emby this association . and the varying rates of pay in each of the States for the same class of work? 3. Did the Public Service Commissioner subsequently agree to pay the rates asked for? 4. Owing to the above circumstances, are tradesmen with over twenty-five years' experience, who entered the service by competitive examination, now working in the Postmaster General's Department for a salary less than the same Department pays its own labourers? 5. Was every Public Service award supplemented by £12 per annum, plus child endowment; and, if so, why are the wages of. the employees referred to not similarly supplemented? 6. As the child endowment is not considered as salary, cannot the Acting Prime Minister arrange that these men shall also participate in the benefits of this endowment as from the 1st November, 1920?",20
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1, 2, and 3. Prior to 8th January, 1920, artisans in the Commonwealth Public Service were subject to the award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Application was made by the Artisans Association to the Arbitration Court to have all positions which are - the subject of outside awards or agreements deleted from the Public Service award, and the officers in these positions remunerated according to the rates granted in similar industries outside the Service. This was agreed to as from Sth January, 1920. 4 ancl 5. From 1st November, 1920, all adult officers in receipt of salary of less than £400 per annum, except officers paid rates awarded to outside industries, were granted basic wage allowances at the rate of £12 per annum, and similarly officers in receipt of less than per annum, excepting those mentioned, were - granted child endowment. No justification exists for granting the basic wage allowance and child endowment to officers receiving the rates of pay Awarded to outside industries, as the existing cost of living conditions are taken into consideration by State Arbitration Courts and other wages tribunals in determinations as to rates of pay. 6. No. The rates paid to these officers are regarded as inclusive of child endowment. If they will insist upon following outside awards, then they take themselves out of our jurisdiction. They cannot bave it both ways. CIVTL AVIATION .",21
25,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. What action has already been taken by - the Government to encourage civil aviation under tlic following heads:(a) Ground organization. (6) Mail and passenger services. (c) Developmental services. (d) Construction of aeroplanes. (e) Generally? 2. What further action is proposed for the future? 3. What amount of the vote of £100,000 was expended up to 30th June, 1921?",21
26,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. (o) The Civil Aviation Branch is provid : ing aerodromes and preparing emergency landing grounds on the following aerial routes, which cover a total distance of, approximately, 2,210 miles:(i) Sydney to Adelaide, vid Goulburn, Cootamundra, Hay, Mildura, and Loxton; (ii) Melbourne to Hay, vid Echuca; (iii) Sydney to Charleville, vid Narrahri, Moree, and St. George; (iv) Charleville to Cloncurry, Central Queensland. Subsidies are being paid to the shires and municipal authorities along these routes. The Department of Home and Territories is now negotiating for the purchase of aerodromes in Melbourne, Sydney, and other centres. The Royal Australian Air Force are surveying and organizing additional routes which will be available for civil aircraft. (6) The Government has invited tenders for the establishment and maintenance of a weekly (return) mail, freight, and passenger service by air from Geraidton to Derby, Western Australia, for a period of twelve months, and will subsidize the successful tenderer to the extent of an amount not exceeding £25,000. (c) Recommendations are now under consideration that tenders be called for the estab£500 lishment and maintenance of developmental aerial services between(i) Sydney and Adelaide, vid Cootamundra; (ii) Melbourne and Launceston; (iii) Sydney and Brisbane, vid Grafton and Lismore. (d) Up to the present only one Australian firm has asked for an order for the manufacture of aeroplanes, and their proposal is under consideration by the Air Council. (e) The Government, realizing that a first essential of a successful aviation industry in Australia is public confidence in the safety of this newest form of transport, has legislated for the strict control of all aircraft and flying personnel. Regulations made under the Air Navigation Act were issued on 28th March, 1921, and came into force on 28th June, 1921. 2. It is the policy of the Government, inter alia(a) To facilitate the influx of capital to the aviation industry by offering terms sufficiently attractive to the investing public to support organizations formed to maintain services on approved routes of national importance, and thus insure useful work for the civilian pilots and mechanics who would be available in the event of necessity for sudden expansion of the Royal Australian Air Force; (I)) to provideaerodromes in all the capital, cities and at junctions of the aerial routes, and to provide emergency landing grounds at frequent intervals along such routes; (c) to prepare and issue aerial maps of all approved routes. 3. The staff of the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department has been organized for - approximately four months of the past financial year, and recommendations for the expendij ture of approximately £57,600 have been prepared and approved in that period, but it has only been practicable to expend usefully, approximately, £6,700 of the amount voted by Parliament for the year ended 30th June. By the end of August, it isanticipated that an additional amount of approximately £20,000 will-have been expended in giving effect to approved recommendations.

Whether he is aware of the reported growing distress and dissatisfaction at Canungra and Beaudesert owing to the closing down - of the. local saw-mills there, which were recently purcliased by the Commonwealth Government? 2. Is it true that considerable loss is incurred at the two places mentioned through loss of interest on capital, idleness of teams, and depreciation both of plant and the big stocks of timber on hand? 3. If so, has the Government decided definite policy to cope with this serious position? 4. If so, when will some announcement that effect be made?",22
28,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,An answer to the honourable member's question will nished tomorrow. WAR PENSIONS.,22
29,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"On the 24th June, 1921, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cameron) asked the following tionWill the Minister representing the Minister -. Your telegram 24th June. for Repatriation state-(a ) The number of pensions cancelled during the period ary, 1921, to date; fb) the number of war pensions reduced, also the number increased, during the same period? I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following in formation, supplied by the Repatriation Commission: (a) The number of war pensions' cancelled from 1st January 1921, to 25th June/ 1921, is 14,078. This includes cancellation by reason of: ""(i)- Pensions irregularly granted .. 481 (ii) Total recovery from wounds and illnesses. ... .. 9,867 (iii.) Miscellaneous causes, including .3,730 (a) Children 16 years of age (6) Widows re-married (c) Surrendered pensions, and pensions stopped consequent upon failure of recipient to present himself for medical review 1 , 14,078 The proportion of' ex-members and dependants in the number above-stated is approximately 40 per cent, and 60 per cent, respectively, viz. : Ex-members of the Forces .. 5,631 - Dependants . of ex-members of the . Forces ' .. .. 8,447 14,078 total number of war pensions in force on January, 1021, was 225,826, and the cancellations since that date therefore represent 6.23 per cent. During the same period new warpensions have been granted to the number of >1,644. (6) 1. Number of war pensions reduced, 48,812-the main cause of reductions in rate of pension is the gradual recovery of ex-membeing bers of the Forces from wounds and illness. 2. Number of war pensions increased, 14,924these increases are mainly the result of failing - health or increased disability 'from wounds of ex-members of the Forces, which had become on some evident on the review of the pensions. »The number of .war pensions reduced and increased quoted above include ex-members of to the Forces and their dependants in the proportion - of approximately 40 per cent, and 60. per cent, respectively. be fur- .

Motion (by Mr GREENE) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act relating to the Tariff Board. Bill presented and read a first time. SECOND READIN G.,22
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown," I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I am taking this course in accordance with the promise I made to the House some time ago that I would endeavour to introduce this Bill and another Bill dealing with dumping before the conclusion of the consideration of the Tariff schedule in order to enable honourable members to make themselves familiar with the provisions of these measures before being called upon to actually debate them. And I propose, if the necessary documents reach the House before I conclude my speech on this measure, to proceed in Committee of Ways and Means to explain the proposed anti-dumping law. I am advised that I am obliged to proceed by way of a formal resolution in Committee of Ways and Means, and to then bring in a Bill to carry out the resolution of the Committee. Australia, rightly or wrongly- I believe, rightly, but that is a matter of opinion-ha s adopted a Protectionist policy, and ever since the inauguration of Federation we have framed our Tariffs more or les3 on Protectionist lines. Naturally, with the development and extension of industry in this country, progressing as we have done from stage to stage in the processes of manufacture, there has been a tendency always to broaden the base of our policy of Protection and to cover more and more ground. It has been m y experience, and, I believe, that of every honourable member in the House, that there has been a great need for more complete and accurate information on the one hundred and one details that we are called upon to consider when dealing with a Tariff schedule. There are a vast number of things that it is necessary for honourable members to know in order to make it possible for them to appreciate the necessifcyfor, ancl the effect of, proposed duties. One thing on which I iay special stress is the necessity for the information placed in the hands of honourable members being up to date. An inquiry held two or three years ago into the conditions of industry is' perhaps of little or no use when dealing' with the conditions existing today. The main consideration is that our information should be kept up to date. The Department over which I preside has endeavoured to do that, and has succeeded to a very large degree, but Burdened as my officers are with all the details ' of ordinary administrative work, it is almost impossible to keep the information ""quite up to date unless we appoint a special staff of officers whose special duty shall be that and nothing else. It seems to be highly desirable, therefore, that there should be a special body created whose duty would be to study 'from' day tb day, and month to month, and year to year, not only the operation of the Tariff, but also the development of industries in Australia and the means that should be adopted to encourage-still furtherdevelopment. That body should study also in its broadest aspect the effect of the operation of the Tariff generally upon industries, both primary and secondary. No doubt there is room for the development of primary industries in certain directions, but only if , side by side with them, are the related secondary industries. I am a great believer in the diversification of primary industries. We do not get the best results from primary industry by growing either wheat or wool ancl nothing else. There are avenues in which we could find useful and remunerative employment for the people on the land other than in the present great staple primary industries. Therefore, it will be the duty of the proposed Tariff Board, if Parliament in its wisdom agrees to its establishment, to not only study the effect of the actual duties we impose, but to also investigate in that broader' and wider field the possibilities of future, development in both primary and secondary industries. The duties will include, no doubt, the collection and collation of a great deal of statistical information, from which the Board will work out their conclusions. But I believe that statistical information of and by itself is of very little use when considering the duties necessary .to be imposed in connection with the establishment of an industry. I agree entirely with some - remarks made by the Chairman of the Tariff Board of America ir. .a 'speech which he delivered at the annual dinner of the Association of Commerce in Chicago on the 3rd cember, 1910. That was about a year after the Board had been appointed, and they had had some time in which to conrecommendations, sider the methods by which they would tackle the immense responsibility that had been thrown upon them by the Preof sident of the United States of America. The Chairman of the Board said, in resible gard to statistics:Frankly, we do not believe that a mere statistical knowledge of comparative costs of production is an all-sufficient basis for a Tariff judgment. In fact, we wish to emphasize strongly our position that the Tariff problem is not a mere statistical problem. It is portant that we do not delude ourselves or the public with the idea that the greater the mass of figures accumulated the greater the knowunsaid ledge derived. We must limit our such a way as to avoid two grave dangers: First, that the Board would be so swamped by a mass of material that even if it greatly enlarged it could not handle the ter intelligently; second, that the Board be forced to trust merely to tabulations and. averages in mathematical form. This latter danger promises to become the crux of whole situation. There are those who seem think that by getting a sufficient mass of figures and putting them through the adding machine the result will be some magical which represents 'an ideally just rate for any specific article. Please do not for one moment that we share this view. Despite the need for a large amount of statistical materia) and special technical reports, pan bo no satisfactory results secured unless the officers of the Government intrusted with the taking of evidence on oath. such investigations can supplement these materials by the application of common sense practical business judgment. They must the conditions of competition in each try, they must be familiar with local conditions through study on the ground, so far as sible, and they must analyze sympathetically, and yet critically,.the claims of each interested party. They must recognise that the question of prices sometimes proves more fundamental than the question of costs. The Tariff tion is one of business, and not of mathematics. The problem of bow fnr an industry needs protection to keep it in sound existence, or what the effect of its decay not"" be settled by any algebraic formula. I quite agree with that statement of the case, and while I realise that one of chief duties of this Board will be the study and compilation of statistics relation to the Tariff, I should be sorry think that it was going to submit to Parliament from time to time recomi mendations based on a mere balancing of figures. I . dp not think we can ever properly consider a Tariff based entirely on information of that character, valuI able as it may be as an assistance towards Desecuring the end we have in view. While I hope the Board will not rely on statistics as the main ground for their I trust also they will not rely upon evidence given on oath by witnesses before them as the main means informing their minds. Sworn testimony may be found of the greatest posuse in elucidating information it is necessary to get, and this Bill makes ample provision to give the Board powers of investigation in that direction; but the most taking of evidence on oath at an inquiry is not an ideal way of arriving at a imjjroper judgment in regard to the Tariff.",23
32,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Sometime s what is left by witnesses is of more importance work in than what has been uttered.,24
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I thoroughly agree were with the honourable member. Very often matwhat is left unsaid is the most material would point in the consideration of a questionThe Tariff Board must be left free to the inform its mind in regard to the Tariff to in any way it likes, and I hope-it will endeavour to make itself, as far as posfigure sible, familiar with the expansion and of duty growth of industry in this country by think getting into close personal touch with that development, for by that means they there can do far better work than by the mere summoning of witnesses before them and Of arid course, in connection with their inquiries know there may come a time when it will be indusmost essential that they should place a posman in the witness box and put certain definite questions tb him, and they are given power to do this; but I hope that they will not rely upon this means as the quessole way of informing their minds.",24
34,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Eve n though a heavy penalty is provided for supplying inacwould be, cancurate information?",24
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It is most necessary that penalties should be provided so that the when the Board in the exercise of this discretion which is given to it summons in a man and puts him on oath, and asks to for certain information, provision should this be made to punish him in a proper way f he supplies false information. I hope that neither the members of this House nor the public generally will expect too much of the Tariff Board. t is often said that the Tariff should be made a business matter, and dealt with apart altogether from political considerations. In fact, some reputable journals - suggest that the imposition of the Tariff should not be left to Parliament it3elf, but to some outside body. But after all. is said and done a Tariff is a form of taxation, and; although taxation levied by Parliament may be regarded as disagreeable in a Democracy, taxation imposed by a bureaucracy would be as impossible as would be the exactions of an autocrat. Let us be under no delusion that the creation of this Tariff Board will bring about a fiscal millennium. It will do nothing of the sort. All the Board will be able to do is to investigate, to inform, and to recommend. It will be able to make its investigations as thorough as possible, its informationas comprehensive as possible, and its recommendations as wise as possible, but when these three things are done Parliament alone can fix the Tariff.",24
36,Mr WATT,Unknown,Not according to clause 15 of this Bill.,25
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think so, and if anything has crept into the verbiage of the Bill which brings about a different result, it was not my intention. I do not think that such has occurred, but we can look into th© matter later on. After all, the application of the recommendations of the Tariff Board involves a great problem of economic policy regarding which there always has been, and always will be, great difference of opinion. It may be demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that the findings of the Board - are unimpeachable, but there still remains the question of a high Tariff, a low Tariff, or no Tariff. These are questions which; in the long run,- can only be settled by the popular will as expressed through the chosen representatives of the people. Tariff Board or no Tariff Board, the Tariff is, and must remain, one of the great problems of political controversy, and I think it is impossible to prevent the Tariff reflecting, from time to time, in a greater or lesser degree, the play of public opinion as mirrored through the constituencies. It is inevitable, therefore, that many of the benefits which are popularly expected to flow from the appointment of a Tariff Board are likely to prove ""illusory; and, though I think there are some substantial benefits to be derived from the creation of such a Board, it is, so far as we are concerned, largely an experiment. It is for that reason, perhaps, as much asany other, that honourable members will find the Bill drafted in the way it has been. It is true that America has had a fairly long experience of a Tariff Board, which there is now called a Tariff Commission. It was created, I think, in 1909, with, a Board of three members, and we have followed that example to the extent that we propose to appoint three' members under this Bill. It will be found that the Bill does not propose to make three new permanent appointments. For reasons which I shall give directly, it is proposed to make one of the appointees a member of the administrative staff of the Department of Trade and Customs, and to appoint two other men from outside, and pay them so much per sitting. The fees are laid down in the Bill itself. It is provided that the member of the administrative staff - of the Department shall be Chairman of the Com_ mission, and that, in addition to his usual salary, whatever that may happen to be, he shall be granted allowances which, together with his salary, must not exceed £1,400 per year. Then we propose to pay the members of the Board £55s. per sitting for every day they sit. There will, of course, be times when they will not require to sit. They can set investigations going, employ men to do the ""devilling""' work for them, and then, with the information obtained in front of them, come to their conclusions from time to time. So much for the personnel of the Board, which, we think, will be able to carry out its work with a comparatively small staff. The members of the Board will, of course, rely largely, on the officers of my Department for a great deal of the statistical and other information they will require. I cannot say, because it is difficult to tell until the Board has been in operation a little while, whether it will be necessary to add to .the 1 staff more than one or two^ who will be required for secretarial work in the first instance. '",25
38,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"If so, it will be different from any other Board!",25
39,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Will the members of the Board be selected from the Department, or from outside?",25
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Othe r than the Bill, Chairman, the members will be selected from outside. If the honourable member will look at clause 6 he will see this visionThe Governor General shall appoint Chairman of the Board a member who holds an administrative office in the Department Trade and Customs . . . . That is provided because we felt that, in any case, and under any circumstances, it is necessary that between the Board and the Department there should. be a close liaison. There is, of course, in Department a vast amount - of experience in connection with the handling of the Tariff, and with the Customs laws, and it is - most essential that the Board should have the benefit of that experience, so that the members may know, in many instances, what they are doing, and what the' effect of their recommendations may be. I have known quite a number cases in which people have asked the Department to take certain action which they believed to be in their interest, when, as a fact, they lacked knowledge Tariff? of how such action would work out in application, and if we had done what - was desired, the result would have been the direct opposite of what was expected. So, therefore, we think there should this close liaison between the Board and the Customs Department, and propose that the Chairman shall be a departto mental officer.",26
41,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Will not the Board clash in some way with the Intertheir State Commission?,26
42,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The honourable gentleWhen man is not very often in that condition in which, Rip Van Winkle is supposed to have been, but is generally wide awake, and I thought he knew that the Interable. State Commission has ceased to exist for quite a long time. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,-^B.P!W has i ceased to exist?",26
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"B y the expiration *f the term for which the members of it were appointed, and some considerable time ago the Government announced that it was not proposed to make any reitems appointments. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN-It is satisfactory to know that.",26
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I do not know that plaint, it is necessary for me to deal with the more or leas mechanical clauses of the between those which provide for the appointment of the members of the Board and clauses 14 to 17. These prolatter clauses really contain the measure itself, and clause 14 is, perhaps, more as important than any other. I wish honourable members to observe how that clause, of which deals with the reference of certain matters to the Board, is drawn, and the effect of it . The clause beginsTho Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following mattersthe Then these matters are enumerated, and the first paragraph concludesand shall not take any action in respect of theany of those matters until he has received report of the Board. That is a very drastic provision. It makes it mandatory on the Minister, in respect to the matters mentioned, to refer of to the Board before taking action.",26
45,Mr GKEGOEY,Unknown,"What do you mean by taking action-say , for instance, in regard to the application of the intermediate Mv. GREENE - It is impossible for the intermediate Tariff to be applied to any country until Parliament has agreed be to its application. The Minister may enter into negotiations with the representatives of another country - with a view its application to that country, and may conclude those negotiations, but before he brings to Parliament a Bill for ratification, he must obtain the report of the Tariff Board on the subject. Parliament comes to consider a proposed application of the intermediate Tariff, if any member calls for the report of the Board that report must be avail1",26
46,Mr WATT,Unknown,Does not the Minister think that the prohibition contained in t paragraph b of sub-clause 1 of clause 14 will hinder him in his work?,26
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Le t me deal first with paragraph a of sub-clause 1Tlie classification of goods under all Tariff which provide for classification undor by-laws. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has been constant in his comin season and out of season, that the Minister acts in this matter without any review of his actions being possible; TariffBoard [REPRESENTATIVES.] and I promised, on behalf of the Governclause ment, that when we introduced this meaing sure it should provide that, before Minister took action under a by-law, should obtain the report of the Tariff Board. All responsibility for taken rests with the Minister, and it must so rest; but before he takes action he tions? must get the report of the Board. Paragraph b requires the Minister to refer the Board for inquiry and reportThe determination of the value of goods for duty under section one hundred and sixty of the Customs Act 1901-1920. That section is an arbitrary provision which puts on the Minister the duty determining the value of goods which come into this country but are not sold here;.goods, for instance, which arc subquiry and reportject to royalty. Before the Minister comes to such a determination, he must undue receive the report of the Tariff Board.",26
48,Mr STEWART,Unknown,Then the Minister cannot exercise the powers given to him by the Tariff schedule unless he first consults the Board ?,27
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Unti l he has conthe sulted the Board. Before the Minister takes action, either in making a departdule, mental by-law., or in performing duties conferred on him by Statute, he must get a report from the Tariff Board. need not necessarily follow the recommendo dations of the Board.",27
50,Mr WATT,Unknown,The members of the action Board will not have much time for if references are to be made to them constantly.,27
51,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"In regard to many matters, their decisions will be more less formal. The information on which recommendations will be made will collected for them, and put in front of them. Information is put before me in that way, and I may act upon it ; or may say that I require further informaunder tion. The Board will do the same.  clause 14, the Board will operate upon reference from the Minister. Is there no provision giving them the right that to initiate action on their part?",27
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes , clause 16 gives ing to Parliament. the Board that right with regard to matters which come under sub-clause 2 of Bill. 14. In regard to matters involvMinisterial action, the Board is to bo the moved by the Minister. The Board, of he course, cannot move the Minister; but the Minister cannot take action until he any action has moved the Board.",27
53,Mr WATT,Unknown,Thos e are general ques,27
54,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes. The Board, if to it likes, may go into that field and make such investigations as it pleases; but when it is a question of parliamentary action by the Minister, such as the introduction of a new Tariff, he must bring the report of the Board with him, or must have it ready to be made available. I draw parof ticular attention to paragraph h of subclause 1 of clause 14, which says that the Minister shall refer to the Board for inAny complaint that a manufacturer is taking advantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or (ii) acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the publicThat provision is intended to carry out definite promise made more than once during the discussion of the Tariff schethat if a manufacturer took undue advantage of the protection given him by the Tariff, means would be provided for Ho its rapid review. What it is proposed to honourable members will ascertain by looking at clause 15The Minister may, if he thinks fit, take in respect to any of the niatters dealt golf with by the Board in its report. so The Board may report, and the Minister may decide to take no action.",27
55,Mr WATT,Unknown,"But when he decides to or take action in regard to any of the matters mentioned in clause 14, he may take be it without Parliament being advised.",27
56,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"There are things which Parliament will learn in the usual I way, such as the classification of goods the Tariff items providing for classification under by-laws. With regard to them the same procedure will be followed as is followed now, the by-law being only gazetted in the usual way.",27
57,Mr WATT,Unknown,But this is the first time the Minister has been given power to reduce or abolish duties merely by report,27
58,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Bill says that a copy of every report made in pursuance of sub-clause 3 shall be available for Parliament. If the Board finds, cn inquiry, that any complaint referred to it , under paragraph A of sub-clause 1 of clause 14, is justified, it may recommend that the amount of duty payable be reduced or abolished, or that such other action may be taken as the Board may think desirable.",27
59,Mr WATT,Unknown,"That is very wide. It"" might include the imprisonment of a manufacturer.",28
60,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Yes ; but all that the Board can do is to recommend.,28
61,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Minister, under subclause 1 of clause 15, may take action, and if his action is taken in relation to the particular matters mentioned in subclause 2 of clause 15, all he will have to do is to report to Parliament.",28
62,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Minister may take action only so far as the la\v permits. There is a number of matters under subclause 1 of clause 14 in regard to which he must get a report from the Board, and on which he may take action, but itdoes not necessarily follow that that will be final action. .1 refer to such things as a proposal for the application of the British preferential Tariff, the granting of bounties for the encouragement of. any primary or secondary industry.",28
63,Mr WATT,Unknown,"As I read the Bill, the Minister has power to grant suchbounties.",28
64,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That is not. intended. ',28
65,Mr WATT,Unknown,Then clause 15 needs amending.,28
66,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That may be so. It is not intendea to alter existing procedure ' in the slightest, degree. This House is left the master of the introduction and rejection of duties. However, we can look at the drafting by-and-bye, and, if it is faulty, can amend it . So far as paragraph h of sub-clause 1 of clause 14 is concerned, all that is intended is that if the Board, after an investigation, reports that a manufacturer is charging too much for his goods, or is acting in restraint of trade detrimentally to the public, then the obligation is thrown on the Minister to bring the report before this House within seven days.",28
67,Mr RYAN,Unknown,If there were not a Board could not the Minister act? Is not the interposition of the Board a fetter on the Minister? .,28
68,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Bil l gives the Minister a power, apart from the Board, which no Minister has previously had. Mr MASSYGREENE.^-It gives new powers of investigation and report; but it does not interfere with the existing position in relation to matters which a Minister-may or may not do.",28
69,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The Minister - cannot do anything until Parliament has sanctioned his action.',28
70,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,No ; so far as those things are concerned in relation to which he must now obtain parliamentary approval.,28
71,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Is there anything in the Bill which gives the Minister power to put into effect the recommendations of the Board?,28
72,Mr WATT,Unknown,Unde r clause 15 he has summary power.,28
73,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Clause 15 saysUpon receipt of a report from the Board, in pursuance of the last preceding sections, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, take action in respect of any of the matters dealt with by the Board - in its report. He can take action only within the limits of the law.",28
74,Mr WATT,Unknown,"That is legislative power to the Minisber, the preceding condition having been fulfilled.",28
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I am not prepared to express a legal opinion on the point; and if the clause requires amendment we shall have it amended in Committee. It is not - the intention of the Government that it shall give that ppwer to the Minister. Sub-clause 1 of clause 14 deals with the review of the Tariff. It was never intended that after report by the Board the Minister should act.,28
76,Mr WATT,Unknown,Not with regard to that particular phase.,28
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,No ; nor was it intended in regard to this particular form of inquiry into the operations of an individual manufacturer or manufacturers. Mr GREGORY But in other matters it was.,28
78,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"There are some matters in respect of which the Minister now has power to move. It is not proposed to disturb that power, nor to give to the Minister any greater powers than those which he possesses today. We propose really in that respect to leave everything \A£\ exactly as it is.",28
79,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I think that th© Minister, in considering the question, would be well advised if he decided to exempt from Ministerial power certain phases of clause 14.",29
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If the Crown L aw Department holds that the words in question have as wide a meaning as the honourable member suggests, we shall take action. If there is the slightest doubt we shall clear it up. Nothing is further from our intention than to go along the lines suggested by the honourable member.",29
81,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"That is satisfactory. ' Mr MASSYGREENE - It will be noticed that in clause 17 provision is made for an annual report. The clause provides thatThe Board shall in the month of June in each year report to the Minister generally as to the operation of' the Tariff, and the' development of industries, and shall in such report set out the recommendations made by the Board during the preceding twelve months, other than any recommendations whose inclusion the Minister and the Board agree is not in the public interest. . . .",29
82,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,What is meant by the last few words ?,29
83,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Board, for in stance, might recommend to the Minister that Certain duties be increased. would probably be most injudicious, in the public interest, to make known that information before action had been taken by the'Minister.",29
84,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The provision, if it is only in protection of the public revenue, is wise; but it might be abused.",29
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I *'think honourable members will recognise that a definite obligation is laid upon the Board to reDort at a certain time, and upon the Minister to lay that report on the table of. the House within a certain time. The Board might have recommended to the Minister certain alterations in the schedule of duties, and the Government .might not be in a position at the particular moment when the report was to be presented to Parliament, to give effect to the recommendation.  for a specific report on specific items from time to time ?",29
86,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Roughl y speaking, the intention is that the report of the Board shall disclose all the recommendations made to the Minister from time to tune.  only once a year..",29
87,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes , except in regard to matters mentioned in sub-clause 2 of clause 15, the reports under which are to come automatically on to the table of the House.",29
88,Mr RICHABD POSTER,Unknown,Is it not conceivable that such a report as that referred to in clause 17 might lead to heavy withdrawals from the Customs?,29
89,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Yes .,29
90,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Is there any protection against that probability?,29
91,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I take it that it is the protection against that probability to which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) is objecting. Notwithstanding that it might not be in the public interest to make known a certain recommendation, the honourable member thinks it should be embodied in the annual report. We want to safeguard that provision.",29
92,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Minister could avoid the difficulty by laying any such recommendations before the House in a separate report, after his Tariff proposals had been presented. .. Mr .GREENE - They would naturally It come along in the ordinary course of events. There may be.other matters that it would be undesirable to disclose, but this is the only one that occurs to my mind at the moment - It was certainly in my mind, when the clause was. drafted, that, although the Board might have recommended to the Minister the alteration > of certain duties in the Tariff schedule, the psychological moment for action in Parliament might not have arrived. The provision as to withholding a recommendation from the annual report is safeguarded to the extent that the Board and the Minister must agree that it is not in the public interest that it should be made known at that time.",29
93,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Has the honourable gentleman satisfied himself as to the necessity for the clause?,29
94,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I think it will douseful work.,29
95,Mr RYAN,Unknown,A r e there not some constitutional difficulties?,29
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I am advised there are not. - Dr MALONEY - Is there not American precedent for the creation of a Tariff Board?,29
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The United States of America Tariff Comniission was set up by'Act of Congress, and although we do not propose to set up anything like so large an organization as that of the United States of America Tariff Commission, we are following very much the same lines..",30
98,Mr WATT,Unknown,Does the Minister think that for the fee named in the Bill he will be able to obtain two colleagues of the right quality and experience to act with the Chairman? I doubt it very much.,30
99,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think that, for the fee named, we shall be able to get two suitable men. We have been guided by the fees paid to directors of 'big companies; but if the House thinks that the fee is insufficient, I do not think the Government would very strenuously object to raise it .",30
100,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The fee, £ 5 5s. a day, will run into £1,000 or £1,400 a year.",30
101,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If the Board sits three days a week, the remuneration provided for will run into a .very fair amount.",30
102,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"The members of the Board, in addition, will be allowed expenses.",30
103,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"We have provided for the payment of reasonable travelling expenses. That, however, is a minor detail. If it is the feeling of the House generally that we cannot obtain for this fee the type of men necessary, the Government may agree to raise it. We require men of the highest type for this particular class of work. '",30
104,Mr WATT,Unknown,And free from conflicting interests.,30
105,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes , as far as possible. The Bill provides that if any member of the Board is pecuniarily interested in any particular subject that comes up for discussion before it , he shall stand aside. I am hopeful that we shall obtain suitable men for the fee set out in the Bill.",30
106,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Some honourable members in the Ministerial corner would like to know whether' the Board will have its headquarters in Canberra?.,30
107,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"In due course, no doubt it will. It is not necessary for me to deal further with the measure this afternoon. I hope that when the House proceeds to consider it , it will give the Government its fullest assistance. This class of legislation is new to. the Parliament, and the Government in putting it forward do not tie themselves to the absolute letter of it . If we can obtain any help in making it more perfect we shall be very glad.",30
108,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [3.45] - I understand that it is the usual practice when a. Minister has moved the second reading of a Bill to move the adjournment of the debate, but all that I have to say can be said. ab. once.",30
109,Mr WATIT,Unknown,"It would not be fair to the House for the honourable member to 'debate the Bill at this stage. He should move the adjournment of thedebate. - Mr ANSTEY - I do not intend to move the adjournment of the debate. This Bill was circulated only a few minutes ago, and the brief examination that I have been able to make of it satisfies me that ' I can say all that I want to say with regard to it before the debate is adjourned. My view is that the Bill should go intothe 'waste-paper basket and stop there for ever. It is designated a Bill for the appointment of a Tariff Board, but all it proposes to do is to resurrect the defunct and useless Inter-State Commission. It proposes to establish a number of gentlemen in new positions, to build up around them a large staff, and to create a number of highly-paid offices. The members of the B'oard are each to receive £ 5 5s. per day; and, since there are 365 days in the year, they will make a very fine thing out of it .",30
110,Mr STEWART,Unknown,But : the honourable member would not have them work on Sundays?,30
111,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"If the Board looks after its own interests while looking after the interest of the public as well, it will sit every day in the year and receive £5 5s. per day. It is declared in the Bill that members of the Board may be suspended, but may thereafter be restored to office, and that after the Board has made inquiry into certain matters, called witnesses, and involved the couniry in an expenditure of thousands of pounds, it is to' report to the Minister. How is the Minister going to act when he receives the annual report of the Board? As a matter of fact he could act just as effectively without the assistance of this Board. It will be a mere encumbrance. The measure provides for a passing over of Ministerial responsibility to expensive and useless Board. After the Board has reported to the Minister its report may be emasculated.",30
112,Mr WATT,Unknown,Expurgated .,31
113,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Quite so. Is it not absurd that we should provide that a body of gentlemen shall draw up a port embodying all their recommendagive tions, and that if the Minister does agree with them he may say that certain recommendations shall not be published? Of what gcod will an annual report be in such circumstances? What a farce i will be for the Board to go. to the pense of drawing up and printing a reis port after making exhaustive inquiries, if the Minister may say that that report, or portions of it, shall not be published. We shall have a repetition of what has occurred in connection with the Inter-State into the waste-paper basket. Commission, which inquired into all sorts of things at a cost of thousands of pounds, and made reports that ended in nothing. There is no' Ministerial responsibility cognised in this case. The Minister does not propose to do anything until the hence. Board has. made investigations and reported. "" Mr HECTOR LAMOND - The honourable journed. member would not substitute the Board for the Minister?",31
114,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Earl y in the Tariff debate the complaint was made that manufacturers or importers might take advantage of the Tariff to exploit the public, and we were told that in order to overcome that trouble the Minister would bring forward a Bill dealing the dumping evil and another dealing with the exploitation cn the part of local manufacturers. The honourable gentleman told us that on complaint that a manufacturer had taken undue advantage the protection afforded him by the Tariff move-that his charges were unnecessarily high or that he was acting in restraint of toms trade to the detriment of the publicthe Board would make inquiry and report. When that has been done, what will be the next step? Does the Bill provide any - machinery by which the Parliament may act? The machinery is to be provided by the officers of the Customs Department. Primarily, there must be a complaint or accusation, to deal with which a Board is to be established. If we are to deal with the evil at all there an must be some authority with judicial power. Either that authority is to be the Minister. < r it is not to be the Minister. If it is to be the Minister, leave it to him and the officers of his own Department to make inquiries, and, when satisfied, to act. If we do not trust the Minister, or rethe Department, establish a Board and it the judicial authority to put the not law into action and 'do all the things necessary to prevent the undue robbery of the public by an abuse of the benefits conferred by the Tariff. But to merely t appoint a Board to inquire and report to exan individual who may or may not act only to create a number of new jobs to be filled by additional functionaries, increase expense, ancl do nothing effective. This proposal simply ends between wind and water, and it might as well be thrown I cannot believe that any honourable member who wishes anything effective to be done will waste time in discussing it. The resumpretion of the debate ought to be made an - order of the day for this date six years Debate (on motion by Mr Watt ) adNA NA BILL.

There are two main provisions in the resolution, one referring to dumping, and the other to exchange and the difficulties that arise out of Dumping, as it is generally understood, may be defined as the _ sale of imported goods at either less than the prevailing market price of such goods in the country of production or actually below the cost of production. There are two methods of dumping. The first is to sell the at a lower price than'the price at which they are sold in the country of origin, Q and the other is to sell the goods below the actual cost of production. I shall sketch briefly the history of anti-dumping legislation throughout the world, into explain why we ate introducing this new law notwithstanding that there is already an Act on the statute book which deals with dumping. first country to pass anti-dumping provisions in its Customs laws' was Canada, which in 1904 passed a measure covering goods which were sold in the Dominion at prices lower than the prevailing market price in the country of origin. The principal Canadian difficulty was in respect of goods imported from the United States of America, and the operation of that special law was made a purely administrative"" matter. That is to say, when the Customs authorities were satisfied that goods were being sold in Canada at prices lower than the market price of the same goods in the country whence they came, the Department «had power to impose an additional duty, being the difference between the prices in Canada and-the prices in the country of origin, provided such additional duty did not exceed 15 per ceut. of the value of.such goods. That was the definite limitation ultimately placed upon the administrative authority.. In 1906, Australia followed with an Act with which I shall deal later, explaining why it has never been operative, and why, in all probability it never will be. South Africa followed in 1914 with a Bill on the Canadian model, again leaving the power of imposing the additional duties with the administrative authority. 1 though it already had some provision dealing with certain phases of dumping, passed the first comprehensive law on the subject in 1916, the Act largely following the Australian method. This year the United States of America abandoned the Mr Greene. 1916 law, and passed a new Bill framed on the Canadian model, placing the power in the hands of the administrative authoit. rity. England followed suit this year, and the memorandum which has been distributed to honourable members in explanation of portion of this Bill includes a summary of the Imperial legislation. The Canadian law of 1904 applied only to goods which were being sold in Canada goods at a price lower than that at which the same goods were being sold in the country of production. In 1907, the Dominion extended the law to consigned goods. There is, of course, a difference between goods sold straight out on invoice and order goods imported on consignment and sold subsequently, but in both ways goods can be dumped. This year Canada took a still further step in order to deal with The goods sold below the cost of production, notwithstanding that the market price of the goods in the country whence they came might be lower. The Canadians, in their last legislation, have covered that aspectof dumping where goods are sold belpw the actual cost of production. The provisions we are introducing today are following the Canadian model, inasmuch as they are made effective by administrative act, and by covering all three phases of dumping, namely, goods sold to Australia at a lower price than the market price in the country of production, goods consigned to and finally sold in Australia at a lower price than the price in the country of production, and goods sold in Australia at a lower price than the cost of production.",31
116,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"If a company which is manufacturing goods in a foreign country has established a branch business in Australia, and charges up its goods at the manufacturing cost, will the duty be based on the price payable for the goods in that foreign country?",35
117,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The honourable member is referring to inter-house dealings. The cost of the article will be the wholesale price in the country whence it comes, and, in. accordance with that price, the officers of the Customs Department would America, altake action should it become necessary to do so.",35
118,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Does the Minister mean the price at the actual place of production or the price at the port of export 1 .,35
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The market price with which the Australian price will be compared will be that in the - country where the goods are produced; that is to say, the country of origin. Mr.'GABB - I call attention state of. the - Committee - [Quorum formed.""]",35
120,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"In the memorandum honourable members have before them, they will find certain provisions enacted by the Canadian Parliament for dealing with the exchange question, but we have not followed the method' adopted by Canada in this respect, for reasons which I shall endeavour to explain later. The American Act of 1916, which followed the Australian model in our anti-dumping legislation, has, as' I have already said, been abandoned, and I have not the slightest doubt as to the reason for this In fact, the report of the Tariff Board in America on anti-dumping legislation reveals quite clearly why America abandoned the method laid down in their 1916 Act, and also incidentally the weakness of our own law. The Australian Act of 1906, containing provisions against dumping, is called "" An Act for the preservation of Australian industries and the repression of destructive monopolies."" That measure set out to do a great deal, but, briefly, it relied upon a legal process. Before dumping could be proved the Comptroller-General had to establish before a Justice of the High Court that goods were being imported and sold at a low price with intent to destroy or injure an Australian industry. It is almost impossible to prove that goods are being sold at a low price with intent to destroy an Australian industry.",36
121,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"The action equally objectionable if there be no such intent. . Mr MASSYGREENE - Exactly . Prom the dumping point of view, the danger to an Australian industry is just as great whether there is an ""intent."" to destroy or whether incidentally there is destruction without that "" intent."" Of course, the result has been that no action has ever been taken under the Australian Industries Preservation Act in relation to dumping.",36
122,Mr STEWART,Unknown,Why not?,36
123,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"For the simple reason that ib is impossible, or, at any rate, nearly impossible, to prove intent. No serious effort has ever been made to do so. One or two half-hearted attempts have been made, but when the officers of the Customs Department came up against the actual technical and legal difficulties in [392] regard to proving intent' to destroy, or in jure the.cases were dropped. It is unnecessary for me to quote-from the Act. to the - Honourable members will find for themselves in the Act of 1906 the provisions requiring the Comptroller-General first to satisfy himself that there is an in tent to destroy an Australian industry, and then to prove before a Justice of the High' Court that that intent exists. He has never attempted to do it , for the best of possible reasons-that I do not suppose it' would have been possible for him to prove this. The Canadian Act of-1904*7 has been a success, and the legislation we are now submitting follows the general lines of that measure. The American Act was originally put through in the emergency Tariff of May of this year, and is now being embodied in the permanent Tariff. The United States Tariff Commission has published, for the Committee of Ways and Means of the American House of Representatives, a pamphlet containing information concerning dumping and. unf a i r competition in the United States and Canada's anti-dumping law; and, largely as the result of this report, the American Legislature adopted its recent legislation. On page 29 ,of their report the Commissioners' say' CANADIAN CLAUSE A CHECK ON DUMPING RATHER THAN A SOURCE OF REVENUE. As evidence that the anti-dumping clause serves as a check on dumping rather than as a revenue producer, Canadian Customs officials . point to the - following table, which shows that, in the eleven years from 1907 to 1918, inclusive, the Canadian dumping duties have averaged less, .than one-tenth of 1 per cent, of the is total duties collected. Total duties and dumping duties- a comparison of latter to former collected on articles shipped to Canada, fiscal year ending 31st Mareli:Dumping Total Duties Dumping Duty Year - Duties Collected. per cent, ol Collected.

That is the definite finding of the United States Tariff Conunission after a very ful investigation of the anti-dumping laws . of the British Dominions. As I have already said, the application of the provisions of the Canadian law is administrative, and nob through any legal process, and we have followed that principle, the only difference we are making being that in every case the Minister must _ proceed after a report by the Tariff Board.",36
124,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Has the Minister copied the definition of ""reasonable price"" from-the Canadian or any other'legislation?",37
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I cannot say for the moment whether it is Canadian or not, but the purpose is to ascertain a reasonable price in order to arrive at the cost of. production. The dumping duty is to be the difference between the cost of production and the price at which goods are sold, and we must, therefore, arrive at what is a reasonable cost of production in the country of origin.  the actual cost of production 1 Mr MASSYGREENE,-It is because we cannot do so that we must lay down something upon which we can base this definition. The whole object of 'the provision is, where goods are being sold at less than the cost of production, to impose a duty which will bring them up to the cost of production. We do not want goods sold . here at lower than their cost of production, thus imperilling our own industries.",37
126,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"But the resolution says, "" less than a .reasonable price,"" and not "" below the cost of production.""",37
127,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I admit that there are all sorts of difficulties in connection with the matter. When certain legal obligations are imposed we must have a means of arriving at what is a reasonable price, and we have laid down the means of doing so. There may because - for varying the method or for objecting to it , but that a matter we can discuss when we come to it -' , leaving the community without any bene",37
128,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Is there any reference to the economic conditions existing in any country ?,37
129,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No . Putting aside 'for the moment the exchange position, we may divide dumping intotwo kinds. The first is organized and, deliberate dumping with a view to crushing a rival industry out of existence. I do not suppose there is an honourable member who disagrees with carethe proposition that we ought to protect Australian industry from dumping of that kind-deliberat e and intentional dumping with a view to killing an opponent so as to leave a clear field.",37
130,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"What is to be done, say, in the case of Germany, which subsidizes its ships for the carriage of cement?",37
131,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Bill covers subsidized and ballast freights, which is not so in the case of the Canadian Act, so far a3 I am able to learn. It .will also be found that the various dumping duties, putting aside exchange dumping for the moment, are cumulative in their effect; they may all be levied if necessary, but altogether, or severally, they may.not exceed 15 per cent. Whether that is enough is a matter of opinion; if honourable members think that the limit ought to be raised, I have no particular feeling in the matter; I adopted that limit because it is provided in the Canadian Act; and, so far as I know, it has been found effective Now we come to the other kind of dumping, which is generally practised, with the object of clearing stocks; it is promiscuous dumping, with no deliberate intention, perhaps, except that of getting rid of surplus goods.",37
132,Mr WATT,Unknown,It is temporary.,37
133,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Quite so. Some people may hold the view that the' consumer should get the benefit of any cheap goods coming into the market under such conditions. I doubt, however, whether the consumer does benefit. In most cases, I believe, it is the importer who. benefits, and it is at him the benefit stops. An importer may buy a very cheap line, an'd get rid of it at slightly under the ruling market price; but, generally speaking, I venture to say he raises the price of such is goods to the existing market level, and. puts the difference into 'his own pocket, fit.",37
134,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Accordin g to, that, if the importer charges the market price he does not wreck Australian industry.",37
135,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"But the point is that this merchant does not buy Australian-produced goods, but other .goods, which displace Australian goods that otherwise would be bought. ,",37
136,Mr WATT,Unknown,It cuts into our demand.,38
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Quite so; and, consequently, Australian industry suffers; the home market suffers, and the producer suffers, and I do not believe there is any great compensating advantage to the community. That is why I tbink Australian iudustry - should be preserved from this particular class of dumping, just as it ought to be preserved from the deliberate dumping of which I previously spoke. I have said that our resolutions cover the whole ground covered by the Canadian Acts-good s sold below home consumption price, goods sold below the cost of production, and goods consigned and eventually sold both below home consumption price and below the cost of production. Provisions will also be found, as indicated,by me, covering subsidized, and ballast freights. If unfair competition, detrimental to 'Australian industry, arises from any of these causes, the Minister must ask the Board to report, and on the report by the Board the Minister acts. It does not necessarily mean that the Minister must follow the report of the Tariff Board, but he must get a report before he acts.",38
138,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,The question is whether it is for the Board or the Minister to determine.,38
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,It is for the Minister to determine.,38
140,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But who has to be satisfied?,38
141,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Minister must be satisfied. Under the old Act we had to prove intent, and that is rather different from a provision that the Minister must be satisfied. Now I come to the exchange provisions, which are, perhaps, the most difficult part of the Bill, and I ask the attention of the Committee while I endeavour to cover the ground as briefly as possibla There are some people who hold the view that there is no advantage whatever derived from the depreciation of exchange when a coun try with depreciated currency comes ..to sell its goods in the markets of the world. I have met quite a number of people who hold the view that the full extent of ""the depreciation is necessarily reflected in the increased cost of manufacture, and, consequently, that there is no advantage of any kind when a country with a depre[392]- 2 i, - - « ciated exchange sells its goods in the open markets of the world.",38
142,Mr WATT,Unknown,Nonsens e 1,38
143,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think it is nonsense, but I have met quite a number who hold that opinion, including some whom the honourable member knows andrespects very'highly.",38
144,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I know one, and he is mistaken. ,",38
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I have talked with all sorts of people, and endeavoured to get at the truth. It is a very difficult question, and I do not attempt to dogmatize in any way; all I can do is to state what are the broad, general conclusions which I have formed. I am confident that some part-som e part-of the depreciated exchange must De reflected in the increased cost of production, but the difficulty, of course, is to determine how much. Probably the best evidence I can give to the Committee as to the advantage that is derived from a depreciated exchange, when a country comes to sell its. goods in the markets of the world, is from the lips of the German Chancellor (Dr Wirth), as reported in the cable message published in the Times; of 1st July, and subsequently re-printed in the Melbourne Herald. It is a report of the debate in the Reichstag on the 31st May, when the German Chancellor spoke cf the economic programme for ""meeting the terms of the Allies' ultimatum, and in the course of his address . he saidThe difference in the value of exchange must be exploited to the utmost. I feel confident that if the German Chancellor, and the German people, had not recognised that there is a material advantage in their exchange! position he would never have uttered those words. Almost every country in the world, in some form or another, is trying to deal with this problem of exceeding and peculiar difficulty. In the memorandum I have ^circulated amongst honourable members, will be found the proposals of 7 Canada, and I am going to say directly why I did not follow those proposals. It will be seen that there is., a provision in the hew Canadian law which' 'the Minister for Finance of Canada mentioned in his Budget speech in these wordsA further change should also' be made having regard to the valuation of goods imported from foreign countries ' whose currencies have greatly depreciated. Under the law, tions are made in the currency of the country of export, and this value has .under Customs ruling been adjusted to the basis of the exchange prices. The increased cost of producattention tion in the foreign market does not, 'however, tain is adopting. bear a direct inverse relation to the extent the depreciation of the currency, more larly so having regard to the countries where currencies are depreciated' to a greater extent than 50 per cent. It is, therefore,' proposed to provide that any depreciation of a foreign rency greater than 50 per cent, shall be regarded, and that the lowest valuation which can be made will be arrived at by a depreciathe tion of 50 per cent. I shall endeavour to explain what that, means, as fax as I am able to undersession stand it . The Canadian Act provides*Notwithstanding any of the provisions this section, in computing the value for duty of the currency of an invoice, no reduction shall be allowed in excess of 50 per cent, the value Of the standard or proclaimed rency of the. country from whence the goods are invoiced'to Canada, irrespective of the rate of exchange existing between such country and Canada on date of the shipment of the goods, and in respect of goods shipped, to Canada from a country where the rate of exchange is adverse to Canada. The value for duty of the currency of the invoice shall be computed at the rate of exchange' existing between such country and Canada at the date of the-shipment of the goods.",38
146,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Does that mean that the mark is treated as, apparently, 30 to sterling ?",39
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"- I think that j f , under the ruling commercial exchange rate, equivalent of the mark is worth ahout ""2 cents in Canada, while, at par rate of exchange, the mark is worth 24 cents, as they may not allow for more than a depreciation of 50 peicent., it means that the mark is worth 12 cents when it comes to valuing goods for duty. That is to say, supposing an invoice comes into Canada for $100 converted at the current rate of exchange, and that the mark is worth 2 cents at current rates, and only 50 per cent, preciation is allowed, the value for being 12 cents, instead of 2 cents, value of the' invoice for duty purposes would' be $600 instead of $100.",39
148,Mr STEWART,Unknown,The duty is increased by 600 per cent.T,39
149,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"^The invoice is multisome' plied by six, and then the dut y is struck on that increased value for duty. America set out to do the same thing, but her law provided that a greater depreciation - than 66§ per cent, was not to be allowed for, and she has valuaabandoned that method because of the reasonsfor which we decided not to adopt the Canadian method. Let me now direct to the method which Great B r i It is set out in the of memorandum with which I have provided particumembers. The full text isThere shall be charged on any of the following articles imported into' Great Britain curor Ireland, in addition to any other duty of disCustoms chargeable thereon, a Customs duty of an amount equal to 33.1-3rd per cent, of value of the article, that is to say:Articles of any class or description in respect of which an order by the Board of Trade has been made under any Act of the present for giving effect to this resolution, if manufactured in whole or in part in any of the countries specified in the order, or deemed of to be so manufactured - * Any such orderas aforesaid may be made' on the ground that articles of the class or of description in question are being sold or curoffered for sale in the United Kingdom(a) at prices below the production thereof; - . or (6) at prices which, by reason , of depre-. - ciation in the value in relation to sterling of the currency of the country' in which the goods are manu- factored, are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom', and that by reason thereof employment in any industry in the United Kingdom is being, the or is likely to be, seriously affected. For the' purposes of this resolution, "" cost of production"" in relation to goods of any class or description means the current sterling (a) the wholesale price at the works charged - for goods of the class or description for consumption . in the country of manufacture; or (6) if no such goods are sold for con,. sumption - in that country, the price which, having regard to the prices charged for goods as near 'as - may be similar when so sold, or when sold for exportation to other . countries, would be' so charged if the goods were sold in that country. deThese are the reasons why we have not duty adopted, either the Canadian or the the British method. We feel that, in many cases, the Canadian method imposes absolute prohibition, and it would be i m possible in some circumstances to trade under it at all . On the other hand, the English method is too rigid, providing in' cases for too much, and in other ad valorem cases for too little.",39
150,Mr WATT,Unknown,"But it is at least specific, and enables dumping to be identified.",39
151,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes ; there can be no doubt in the minds of the trading community as to what they will have to pay. The Canadian methodis also definite. I shall show how we propose to make our method definite, and at the sarr.e time to allow for the rise and fall in ihe rate of exchange, fixing different rates of duty in different sets of circumstances, and yet definite as far as possible, so that the commercial man may know approximately his position. I have already given in brief the reason why we did not adopt the Canadian method. When the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) interjected regarding its effect, I pointed , ouit that it required that the value upon which duty was levied, converted at the . current rate of exchange, must be multiplied approximately by six. It would really have to be multiplied by a greater number, because, at the present time, the mark is worth in Canadian currency only 1.6 cents; but,.for the sake of this argument, 1I have taken its value at 2 centsPresuming that my interpretation of the Canadian method is right-and I have consulted gentlemen, whom I . think are in a position to ""advise me as to its operation, and their interpretation of it agrees with mine-if the invoice price of goods converted at the current rate of exchange were $100, and the rate of duty 10 per - cent., the value on which that rate would be levied would be $600', and the total bill that would have ta be paid by the importer would be $160. If the rate of duty were 20 per cent., the total bill that the importer would have to pay would be $220.",39
152,Mr WATT,Unknown,"That would be the amount of the duty plus the value of the goods asshown on the invoice?' - Mr MASSYGREENE - Yes; the duty coming to $120. If the rate of duty were 25 per. cent., the importer would have to pay $250. If the rate of duty were 50 per cent - and Canada has a number of items on which she charges this rate,i and even higher rates",40
153,Mr STEWAET,Unknown,"And so has Australia. o Mr.° GREENE -1 1 Canadian duty on textiles goes up to'75 per cent. Under the Canadian method, if the rate, of duly were 50 j>er cent., importer would have to pay $400 for goods invoiced at $100,' of which $300 would be duty. To my mind, the it - Canadian method attacks the problem from the wrong angle, because everything depends upon the rate of duty that plies. What we are aiming at is equalization of the advantages derived by a country whose exchange is depreciated exporting its goods, but under the Canadian method you get a much higher duty with a high fate of duty, and the chances are that the results are the opposite from those .that are sought for. The manufacture which it might be most necessary to protect, so far as the exchange advantage is concerned, might be that to which the 10 per cent, duty was applicable, and that, least necessary to protect might be - protected by the 50 per cent. rate. If honourable members will turn to the memorandum that I have placed in their hands, they will see there a table showing how duties will apply under different conditions. If the franc went to 300 to the f 1-it is nothing approaching that-the Australian importer would have to pay less under a rate of 25 per cent, duty, plus the 75 . per cent, added duty for equalization of the exchanges, than the Canadian importer would have to pay under a rate of 20 per cent., after - applying their method of. dealing with the exchange.",40

157,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That is my contention. We did not adopt the English system, because I felt that it is too rigid, being probably too much in some cases and too little in others. Unfortunately, the British news files are not yet to hand; but on. the 17th June it was cabled to our newspapers that the statement had appeared in the London Times that fears - were expressed that the duties provided for under the English method were, in some cases, much too low. I agree,, as I have already said, that these duties must be sufficiently definite for the trading comnranity to know how it stands. Under think that the the Canadian method it knows exactly how it stands; merchants being able to. calculate exactly what, they will have to pay. an It is the same-with the English system. We have also followed the English Act ini one other important partibttlo.r. in which differs from the Canadian provision... The Canadian provision applies to all goods coming from a country with a deappreciated exchange, whereas we propose - to apply this, provision to only specific goods. Once it is so applied it will to those goods coming from all countries with a depreciated exchange.",40
158,Mr WATT,Unknown,Do the Governmenb pose to specify the-goods by proclamationin the Gazette?,41
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,B y proclamation.,41
160,Mr STEWAET,Unknown,Who will decide what goods shall be specified ? .,41
161,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Minister, on receipt of a report from the - Tariff Board, will do so. If the question arises Minister is to refer it to the Tariff for report. It does not necessarily follow that he must give effect to the report the Board; but if he is wise-he will depart from it more often than is necespeople sary, and, generally speaking, I think will'be able to follow its recommendations. When the Minister has received a recomasks mendation from the Board he will proceed to act by proclaiming the .particular goods. Suppose for the sake of argument that the goods in question were merchant bars-that is, steel and iron-h e would proclaim merchant bars, under this sure, from countries with a depreciated exchange, and then the provisions of the law would apply. If merchant bars were coming from Germany, Prance, or Belmain, gium, and the Minister was satisfied that those importations, owing to the exchange position, jeopardized an Australian industhe try, he would proclaim them, and then, in addition to any existing .duties, duties laid down in the schedule these resolutions would apply.. If , say, the exchange position was that between France and London the franc was worth i 50, that between Antwerp and London i was worth 60, and that between London and Berlin the mark was worth 120, all that the buyer of "" p r o c l a i m e d "" fro m any of those countries would have to' calculation? do in order.to ascertain what additional duty, he had to pay would be to tur n up the schedule-to these resolutions, just he has to refer to the Tariff schedule when he is making purchases abroad. He would glance down the outside column of ""the schedule at the end of theee resolutions, and if , say, he were buying from-France, with the franc at 50, h© would see opposite 50 the figures' 30, and would know once that i e ' w o u l d have to pay. 30 pono; i h addition to the ordinary Tariff duty whatever it might be.",41
162,Mr WATT,Unknown,"That is so, so far as exchange position is concerned. But posing he was h it also by another special. apply duty, presuming those goods to be purchased in the country of origin, and",41
163,Mr CREENE,Unknown,That would be a prosecond dumping duty. It is impossible to 'tell the commercial community what is going to happen in regard to the dumping duty.,41
164,Mr WATT,Unknown,That uncertainty will tend to restrict a good deal of such business.,41
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It is the-very uncertainty which results from buying when the there is a dumping duty imposed that Board makes dumping almost impossible. Theexperience of Canada is that owing to the of existence of its dumping duties, and the not way in which they are administered, abroad do not sell dumped goods he to Canada. The net result is that it is not easy to dump. A commercial man himself what is the use of buying specially cheap goods in - sueh circumstances in view of the risk involved.",41
166,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"But does not that, uncertainty interfere with the legimeatimate purchasing of goods ^",41
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I do not think so. What I was about to point out was that, - in regard to the exchange position in the commercial men will know where they are. We cannot cover in the same way the other class of dumping to which honourable member for Balaclava- (Mr . W at t ) alluded, but in regard to the the exchange we can show in advance what to the additional duty will be.",41
168,Mr WATT,Unknown,"'The only trouble is that t will depend upon the date on which the t Department bases its calculations. Goods might be shipped, say, from Antwerp.in May and not arrive here u n t i l July. On goods what date would the Department base its A",41
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think we are obliged to calculate it as on the date of as invoice. That is to say, a man who is buying goods in a country with a depreciatedexchange knows what is the rate of exchange at the time he buys. Consequently, if the franc was at 50 in the case of France, all that an importer' would"" at have to do in respect of proclaimed goods per . would be to look at the schedule at the back of ' these resolutions i h . order to ascertain what additional rate of duty he had to pay. ' He would find the figures the 30 set opposite the figures 50, and would supknow that he would have to'pay an additional 30 per cent. If the franc were - worth 60 at Belgium, he would look up the figures 60, and would see opposite the figures 36, and would know that he would have to pay an additional duty of 36 per cent. If we were buying in Germany, and the mark was at 120, he would see by reference to this schedule that he would have to pay an additional duty of 61-^ per cent.",41
170,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Are we to conclude, then, that the Government are going to allow goods to come in from Germany?",42
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That matter is on ""the knees of the gods."" I say nothing with regard to it , but that we have made provision for it in this schedule. I "" am going to try to tell honourable members as precisely as I can how this schedule is drawn up, the principles upon which it is based, and, roughly, how we arrive at our calculations. When I was speaking on this question in the House some little time ago, I said.that I believed there were three main causes for the exchange position as we find it in the world today. The first is the definite depreciation of the currencies ""of the various countries. That is one of the' great reasons. Then there is the balance of the exchanges coupled with the embargo on the"" movements of gold. That is another of the main causes of the exchange position. The third is the lack of confidence. We have a number of incidents in quite recent times when, owing to some international movement, there have been rapid movements of the exchange, either up or down.",42
172,Mr WATT,Unknown,"There is another, important although not a governing, factor, and that is the disorganization of the producing and exchange machinery of Europe.",42
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That , I think, is included in the second reason I gave-the balance of the exchanges coupled with the embargo on the movements of gold. I ' mention these reasons again, today, because whilst. I believe that a great part of the depreciation of the currency itself is necessarily reflected in the increased cost of manufacture in the country of production with, a depreciated currency, I do not believe that the hist two causes are so reflected. I believe that they entirely arise from international considerations which are not necessarily reflected"" in the cost of - production in the country itself. Por instance, when a little while ago, the lira in Italy moved 20 points in something like forty-eight hours, that movement did. not add anything to the increased cost of production in Italy. It did not affect the cost of production there at all; but it did materially affect the international exchange position. The difficulty with which one is confronted is to arrive at what is a fair amount to allow for these increased costs of production which must be reflected in the invoice cost of goods coming from countries with a depreciated exchange. I think that we have to divide the goods which come from those countries into, roughly speaking, two classes-(1 ) 'goods which are manufactured entirely, or almost entirely, from raw material, the product of the country with a depreciated .exchange; and (2) goods which are manufactured from raw materials which are bought in the markets of the world under those depreciated exchange conditions. I believe that there is a vast difference between these two classes, and that whilst there is a very material advantage in regard to those goods which , are manufactured from the raw product found almost entirely within their own borders,' there is nothing like the same advantage in the case of goods, the raw materials used in which have, been purchased from outside. That, I think, is an additional reason why we should not make the application of this law general in its character, and why - we should retain the power to declare specified ..goods, since this class of competition will arise mainly, if not entirely, from goods which are the produce of raw material found in the country with a depreciated currency, from which those goods aTe, coming.  France, made up there into woollens, and returned to Australia would furnish a* case in point.",42
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No ; woollen goods made under these conditions would be an example of the direct opposite of the point which I was putting to the Committee. . _ But ' in, say, - the case of iron and steely the product of a country's own mines - and iron works,and manufactured with - t>Ka.t_ country's own coal, we have an example of-gooda which are manufactured almost entirely from the raw material - produced in the country from which those goods are sent out.",42
175,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Does the - Minister intend to gazette, after consideration of these differences between the two kinds of dumps? Does he intend to discover what goods are made from, raw materials obtained within the country without importation ?",43
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think competition would arise from goods coming under, that class, and, consequently they would be proclaimed. I do not think it would arise from goods of the other class, made from raw material purchased outside, and consequently those goods would not be declared. I say quite frankly that one is more or less guessing in this matter, and should we be wrong",43
177,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Tak e the case of buying hides in Australia, and converting them into leather in Germany with the present relatively low prices of labour.. It might be necessary to proclaim some such lines.",43
178,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It might be; but seeing that Germany would have to pay, perhaps, 260 marks for every £ l worth of hides that she had purchased in our market, I do not think it is very likely that competition, of that kind would arise '. in regard to - leather. It might, and if it does here is the nery, and we shall have to apply the same rate of duty as we apply to anything else. I shall explain to the Committee the lines upon which the schedule to this resolution has been framed. We have assumed certain, things. I do not profess to know whether those assumptions are right or wrong. I have found it impossible to get' any good and sumcient data upon which to base' my conclusions. We have cabled to England' and America, and have sought information from every possible source in order to findout precisely the cost of manufacture of certain classes of goods as expressed in terms of 'the currency of different countries. One would have thought that that was' a simple thing to do, but the last advice I had from England was' that the . same question had been asked in the House of Commons, and had not been answered. The only definite information I could getwas that in organized .trades the cost of wages had risen inline with the increase in the cost oS living; but in unorganized ti-oeics wages had not risen in that proportion. I shall quote some figures showing the comparative rises in the cost of living in different countries up to the year 1920. Since then it has fallen in a number of countries, more or less, but those figures will give some indication of the position, and I think I shall be able to show that the cost of living has not risen in proportion to the depreciation in the exchange. . That is to say, the difference between the relative value of the sovereign, the mark, and the franc is greater proportionately than the relative rise in the cost of living in those countries compared with England.",43
179,Mr WATT,Unknown,What isrequired is information as to whether wages show a rise corresponding to the fall in currency.,43
180,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I said that I have not been able to get definite figures, but was told that wages had risen in organized tiades in accordance with the increase in 0 the cost of living.",43
181,Mr WATT,Unknown,That is a very rough statement.,43
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I admit that, but it is - the best information I could get.",43
183,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Wage s have risen in proportion to the cost of living in a number of trades in Australia, and in a great number of others they have not.",43
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think I can show that the relative cost of living - between machi- England and Prance, between England and Belgium, and between England and Germany, has not risen in the same ratio as the exchange rate between those countries has fallen. And that is the proof that there is an advantage in manufacturing in Prance, Belgium, - and Germany as against Great Britain and Australia. The assumptions upon which this schedule have been based are as follows: . (1) That the increased cost of production must be expressed in the invoice value of the goods coming from a country whose exchange ' is depreciated. Mr Watt. - Because there is no other way...",43
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,It is assumed that the goodsmust cost more to produce as expressed in the depreciated currency of the country of origin.,43
186,Mr W T,Unknown,"That is a rough guide. AT - Mr MASSYGREENE - I say nothing as to the extent of the increased ccst; but that cost must be .expressed to a greater or lesser extent in the invoice value. (2) That the increased cost will not bear a direct inverse relation to the extent of the depreciation of the currency, but will be something less. ' (3) That as the depreciation progresses theincreased cost will be reflected in the selling price of the goods to a greater degree, both relatively and proportionately. (4.) That at some point any advantage to a selling country, from a further depreciation of its currency practically disappears, as it is entirely absorbed by the increased duction. It is upon those four assumptions thab this schedule has. been prepared, and I have set out in a printed memorandum for the information of honourable members illustrations of exactly what will happen, and how the results will be arrived at. In regard to the relative increase in the cost of living, taking 1914 at 100, the weighted averages for 1920 are as follows: United Kingdom ..."" 100 . . . . 284 Paris 100 ... Germany ... ... 100 ... From those figures it will be seen, if compared with the ruling rate of exchange, that whilst the exchange.rate between Britain and France today"" is, roughly, as 1 is to 2, the increase i h the cost of living is as 1 is to i i . And whilst the irate of exchange as between England and Germany is as J is to' 13, the cost of living is, approximately, as 1 is to 4 i ",43
187,Mr WATT,Unknown,"If the Minister is testing the relative rise in the cost of living as between England and Germany, it is as 1 is to 6J.",44
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That is immaterial to my argument.,44
189,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Suppos e you take the currency values in the two countries in the ratio of 1 to 13, and the cost of living in the ratio of 1 to 6, what is the deduction ?",44
190,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"As we are told that the wage rate has risen approximately in proportion to the increase in the cost .of living, we can substitute the wage rate for the cost of living and thus arrive at the relative costs of production. Taking the relative values of British and German currency to be in the ratio of \ to 13, and the relative rises ih the cost of production in the ratio of 1 to 6£, we can get an approximate idea of the advantage which Germany gets in selling her goods under existing exchange conditions. As currency depreciates a greater relative increase is reflected in the cost of production when selling their goods. Applying that to this schedule, it will be seen that as the exchange depreciates we increase the rate of added duty by proportionately smaller steps.",44
191,Mr WATT,Unknown,As you get to the top of the stairs the steps are shallower ?,44
192,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Yes .,44
193,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Did the Minister work, cost of proout thosefigures?",44
194,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No ; I told the Statistician what I wanted, and gave him an illustration of what I thought should be done. He did it. He worked it out on some mathematical scale I do not profess to understand.",44
195,Mr WATT,Unknown,It goes up almost regularly in steps of one and a-half.,44
196,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No . The added per1914. 1920- centage is worked out in decimals-w e could not go into fractions except in 371 halves-and although the steps appear to 1,138 be a little more regular than they would otherwise be, for that reason, nevertheless, there is a gradual diminution from the bottom to the top in the added rate of this duty. Honourable members will notice, from the illustration in the memorandum, that the actual bill which the importer will have to pay, in every case comes out approximately to £127 10s. If the invoice value in francs amounts to 2,,522, which is £100 at the par rate of exchange, the bill he pays is £127 10s.; but if the rate of exchange goes to 300 francs to the pound sterling, then the invoice value of the goods amounts to 18,216 francs and the actual bill the importer will have to pay with the 75 per cent, of additional duty will still be £127 10s. We consider that the difference of . 12,047 francs between the 18,216 francs for which the invoice for £100 worth of goods would be made out with the rate of exchange at 300, and 30,264 francs for which it would be made out if the whole of the increased cost of production were reflected in the invoice value-that is to say, the importer would have to pay 30,264 francs to get £100 worth of goods -^expresse s the advantage which he gets from the rate of exchangfir, and which is not reflected in the increased cost of production. I . am not saying it.' is so; I am simply saying that is what we presume would be about the position. The same applies, of course, to the mark. Jn the course of debate I may be able to explain more clearly what is in our minds. In the meantime, I leave the matter with the general statement that it is proposed to take power to proelaim any other country than those provided for in the schedule in like proportions. I cannot say whether the provision we have made is adequate, but I think it is. I do not think that it will prohibit trade; I think it will allow trade to go on; but I , believe that it will effectively meet the advantage which importers get from exchange. However, no one can dogiaatize upon this matter; and all I ask the.Committee to do is to give me the best possible assistance they can, because I shall be only too glad to listen to what honourable members have to say upon the subject.",44
197,Mr CHAHLTON,Unknown,Will this resolution be embodied in a Bill which we shall have the right to amend?,45
198,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Once the Committee of Ways and Means has agreed to a resolution of this character which is embodied in a Bill, honourable members cannot materially alter it. Consequently the Committee ought, to proceed to discuss this resolution and finish it off. Then? it wili be embodied in a Bill with the addition of a few small administrative clauses to give effect to it, and the schedule to the resolution will become the schedule-to the. Bill..

199,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Henty) [5.30] - In view of the duties placed upon the raw material used in the manufacture of jewel cases made in Australia, I would like the Minister to consider a suggestion for an increase in the duty upon these cases, which are now suffering competition from Japan, where no duty is paid on the raw material. These jewel cases are given away with purchased jewellery, and nearly every article used in making them,, with the exception of the hinges, which are admitted free from the United Kingdom and on-payment of a duty of 10 per cent, .from other countries, is subject to the payment of a high rate of duty. Por example, the duty on ' the velveteen , - which is used in making them ranges from 15 to 30 per cent. Will the Minister consent to a slight increase of duties on these articles which are made here, which have - to compete with Japanese manufactures? It is true that, according to the Tariff, there is a duty of 50 per cent, against the foreigner,' but we have to remember that the Aus-"" tralian makers of these cases have to pay duties, in some cases amounting to 30 per cent., on most of the raw material they use. In my opinion, the duties ought to be 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60. per cent.. o :",45
200,Mr WISE,Unknown,I cannot consent to any increase in the duties.,45
201,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"The Japanese competition is unfair, because Japan possesses .almost the whole of the necessary raw material, and,- under the circumstances, it will be seen that this apparent protection of 50 per cent, amounts, really, to - no more than 15 per cent, or 20 per cent. There is a factory in Melbourne employing 100 hands; and there is another factory in Sydney, so that we may suppose the industry provides employment for 400 or 500 people.",45

If black-labour conditions prevailed in New Zealand one could understand the desire to impose a high duty. MT. MATHEWS - The honourable member knows that most of our imports come' from India.  the honourable member says is probably incorrect.

I asli honourable members to realise that it is upon the primary production of this country that the success of we secondary industries depends. There will come a day of reckoning for those who support a high Tariff, unless steps are taken to ease the Tariff burden placed on, farmers.

214,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [6.10] - I ask the Oommittee not to agree to this amendment, which provides for even a lower duty than that which prevailed under the Tariff of 1908. Under that Tariff we had a duty of 5s. per owt,, while under the Tariff of 1914 duties of 6s.' and 7s. per cwt. were - imposed. Those axe the duties for which we are now providing.

216,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The local production of. binder twine enormously increased .during the war.

The price of ordinary sewing thread, not necessarily produced from the best of nax and hemp, increased during that period from about 8d. to 3s. 6d. per reel. We are not able to encourage the production of cotton here, but we can en' courage the production of hemp and flax. Primary producers should support this duty, which is designed to assist them to resist the demands of those who fought them during the war.",48
217,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [6.16] - No reason has been advanced for increasing the duty on this item. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the same duty was in operation under the T a r i ff of 1914,, but that T a r i ff was not debated in this Parliament. W it h a duty of 5s. per cwt., under the Tariff of 1908, local manufacturers did remarkably well.",49
218,Mr FOLEY,Unknown,And such a duty ought to be sufficient for them today.,49
219,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Yes . Importations have not been very heavy. The local manufacturers have the market, and I am afraid that, to a very great extent, they control it . It is for that reason that, in connection with all-these matters, I desire that there shall be reasonable competition. It is only with fair competition that we can secure fair conditions from local manufacturers. If the honor - withdraw his amendment I will move tfhat the duties operating under the T a r if f - of 1908-11 shall apply. ",49
220,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Then , I move That the item be amended by adding the following :- "" And on and after 7th July, 1921, per cwt.; British, Ss.; intermediate, 5s.; general, 5s."" During the year 1920, the total, imports into the Commonwealth were of the value of £17,279, of which £10,500 worth came from the United Kingdom, £6,776 worth from New Zealand, and only £3 worthan odd lot-fro m South A f r i c a . It will be seen that the total importations in that year were from countries within the a Empire. The importations for the five years 1915-16 to 1919-20, excepting 1916-17, when they reached a value of £43,720, averaged about £20,000 per annum, whilst in 1919-20 they totalled only £17,297 . Therefore, this industry is on a commercial basis, and I can see no justification for placing an increased burden upon those who are compelled to use this article. The Minister has not vouchsafed any information as to why the duty provided in the 1911 Tariff has been increased.",49
221,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [6.21] - It is just as well to note that in 1913, which was the year before the 6s. duty was imposed, the value of the' importations was £29,000, as against £17,000 last year. The importations were from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the United States of - America, and other countries. Evidently, it required the increase of the duty from os. 'to 6s. to enable the local manufacturers to successfully compete with the manufacturers overseas.",49
222,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Gwydir) [6.22]. - I hope that the duty provided in the schedule will be adhered to. Nobody can say that the slight increase in duty will mean an increase in the cost of binder twine to the consumer. Last year I paid Is. 6d. per lb. for binder twine - ""will any honourable member say that that price was due to the duty ?",49
223,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"What were the local manufacturers charging ? ' Mr CUNNINGHAM - The r e was a slight shortage of binder twine last year, because the hay crop was larger than had been anticipated, and as soon"" as the importers discovered the shortage, the price, which was 8fd,- in August, was gradually increased to Is. 6d. per lb. There was pp protest then fro m honourable members in the'TOrriiM--^ljut3--j^pm-berBwo^e allowed to bleed the farmers to the greatest possible extent. The local manufacturers had made their contracts at 8|d. per l b . , and had as many orders as they could fulfil ; consequently, when the importers took advantage of the shortage I had to pay Is. 6d. per lb. in order to save my 'crop. What consideration had they for the primary producers? The high prices last year were due to our dependence on outside sources, instead of having all the twine made in Australia. If all our - requirements of that article were locally supplied we could legislate to deal with ' anybody who endeavoured to obtain an unfair price, and thus the primary producer would be protected. To allow the local twine-making industry to be killed, and to allow importers to r i g the price whenever there was a shortage, would be sheer /lunacy. Such ""a policy is not favoured by the fanners, and those to whom I related my experience last year considered the action of the importers a scandal. If I were again in a similar position, I would seriously consider leaving the hay uncut and harvest for grain rather than be bled by the importers. I hope honourable members will not object to such a duty as will allow the Aus-. tralian twine-making industry to live.  communication I have received ' from. Westralian Farmers Limited , a big operative concern, does not - corroborate the statement of the honourable member for Gwydk (Mr Cunningham).",49
224,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I asked the Co-opgrows erative Farmers Society of Victoria to supply me with twine, but, because I did not live in the Riverina, they refused my request.  ern Australia saysWe desire to bring under your notice present duty on New Zealand, binder twine. The present schedule stands at 7s. per cwt., nnd, at the same time, there is a preferential Tariff 'on English twine of 6s. per cwt. This, unit. organization has, for the last four years, ported its requirements in twine from Zealand. It was found that the New Zealand manufacturer was giving a much .superior article to the Australian-manufactured string, and, even with that very considerable impost of £7 per ton, we-have been in a position command from, 86 to 90 per cent, of the binder twine business in this State. It seems unreasonable to impose upon, neighbouring Dominion, whose people have ideals and'aspirations similar to our own, such a heavy duty.

There seems to be an impression that sisal hemp is grown in Australia and needs protecting.. As a matter of fact, it is the middleman who seeks the protection, although by giving it to him we may retard the pro- A gress of the primary producer. The raw material for the reaper and binder twine coand yarn made up in Australia is imported, and the duty is imposed for the purpose of protecting the work of making it up into twine.

GBOWEBS TO BE ENCOURAGED, BRITISH VOTE OF £1,000,000. (ReutersLondon, 8th June. - Mr Winston Churchill, Secretary, of State for the Colonies, addressing the British Cotton Growing Association at Manchester, declared that the-British Empire, despite its steady progress, produced only a fortieth part of the cotton needed to keep its hungry mills fully active. v The formidable fact now - was, he continued, that America was consuming a very large proportion of her own cotton crop. He advocated the location and development of.' supplies within the - Empire, and deplored the neglect to develop tropical Possessions in the past twenty years. He urged the use of scientific apparatus as a remunerative investment; also the development of Inter-Imperial trade, both with tropical dependencies and the Dominions. The British Government, he said, was devoting £1,000,000 to the encouragement of.cotton growing within the Empire There is no question that cotton can be grown in Australia of as good a quality as in any part of the world. It was estimated that last year, in Queensland, there were 1,250 acres under cultivation of cotton, and steps are being taken to extend planting in other parts of the State. No doubt the industry could just as well be carried on in some of the other States of the Commonwealth; and this is a matter to which representatives of the-primary producers, no matter On what side of the , House they sit, should give their serious attention with a view to adequate protection. I trust that the Minister will be able to indicate some means by which this industry may be safeguarded. It is not as if the rates of wages in Australia were higher' than those ruling at present in 'America. I have particulars in. regard to wages in America, and I am sure # i r cotton-pickers would be quite satisfied to accept the same. We have the climate and the soil, and there is no doubt that cotton can be grown"" here profitably if given a chance.",51

I hope the Minister will give those engaged in this industry some assurance that, either now or in the near future, they will be placed in a position to enter heart and soul into an effort comply with' the wishes expressed in the newspaper extract I read, and thus in carrying out the desire of the Empire.",52
230,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.27] thoroughly, agree that there is room for a development of the cotton-growing industry in this country. I believe in time, it will probably develop along the lines on which it is being carried on at another. in many parts of America. There the industry is very largely conducted by means of family labour on. compara-tively small plots, and in the aggregate living? large quantities of cotton are produced. There is no doubt that the .climate soil of Australia are admirably adapted to its growth, and it is only a question of time, provided the price keeps up to profitable level, when we shall see the dustry extend over large areas of country. It has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt thab Australia can produce longjute, staple cotton of very fine character, but it is too early to talk about protecting manufacturing side of the industry, particularly in regard to yarns. Protection has been given in the case of waddings, it -' waste, and those comparatively' primitive manufactures in the early stages. But yarns are quite another matter. of course, enter largely into our textiles; there are such things, for instance, as Viyella, of which cotton forms a material I portion, and there is also the knitting dustry. To impose a Protective duty when we have no spinning plant would be simply handicapping those other in the dustries without doing any appreciable good to the cotton industry. It is too early to think about a duty, but, in the meantime, I have no doubt that the 40 per cent.? cotton-growers, under the arrangements come to, and the guarantees given by the Manchester Association for the develophave ment of cotton-growing in - the interests of the Empire, to give a price which will pay for five yeaars to come, will prove best possible inducement to cotton-growing in Australia.",52

235,Mr GREENE,Unknown,No .,52
236,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The Minister must ' % information regarding these commodities, and ought to know that unless something is'- done the Indian products the' will swamp' the .Australian industry. - There is a firm in Victoria, and other associated firms,, which have installed large plant for the purpose of manufacturing these particular yarns. . Some time ago there was some difficulty with the, firms, which, while making twine, did not make yarn, and objected to a duty on the yarn becaiise it was their raw material. Since that time, however, machinery has been introduced capable of producing all the yarns necessary for the manufacture of twine. That being so, it is a foolish attitude to refuse to encourage their manufacture in Australia. The production of yarn is the elementary process in the manufacture of fabrics.' It will be useless to attempt'to manufacture cotton piece goods in , Australia u n t i l we can' manufacture the yarn, and we did very little in woollen manufacture u n t i l we spun woollen yarn here. The local netting industry will go out of existence if v a do not make our own, yarn and twine. In my district there is an establishment which, during the war, was full of workpeople engaged in making yarn, and its storehouse was always practically empty; but now half of those who were employed have had to leave, and the storehouse is practically full . Honourable members opposite know that the storing up of productions cannot continue indefinitely, especially when the banks are treating manufacturers as they are treating them today. The manufacture of yarn here should encourage the. growing of hemp and flax. I hope that the M i nister will increase the duties.",52
237,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister for . Trade and Customs) [8.39] - I think that duties of 10, 15, and 30 per cent, should be sufficient, to protect a simple dustry like the spinning of yarn. honourable member spoke of the competition of India, but the great bulk'of our importation of yarn comes from Great Britain . In the year 1920 the y a m coming from Great Britain was valued at £8,915, and that coming from India at £5,440. In the previous year Great Britain sjent us yarn worth £ 9 , 1 4 3, and India yarn worth £4,233, and the year before that Great Britain sent yarn worth £16,700, while the importation from India was valued at £4,086 . Since this dutyhas been in operation, the importations have decreased, the total importation this year being only £15,266, as against £33,000 last year. Although the price of the article has been much higher during the last two years than it ' was previously, the value of the importation has diminished. That seems to show that the protection we afford is sufficient. I cannot see that a comparatively minor operation like the spinning of yarn needs a higher duty than 20 per cent. The raw material of the industry-jute , hemp, and flax-is admitted free of duty, the local production of it being so small that a duty would not be justified. I do not share the view of the honourable member for  grow our own hemp. I know two or three persons who are now growing hemp, and there"" is a great deal of country on which it could be grown. I believe that we shall eventually grow it as successfully as it is grown in New. Zealand.",53
238,Mr WEINHOLT,Unknown,Quite a lot was grown years ago.,53
239,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes ; but the competition from abroad made the crop unprofitable. We still guarantee a certain price for flax, and a fair quantity of it is grown, and the production is increasing each year. I think that it will not be very long before all the flax yarn we require will be made from locally-grown flax.

240,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [ 8 . 4 4 ] - I desire to support the contention of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr . Corser) that Queensland is eminently suited to ' the growing of cotton. Rei n - cently I had the pleasure of conversing The with Mr Jones, the Government cotton expert qf that State, and he assured me that he had never seen cotton elsewhere thriving so well as it does in Queensland. Not only are the pods valuable for the cotton they produce, but the plant is a splendid herbage during droughts, and will sustain cattle in periods when there .is no grass. For that reason alone Mr . Jones' recommended the growing of cotton. He told me that small crops were grown in the Burdekin' District, though hardly for the sake of the fibre, yet a good price was obtained for the cotton that was picked there. Some years ago Dr Thomatis grew cotton on the Barron River, samples of which were sent to Great Britain , and pronounced to be of the best quality. A duty would not stimulate the growing, of cotton', but a bounty might. In 1907, this Parliament provided for a bounty on cotton available until 1915; but in the last year of that period only £ 2 2 Was asked for, and in the year before £ 2 1 , the maximum amount that could have been drawn being £6,000. In view qf the desire of the British Government to increase the growing of cotton within the Empire, I suggest that the Minister should propose again' the offer of a bounty, making the sum available three or four times as large as it was.",53
241,Mr GREENE,Unknown,- I shall look into the matter.,54
242,Mr BAMPORD,Unknown,The conditions of the present day are entirely different from those which prevailed between 1907 and 1915. I accept the Minister's assurance that he will give consideration to my suggestion.,54
243,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [8.47] I shall support the amendment. I am glad to have the Minister's promise about a bounty for cotton. The honourable member"" for Herbert (Mr Bamford) omitted to mention a matter that we were told of in a lecture in the Senate Clubroom recently, namely, that cotton is a crop which does not spoil if the picking is delayed, and that sometimes the picking can be extended over a period of six months. That would be a great help to a small family. Nothing stimulates primary industry so much as a good duty, and I think that the rates moved for by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) would largely stimulate the growing of cotton in Queensland. For the past sixty years cotton has been grown in Queensland, and there is no doubt as to the ability of the wnite man to produce there high-grade fibre which will compare favourably with the cotton of other countries. One of our long-stapled up-land varieties, when submitted to the British Cotton-grower? Association for valuation, was appraised at Is. per lb, when American ""middling "" was valued at only 5d. Another sample was judged to be worth from 3s. 6d. to 4s. pov lb. It is an annual crop. I invite my Free Trade friends to support the amendment in the interests 'or-Australia, believing that we should be able to build up a cotton industry that will rival that of the United States of America.

There is a duty of 35 per cent, on the printed labels, cardboard boxes, and paper tubes used by the industry, while on the wooden reels there is a duty of 30 per cent. Coats and Company have been disposing of enormous quantities of sewing cotton on the Australian market. The local company is content that no duty shall be imposed on imports of ordinary household threads and cottons from Great Britain, but it asks for further protection in respect of crochet,. knitting, mercerised, and embroidery cottons, and promises that if an 'all-round increase of 10 per cent, is granted it will extend its plant and employ considerably more labour.

247,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [9.0] - I do not know whether the information I have regarding the local firm is correct, but it is to the effect that the industry carried on by it consists only of reeling certain lines of cottons and labelling them for retail sale. If it simply purchases the yarn from abroad and employs a few persons in reeling it for, retail sale, it can hardly be said to be carrying on an industry. ' There is, however, an anomaly in respect of this item, because, while crochet, knitting, mercerised, and embroidery cottons are dutiable, ' I notice that under sub-item' A, embroidery silks and twists, which are used for the more expensive classes of work, are free under the British and intermediate Tariffs. 0",55

249,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"My desire is that a big duty shall not-be imposed on cottons, which the poorer people have to use, while embroidery silks and twists are admitted free. This, it seems to me, ""is ananomaly that ought to be explained.",55
250,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [9.3] - I sincerely hope that the Minister (Mr. Greene) will accept the amendment. The firm referred to by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) is. the Commonwealth Cotton Company Proprietary Limited, which carries on. operations at what is known as the Rainbow Factory,. Clifton Hill. If .the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) would visit the company's factory, I am sure he would be satisfied that the industry isworthy of substantial protection. I have shown several ladies the crochet, knitting,, mercerised, and embroidery cottons produced by it, and they all tell me that they are. equal to any imported cotton. This, company is also making the finest thread used by tailors. For a time it was able to compete with the Coats Combinewonderful in its awfulness-^but that Combine has been undercutting it to such an extent that it is impossible to compete with it in the production .of threads and ordinary cottons. The principal of the company comes from that part of the Old Country in which threads and sewing cottons are made, and has the necessary machinery to carry on the industry. All that he asks for is a duty of. 20 per cent, under the British Tariff to enable him tocompete against the mighty Combine, and ah increase of 10 per cent, under the intermediate and general Tariffs. If . the honourable member for Dampier will visit the factory, he will see that the various cottons covered by sub-item B are spun there from the yarn. I shall vote for the amendment.",55
251,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [9.5] - Sewin g and embroidery silks and twists, household threads and cottons, and' sewing threads and cottons, are for the manufacture of garments. The silk or twist is used for outside woollen garments. They are not the class of article to which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has' referred. The mercerised cotton is for crochet and embroidery work, and is rather in the nature of a luxury, while the other isa daily necessity.

I assume that'the intention is to assist the cork-cutting industry. W it h that I am-entirely in agreement, but the Committee should consider' the' effect of this duty on the corkboard industry. Under the 1914 Tariff granulated cork was not specifically mentioned, but cork mats, and all other manufactures of cork were subject to a British preferential .duty of 15 per cent, and a general duty of 20 ' per cent. Consequently, it was impossible for the corkboard industry to prosper in Australia - This schedule provides for the free admission of granulated cork for f r u it packing, but the materials required for'manufacturin g purposes will be subject to-duties of. 15 per cent, and 20 per cent. It is unfortunate that the cork oak is not grown to any extent in this country; the very fine samples , of this tree;*to be found in the Melbourne Botanic Gardens is proof that it would flourish in this climate. There are many industries in which granulated cork is -.used. Represen-* tations were made to. 'the . Minister .early last year in regard to this duty, - and I should like to know whether he will agree to any decrease in respect of sub-dtem B It was my intention to ask that granulated cork for - 'manufacturing purposes should be admitted free, but fro m information which I have since obtained I do not think that would be quite fair to the cork-cutting industry. The largest corkboard manufacturing company is in Queensland, and in a recent letter to me the manager disavowed any intention on the part of his company to in jure the cork-cutting industry, but asked for fair consideration,'so .that this industry might be preserved .from destruction.",56

It has been ,said there is plenty of this granulated cork available from the - cork-cutters, but the .corkboard manufacturers point o u t .that the waste from cork-rCutting is ""not always suitable for corkboard, inasmuch as the grains should be of ,a certain size, and contain air cells. An objection to .the irn,portation of the cork bark and the granulation of it - in Australia is. that the process is dusty aiud unhealthy for the employees. I know that the Minister has all the in formation available on the .subject, and I hope he will agree to the .request that has been made. < >",56
258,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [9.15] The dust nuisance in connection with, any trade can be eliminated by the use of forced - pressure. Honourable members may see an example of that in the Wertheim factory, where every particle of dust is sucked up by forced draught, and carried to the furnace. If the dust is proving inimical to the workers in any factory in Queensland, the f a u l t lies with 'the factory legislation of that State. I intend to move that an increased duty be placed on all granulated cork. The statement that (this material cannot he supplied locally is dearly met by the offer made by the Cork and Crown Seal Proprietary Company Limited to the manager .of the 'Victorian Orehardists Coroperative Association Limited , Flinders-lane. W r it in g .in regard to granulated cork''""'for the purpose corkboard of fruit-packing for export, the manager of the company saidWe now beg to confirm, and here set out, our undertaking, namely, to supply all .your requirements, and those of your' association, with the right grade of .granulated cork at f.o.b. prices 5 per cent. Jess than Portugal, Spain, or Algeria will be prepared to supply same, plus freight and landing charges. In other words, that company pared to supply every fruit-grower in Victoria with cork packing at a price 5 per cent, less than that at which, European bananas. countries are prepared to place it on board ship. That offer has been accepted by the Victorian Orehardists Co-operaslipped tive Association in a letter dated 1st, June, 1921. The writer referring to the intention of the cork cutters to ask increased duty on granulated cork, said I have pleasure in stating that, the representations made by yourselves, and also having in view your guarantee that the users of this commodity will actually reap benefit to the extent of 5 per cent., my associatralian tion agrees that the request, if granted, will meet with the full approval of the fruitgranulated growers generally. I trust, therefore, petition will meet with the full measure of success that this association feels that it deserves. If a duty is placed on all granulated every fruit-grower will be able to . cork packing at a price 5 per cent, below the price in Europe. If the European price decreases, the 'local price w i l be 5 per cent, lower - Having regard to that offer, I cannot, understand that the Government should hesitate to increase the duty. I understand that in corkfor cutting two-thirds of the sheet is lost, in cutting champagne corks the loss is even greater. The use of the t h in layer cork in the metal stoppers which are so largely used nm. beer and aerated water bottles has certainly freed 'the growers the cork oak from the fear that they might not be able to supply the world's requirements. But in Australia there are vast areas of laaid suitable for the vation of that tree. I have seen splendid forests of cork oak in Spain,'and I noticed that the trees were not only f u l , but most graceful. We should sist the cork-cutting industry by imposing a fair duty, and I therefore move That the item be amended by the addition of Algeria, or Portugal. the following words :- "" And on and after July, 1921, sub-items (A), (B), and (c), ad val., British, 30 per cent.; intermediate, 30 cent.; general, 45 per cent.",56

262,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I think I can do so. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . cork, Cameron) has pointed out that the manget ager of a factory in Brisbane said that his firm could not get sufficient waste cork in Australia. As a matter of fact, l still that very gentleman was appointed the Brisbane representative of a Clifton Hill cork factory, and on its behalf secured a contract with the Queensland Government the supply of granulated cork; but?no and sooner had he obtained this contract than be practically cancelled it , and imported of inferior waste cork . from abroad. I can' now assure the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) that the cork cutters of of ^Australia can meet the granulated cork requirements of. Australia. The Country party need hot be afraid that the duty asked for will oppress f r u it growers. The cultihonorablemember for Melbourne (Dr the Maloney) has just pointed out that the Clifton. Hill firm has made a contract useto 'supply the Victorian Orehardists asCo-operative Association Limited with granulated cork at a price which is 5 per cent, lower than the price of waste cork imported from Spain, These people are 7th very anxious to extend their operations. per Already they are employing a large number of hands, but they are suffering loss, I by reason of the fact that they are not able to put their waste cork to the best use. They would be very pleased if honourable members would make themselves acquainted with' the factory. The so Quality of their, output has - stood the t Queensland Government's test; it is in finitely superior to the imported 'waste cork, and if the Committee will agree to the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Moloney), I am sure it will aifford considerable employment to our own people.  that the Minister will not be influenced to alter sub-item A. If the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) is correct in saying that the local cork cutters can sell, granulated cork at 5 per cent, less than the price of the imported article, I am sure the grape growers of Western Australia will buy up all the Australian product, if it is suitable, because they use this cork for packing grapes for export to other parts of. the world. But when i m ported granulated cork ie used for this purpose a rebate of duty in any case should be permitted. I cannot see the necessity of going to the - trouble of imposing a duty on this very necessary requirement for packing f r u it . The honourable member for Melbourne has made the ludicrous proposition that we should impose a Protective duty for the purpose of enabling cork trees to be grown in Australia, without any regard whatever for those industries which are sending produce out of this country, and for which money is secured in return. It is this money which is coming into the country that makes it possible for us to establish secondary industries here. It will do no harm to the cork manufacturers of Australia to retain granulated cork on the free list, because we are told that they are .prepared to sell their waste product at 5 per cent, less than the cost of the imported waste. . The f r u it growers of this country will be quite prepared to buy their output if they find that they can get enough of . it of the right quality to meet their requirements.",57

267,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Lilley) [9.31] - The honourable member ' for Newcastle (Mr . Watkins) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) are under a mis-, apprehension in regard to the attitude of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . Cameron) and myself. We are asking for consideration for the corkboard in dustry, and have no desire whatever to in terfere with the. business of cork-cutters. My remarks were based on a letter signed by the manager of a corkboard manufacturing company, who writes as follows:In March last our representative visited Melbourne, and when in that city endeavoured to secure supplies of Waste cork through one of the large Melbourne houses, but was met on every hand by the reply, "" We have not sufficient for our own requirements."" Only one cork-cutter quoted for a small parcel of 1 or 2 tons, but the price quoted was just about 100 per cent-, higher than the landed cost of the best granulated cork. Our representative also visited four of the five principal cork-cutters and cork board manufacturers in Melbourne, and all the factories known to him in Sydney, and discussed with the principals the question of the removal of the duty on granulated cork, and in every instance the replies-received were favourable, the unanimous opinion' being thai the imposition of the present duty was unfaii, and its removal would be helpful rather thon harmful to the cork-cutting industry. I have a sample of corkboard manufactured.",58
268,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"It is manufactured out of cork waste. the Mr MACKAY - That is so; but the duty on. pieces must be of certain size, so that the board, which is used for insulating purposes, may contain air cells. Cork shavings, which . may be suitable for fruit packing, are quite unsuited for the making of cork-board. I speak in the interests of a factory capable of turning out 10,000 square feet per week, and for which 20,000 lbs. weight of granulated cork is required.  Committee really wants to place a duty on granulated cork, I hope that it will not interfere with granulated cork used for fruit packing, because the fruit growers of Australia are in competition with those of Spain, Italy, and other continental'countries. I ask the Minister (Mr Greene) not to permit himself to be moved from his proposal. If primary producers have to compete with other parts of the world, surely others may be made to compete in like manner.",58

The honourable member for  ister (Mr Greene) will not be "" moved,"" but the Minister is not here to be moved. I , however, should like the Acting Minister (Mr Wise) to explain why, in' view of the fact that under the old Tariff the duties on granulated cork were 15 per cent, and 20 per cent., the commodity is to be made free. Why should - there be a decrease in this particular item, since most of the changes have been in the nature of increases? The honourable member for Swan has informed us that the fruit-growers cannot get granulated cork, but I may inform him. that the cork manufacturers of Victoria, and the producers of granulated cork, have time after time applied to the growers  tured, but grows.",59
271,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Allo w me to tell the honourable member that cork is both grown and manufactured. However, the cork manufacturers in Melbourne have repeatedly written to the fruit-packers of Western Australia asking for orders for granulated cork, and have been unable to get any; the idea is to get cork from foreign countries ih order to push the local product out of the market. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) has produced cork-board which was, and is, a. process of manufacture. As a. matter of fact, as the 'honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has pointed out, the cork industry represents three-fourths waste, which by machinery is made into cork-boards and articles for insulating purposes. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) told us a story of the real foundation of the argument used by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cameron) who, with others beside him, spoke' l of the failure of this industry. That failure is easy to explain; and there is the same intriguing underlying nearly every industry. The. Queensland Government required insulatorsfor certain processes, and for such insulators it was necessary to have granulated cork prp-* duced from cork waste. Tests were made, as against the English and American article, and it was found that the Australian cork was the best. A gentleman in this city then proceeded to play a are smart game on his own partners, and got the contract, and then obtained his granulated cork from abroad. The question is asked, what does it matter if this be waste cork, whether it is the local product, or comes from overseas?  duct, anyhow.",59
272,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"We are not playing on words. If we. get the raw material from some other country, and work it up into the finished' product, we furnish labour for our own people; that argument applies to a variety of industries as well as to the cork industry - When the tree is here, and the waste is here, the finished article is properly seasoned, whereas the foreign article really has the vitality squeezed out of it , and fails in its work. The result of the piece of intrigue to which.I referred was that the local manufacturers were discredited. I see no reason why the old Tariff should not be maintained, or, what is better, increased, and I support the amendment. In any case, it would be interesting to know from the Minister what prompted him to make this item free.",59

It is not hard for any of body to understand that unless the waste represent. product can be made marketable the importer of cork will have to charge more for the corks he makes. As it is, there is an enormous! amount of waste cork here from these coSk establishments that be made into granulated cork for fruitpackers and the manufacture of insua lators. When the fruit-packers and the manufacturers of insulators are told that there are large quantities of granulated cork available, why do they, in their cussedness, say they will not have the Australian waste product, but will have the imported waste product from Spain? If this is an Australian Parliament, these people ought .to be forced to use the local waste product.",60

281,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"They have never raised that point; if they had said that the local product is not suitable, it would be a matter for investigation, but what they say is that there is not sufficient of it.

The fruit-packers also say cannot get this cork ; but if they can get it in sufficient quantities from Victoria, and its sale would assist in the of factories in that State and elsewhere, they should do so.",60

That is the only occasion on which the honourable member has given an Australian vote. If there were not sumcient local granulated cork, at a lower price than that of the imported article, to supply the fruit-packers, I should not desire any duty; but, if there is enough cork at a reasonable price, I would compel the fruit-packers of Western Australia to use it, providing, of course, that it did no injury to the fruit.  compulsory Wheat Pool?",60
284,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I shall tell the honourable member when we are discussing the Wheat Pool, but I may say that I think the Pool has been of some assistance to the wheat-growers. No doubt the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) is at a disadvantage, and we.are sorry that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) is kept away through illness; but I ask, nevertheless, that due consideration may be given to this matter. The loss of the by-products from wool would be a serious thing for the wool growers of Australia, and similarly the loss of the by-products of the cork cuting industry would be a loss to the people engaged in that industry. Mr.'WISE - The concession objected to applies merely to cork used for packing fruit for export",61

We admit duty-free the raw material of the cork industry and protect its manufactures, and then it wants a duty to enable it to sell the surplus rubbish of its operations. About 17miles from Perth there is one of the finest vineyards in the Commonwealth, the grapes from which, exported packed in granulated cork, realise as much as 35s. a case in the Old Country. You can see there avenues of vines three-quarters of a mile long, and I hope that similar grapes may. be grown in other parts of Australia, and a large export trade in them built up. . It is to assist this export trade that we wish to have granulated cork admitted free. Although the grapes that I have mentioned bring 35s. a case in London, exporters cannot be sure of getting such prices for their fruit; because there .are times when, through some small thing going wrong during transport, the sender may receive nothing, or may even be at a considerable loss.",61

Victorian Orehardists Association, however, has no complaint against this duty, and the cork makers, in order to get a waste product used, to help them to carry on their business, have offered to supply the association with granulated cork for 5 per cent, less than the price f.o.b. in Portugal.",62
298,Mr WIENHOLT,Unknown,"Then why do they ask for a duty? Mr MoGRATH - To compel those who have a decided preference for imported cork, and who would pay a little more for it, to use the local article. Some persons prefer to patronize the productions of Portugal, Algeria, and Spain rather than - those of their own country. I have here a letter from the Victorian tralian article.

Mr MoGRATH - The honourable member is not so closely in touch with the fruit-growers of Australia as is the Victorian Orehardists Association, whose members are actually growing and exporting fruit.

He may be a German; but as one who has met people of all nationalities, and who did a little in the late war, I say that there are Germans who are just as good as other men. Whatever may be the nationality of the proprietor of the local factory, those employed in it are, for the most part, young Australians, and they are the men we are trying to help.

I* have always shown my sympathy with and their representatives; I have voted for many items the farming population. they ask for a duty on peanuts, '",64
318,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The item before the proChair is granulated cork.,64
319,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The case for peanuts the was put gsp by one of the most respected . and brilliant members of the House, and I am merely trying to put before the Committee a few facts with the intention of showing, later, their bearing on the item now before us. Onions are a local product of vast importance to the destitute farmers and their representatives. There was no suggestion of allowing unrestricted importations from abroad which would compete with the poor farmers' production of onions; or of maize,, or butter, or canary seed, or dried fruits, or millet. To all these pleas.for relief for this destitute section of Australians, whether from five, flood, or drought, and whether by way of duties on peanuts or duties on bananas, I gave my support. But now, when we ask that a duty shall be placed upon granulated cork,- irrespective of the purpose for which it is required, and that an industry which has been in existence for many years shall be maintained by the aid of the protection it has hitherto enjoyed, these representa- tives of country interests reflect upon people who conduct this industry and those who advocate their cause in this Chamber. It can be safely said of all these firms that the proprietors are natives of this country, and have, demonstrated their genius in the building up of an industry which is beneficial to the Commonwealth. We have put forward the facts to prove that they can furnish other industries with granulated cork; but because the representatives of the poor farmers"" think that, in connection with the packing of fruit, they can save a miserable penny, they want the cheapest product from the cheapest country on earth in respect of this, as in respect of all other commodities except .those in which they have a personal and pecuniary interest. That has been their policy from beginning to end. One day they ask this Committee for relief and support, and they plead with representatives of city constituencies to vote with them in support of duties vital to their industries; and then, when they are asked to vote for the maintenance of other industries by members who represent those industries and the workmen employed in them, they impute motives. They talk of the poor starving men on the land. What of the men whose industries ^are killed by foreign importations™ of the men who built up industries under Mr Anttey. the protection of the law, which protection has now been withdrawn? What of the workers in factories employing 500 hands at one time, but forced to reduce the staff to forty or fifty hands? At this date,, when more and more industries should be built up, and when the necessity for the Commonwealth being self-contained becomes daily more apparent, country members are opposed to the protection of any industry which conflicts with their own selfish interests. That is why we are asking the Minister in charge of the Tariff to reconsider the whole matter, and come back to the question of the alleged shortage of supplies. It has already been shown that the output of this industry is sufficient to meet requirements, as the factories are choked with granulated cork.  pay on their raw material?",64

I can quite understand that if this was a partisan question, or one of city versus country, members of the Country party would adopt a. certain attitude, but it .is not. Those who are supporting increased duties in this instance have not been hostile to every claim submitted by members of the Country party, and have not been blind or stone deaf to their appeals to protect those products which come from the farm or the garden. The Country party have asked the Government for their support, and have grabbed assistance from wherever it could be obtained; but they' are hostile to everything but their own particular industries. Is this section to dominate the policy of this country ? I trust not. I am a strong believer in the maintenance of all our'Australian industries, and when our factories are choked with waste material, which can be supplied at cheaper rates than importations from.

332,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.57] - I wish to refer to an interjection which was made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I am sure that the honourable member did not intend the unkindness which his interjection conveyed. It reflected upon a gentleman who has been a friend of mine for fifty years. This gentleman came to Australia in 1852, and, is therefore, a colonist of sixty, nine years' standing. He was born in Frankfort, before that place was compelled to become part of the hegemony of Prussia after the war of 1866, when blood flowed in the streets of Frankfort in resistance to Prussian compulsion. My old friend is one of the bravest men I have ever met.' He is seventy-nine years of agc and no man can hold up a finger 5 against him.' I only wish that we had more men in Australia of the character of my old friend, Mr Voght. I want to see preference given to the Home Land, and especially to England, from which country my mother came. If I had a choice in the matter, I should prefer that this article should be admitted free from Great Britain, but I do desire that there should be duties of 20 and 25 per cent, imposed upon importations from other eountries. I carried a knapsack through Spain, and visited factories there. I can assure the honourable member for Swan that, if he were in a position to compare the factories in Spain with the Victorian factories, he would be prepared to admit that the waste product must be cleaner in the local f actories than it is in the Spanishfactories.  - will admit that those who use granulated cork should be better judges of the matter than either of us.",67
333,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The conditions prevailing in the Spanish factories are. not comparable with the conditions here. Any one who knows anything of lavatory arrangements in Spain will know that one dare not cross a vacant block in a city or town in that country at night without a lantern. The honourable member for Swan was right in saying that granulated cork is not used in packing apples. Every one - knows that each apple should be separately wrapped in paper, but cork packing is used in the shipment of grapes, plums, and fresh fruit, which require de^ licate handling. The honourable member for Swan was wrong when he spoke of chemically treating cork dust, because, if antiseptics are used in treating cork dust they might flavour the fruit packed in it, and especially delicate f r u it like grapes.  that the honourable member cannot bluff me in .that way.",67
