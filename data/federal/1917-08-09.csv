1,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yesterday the honourable member for Hindmarsh asked me why soldiers in camp were being allowed to transfer to the artillery. I promised to make an inquiry, and I am now informed that no transfers to the artillery have been authorized since the 31st May last, the date on. which recruiting for the artillery stopped. TRAVELLING OF MEMBERS .",4
2,Mr CORSER,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister noticed the absence during recent divisions in this House of a number of the members of the Opposition 1 Is he aware that it is reported that the reason for their absence is the fact that the unions .have declared the coal used for the trains Tunning between Sydney and Melbourne to - be black? Is the Government providing free - steamer fares for the travelling of these members? Is it the intention of those who refuse for the reason mentioned to travel by train-to attend the sittings of this Parliament to refund their Parliamentary remuneration for the period of their absence ?,4
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have noticed the senoe of some members of the Opposition, and can quite believe in some of their cases that the cause is that communication between Sydney and Melbourne has been somewhat interfered with by the industrial disturbance in New South Wales. I have read that the unions have declared coal to be '* black,"" though, so far as I know, that! declaration has had no effect on the colour of coal. I am not aware that the Government is providing free steamer fares for members, nor do I know that members who may refuse to travel by train at the present time have any intention of foregoing any portion of their Parliamentary remuneration. I should be very much sur-. prised to learn of such an intention. It would indicate such an amazing departure from whab my long experience of members of Parliament has taught! me to expect that I would begin to believe that the millennium was at bland.",4
4,Mr WEST,Unknown,I should like to claim tihe sympathy of the Prime Minister in my present position. I am unable to proceed to my home because of tha incom2.30 petence of the engine-drivers on the railway trains in New South Wales. Will the right honourable gentleman render me some assistance!,4
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I shall be glad to do what the honourable member asks. What: particular assistance does he need F What does he miss most ! - t CANBERR AARSENAL .,4
6,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"In . view of the large sum mentioned in the Budget statement in connection with the proposal to build an arsenal at Canberra, I ask the Prime Minister if the House will be given an opportunity to express its opinion on the subject before the country has been committed to the expenditure T",4
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes ; the House will have an opportunity to discuss the proposal. PRICE OF MEAT . Mr M ACKA Y - H as the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a letter appearing in. the Age newspaper this morning stating the prices paid for beef and mutton at the Queensland State butchers' shops, and also at Melbourne? Is the Prime Minister aware that the beef and mutton sold in the'Queensland State abshops is frozen, and has been commandeered at 3Jd. per lb., while ths price paid by the Imperial Government for a similar article for the use of the. troops is 4Jd. per l b . ; also that the prices quoted are for cash only ?",4
8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I was not aware of the facts to which the honourable member directs my attention. The letter appears in this morning's Age was Shale brought under my notice by the committee of management of the Waterside Workers vernment Federation, which attached considerable importance to it as an indication that prices of meat here.are much higher, than they ought to be. I was not aware the Queensland Government had comof mandeered the beef sold in the QueensUnion ? land State shops at 3|d . per l b ., and that the price paid by the British Government for similar meat is 4 | d . per lb., or-that the prices quoted are for cash only. The House and the country is obliged to the honourable member for making these facts known, because statements which have apeven peared in the press have had the effect of greatly misleading the people both as to the prices of meat, and the reason for the increases. FOODSTUFFS IN COOL STORE.",4
9,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The Minister protain mised nearly a fortnight ago that monthly return of the quantity of foodstuffs in cool storage in Australia would be furnished. Is such a return now available? If not, will the Minister do his best to expedite its production ?",5
10,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"In . pursuance of promise, I have given the instruction that returns shall be made available monthly, and I hope to lay the first on the table within a day or two. PAY OFFICE, VICTORIA BARRACKS.. SYDNEY .",5
11,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yesterday the honorment able member for Nepean asked whether the departmental Board appointed to in - matter. quire into the working of the pay office at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, had finished its investigation and made a port. I am informed that the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence A d ministration recommended that of Inquiry should be disbanded, as the scope of the Royal Commission is very much more extensive, and' full y covers the ground of the Board of Inquiry. This recommendation was approved. All data collected by the Board of Inquiry have been made available to the Royal Commission. COAL MINERS ' THREAT . IMPORTATION OF COAL. Mr ' BOYD - In view of a statement made in Sydney yesterday by Mr Willis, which secretary of the Australian Coal and Employees Union, that ' the coal mine employees were out to fight the Goto the last ditch, will the Prime Minister see thab some provision is made the for the importation of coal, so that the other industries of Australia shall not be' that hampered and placed under the control the executive of the Coal ' Miners",5
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have not seen in the press the statement to which the honourable member refers. I would point out to him, however, that the importation'of coal is not now a feasible project. As far as I know we could not import coal, if we desired to do so. in sufficient T quantities to have the slightest effect upon the industrial position of Australia in the near future. It is not to be deduced from my remarks that I for one moment, agree with the position said to have been taken up-by the coal miners, but we cannot obthe shipping to bring coal in suffia cient quantities to this country. COST OF LIVING . GOVERNMENT POLICY .",5
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime M i nmy ister and Attorney-General) [2.42] (By leave.) - I desire to make a statement in regard to shipping and the cost of living. Yesterday I was asked a question as to the attitude of the Government in relation to the refusal of the waterside workers to load wheat and flour for foreign countries. I said then that the Governwould take an early opportunity of declaring its policy in regard to this It is understood that the situation arose out of a belief which is held, not only by the wharf labourers, but reby other unionists, that prices are unduly high, and that the refusal to load wheat and flour for export would have the the Board effect of reducing them. The Government, of course, is charged with, the conduct of the industrial and general affairs of this country, and its business is to see that the products for export gefc away in order that the industrial as well as the general welfare of the Commonwealth may be conserved. This morning I had an interview with the committee of management of the Waterside Workers Federation, at which I pointed out the position which would be created by the refusal to load vessels with wheat and flour. I am glad to be able to announce that the committee gave me an assurance that, so far from desiring to hamper the Government in its war policy, the waterside workers would, without hesitation or delay, proceed to work any vessels that were engaged' in war work or in what might be termed war work. In pursuance of that assurance? instructions were issued, and the men are now standing by ready to ' load, or, perhaps by this time are actually loading, the two vessels to carry British and French wheat. There is another steamer about which something was said yesterday, but so far as its immediate relation to the war is cerned, it falls within a different put the matter clearly, and I wish peat what I said this morning to friends the waterside workers. them that the business of the country must be carried on, and that it was not them to say what ships they. would would not load, otherwise they would usurp the functions of the Government of the country, and our position would be farcical - that portion of the consignment. What I desire now to state the position of the Governmenb with regard to the althe leged exploitation of the public through the excessive cost of living. The Governable ment has considered the matter, and haa decided to remit it forthwith to the State Commission, with a request that inquiries be made immediately in regard to the prices of the main staple commodities of daily life, the prices in relation to the . cost of production, and the effect, if any T of the exportation of foodstuffs or any other products upon the local prices. The Commission will enter upon its littlp. labours immediately. Later it can extend its inquiry, but I apprehend that this munity is more concerned about the-prices of the staple commodities of daily life than with any other - The Commission will proceed at once to deal with the question,, and .as 4t .makes,its report each.commodity the.Government will take such action from time to time, as the circumstances demand. . .",5
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," The Prime Minister says that he received this morning from the reprethe sentatives of the waterside workers an assurance that they were prepared to go on with ""what is knownas war work. wish to point out that the waterside workers have not at any - time objected load .vessels engaged .in that class of work. The resolution which, it is stated, they passed, and to which exception has been taken by certain persons, concerned the loading of the Houtrrumn and certain other vessels going to the East. The Melbourne wharf labourers have an understanding to the effect' that they would not load vessels with foodstuffs that were not required in connection with war work, but, they say, no resolution was carried. In order to substantiate my statement as to the position they take up regarding war work, that is, the loading of foodstuffs or other congoods for defence requirements, I need class. I only refer to what was done last to reweek in connection with a shipment my of 50 tons of onions to New ZeaI told land.- As soon as Mr Manson, the New Zealand Government agent here, for reported that he had received a cableor gram from the New Zealand Government that 25'tons of these onions were required for defence purposes, the wharf labourers withdrew their objection to' the loading of , they objected to' was the exploitation of market by the action of certain men in exporting a sufficient quantity to enlocal prices to be increased. As a matter of fact, the price of onions had Interbeen more than doubled within a month.",6
15,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Withi n a week.,6
16,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I understand thab in little more than a month the price of onions rose from about £ 5 to . £ 1 1 per ton. Since the wharf labourers announced their objection to load onions for New Zealand the price has dropped a,6
17,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The honourable commember would not like to grow onions for much less than £ 1 0 per ton.,6
18,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not know what is the cost of production per acre or per ton, on but I Jiave always said that no, exception can be taken to /any legitimate 'increase in 1 prices due to an increase 'in the wages of those producing the commodities or foodstuffs involved: I made 'that statement in the Melbourne Town H all last week when' speaking on ""the cost of living, but Argus did not publish it . I said then that I would domy best to see that producers secured any legitimate increase to I which they were entitled by reason of an increase in the cost df production. to What I object, to is the practice, when there is Id. increase in wages, of adding Is. to the price of the commodity produced, r I should now like to deal with the matter of remitting such questions as the cost of livin g to the Inter-State Commission. In the last Parliament; about the beginning of March, the honourable member for Maribyrnong and others drew attention to the proposed prohibition of the importation of luxuries, and I myself threw across the table to the Prime Minister a note upon the subject. That question of the importation of luxuries was remitted to the Interstate Commission, but , although five months have elapsed, not a single report has been presented to Parliament. Shall we have to wait as long for a report! on the prices of commodities? I do not say one word about the personnel of the Comi mission, the members of which have done good work, and one, I know, is busily engaged at the Treasury.",6
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that the honourable member for Yarra has no right whatever to make an argumentative and controversial speech at this stage under cover of the leave generously granted to him by, the House.",7
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I can only say that the honourable member for Yarra in formed me bhat he wished to make certain statements-in reference to observations by the Prime Minister. I told the honourable member that it would be necessary for him to obtain the leave of the House,and that leave has been given. I am not in a position to dictate to the honourable member what he shall say.",7

25,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am also dealing with facts, and the first fact is that the waterside workers never refused to deal with stuff for war work.",7
26,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is not true; they refused to load the Medic and the Runic.,7
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I must ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the statement that what the honourable member for Yarra has said is not true.,7

NORTHERN TERRITORY : REAPPOINTMENT OF DB . GILRUTH .",8
40,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I haye received an intimation from the honourable member for Brisbane that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent publio importance, viz., "" The reappointment of Dr Gilruth as Administrator of the Northern Territory."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",8
41,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Brisbane) [3.0] The matter with which I wish to deal was it is referred to by me and other honourable the members during the debate on the Supply Bill on the l l t h July last. Since that date I have secured such further information as justifies me in making' a special feature of this question because of the contradictory statements that are in cirBoard, culation. When I made my remarks on the l l t h July I asked the.Deputy Leader of the Government and the Treasurer if any offer for the purchase of the Northern Territoiy had been made as reported to any member of the Government or to the Government! as a whole, Sir Johh Forrest replied, "" I have never heard of it ; "" and r . Joseph Cook said, "" None whatever; absolutely none."" I am quite willing to believe that those honourable gentlemen time were stating what) they believed to be true, and what, so far as they were conr o m cerned, was true. But that there was something in the statement is borne out memby the following paragraph which apwithpeared in the Age of the 6th July' f h Minister for Home and Territories (Mr. Glynn), to whom it was alleged the offer of ti purchase had been made, 'admitted yesterday the Administrator had made some''' reference, to a purchase of the Territory, but he not regard the matter seriously. Mr. Glynn said that when last he was in office as o Minister for External Affairs, three years ago, when going into the position of the Territory with the Administrator, he remembered Dr Gilruth casually mentioning that he thought a chartered company would take the Territory U PJ pay off the debt, and develop the country. He (Mr Glynn) replied in effect that such a proposal did not commend itself to bim. No such offer as mentioned by Mr Bedford was' ever made to the Government, nor did he regard Dr Gilruth's observation as more than a casual remark, strengthening his belief in the possibilities of the country. The Minister added that they had reached a stage of development from which they could not revert to chartered companies. A chartered company was, the next stage after a protectorate, and then followed the creation of a Crown colony, ""I w is h to s u b m it the f o l l o w in d a v it on t h is matter : I', Randolph Bedford, of Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, journalist, do solemnly and sincerely declare-^ On the afternoon of the 12th February, 1917, I was visiting the Hon.

Bamford, M.P., in the Ministers room at the Department of Home and Territories, Melbourne - As 1 was leaving the room I met a Mr Rigby, who told me he wanted to introduce me "" to somebody."" ]', with him, entered a room near the Minister's room, and .was introduced to Dr Gilruth, Administrator of the Northern Territory. Dr Gilruth complained ""that I had been attacking His 'administration, and I told him that I had not yet finished the attack,. and that the administration seemed to dislike Australians. In the conversation ensuing, Dr Gilruth said that the Territory was difficult to administer, and that, on behalf of a syndicate, he had offered the Commonwealth £5,000,000 for the purchase of the Territory, and to spend £10,000,000 within two years of the purchase. I asked him how he proposed to govern the Territory in such event, and he .said it would be administered by a company on the lines of the British Chartered Company of South Africa. I said that that was no good to White Australia, and that I would do my best against any sale of a Territory four times the size of France at any price. ' He then hurriedly told me that the information, unsought by me, was the not for publication, and a few minutes later I left for the Sydney express. t 1 .have not so far published, the conversation, and would not now make this declaration didI not believe many of the Liberals new Parliament to be suspect of complaisance or agreement in this matter, and did I not apprehend danger to Australia's development and Australia's ideal destiny of a high try for the white man. For those reasons the confidence forced upon me I now break with much pleasure, so that Australians can demand full particulars of ""the offer, and pronounce m against its repetition.

There was g sworn affino warrant for MrT"" Bedford's statement beyond* the fact {Cat he (Dr Gilruth) had informed him that he had asked the Minister, in the course of a general conversation, whether he thought the Government would sell the Territory. The statement by Dr Gilruth is, in spirit and essence, untrue. . . . He did not mention the matter "" lightly, "" he' said it forcibly, seriously, and as if disgusted, at the refusal of the offer, and rather pitying the intelligence of the refusers. He used the words "" of f e r "" and "" syndicate,"" and that his intention was serious and not "" l i g h t "" is proved by the details he had already thought out and had given me. . . .

Mr FINLAYSON.'-The industrial troubles have been so painfully frequent, and so unfortunately bitter, during Dr Gilruth's term of office, that there only disappointment with regard to the past, but also considerable apprehentween sion in regard to the future. This stateclosely ment is borne-out by the fact that when Dr Gilruth was returning to the Norwe thern Territory, the residents gave an hibition of their feelings in regard to re-appointment. The following report peared in the Brisbane Standard on the 31st July: A mass meeting was held in Darwin to test against the re-appointment of Dr Gilruth as. Administrator of the Territory. The Mayor presided, and""' numerous speakers referred neither use n o r r o q m „ specifically to various acts of alleged ministration, particularly in the Mines ment, the Jensen inquiry, and the Batchelor and' Daly Biver farm experiments, the limited Knowledge of the Administrator, his excision of. experts,'the suppression of 'facts, and leading statements Handed to the Southern community. press, and the continuous misrepresentation of the various industries. . . . vigorously protested against the mock reception to be tendered the Administrator,, as engiby an official clique of puppets. . . . Some severe criticisms of inquiries as to the method of eliminating some of the troublesome not subservient to the Administrator, passed, notably, ine, cases of Dr Jensen and Mr .Beckett. It was suggested that a mass meeting be held outside the hall when the reception is to be to the Administrator by card only, to the show the real feeling of the citizens. n regard to the same matter, the followTering telegramappeared-in the Age on the a heavy and 7th of this month: .

On Tuesday evening, in the Town Hall, Dr Gilruth was welcomed home at a social evening by the citizens. the These reports show that there is among a Dr section of the community in Darwin and the Northern Territory generally a very strong personal feeling against the methods adopted by the Administrator.",10

Here let me quote from a statement made by Dr Jensen which appeared in the Brisbane Worker on l|2th July lastInstead of attempting to create bond settlement, the Administration has handed the best of the country to a monopoly, has stunted the, mining industry by changes time when it was making headway, and killed all hope of agricultural settlement putting a large number of good, hard-working poses. settlers on unsuitable land, treating them harshly, and dictating to them as if they children. The Land Board, consisting of an accountant (a new chum to the Territory, who has been off the railway line), a survey draughtsas man (with a minimum experience of land), and a clerk, decides where people should settle deliberation in Darwin. George Ryland, who had extensive expericlass ence of land in Queensland, having ploughed his old bicycle through every part of this was discarded as Director of Lands to make room, for pets of the Administrator. No wonder most of the settlers hadto leave through starvation. . . . The poor postmaster, a widely respected man, became so worried that he blew his brains out, and one of the unfortunate Daly settlers drowned himself. Glynn also laments that he cannot get married men with families to stay in the Northern Territory. That, too, is essentially the ministrator's fault - His alterations of working them. hours, school hours, and office hours have created conditions intolerable to all domestic life among those who are id the Public Service and have families. The Public Service Asso ciation protested again and again - Mr FINLAYSON I can supplement that statement by a letmember deny it ? ter that I have received from a man who has abandoned his selection Biver: I knew him in Brisbane. went to the Northern Territory to take up any charge. one of the blocks on the Daly River, and he wrote to me on the 6th November of is indicating one. last year as follows: Ycm will see by the address that we have left the Daly. This was the only course, for us, as the treatment was abominable. One of the settlers has got his clearance through the influence of one of the senators who came here' (Senator Newland), and now, owing to the treatment we are receiving from the officials, I am appealing to you to help I received your letter some few weeks ago that you sent up the line to me, also the official's letter, and I am satisfied that we get no justice from him. You will have enough about the Territory, Hut what musti be for us that are here? [35]. The developmental policy of the Northern Territory under the administration of Dr Gilruth has been on wrong lines. Whatever Dr Jensen means by the statement : that the best parts of the land' have been given to a certain monopoly, there is, at any rate, a suspicion in the minds of many people that when .Dr Gilruth made that offer of £5,000,000 for the Northern Territory under the conditions specified, the fide company behind him was the same comover pany that has established meat works at at a Darwin, and which has secured a very has large control over the lands of the by Northern . Territory for grazing purI t is only reasonable that were this company should have behind it reasonable facilities for growing cattle, and keeping its meat works full y hardly employed, and I do not object, so long the conditions under which it secured by control of that land do not preclude other settlers who are anxious to do the same of work from having an equal opportunity with it ; but if there is any conState, nexion between Dr Gilruth and Vestey Bros., then at once we have an illuminating comment in regard to the offer that is said to have been made.",10
50,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Does the honourable member say that there is any connection between them?,11
51,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,I do not. I say that there is suspicion in the minds of the Adpublic that there is a connection between,11
52,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,The honourable member should not make such a statement unless he has reasonable grounds for making it . - Can the honourable,11

54,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,The honourable member,11
55,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I am indicating that inquiries in that directionmight left show the inspiration of the offer that is said to have been made. At any rate, my impression is that the administration of the Northern Territory under Dr Gilruth has not only been on wrong lines for us. securing the best results, but has also been carried out in such a fashion as to irritate shall the people who have gone to the Terriresa tory, After all the money that has been t expended and the efforts that have been made to settle the very fine land along the Daly River, tliere is absolute and complete failure. I have my own ideas regarding the development of the Northern Territory, which I may state during the Budget debate. It seems to me that not only does Dr Gilruth find ways and means for the development of the Territory along the lines not likely to lead to success, but that he has a penchant for irritating those who are desirous of developing it . Whether he is seeking to help Messrs. Vestey Brothers, as perhaps, the only means of developing the Territory, may be open to argument, but that has been the effect of his administration. Not even the building of railway lines or other developmental"" work seems to him to offer like opportunities for development. I think that the mining industry should be encouraged equally with the pastoral industry. Dr Gilruth's conduct generally is well set' out in a letter which was published in the Brisbane Standard on the 19th July. It is therein stated thatThe administration of the Northern Territory during the term the Federal Government has controlled it has been on the lines of the German Crown Colony. There' has been in the Territory an absolute autocracy, no. popular representation of any kind whatever, no means for the people to voice their grievances (as there is in a subdued way in the Legislative Councils of British Crown colonies); there has been a system of espionage, accompanied by victimization .of every official or private individual, worker, or business man who ventured to express his disapproval of the brutal Hunnisli ways of the administration. "" Black listing "" of workers who were not potential scabs was openly practised by the Administration, and instructions sent to the Departments not to employ those who were black-listed. Men who scabbed on the unions were shown favours and given preference. In every way Huunish methods were followed. Let me dwell brieflyon the administration of the Northern Territory from the financial point of view. The figures that I propose to give have been, obtained from the summary of Australian statistics recently issued by the Commonwealth Statistician. This officer shows that the deficiency in the accounts of the Northern Territory was, for the year 1910-11, £166,856; for the year 1911-12, £364,368; for the year £388,658; for the year £458,878; for the year £391,862; for the year £642,512; and for the year according to the information given to us by the Treasury yesterday, £690,555. Mr Finlayson.",11
56,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Does that include the railways ?,12
57,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"It includes the Port Augusta and the Pine Creek"" railways. On the 30th June the total deficiency was £2,778,265 . This matter calls for serious and close attention. On the average, we have lost £500,000 in the Territory every year.",12
58,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,That is a legacy under the agreement with South Australia.,12
59,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"No . In 1910-11 the deficiency was only £166,000, and it has grown under Dr Gilruth's administration to £690,000.",12
60,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I have prepared a memorandum analyzing the position, which I shall lay on the table tomorrow.",12
61,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"The Minister told me some time ago that he was preparing a memorandum, and I hope that this discussion may induce him to give attention to matters which might otherwise be overlooked. As only a minute or two of the time allowed to me under the Standing Orders remains, I must pass over a good many matters that I had in tended to mention regarding the detrimental effects of Dr Gilruth's administration. I submit that the remedy for the present position can be stated under four headings. The first thing to be done is to immediately recall Dr Gilruth. Every one was disappointed that the Government, when it had an opportunity to get away from the experience of the past few years, did not appoint to the A d ministratorship some one with better qualifications for the position. Very few in the Territory wanted Dr Gilruth back, and people generally down here did not expect that he would be re-appointed. As I said on the l l t h July, the only comfort we have is that the re-appointment is for a short term, and I suggest Dr Gilruth's immediate recall. I suggest, too, the combination of the administrative and financial judicial offices. I do not know why the Administrator should not also be the judicial oflicer. The population is so small that, with proper administration, bhere Would not betoo much work for. one man if the two offices were combined. 1912-13, Then all the Northern Territory Depart1913-14, ments' should be reorganized. I am in 1914-15, formed that these Departments are 1915-16, notoriously over-staffed, and exist more 1916-17, for the sake of the officers than for their use to the State. Lastly, I suggest the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire intotihe administration of the Territory, and to advise Parliament as. to the possibility of reform. One of our most important-and most humane-obli gations in the Northern Territory relates to the aboriginals. It is one of the worse features of Dr Gilruth's administration that the treatment of the aboriginals of the Territory has been rather a duplication of some of the ..worse previous experiences of Australian history, and not on the lines that modern humanity Would desire, or that this House would wish to be followed.",12
62,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,That is rather a serious statement. Can the honourable gentleman state facts in support of it?,13
63,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Yes , if the honourable member will move for an extension of my time. I have piles of documents here.",13
64,Mr LIVINGSTON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Will the honourable member vouch for the statements contained in them?,13
65,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,They are over reliable signatures. The office of Chief 'Inspector of Aboriginals has juslt been abolished and Mr Beckett's statement is T that the administration of the Territory with regard to the treatment of aboriginals is not such as any member of this House can be proud of. I am certain that every member will be glad to see an alteration made in this matter. It is ' a duty that we owe tb the aboriginals.,13
66,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Batman) [3.32] - In adding a word or two to what the honourable member for Brisbane has said, I shall begin by referring to the matter witli which he was dealing when the Standing Orders compelled him to finish his speech, that is, the treatment of the aboriginals in 'the Northern Territory. One of the saddest things in Australian history is the fact that the aboriginals of this country have been degraded and debauched by their association with civilization.  to keep the white man out of the Northern Territory.",13
67,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"This state of things does not reflect much credit on our civiSzation. I view with the greatest regret the withdrawal of the Chief Inspector of Aboriginals consequent upon the abolition of his office. Mr Beckett was a most conscientious and able officer, whose experience of Australian aboriginals is equalled by few, if any, in Australia. [35]- 2  about aboriginals before he went to the Territory?",13
68,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Yes , a great deal. He had »had a long and intimate acquaintance with them as the result of his travels and observations from the north to the south of Australia. This is a delicate matter, and if tliere are any with in hearing whose, duty does not. compel them to-remain while I mention what I conceive to be certain facts in connection with the aboriginals and their relations ^ with the white men of the Territory, they should take this opportunity to retire. I wish to put it on record that it is one of the very gravest things in connection with our responsibility to a subject race that it is stated by the Chief Inspector himself that ihere have been men in the employment of the Commonwealth termed protectors of aborigines who have openly carried i on immoral intercourse with them.",13
69,Mr BAMFORD,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,The honourable member is making a very grave charge now.  outside.,13
70,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"It is a charge which may be made outside as well as in side' Parliament, because the facts have been admitted by the departmental head, and are capable of conclusive proof by the Chief Inspector. It is a known fact' that there are children being reared and looked, after by the Northern Territory Missions, and others, who owe their shameful origin to officials paid by the Commonwealth. If honourable members wish to challenge serious statements, I will make them, and proof of them can be easily obtained. There is anacknowledged traffic of this disgraceful and disgusting character going on between a regrettably large number of white people and the blacks in the Northern Territory. It is within the knowledge of every self-respecting resident of the Territory that male blacks in and about Darwin are selling their females to white men. I would be quite prepared to support a Bill providing for the penalty of imprisonment, or such a substantial fine, for i m moral intercourse of that kind, as would remove so disgraceful a stain from this country. Proof of all these statements is forthcoming if an opportunity be offered for producing it in greater detail. It can be easily understood that, in the. short time at my disposal; it is impossible deal adequately with it. Let me turn how to another subIment ject. One of the Ordinances"" of the to Northern Territory provides that no of Chinese may employ aboriginals. Notwithstanding that fact, I have very strong evidence-int o which I wish the Minister to make inquiries-that the Government Secretary put his signature, or, at all events, officially consented in way, to the employment of aboriginals Chinese. I have the very strongest eviseen dence that, as the result of that consent, given in contravention of an Ordinance of this Parliament, four Australian blacks were employed by a Chinese on a lugger, or like vessel, and that while so employed they were drowned.",13
71,Mr CORSER,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,When was this done?,14
72,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I have no* time to refer to the correspondence, but it is recent history. I come now to another ter. We have in the Northern Territory Supreme Court Judge-Judg e Bevan- a gentleman whom I know well, and have always respected. It is on record that Judge Bevan quite openly-and apparently, he believes, and would have believe, with propriety-entere d into acontract with one Mr Hope for the purquite chase of a copper mine in the Northern concerned ? Territory from the Government. Such an action on the part of the' Judge of the Northern Territory ought to be depretion cated; I certainly deprecate the kind. ' highest judicial officer in the Territory entering into big commercial contracts with the Government that he is serving a judicial capacity. In this contract there was a condition, so I am - informed, that only white - and no Chinese-shoul d be (employed. As a matter of fact, however,. Chinese labour was employed on the mine. A little later, when the matter became pubother. lic, it was urged in defence of the action of the owners of the mine in employing Chinese labour, that there had been a variation of the solemn agreement enis tered into when the mine was sold to employ Chinese labour. these gentlemen. The file was turned up, and a short document, signed by Judge Bevan and another, Was covered. It was in the form of a letter, and that letter is also on record. I a photo of it, and, speaking from memory, to its terms were somewhat as follows:Following upon our telephone conversation, now repeat that the condition in the agreeas to the non-employment of Chinese, is be read subject to there being a sufficiency other labour available for that purpose.",14
73,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Who wrote that letter ?,14
74,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"It was written by Judge Bevan for himself and Mr Hope, his co-purchaser of the mine: This letter, some which is on the file, was repudiated by by Dr Jensen, who said, "" I have never it before."" It was not minuted by the Administrator as having been received by him, nor was it minuted by of. Jensen as having been received by him. What I desire to criticise-and I think it is in this regard that Judge' Bevan should be asked for an explanation-is the fact that, as the Chief Judicial Officer of the Territory, he purports to vary a most solemn agreement by a short, hastilyquite prepared memorandum written on a piece matof notepaper, signed, by himself and his a co-partner in this enterprise, and placed upon the file, although no record is now available as to whether it was ever seen by the men to whom it was addressed.",14
75,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Is there any evidence as us to whether that letter reached the file properly, so far as the Judge is",14
76,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"On this point I am not absolutely certain, but my informais that it bears no minute of any",14
77,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,No receipt stamp?,14
78,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Neithe r a receipt in stamp nor <any other stamp, nor any other kind; but it will speak for itself.",14
79,Mr MAXWELL,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Who was the other labour party to the contract? ,14
80,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"The contract was as between Mr Hope and Judge Bevan on the one hand, and the Government on the In dismissing the matter for the present, I submit that it was most improper to purport to vary such an agreement. At the root of the whole incident the question of whether it wap right tb I am viewthen ing the matter, however, not from that stand-point, but from the point disof view as to whether or not a considered agreement should be dealt have with in that way by any person, and particularly by a gentleman of the eminence and the reputation-whic h I am glad to acknowledge-of the Judge of the Northern Territory. On the general question of the reappointment of Dr Gilruth, I think that a very reasonable protest was addressed to this House some little time back by the honourable member for Wakefield when he urged that that re-appointment might well have awaited consideration by Parliament, especially in view of the fact that Dr Gilruth, at the time it was made, had been in Melbourne on full pay for some eight or nine months. I think it was almost an affront to this House to make a re-appointment in those circumstances and at that time, in view of the general knowledge that it would receive far from the unanimous approval of this House, and would be the subject of very grave criticism from both sides. Dr Gilruth, however, was re-appointed, and in war time,' at a salary of £1^700 a year. I deliberately assert-and I am not attempting to make any party capital out of this-that it was an affront to the people of this country to re-appoint that officer, however excellent he may be, at such a salary, and to add to it an entertainment allowance of £500 per annum.",14
81,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.46] - I was not in the House when the honourable member for Brisbane first raised this question, but I understand that he said that Dr Gilruth had informed the Government that he could obtain from a chartered company, or some other body, an offer to take over the Territory. I can only say that no such offer was ever made to me or to any other member of the Government. When I was last in office, some three years ago, I was anxious to cut down expenditure in the Northern Territory, and I then discussed with Dr Gilruth the necessity for curtailing its increase. also raised some questions about the position of the farms, and as to whether agriculture could profitably be carried on up there. As he rose from his chair at the end of the interview on that occasion, Dr Gilruth remarked, ""Well, would you handover the Territory to a chartered company?"" He, at all events, used words to that effect, but I shut down the matter at once, and there was no further reference to it. I do not think our conversation on the matter extended over more than half a minute, and certainly the remarks as to handing over the Territory did not extend over more than a few seconds. What led Dr Gilruth to make such an observation I do not know, but, later on, when it reached the importance of a news^ paper statement on the subject, it occurred to me that Dr Gilruth was endeavouring to emphasize his optimism as to the future of the Territory. When I heard of this newspaper criticism, I asked Dr Gilruth what it all meant. He then told me that he met Mr Randolph Bedford on the occasion of a visit paid by the latter to Mr Bamford",15
82,Mr FALKINER,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,And Mr Randolph Bedford is a reliable Labour journalist.,15
83,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Dr Gilruth, from his occasional proximity to politicians, perhaps, was rather sensitive to criticism, and he told Mr Bedford that he thought he had reason to complain of his continual attacks on the Territory. He disapproved of this destructive criticism, and thought that there should be, on Mr Bedford's part, a better recognition of the difficulties in the way of the development of the Territory. That conversation led up to some statement by Dr Gilruth to Mr Bedford, to the effect that he had some two years previously told .the then Minister for External Affairs that the Territory could be managed by a chartered company."" I believe he mentioned to him that some such company as that which managed a part of the British Empire in South Africa-the Rhodesian Company-coul d be formed, but he assured me that he had no particular company in his mind at the time. He made no offer to me, and I placed not the slightest significance on his passing remark about the possibility. What, probably, was unconsciously in his mind was the financial position when w tooke I over the Territory. When the Territory was taken over on the 1st January. 1911, by the Commonwealth, I had myself to go into the facts a good deal, and I - also took occasion, when settling the terms of the measure, to examine the finances. I found that an offer had been madeto Sir Frederick Holder, who was then Premier of South Australia; by a company, or a number of capitalists prepared to form' a company, to take over the Territory for about £10,250,000, on the condition-this is the point -'that they ' were allowed to introduce coloured labour. At the, time of the transfer the indebtedness of the Territory was about £6,000,000, including the Port Augusta railway and all other works. Further, we entered into an obligation, not yet carried out,, with South Australia to continue' the transcontinental line up from Oodnadatta and down from Pine Creek. To do this would have cost an additional sum, bringing up the total to about £10,250,000. figures that have been referred to today principally have to do with the payment of interest and redemption fro m year to year. South Australia's plan was not to redeem loans as they fell due, but to add them to the debt and consolidate them. In our case we acted from a much better point of view, and when we have money it is just as well to spend it in one way than, perhaps, squander it in another. In other words, we paid off our debts as they fell due, and in one year no less than £500,000 was liquidated. When honourable members talk about the figures being increased, their statements may be qualified by the fact that when I was in office about 1914, the deficit in the annual accounts on ordinary expenditure and works-whio h is the test, and not the redemption fund and interest-wa s £202,000, and the expenditure £274,000. I reduced the expenditure to about £208,000 at one stroke, and the deficit ' to £135,000 during my term of office; and I can show that there has not been an increase of £60,000 since the Territory was taken over. It is the redemption that causes the trouble; and, as the honourable member for Franklin has asked for a statement on the point. I shall tomorrow, if ready, read one that has beeu prepared. No offer was made to me, nor would I at any time entertain one, to barter away to any company our obligations. about three weeks ago a capitalist came to me in Adelaide, who was prepared to construct the transcontinental asked me, "" Is there any chance of any offer to construct that iine being considered ?"" and I replied, "" There is none, if you mean on such terms as were embodied in the South' Australian > These are the facts in regard to the offer. The honourable member has referred to a number of grievances; and in ilfr. Glynn. this connection I wish I could remember the words of a missionary writer in a very neat periodical called The Inlander, issued, I believe, by the Methodists, or one of the religious, bodies, which are doing such good work amongst the blacks in Central Australia. That missionary said he regretted to have to express an opinion at all, because he was sure that there would be immediately three or four other opinions expressed to controvert his; and that is the case with the Northern Territory. The honourable The member for Brisbane referred to two cases, and, apparently, the honourable member' for Batman has recently been given a political brief in the' matter of Mr Beckett. It is rather significant that I should have met Mr Beckett, and I then asked him to reduce to writing the complaints-som e of the very complaints we have heard here today. i felt that i n1 justice to Mr Beckett, and those whom he impugned, the charges ought to be madein black and white, and I was expecting such a document, with a view to making inquiry. I do not wish to go into Mr . Beckett's case, or to say one word against that officer. I spent many nights going through the files of papers-which , by the way, have gone to Darwin-and with the scrutiny of a lawyer and a M in ister, who ought to keep his mind unbiased, I made a complete analysis of the evidence and the judgment of the Judge, almost acting as a defender in case of any possible injustice. I made a minute on the matter, which was sub judice at the time, that the vacancy created in his office was not at all affected by that case. Nor do I see that Mr Beckett, or any one else, has come badly out of it .",15
84,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,That is why I think he is a good witness.,16
85,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I have not a word to say against Mr Beckett, but, with due respect to him . I do not tliink that' it is Only quite fair, nor in accord with the finest sense of members of the House, that, when allegations are made on ' one side, line. He and the Minister is waiting for definite evidence, the matter should be raised in the House. All ' we have as yet is Mr . Beckett's version; and, as I told him , I hoped he would not expect me to assume Act."" a thing proved against another officer, considering that I would not accept anything against him until I had heard what he had to say. I read both sides of the correspondence. I do not believe there is very much in the statement of the aboriginal position at the present time. Unfortunately, contact with whites has to some extent a degrading effect on aboriginals, and they present a very difficult problem. I have considered the matter with Spencer and others; but, do what we may, the trouble seems almost insuperable. I read the charges about the aboriginals and made inquiries; but I do not think that the House is the place in which to discuss them. Only a few cases are mentioned; and nearly always, when a man leaves office, some disputes of the kind arise. Dr Jensen made a series of charges, which were reduced to forty-three in number, principally against Dr Gilruth,",16
86,Mr BOYD,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,How many charges were there at the start?,17
87,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I was not in 'office, I.do not know. I myself gave Dr Jensen' a certificate of competency as a manwho had done good work in the mining branch in the Territory. It is true that Dr Jensen did not leave his appointment when I was in office, but I thought that, in justice to him, he was entitled' to the certificate. In these matters you can never get absolute accuracy, for opinions will differ. The charges made were in quired into by a Sydney magistrate, who found every one of them disprovedWhat is a Minister to do ? Is he to listen nightafter night to reiterated charges? If so, how can he be expected to carry on the administration? I really do not know whether it is worthwhile referring to any other point. The Aboriginal Department has been presided over for a time by Professor Spencer.",17
88,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"The honourable member for Batman said that a document of a very important nature had found its way on to a public file, without any notification of how it came, there.",17
89,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,In connection with the Judge ?,17
90,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Varyin g a which the Judge ought not to have made with the Government.,17
91,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I do not think there was anything in that, speaking from memory, and the impression made on me at the time ; but if the honourable membei will ask a formal question on the subject, which did not arise during my term of office,'I shall tell him the facts from the departmental point of view. As far as I saw at the time, there was not any justification for the attempt to throw disrepute on the Judge, for the transaction seemed to have been a bond fide one.",17
92,Mr KELLY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"As the .statement has been made it ought to be cleared up, in Professor fairness to the Judge.",17
93,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,I shall look up the file.,17
94,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I took it for granted that the matter would be looked into. I assumed that the matter haying been raised, and the fact of this document pointed out, - the Minister would take the trouble to make inquiry.",17
95,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"So far as I could see, there was no justification for imputations that were being made; it was simple repetition.",17
96,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Assumin g that there was a contract, does the Minister and agree thab a Judge should enter into contracts ?",17
97,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Not at all ; and I made a note of the matter the moment I heard of it . I do not wish, however without T refreshing my memory, to express an opinion,' but I shall be pleased to do so at some future date if honourable members wish. One of Mr Beckett's complaints was that Mr Carey, his chief, did not try him. Technically, I think that Mr . Beckett was right.",17
98,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I had not time to"" go into that matter.",17
99,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"The honourable member went into as much as he could. I do not wish to discuss the merits of the question, but simply to point out that Mr Carey refused to sit as a Judge, because he thought he was, to some extent, affected by certain charges, and he feared that, he might afterwards be said to have acted in a case to which he was a party.",17
100,Mr FINLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Would not Judge Bevan have been the only court of appeal ?,17
101,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"That also was one of contract Mr Beckett's cases, and honourable - members seem, to have been very well primed up. I am not attempting to form any opinion against Mr Beckett, who, in my view, has not suffered at aU by the in quiry that took place.",17
102,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"It is very seldom ' we can get any information from the Territory, and when we do,- we wish"" to verify",17
103,Mr GLYNN,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Nearl y all the information is supplied from outside, and five-sixths of it is destructive criticism. very much regret that a little more optimism is i not displayed in reference to this damnosa hereditas of ours. When a lease is put up for sale in the Territory in country adjoining Queensland, at a lower'rental for equally good land, some fatality prevents it being taken up; and that, I suppose, is the fault of Dr Gilruth. He may be 800 miles away, but still his second person is there all the time. An objection has been raised that Dr Gilruth is paying too much attention to pastoral matters; but, really, the last complainb was that he was not attending to them at all. We are told, to speak colloquially, that this is a pastoral proposition altogether. I do not think it ie an agricultural proposition.",18
104,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,The Minister's has expired.,18
105,Dr MALONEY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Melbourne) [4.3] I am surprised that the Minister did not tell us that the people up in the Territory are much like helots, without votes citizen rights. There is no Judge so dominant or 'powerful as the Judge present up there; and if ""the recall were in operation, as in some of the America, he would be dragged from the Bench if they considered him unworthy.",18
106,Mr BOYD,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,There would have to be the initiative as well.,18
107,Dr MALONEY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Exactly ; but I am sure that the honourable member, if he had to be tried in .the Territory,- would not like to be tried without a jury. .",18

117,Dr MALONEY,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"As a doctor of veterinary science, Dr Gilruth possesses the highest diploma given in his profession, and I could recommend him for an opinion on stock; but there are .Australians who know more about land than he does. Dr Jensen, on the other hand, is a doctor of science, and I doubt if you could count doctors of science by the hundred where you could count doctors of veterinary science by the thousand. I am very glad that the honourable member for Batman brought under the notice of the House the brutal treatment of the time aborigines. I have never met Mr. Beckett, but the Minister seemed to suggest that an opinion given by that gentleman to Mr Brennnn should be put aside.",18

I make that statement on the authority of his lordship the Bishop of Carpentaria-Dr White. When I was on Thursday Island, I found there was the greatest difficulty in getting drugs. Although in Victoria men, women, and doctors are being penalized in fines of from £10 to £100 if they do not give proas per attention to the treatment of these diseases, yet in the Territory, where the missionaries were willing to give their services free to cure suffering humanity, obstacles were thrown in their way. I can hardly say that I should like a Royal Commission - appointed to investigate Northern Territory affairs, for any one conversant with the history of the Terriknows - that the reports of Commissions are filed yards high. But, in God's name, what is the use of paying a man £44 per week to administer the Northern and keeping him in Melbourne for nine months! Some honourable member, interjected that the only industry in the the Territory was pastoral.

Dr on the Northern Territory Gilruth was certain that if future experiof any member of the House. ments in rice growing proved successful, they would be able to reap it by maNorthern chinery and employ white labour at-white man's wages. But why does not this man, for its development. who draws a salary of £1,750 and an lowance of £500, set an example to other - residents of the Territory by employing white people in his own house ? It be said tnat if white girls are sent the Territory they marry. Do we not want them to marry, and rear children populate the Territory? I urge the Minagainst ister to see that any girls who are sent the Territory travel first class, and in the steerage.

Next to water conservation, the Minister has to handle, in the development of the Northern Territory, the greatest Australian problem with which we are con. fronted.",19
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,The honourable member's time has expired.,20
129,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Wimmera) [4.17] - I ; do not intend to discuss the treatment of the aborigines of the Northern Territory from the stand-point of the honourable member for Batman, but I do believe that the time is long overdue when this Parliament should take some action to found a broad policy for dealing with the natives. I have had an opportunity of visiting the Territory, and I am convinced that the treatment of the aborigines has been too long neglected. has never been taken in hand in a way calculated to do justice to them. I believe that if the Minister were to call for special reports from his medical - cers and the administrative staff in the Territory it would be possible to found without great expense a policy that would deal out greater justice to the thousands of aborigines, large numbers of whom are coming into contact with the white population to their serious detriment. The charges made by the honourable member for Brisbane against the Administrator are chiefly founded on statements by Dr Jensen, who was at one time an official in the Territory, and by Mr Randolph Bedford. My observation, when I was in the Territory, was that a big contest is in progress between Mr Nelson, the head of the labour organizations at Darwin, and Dr Gilruth, and, as the leader of the labour organizapenditure tions has a majority of people behind him, necessarily he can make things very hot for the Administrator., I do hot wish to defend all Dr Gilruth's acts of administration. Like every being, he has made mistakes, but the failure of the Northern Territory so far has been very largely due to this Parliament. An Administrator was' sent to the Territory to face difficulties that no human individual could overcome, and he has been left without any proper direction from the National Parliament in regard to a continuous policy. Since the Territory has been taken over by the Commonwealth, there has been only one Minister who has made anything like a real attempt to outline a policy for it, and that is the Minister who is now controlling it. He has introduced some good development work. He has put down bores in the interior, thus providing water supplies which help the pastoral industry; and his agreement with Vestey Brothers is the only really substantial development work that has been carried out with a view to increasing the popula-, tion, as well as the productivity of that northern country. In fact, these are the only two pieces of work that can be claimed by this Parliament as having anything of a permanent nature about them, or as dealing in a comprehensive way with the development of the Northern Territory. .",20
130,Mr FINXAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,It is only fair to say It that the .agreement with Vestey Brothers was the development of a proposal put forward by a Labour Government.,20
131,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I do not say that offithe completion of the agreement was the matter of an hour or a day. I do not intend to go into the history of the transaction. I merely say that the completion of the agreement, which had been developing for some time, was achieved under the direction of the present Minister. The failure of the Commonwealth Parliament in regard to the Northern Territory lies in the fact that, during the ""period when taxation was, being imposed, and our revenue was largely increasing, and we had millions to spend, we did not lay down a strong, broad, comprehensive policy of development covering a period of ten, or even twenty, years, and meaning an exof, perhaps, £20,000,000.. If that had been done, the Administrator, when he arrived in the Northern Territory, would have known exactly what he had to do. He would have been charged human' with the specific task of carrying out the Government policy. The honourable member for Brisbane has quoted Dr Jensen. The Minister has - already pointed out that, so far as his indictment of Dr Gilruth was concerned, Dr Jensen left the Northern Territory a discredited man, whose charges had been found by a judicial tribunal to be utterly groundless. The honourable member should not have quoted Dr, Jensen unless he was able to back up, by indisputable evidence, in other directions, the statements of one whose charges had been tried and found wanting by a judicial tribunal.",20
132,Mr FTNLAYSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,Does the member suggest that the inquiry held into Dr Jensen's charges was a satisfactory tribunal?,21
133,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"The honourable member could ask for nothing more conclusive than the fact that the forty-five charges brought by Dr Jensen against the Administrator of the Northern Terri tory were tried before a police magistrate sent from Sydney for the purpose, and every one of them failed. Dr Jensen was certainly put "" out of c o u r t "" as an indicter of the Adrninistrator. But the honourable member for Brisbane was on sound ground when he' indicated the existence of divided, control. In this great Northern Territory, several thousands of miles away from the Commonwealth Seat of Government, there are all sorts of different authorities in conflict. The Post Office is ruled from one branch, the railways are under another control, the Land Titles Office is under another control, and, on top- of all, the Administrator is supposed to exercise a general supervision over the Territory. All this division of control necessarily means conflict and warfare, and it has been brought about by the failure of the Commonwealth Government to place some individual or body of men in control of the Territory. I do not care whether the control is exercised by an Administrator, or whether some body which is partly elected and partly nominee exercises control, or whether some Commission is appointed. Whatever authority be constituted, it should-have vested in it general supervision over the whole of the Public Service in the Territory.",21
134,Mr WEBSTER,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,I offered to hand over the postal work.,21
135,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"Something of the - 1. sort should be done. I do not say Dr Gilruth' has not made mistakes. N individual could go into that Territory Weaving under the industrial conditions obtaining there during the last four or five years and please all the people with whom he had to come into contact. was remarked from these benches a little pany. while ago, a strong man must necessarily come into conflict with the industrial company. organizations in the Northern Terri tory. Here is an example of what the industrial conditions obtaining there have honourable meant. The estimated cost of building the meat works was £250,000, and when allowance was made for certain increases of material because of the outbreak of the war, the estimate was increased to £300,000, but it is well to know that be- . fore the works are completed the cost will considerably exceed £500,000. Mr..GLYNN -^-The cost will probably be £750,000.",21
136,Mr SAMPSON,UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUBLI C,"I do not say that labour troubles have been responsible for the whole of the increased cost of these works, but I know that one' season has already been lost owing to them, and that they have increased the expenditure to an enormous extent. I do not say that every workman in the Territory is prepared to go out on strike, or is not prepared to do his duty; but I know that the industrial organizations there have had the same kind of leadership as has been in evidence in the southern parts of rthe Commonwealth, with results well known to the community in the shape of industrial loss to Australia as a whole, as well as loss of wages and comforts to' the workers themselves. I know that it is impossible for the Minister to lay before this House anything like a broad, comprehensive policy, owing to the heavy expenditure incurred by the war, but I hope that it will be possible for him to give special attention to the matter of dealing with the aborigines. I hope that he will obtain reports from his officers, and see whether some improvement in that , branch of the administration cannot be . carried out without any further delay.

Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion,by Mr GROOM) read a first time. NA Motion (by Mr GROOM for Mr Hughes) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1915. PUBLIC SERVIOE BILL . . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 25th July (vide page 466), on motion by Mr HUGHES That this Bill be now read a second time.",23
149,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [4.34] - I wish to make one or two observations with regard to criticisms that have been levelled against the Bill. B y section 26A of the Act , which was assented to on the 13th September, 1915, it was provided that preference should be given in appointments to members of the Expeditionary Forces. The paragraph reads as follows: In the making of appointments to the Public Service from among persons who have successfully passed the prescribed examination, preference shall be given to those persons who have served with satisfactory record in any Expeditionary Force raised under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903-1915. During the debate objection has been to the Bill on the ground that it deals o n lyw ith the Clerical Division of the Public Service. The Bill refers particularly to that division because iti is necessary to provide for preference in regard to it . But the measure must be read in conjunction with .the existing legislation. There is at present no limit to the age at which persons may enter the Professional Division of the Public Service, and any person may enter the General D i v ision whose age on his last birthday was not less than sixteen nor more than fifty. Therefore it is not necessary to mention the Professional and General Divisions in the Bill .",23
150,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I understand that at present any person not more than f if t y years of age can enter the General Division, and that, under certain circumstances, a person not more than fifty-five years of age may be allowed to enter that.division, but that no person over twenty-five years of age can get into the Clerical Division.",23
151,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is so, and we have therefore extended the age l i m it applicable to the Clerical Division to pror vide for preference to returned soldiers. BILL. It has been questioned whether A r m y nurses will be able to take advantage of the proposed preference., Consideration was given to that matter before it was mentioned in the debate, and an instruction was issued for the preparation of an amendment which would make it clear that nurses may take' advantage of the proposed preference. Then, again, the Bill ' refers only to the Expeditionary Force raised under the Defence Act, and ""we therefore propose to move an amendment which will make it clear that the men serving in the Navy, who are entitled to as much consideration as those serving on land, shall be treated i h the same way.",23
152,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the Government going to continue the preference to members of disloyal unions?,23
153,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"^Suppos e returned soldiers"" belong to disloyal unions, will they be given preference?",24
154,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am, possibly, prevented by the Order of Leave from referring to. those matters. We shall do better to keep to the problem with which we have now to deal. I shall have circulated the amendments to which I have referred, so that honourable members may see how far they carry out the expressed intention of the Government. I have no desire to discuss the general question of temporary employment which has been raised during the debate. I think it ""will be acknowledged that the amendments will give effect to the intentions of the Government, and the desire of the House to provide effective preference for returned soldiers and sailors.",24
155,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Wilmot) [4.42] - I am sure that the measure meets with the approval of every member of 'the House. Our soldiers have been prepared to sacrifice everything for the country, and we should do what we can to show our gratitude for this sacrifice. Unfortunately;> it is beyond human possibility to full y repay them. At the same time, we must guard against any action which may be to the detriment of the public interest. I was called out of the chamber during the Minister's explanation, and therefoie I ask him whether the Bill limits the preference that is to be given to the Clerical Division of the Service?",24
156,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have explained that no legislative action is necessary to provide for preference in regard to the Professional and General Divisions.,24
157,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My desire is that there shall be preference in regard to all the divisions of the'Service. As to clause 3, it seems to me that without an amendment, it may do some harm to the public interest. I am sure that no returned, soldier wishes to be taken on as a casual employee, and retained permanently, but as the clause stands, soldiers temporarily - employed may become. virtually permanent employees. At the present time, temporary employees are appointed for six months, when they are supposed to make room for others, and at the Public Service Commissioner's office there arelong lists of the names of those waiting for such employment. But returned soldiers appointed as temporary employees will not be affected by any limitation of time, and this may work publio in j u r y . Ifc may happen that some thousands of temporaryemployees will be replaced with returned soldiers,- who, instead of being kept on merely for six months, may be retained much longer, to the detriment of the public interest.",24
158,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why should they not be retained so long as they do their work capably ?,24
159,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There may not be the work for them to do.,24
160,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is afraid that the clause may tend to cause congestion of the Public Service.,24
161,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . A f t e r a few years, custom will obtain its usual power, and the longer these men are in the Service the harder it will be to get rid? of them.",24
162,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member suggests that they wil l become virtually permanent employees.,24
163,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes ; though not in the sense in whioh those who obtain positions in the - Service by passing examinations are permanent. I wish to know if the Government is prepared to move an amendment to prevent fchis.,24
164,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Has-the honourable member in mind the fact that married men with families, who have volunteered, are being turned out of the Service to give preference to returned soldiers ?",24
165,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I was not alluding to that matter. No doubt there will be hard cases, but as it is the policy of the Government to give preference to returned men, every effort should be made to remove single men before married men when displacements are necessary to find positions for returned men. This has not always been done. I do not blame 'the Minister or those in high authority for what has occurred; ib is generally the result of the stupidity of some lower placed official who has carried outi his in structions in a thick-headed way. I am satisfied that some public servantssome of the men in the Defence Department more particularly-ar e responsible for much of the trouble and friction, of which we hear so much in this House. I believe that the failure of a public servant to carry out the instructions of his superior officer is among the occurrences that are detrimental to recruiting. I wish fco know whether the Minister is prepared to bring forward a proposition so to limit the effect of clause 3 that'the men coming under it will not necessarily be made permanent officers of the Service indefinitely. While it is. reasonable to provide that returned soldiers who obtain temporary employment shall not be affected by the existing time l i m it , we should, at the same time, make it clear that because of that fact they are not to expect permanent employment.",24
166,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is what is proposed in the clause as it stands, and the first men to return will obtain the positions.",25
167,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That would be unfair. If a returned soldier obtains temporary employment in the Public Service he should be prepared at the end of twelve or eighteen months to make way for another returned soldier.,25
168,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Has the honourable member ever come across a man who would be prepared to do that T,25
169,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have not, and that is the danger I see in clause 3. A f t e r these men have remained' in the temporary employment of the Commonwealth for two or three years, it will be much harder to remove them than it would be if at the end of eighteen months' service they were called upon to make room for other returned soldiers. Under the Act as it stands, a man can be employed in the temporary service of the Commonwealth for only six months at a time. . Ait the expiration of that period, however, his employment may be renewed for a further term, and we know that in many cases the period of service is extended. cers responsible for such extensions cannot be blamed, because these temporary employees have become accustomed to the work required of them, and with the entrance of a hew set of employees the work of training has to be commenced once more. I hope that the Minister w deavour to l i m it clause 3 in ' some reasonable way ",25
170,Mr LECKIE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,-The Bill does not provide that a man shall be kept in the Service unless his services are required.,25
171,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so, but the limitation of temporary employment is removed in the case of returned soldiers, and the longer they remain in the Service the harder it will be to remove them when there is no work for them to do. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. - ln Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Section thirty-two of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end of sub-section (1.) thereof the following proviso :- , "" Provided that any person who has served with satisfactory record in any Expeditionary Force raised under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903-1915, and whose age at his last birthday previous to appointment was not more than fifty years, may be appointed to the Clerical Division upon passing the prescribed examination.""",25
172,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [4.55] - I propose so to amend the Bill as to enable a special examination to be held in the case of .returned soldiers, and to make it perfectly clear that it need not necessarily be such, an examination as is prescribed, for in stance, in the case of youths of eighteen, fresh from school, seeking to enter the Public Service. I move That after the word ""years,"" line 9, the words "" and who has passed, whether before or after the commencement of this proviso, the prescribed examination "" be inserted. The clause, as proposed to be amended, will enable returned soldiers up to fifty years of age to submit to an examination to be prescribed.  who, after passing the necessary examination, has joined the Public Service, but later on has left it altogether, and has joined the Australian Imperial Force?",25
173,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am having a clause, drafted to the effect that where a person has previously passed an examination for admission to the Public Service, such The offi- examination shall be taken as the equivalent of the "" prescribed examination.""",25
174,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yarra) [4.57] - I should like to have from the Minister some in formation as .to <%e character of the examination which it is proposed to pre-cribe. A few weeks, after the outbreak ill en- of war, an examination was held for linemen, or instrument fitters, in the Electrical Branch of the Postmaster-General's Department. The Fisher Government, which was then in power, realizing that men who volunteered after passing that examination would be placed at a disadvantage, decided that no permanent appointments should be made during the war. I understand that with some exceptions that decision has beenrigidly adhered to.",25
175,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It has practically been carried out. (,25

179,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member know of any of these men who are over 45 years of age ?,26
180,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yea . The examinain tion to which I refer was open to under the age of forty-five years. know of one man who was well over forty when he passed it . He came out very high in the list. He had been a temporary employee and made a special effort to qualify. He is now anx'ious whether the fact that he is forty-five years of age will prevent him at this stage entering the permanent Service of the partment. ' I should like now to put before Minister, as I did on the motion for second' reading of the Bill, the position of married men with families who volunthey teered for active service but were rejected, and who are in the temporary employment of the Commonwealth. I urge that such men should not be turned adrift, before their six months of service has expired, in order to make room for single men. I yield to no one in my desire that justice shall be done to those who have gone to married. the Front to fight for our country. But I do not think that these married men-r-' and some of them to my knowledge have as many as three, five, and six childrenshould be burned adrift until at least their Australia. six months pf service has expired, even to make room for a returned soldier who unmarried. I am not asking for any extension of the period of six months respect of which a temporary servant be employed.",26
181,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member merely says that if there is work for these married men to do they should have absolute right to remain in the Service until their six months' has expired.,26
182,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . If there is 'work for them to do, then I do have not suggest that they, shoulcl be kept on. We know that in some Departwould ments temporary hands are sometimes employed for only three days at a time. For instance, when steamers come down to Sydney or Melbourne from the East, temporary watchmen are employed by the Customs Department, and the Department takes care to select men on whom it can absolutely rely. These watchmen are employed for only two or three days at a time. Then again, in the Postal Department, there are temporary letter-carriers employed in Melbourne and suburbs to fill the places of men who are away at the Front. I introduced a deputation to the Postmaster-General some little time ago regard to their position. Some of these men temporary hands are married men who I have been rejected, and my contention' is that' if there is work for them to <do they should be kept on for six months.",26
183,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In other Words, that these married men shall have preference over a to know returned single soldier ?",26
184,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . Provided there from is' work for them to do, they should not Debe dismissed before their six months' term has expired merely because they were the not accepted for service with the Austhe tralian Imperial Force. I do not know how many of these men there are, but cannot be very numerous; and, in view of the greater difiSculty there is now in obtaining employment, some consideration should .be extended to them. If an unmarried soldier returns, he finds his pension doubled if he marries.",26

Instructions an were given that no permanent appointments should be made while the men were at the Front; but, in view of the fact that no a number of youths and young men, who gone to expense in preparing themselves for examination and qualification, have found their labours wasted if the war continued, say, for eighteen ' months, that section was passed. As to the nature of the examination for the returned soldiers, I am afraid that will have to be left to the discretion of the Commissioner; and we shall propose a clause to empower'him! to have a special examination.",26
188,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I presume it will not be as difficult as the ordinary examination.,27
189,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It will be an examination to show the qualification of the didate for the position for - which he may be appointed, and will be more adapted to men advanced in years than is usually the case at Public Service examinations.",27
190,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The examination ought to be, as far as possible, more practical, less educational, than at present.",27
191,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the Minister, keeping in view the fact that didate is^to be appointed to perform certain duties. The third point raised by the honourable member for Yarra goes to the very root of the Bill, and raises the question-shoul d returned men have preference or not ? The general principle of the Bill gives preference, and the honourable member agrees as to the principle, but suggests a limitation. He says that if a man is married, has a wife or family, and has offered himself for the Army and been rejected, he shall not be dismissed from his temporary position in preference to the returned soldiers until the period of six months has expired. That, I say, is not necessary to provide in the Bill, for it is action which may, or may not, be taken in administration.  missioner will be guided entirely by the Act.",27

The desire of the Prime Minister was to extend the Act to nurses, and in any measures passed we have found it advisable to specifically mention them; a clause has been drafted for this Bill to carry out that intention. and As to the medical examination, the honourable member appears to be afraid that such an examination as is at present insisted on would practically exclude a canwounded and injured men. I remind the honourable' member, however, that a regulation has been drawn up providing that a candidate may. be appointed though not free from physical, defects, provided it is certified by a proper medical officer that he is free from such defects as would incapacitate him from the efficient discharge of the duties of the position for which he is nominated.",27

If we are not careful, we shall inflict serious hardships on very deserving men who have made a bond fide attempt to go to the Front, but, owing to physical defects, have been rejected.! Some those men aTe responsible for the upkeep of a family, and a man in that position stands on almost identically the same plane as a single man who has been to Front, and has not the same family retributing sponsibilities. I have here a letter written by a returned soldier who was one of the first to land at Gallipoli. He is a putable citizen, upon whose word I can thoroughly rely, and he writes on behalf of .another man:A man who for the past two years has_ employea as a temporary letter-carrier has a familv. just enlisted (after trying to do so three times), and has been accepted. It has been said that the idea of economic conscription is all "" bunkum."" This man, as I say, has fbr over years been temporary letter-carrier, and the officers would report, was an exceptionally good man. Though he had volunteered an'd had been rejected twice, he was informed his services would be dispensed with, and finished up last week. The reason was that had to make room for a returned soldier. Since then he has volunteered for the third time and been accepted. If that is not "" fight or starve "" policy, I don't know is. That letter shows that .it is possible, under a Bill of this kind, to do a grave injusfor tice. ATI Honorable MEMBEB - Is the man referred to married?",27
199,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not say that he is. But I do not agree with those who argue that, because a man is single, has no domestic responsibilities. honourable member knows that there are some single men who have a greater load gulation. of responsibility for the upkeep of' a home than have many married men. Sometimes the eldest son of a family, father of which has died, has to mainlater. tain his mother and four or five younger children. Their feeding, clothing, and housing are dependent on his earnings; and, in passing, I should like to express the hope that the Government, in framstances, ing their taxation proposals, will see that some discretion is allowed in dealing with cases of this kind.",28

He is now in Camp; but, in recent times, men in Camp have been of found, on final medical examination, to be unfitted to go to the Front; and it would not surprise me if this man, having been twice reported unfit, is finally rethe jected. I trust that any man who is conto the support of a family, and taking the part of a father as head of the household, especially when he has been re rejected for active service, will not be : called upon to give place to an unmarried as follows returned soldier.",28

207,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But , according to the the Act, he would have to go sooner or",28
208,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I admit that; but, in the last resort, the man was discharged to make room for a returned soldier. That is done under existing circumand when we are operating a law which gives still larger powers to act in that way, a number of injustices will be' committed; We should safeguard ourselves against that possibility, even to the extent of inserting a specific clause, so that those administering the Act ""will clearly understand the intention of Parliament. I would prefer the insertion of a clause that will insure a square deal all round. Mr Laird SMIT H (Denison) [5.30] - rThi s clause brings under notice one of the most important sections in the Public Service Act. In my opinion, the increased cost of running the/various Departments is largely caused by that section. For many years I was employed in the electrical branch of the Telegraph Department, and I had experience of the inequitable working of the section relating to temporary employment. ""We would train a man for six months, three of which would be occupied in getting him to understand the technical names of the instruments he was operating. . Just when he was well trained, and fit to be sent to do work alone, he would be dismissed, because the Act did not permit him to remain in the Service longer than nine months. To overcome the Act, we had to discharge men for a few days, and then re-employ them. I cannot understand why we have so many casual employees in the Public Services of Australia. Is not the Commonwealth to grow, and population to increase? The greater our population, the greater number of civil servants there must be. There are in the mechanical branch of the Postal ' Department many temporary employees who should be in 'the permanent Service.",28
209,Mr HEITMANN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The greatest trouble in the Australian Public Service is that there are too many permanent officers. Mr - LAIRD SMITH - I do not agree with the honourable member. The officers in charge have an excellent opportunity of learning the capabilities of casual hands, and if those casual hands are able to pass a certain examination, they should be passed into the permanent Service. Hundreds of electricians^and men of other occupations-throughou t Australia are merely casual employees, although they have been trained at - great cost to the Department. How can foremen be expected to maintain the efficiency of the Service if they are continually training new men? No private firm would operate such a system. We have engineers in charge of the technical branches of the Service, but we refuse to give them a permanent staff. Every day changes are taking place in electrical science,.and only in the Service can men receive proper training. Within the last few days we have had demonstrated clearly the advantage of having men trained in the Service from their youth upwards to take responsible positions. Men who are said to have great capabilities have made statements which no trained civil servant would dream of making, because he has been trained on certain lines. These men must be trained if they are to be competent. Otherwise no Minister could run his Department. I am wondering where we are to get our future heads of Departments if this policy of the continuous dismissal of men and the appointing of women proceeds. I do not object to women being employed, but we must have regard to the fact that we must have men to assume the responsible positions that are now being filled by heads of Departments. We have heads of Departments who are responsible for the expenditure of millions of pounds every year, and who are doing invaluable service, and we must train others to take-their positions later on.",29
210,Mr HEITMANN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do not forget that the same remarks apply to private employment. *,29
211,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They do; but private concerns are more careful of their servants, and do not pass them out. Unless a civil servant has very great capabilities, he cannot go out at the age of forty or fortyVfive years ' and take up positions in competition with men who have been trained outside the service. That is why we should see that the service is properly manned by men who know that their positions are permanent provided they serve the country faithfully and well. It Will pay the Commonwealth to employ men permanently instead of temporarily. If any one is entitled to a place in the Public Service it is the man who has gone away to fight our battles, and.,to whom we owe our existence today. Not only is he fighting for our very existence; fie is also del monstrating to the Old World, which never knew it before, that the Australian is capable. His wonderful initiative has . been a surprise to the Old World. An * American authority said quite recently that the day had gone for the speciallytrained officer to lead, and that every soldier now must have initiative. The Australian soldier has that initiative, and as a result he is a much more capable man. When the gold-fields in Western Australia broke out, and the postal service was paralyzed, men were imported from Victoria and South Australia, and from Great Britain; but whereas the telegraph operators drawn from the southern States could do their forty words .a minute on the quadr.uplex line men from Great Britain could not work up to that standard. , Mr HEITMANN - On e of the best telegraph operators in Western Australia was ' imported from Great Britain.",29
212,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He was an exception. I know what I am talking about. In the damp climate of Great Britain the lines are much slower. Australia men who are sound readers and splendid penmen can work for hours on the quadruplex instrument, doing their'forty words a minute. It is due entirely to the' training fchey receive, and that is why I wish to see fchis class of men retained in the service. It is a! hardship for them to be only temporarily employed. We should not encourage meh to enter the Service for six months, and then - compel them to leave and look for some other work. Men sbould be encouraged to apply themselves to their work in the knowledge that, they will have a permanency of occupation. There is nothing to be afraid of in the clause before the Committee provided we have the assurance of the Minister that nothing will be done resembling what was done in the Department of Home and Territories when the father of a number of children was dismissed to make room for a returned soldier. I interested myself in the case of that , man, as I am of opinion that he should not have been dismissed.",30
213,Mr TTJDOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,L understand that he has not yet been returned to the Service.,30
214,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I was under the impression that something had been done for him. He should not have been put off. If nothing has been done, the sooner something is done, the better ib will be for the Service and for all concerned. Some provision must be made for returned soldiers to enter the Commonwealth Service, where they can earn their living, and do good work.",30
215,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [5.42] - The clause really deals with returned soldiers, but a wider discussion, which is not strictly relevant, but to which I do not raise objection, seeing that it gives an opportunity of ventilating a certain matter, has taken place in regard to the-whole question'of temporary employment. The intention of. the Public Service Act was to have permanent employment in the professional, clerical, and general divisions under certain clearly defined conditions, but it was realized that it was possible that certain classes might be employed who, strictly speaking, might not come under the regular machinery of the Act, and therefore power was given to declare certain men to be "" exempt officers."" There are many In men working under the Act who are known as exempt officers. It was also realized that on specific occasions men showing certain adaptability and skill might be employed. Power was given to exempt those men. Then it was realized that a Department might find occasion to employ from time to time a number of casual men on temporary employment only. At the time the Act was passed, this was regarded as a general class of work, for which no particular qualification or skill was required, and as there were many persons in, the community who would be anxious to get this work, Parliament insisted that it should be divided up by stipulating that persons employed in this way should not serve for more than six months. It was also provided that the period could be ex- ' tended for three months on a special report from the head of the Department, in which a casual hand was employed, being supplied. It was never intended that that class of temporary employment should be engaged upon any particular kind of work the Commonwealth required for its service. If any mistake has been made it has been that there has been too much tendency to rely on temporary employment in cases where permanent hands should have been employed. The Public Service Commissioner may have erred on the side of trying to prevent the undue swelling of the Commonwealth Public Service, which in bad times might necessitate severe retrenchment. In this clause we are dealing with that class of temporary work which does not require skill. Returned soldiers are already being given preference for temporary employment, and the object of the amendment is to enable him to be retained in such employment for a longer period than six months.",30
216,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will any person temporarily employed not be dispensed with until he has served for six months ?,31
217,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A temporary employee may be dismissed at any moment. Honourable members are desirous of giving preference to returned soldiers, and are of opinion that the limitation of six months for temporary employment should not extend to them; but, it is said, do not summarily dismiss 'existing temporary employees such as have been mentionedone case was that of a man with five or six children, who had volunteered several times and had been rejected, and another case was that of a father well up in years with several sons at the Front-in order to find positions for returned soldiers. I recognise that cases such as have been mentioned are fit subjects for consideration, but this is a matter not for legislation, but for administration. The right to dismiss must remain with the Minister or the permanent head.",31
218,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will the Minister say that men shall not be dismissed merely to create vacancies?,31
219,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Eac h of such cases as those specified will be considered on its merits, and I do not think that injustice will be done in cases such as have been cited. . Mr Fenton - Will the heads of partments accept the Minister's view if there is no indication in the Bill of the 'wish of Parliament in this matter?",31
220,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think so.,31
221,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They are not doing so now.,31
222,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is impossible at the present time to enumerate the cases which may require consideration. It will not follow that the only position to which a returned soldier can be appointed will be that held by a temporary employee, whose six months' period has hot expired and who has claim for consideration. All that we are doing now is to propose that a returned soldier, who may be appointed temporarily, shall not be limited to a term of six months. The honourable members for Flinders and Wilmot have pointed out that we must be careful lest, in removing this limitation, we convert temporary into permanent employment. They contend that some safeguard against that should be provided.",31
223,Mr FALKINER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Is a temporary employee retained for six months, whether needed or not?",31

225,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Is there any reason why a man whose services are required, and who is giving satisfactory service, should not be made a permanent employee?",31

232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A permanent offide- cial will always be indisposed to recommend the removal of a man who suits him.,31
233,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Minister, as he represents a large and populous constituency, must from time to time receive complaints of inequitable treatment from men with large family responsibilities, whose services have been dispensed with. What we all desire is that the equities of each case shall be considered, and that men with large domestic responsibilities shall not be removed merely to provide for returned soldiers who, taking everything into consideration, have not so great a claim to the positions as those who are occupying them. Certainly, men with heavy domestic responsibilities should not be removed until their term of temporary employment has expired. One of the reasons why the Public Service is not the success it should be is that temporary employees have to be dismissed after certain periods of service.' Just as a permanent head has got a temporary man properly trained for the work that he is doing, that man has to make room for another, and then, perhaps, a third follows. No business oould be successfully conducted on those lines.",31
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In any case, something must be left to the administration.",32
235,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is so. must have occurred to the ""Minister that the present system of temporary employment is unsatisfactory. When, as a member of a deputation from the Victorian Public Service, I waited on the late James Munro, then Premier of the State, and informed him that there were in the service men who had been temporarily employed for periods ranging from five to ten years, he asked; "" If the services of these men have been required for so many years, why have they not been put on the permanent staff?"" My reply was that that was what the men themselves claimed should be done for them. The Government Printer puts on one side the restrictions of the Public Service Act relating to temporary employment.. He could not afford to have his office upset by the provision which requires the dismissal of temporary employees after six months' service. There are men in the Printing Office who have been there, as temporary hands for five or six years.",32
236,Mr CORSER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A number of good men cannot get into the permanent service because they were too old when they entered the temporary service to be eligible for permanent employment.,32

I should like to have it inserted in the Bill that, as promised by the Minister, the equities of the case on both sides shall be considered, and that men deserving consideration shall not be ignominiously pushed out of their places to make room for returned soldiers whose claims may not be so goon as their own.",32

241,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No , but I object to the dismissal of men who deserve special consideration. The officials complain now that they have'to replace competent men But it who have serious responsibilities with men who are not equally efficient.

244,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We have now come to ' realise that industry is getting every day more technical, and that to dispense with the services of trained men merely because they have been employed - for a certain length of time, and not because the need for their services has ceased, is foolish. I hail with satisfaction even the introduction of this t h in end of the wedge, which will mean in - the long run an alteration of the provision in the Public Service Act with regard to the limitation of temporary service to six or nine months. Under the existing law, a man is employed for six or nine months, and must then go, notwithstanding - that he may really be needed in the Departmenti n which he is working, and that it would pay to keep him 'on. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Wilmo t - that we are Such really going, by this Bill , to establish a permanent service under the name of temporary employment, I think it is well met by the provision in the principal Act under which a temporary employee is subject to immediate dismissal, whereas a permanent employee has certainguarantees that his employment shall not be in terfered with, except by certain definite methods. I am sorry that the Minister cannot give us more than his assurance that men whose responsibilities are great, and whose efforts to enlist entitle them to consideration, are going to be protected.",32
245,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does not the honourable member think it would be . dangerous to attempt to frame a clause to meet'their position?,33
246,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is great danger to be feared in attempting to meet' individual cases by a general rule. "" I am sorry, that the Minister cannot give us more than his assurance that such men will receive consideration, bub I realise that it is about all he can give. wish however, to have ib declared by the T Minister as definitely as possible that men who have tried to enlist, but - who, because of .unfortunate physical deficiencies, have been rejected, as well as men whose parental responsibilities entitle them f o some consideration, shall not be penalized and dismissed under this clause in order to make room for a returned single soldier. I hope that the honourable gentleman's assurance will not be forgotten in the administration of this law. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to.

248,Mr TTJDOB,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is not the same result arrived at under section 34c of the Act of 1915?,33
249,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No . The which is being amended by this clause deals only with leave of absence to persons who are called up for service. amendment is intended to bring within its provisions members of the Naval Forces on active service.,33
250,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yarra) [6.6] - This matter was brought under my notice when I held ofiice as Minister for Trade and Customs. Men who had served in the Naval Forces were found to be particularly well suited to carry outf o r the Department certain duties connected with quarantine and lighthouse work, as well as the duties of Customs watchmen and searchers. We therefore provided in the Public Service Act of 1915 thatAny person not more than fifty years of age, who has served in the permanent Naval Forces of the Commonwealth for the full period for which he enlisted or engaged, and has a satisfactory record, shall, without passing the pre' scribed examination, be eligible for appointment to any office in the Department of Trade and Customs which is classified in the General Division offchePublic Service. That provision was limited to employment in the Customs Department, because these men were specially suited for the work of the Department.",33
251,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so. But this We clause simply amends section 70A of the principal Act , which deals only with the question of leave. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. '",33
252,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [ 6 . 8 ] - I move That the following new clause be inserted:"" IA. Section 2 of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section:"" (2) References in this Act to persons who have served in any Expeditionary Force raised under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903-1915 shall be deemed to include members of the Army Medical Corps Nursing Service accepted or appointed by the Director-General' of Medical Services for service outside. Australia and members offcheNaval Forces who have been on active service outside Australia."" The proposed new clause, if agreed to, w i ll for m part of the definition section .of the original Act, and it will practically define the words ""those who have served in the Expeditionary Force,"" which occur several times in the Bill , as including nurses, and also members of the Naval Forces, who have been on section active service. Shortly put, the object is to extend the provisions of this measure to nurses accepted or appointed for active The service outside Australia, and to make it perfectly clear that members of the Naval Forces who have been on active service outside Australia are also covered by it . - Mr FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [ 6 . 9 ]. - The proposed new clause is very satisfactory, except for the last two words, "" who have been on active service ' outside Australia.'"" Quite a number of Naval men have been sent on active service to No r t h Queensland, Thursday Island,' and Papua, and these men/ under the clause as it stands, - will be excluded from the provisions of the Bill. In short, there will be no recognition of their services. I ' do not think it can be the desire of the Minister to exclude them from any of the rights and privileges which are to be enjoyed under this Bill by. men who have served abroad. The fact that these men, who volunteered for active service, have been detailed for service in Australia- a number of them have been detailed for service on garrison duty in Australia-shoul d not exclude them from the benefit of this Bill.",33
253,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And many of them were kept on garrison duty against their will. i Mr FINLAYSON - Quite so.,34
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"This Bill deals only with returned soldiers. ' Mr FINLAYSON - Surely the men drafted to whom I refer should come within the category of returned soldiers and sailors! I know of men who have returned from service at Port Moresby and Thursday Island, where they suffered just as much from malaria as any man at the Front has suffered from trench fever - Are they to receive no consideration ?' One' of men whom I have in mind was-employed as a chauffeur by the State .Commandant that it did not. in Brisbane on the ground that he was a returned soldier, but under this provishall sion he will be excluded from the beneto fits of the Bill. He will not be recognised as a returnedsoldier. Those who are doing active service in Australia are as much entitled to consideration who are doing active service outside Australia. This war is being won, not only by the men who go to the other side of the world to fight, but by others who volunteered and who are doing splendid service within the Commonwealth. Mr. JOSEPH Cook - There must be limit somewhere.",34
255,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think i is fair to exclude these men, seeing they have been, in many cases, detailed, against their will, for service in Ausvolunteered tralia.",34

There is the case of those nurses who have been accepted and have not gone to the Eront.",34
258,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think the proposed new , clause will include them, since it refers to nurses and doctors "" accepted or appointed "" for service outside Australia.",34
259,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is so; but the k general clause will apply to all those who are sent on active - service outside Australia, as I understand practically all go to the Front. The intention is to put members of both the Naval and Military Forces, as nearly as practicable, on the same footing. This clause was only this morning, and I have just received it from the Government Printer.",34
260,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"This is "" rush "" work.",34
261,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Not afc all. This amendment has been rendered necessary, as a matter of fact, by a defect in the honourable member's Bill of 1915. The assumpthe tion was that it covered everything desired in this direction, but it was found I give the honourable member for Brisbane my assurance that I ask the Parliamentary Draftsman examine the clause closely, and see that it provides, as far as practicable, for identical conditions in respect of both the just Naval and Military branches of the Ausas those tralian Imperial Force.",34
262,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yarra) [6.15] - The Minister states that this Bill is to cover an omission, which, apparently, was made haye in the Act of 1915. But any one who has been connected with Parliament must admit that no Act is perfect, and must be a amended from time to time; and no person could then foresee what legislation we t should have to deal with in 1917. We that provided in the War Pensions Bill that only those persons should benefit who. had for active service abroad, and who were injured while on service, and not this prevented pensions being given to men who were injured or .contracted I know the case of a young doctor who enfor active service abroad; but he did such good work at the Base Hospital in the meningitis outbreak, that he was on .kept here by General Fetherston. This young man waa extremely anxious to get to the Front, hut he performed the duties allotted to him, with the result that he contracted the disease and died. That young man died as much in the service of the Empire as if he had heen killed in Gallipoli or Prance; but there was great difficulty in obtaining a pension for his mother, simply because he had not gone abroad, although there aTe letters in the Department which show that he applied time after time to go on active service. Then, again, there are men who, in the early days of the war, weTe. brought from South Australia and other States, and sent to Thursday Island and New Guinea, and such men are as much entitled to the benefits of the Act as are those who went overseas. I trust the Minister will consider the point I have raised.",34
263,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I promise you to see that there is equality of conditions between the Army and the Navy.,35
264,Mr WALLACE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"West Sydney) [6.20] - There are at present about 600 or 700 of our seamen not actually in the Navy, but engaged in war work, inasmuch as they aTe employed on transports 'outside Australia. There are some twenty Inter-State boats manned by Australian seamen engaged in this work, and, in addition, some twenty-two interned German vessels, also manned by ourCown men. I take it that, at the termination of the war, these ships will have to be - returned to their original owners, and that these men, as a consequence,. will be unemployed. Their claims, I think, ought also to be considered.",35
265,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Thes e men are doing the same class of. work as is being done by other civilians in the community outside Government employment; the only difference being that they are employed by the Commonwealth.,35
266,Mr WALLACE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"All the same, I submit that the claims of these men ought to be recognised, as the claims of similar men are recognised in Great Britain. The men engaged on the trawlers in the North Sea, looking for mines, aire merchant seamen; and what sailors call the ""dummy fleet"" is also manned by men of the merchant service; andall these come under the Naval Act of Great Britain. Last week there were men returned to Australia who have been employed for fourteen months Tunning troops over the Channel-; and surely these men must be regarded as having been engaged in war work, pure and simple. As I say, I suppose these German vessels engaged in transport work will have to be restored to their original owners at the termination of the war.",35
267,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will they?,35
268,Mr WALLACE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I hope they will not; but if they are, it will mean that about 700 men will be without work. Some of the vessels which will be returned to their owners were previously manned by lascars, and, with the ship-owners' weakness for cheap labour, it is possible that our men may be replaced. If we hadan assurance that black labour would not be re-employed, the circumstances, would, of course, be different; but, in any case, the men to whom I have referred ought to have preference along with, men who have been actually - on active service. 1 Proposed new clause agreed to. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the following new clause be inserted:IB. After section twenty-one of the principal Act the following section is inserted :"" 21A. Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding section any person * who bas served with satisfactory record in any Expeditionary Eorce raised under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903-1915, and who is eligible - for appointment to Ihe Clerical Division, may be appointed to such class and subdivision as the Commissioner determines.""",35
269,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Brisbane) [6.26]. - The Commissioner should have certain discretionary powers, but this provision is altogether too wide, inasmuch as it would enable him to put these men into any section of the Service, and thereby deprive others, who have been in the Service for many years, of their opportunity for promotion.",35
270,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Whafc is your alternative --that they should be appointed only to the lowest positions t,35
271,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Not to the lowest; there should be a certain minimum. We all know what a great thing seniority is in the Public Service.""",35
272,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The basis of the Public Service Act is efficiency.,35
273,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Promotio n and annual increments do not always go by efficiency, but very often by seniority, andfchisclause would not give a fair deal* 954 Public Service",35
274,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Would , this clause give the Commissioner the right to put returned soldiers over a number of other men already in the Service?",36
275,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If there is a. vacancy, and the returned soldier is qualified, he would be eligible for appointment.",36
276,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Would the Commissioner be able to appoint soldiers as letter-sorters oyer thousands of letter-carriers who are qualified?,36
277,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He could put them ahead of every letter-sorter.,36
278,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the honourable member's alternative?,36
279,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It ought to be provided that this power shall not jeopardize the promotion of any man now in the Servioe. . Mr GROOM - That would mean no preference at all.,36
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Honourable members opposite seem to desire to whittle down the clauses until there is nothing l e ft in the Bill .,36
281,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I cannot imagine that the Minister for the Navy really means that.,36
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,-I it.,36
283,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then I strongly dissent from the suggestion.,36
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It whether you dissent or not.,36
285,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is certainly not my intention, for I am quite sincere in my wish to give the returned soldiers first consideration. Surely the Government do not mean to take away the privileges of those men who are now in the Service?",36
286,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,This is not taking away their privileges.,36
287,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The clause gives the Commissioner power to fill every vacancy with returned soldiers, to the detriment and exclusion of men whose services have been continuous, and who are entitled to consideration.",36
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If first you settle in your own mind that the Commissioner is a fool, it may be so.",36
289,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not suggest that for a moment.,36
290,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"How would the honourable member give preference to soldiers? , Mr FINLAYSON - The r e should be a provision that preference is subject to the recognition of the rights of the men »now in the Service. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill.",36
291,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What rights? - Mr FINLAYSON - We l l , the right of promotion.",36
292,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If every man had that right, a soldier could not be appointed, and the result would be that every one would have to start on the lowest rung at the lowest salary.",36
293,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That opens the way to the other extreme view, that a returned soldier could be appointed to the highest oflices over the heads of others.",36
294,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do you not think that the Commissioner will exercise his powers with reasonable discretion? Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7 -45 p.m.,36
295,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Melbourne Ports) [7.46] - Repeatedl y public servants have represented to me good reasons why the Public Service Commissioner. should not have as much power as he has at present^ but the Minister is now proposing to give him greater power. I admit that there 5 might be a returned soldier who is a very able man, and who had occupied -* position outside the Service equal to that to which the Commisdo really mean sioner might appoint him. But the J placing of men over the heads of others who have been in the Department for years, and understood full y the is a' fact, routine work, is bound to lead to dissension^ No doubt the Commissioner may use discretion in the matter, but I think we should adopt the suggestion made by public servants in the past that before a junior is appointed above his seniors the latter should have an opportunity of objecting.",36
296,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They can do that now.,36
297,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What is the use of objecting after the appointment is made and gazetted ?- I have known of dozens of cases of men appointed over --the heads of others, and the appointments gazetted before anybody knew anything about them, and by that time the new appointees were fixtures, and could not be moved. Thus men get seniority over others who have been in the Service for a greater number of years. A Judge of the Supreme Court who was overlooked when a Chief Justice was being appointed was heard to say that in .future he would do only his bare duty - When so high an official as a Judge felt h u r t ab being overreached by a junior, and announced such a resolve as that I have mentioned, we can readily understand that the same feeling would result in other walks of the Public Service. If the Commissioner is given the further powers proposed in this Bill a feeling will be created that it is useless to try to make oneself fit for promotion, because the Commissioner may at his own sweet will , advance juniors above their seniors. I have no objection to doing everything possible to make things easier for the returned soldier, but I shall vote against this clause just as I would if it were an amendment dealing with public servants other than soldiers. I suggest that when promotions are in tended the intention to promote should be gazetted, and thus allow an opportunity for objection by those officers who have been overlooked. ' If the objection were a trivial one in the opinion of somebody considered capable of dealing with the matter, nothing further need be done. We must remember that the Public Service is a huge machine,- and the less irksome the conditions the. better the result that will be obtained.",36
298,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Hindmarsh) [7.53] - The honourable members who 'objected to the clause seem not to understand the facts of the case. I am astonished at the efforts put, forward in the interests of those who have not made any sacrifice for their country such as has been made by the men who have been on active service. We have stated in Parliament, and tKe country has endorsed our view, that the returned soldiers should be dealt with not only justly, generously. The Minister is now proposing that if a vacancy occurs the Public Servioe Commissioner may appoint any returned soldier whom he considers fit for the job. I cannot see that the returned soldier will get much benefit out of this provision, and it seems to me that the objectors are making much ado about nothing. These desperate efforts in be half of the cold-footers are rather amusing. The Civil Service is a pretty compact body, and heads of Departments generally are anxious to get through their work as quickly and efficiently as possible. I believe that, »as a body, the Public Service do their work efficiently. Naturally the heads would prefer to have trained men about them. A leading civil servant told me that ten years of training was necessary to render a man any good to the head of his Department.",37
299,Mr FALKINER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,An y man who has occupied fen years in becoming' efficient ought to have been sacked long ago.,37
300,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The head of a Department should not have to instruct his subordinates in every detail of what T he requires; they should be sufficiently acquainted with the Department to almost anticipate what the head wishes done. And as a rule, departmental heads will be reluctant to have new trained men in troduced into the Service. So, too, an active Minister who is taking a live in terest in his Department will naturally desire to have his work done as quickly and smoothly as possible, and if representation is made to him that the influx of returned soldiers is interfering with the efficiency of the Service his tendency will be not to open the door any wider than he can avoid. The more efficient the Public Service is made the greater will be the handicap of the returned soldier; therefore, the danger honourable members have anticipated seems very remote. On the other hand, we have' a pledged duty to the returned.soldiers. We have talked about what we will do for them, and if , when the opportunity - arises, we close the door against them, we shall brand ourselves as a band of hypocrites. I hope the Minister will adhere to the clause as drafted, because, so far as I can see, only the exceptional men will be admitted to the Service. Returned soldiers ought to be in two but classes, the men who have actually fought and those who have merely been abroad, and have been returned invalided without having been actually to the Front. A man may have been to Egypt or France, and because of illness have been sent home without even having heard a shot fired. He has had at r ip at the Commonwealth expense, and doubtless when the : war medals are issued he will get one. We shall have returning directly a lot of soldiers who have been nothing but drawingroom knights, loafing round Westminster, near head-quarters, and who have been absolutely as safe from shot and shell as any of us in this chamber. We ought to draw a distinction between them and those who have gone to the Front and risked their lives for their country. A classification of that kind should be made before we go any further with the Bill. There, is a great deal in the remark of the honourable member for West Sydney, that the men in our mercantile marine have done yeoman service during the war. I do not say that provision should be made for them in this Bill, but after the war is over they will have a strong claim to any positions going on any shipping owned or controlled by the Commonwealth. However, I am not afraid that' justice will not be done to them by this or succeeding Parliaments.",37
301,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Brisbane) [8.4]. - I am quite unable to. follow the argument of the honourable member for Hindmarsh for differentiation between returned soldiers. Many, not only on the permanent staff and at the Defence Department, but also amongst those who enlisted from private life, have been refused permission to go to the Front. Many of these are rendering excellent service, and doing work equally essential to the carrying on of successful operations as those who are actually in the firing line.",38
302,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I was referring more to "" cold-footers,"" who did not want to to the Front. .",38
303,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Thes e men are fGlTSIlCG*"" not "" cold-footers,"" and no such distinction as the honourable member suggests should be drawn. As the honourable member for Robertson interjected earlier, it is their fault that they are not sent to the Front. Many are put into other branches, and sent to other places.",38
304,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And many have volunteered for certain branches so that they should not go to the Front. Any number have got into the artillery for that reason.,38
305,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They are not cordingly, going into the artillery tp avoid risks. They are taking as big risks, and doing excellent service, as those in other branches. Sometimes there is more danger at the rear than at the front, is shown by the statement published the other day, that shells were falling 20 miles behind the firing line. Will the Minister permit me to supplewho ment my earlier remarks about priority of consideration for returned soldiers the exclusion of those already in the vice? Section 44 of the Victorian fences and Discipline Act of 1890 pror vides thatAll persons now or hereafter to be engaged to serve in the Naval or Military Forces of Victoria, and who have served for a period of not less. than five years, shall be entitled at the expiration of such period to be employed in the Non-clerical Division of the Public Service, on fulfilling all requirements as to examination and insurance for persons entering such division, and such persons shall be entitled to be appointed to any vacancy which may occur therein in priority to all otherpersons whatsoever. That is practically on the lines of the clause the Minister is suggesting today, but, in 1893, that section was .altered by section 18 of the Public Service Act, which provided-< - Notwithstanding the provisions of section 44 of the Defences an'd Discipline Act 1890; persons who have served for a period of not less than five years in the Naval or Military Forces of Victoria shall not be entitled to be appointed to any such vacancy in the Nonclerical Division in priority to any officers of the Public Service. Our duty to returned soldiers is, no doubt, of paramount importance, but it should not be exclusive.",38
306,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I i you followed that secgo tion, you would say to them, "" Y o u shall be appointed, but you. shall get no pre",38
307,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Minister must distinguish between preference and priority. The Commissioner should not not have power to give them priority over men in the Service who have earned, and are entitled to, their .promotion.",38
308,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What do you mean by ""priority""?",38
309,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The basis of promotion in the Public Service is that, so far as divisions within classes are concerned, the. officers automatically move forward, and receive their increments acwithout any question of seni# ority or anything else; but before they as move from one class to another they have to show merit. The question of seniority also comes in, but merit is the prior conas sideration. The clause gives the Commissioner power to place returned soldiers in any grade and in any class, which must necessarily mean - the exclusion of men look upon the vacancies as their only opportunities for* promotion. If the honto orable member for Flinders is right, we Sershall, by this clause, introduce the very Dedanger he pointed out, of having men in tihe Service without the experience and knowledge of the Service which is essential to enable them to Tender efficient service to the public. There is such a thing in the Service as efficiency, which is attained only by experience. It is a peculiar kind of training, yet, under this clause, the Commissioner has power, hecause a returned soldier has certain clerical qualifications, to put him in any of the higher positions in the Clerical Division. There is no limit to it , and some limit ought to be imposed to protect* the men in the Service. N MT. GBOOM - What limitation do you suggest?",38
310,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A proviso that these appointment's shall not prejudice the claims of men in the Public Service to promotion which they have earned.,39
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,You would give them no preference at all. . Mr FLOTLAYSON - The preference could be limited to certain grades. would then let them work their way up to the top the same as any one else.,39
312,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then you would not recognise any priority in the lower grades?,39
313,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I say ""Give the returned soldiers preference to get in."" We all know that once a man gets into the Public Service, he is as difficult to shift as a Presbyterian minister. I have sufficient confidence in the returned soldiers to think that, if they once get a chance in the lower grades of the .Service, they will soon show their ability, and get the experience to qualify them for promotion tp the 'higher grades. ""But I would not put the whole of the members of the Service who occupy higher positions, and who are looking forward to opportunities for promotion, aside, and allow an outsider, no matter what his qualifications may be, to step in front of them.",39
314,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Do you call a returned soldier an outsider? Mr FINLAYSON"" - So far as the Public Service is concerned.",39
315,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,.The--objec t of Bill is to put him on the inside.,39
316,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He should get. in ; but it is not fair to those already into give the Commissioner power to appoint him to any position. In the interests of the men who have given years of good honest service to. the Commonwealth, their privileges should be protected to some extent at least. Mr GROOM < (Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [8.13] - I cannot accept the modification suggested by the honourable member for Brisbane, who says, in effect, "" I believe preference should be given to Teturned soldiers; they aTe entitled to it, having made greater sacrifices and run greater risks than anybody else; but that preference must not interfere with the seniority or priority of men al*, ready in the Service."" That is practically a negation of the doctrine of preference. .Alternatively the honourable member suggests limiting the preference to certain grades, thus saying to returned men, "" You - aTe good enough to fight and lay down your life for your country, and"" , so we will ' give you preference to the lower grades, but hands off the higher grades of the Publio Service of Australia.""

317,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What would that chance amount to, if you recognised all the seniority and priority rights of those already in the Service as superior to the claims of the returned soldier ? The honourable member practically tells the returned soldier that he must begin at the bottom rung of the ladder, no matter' what his age may be.

If the proposal of the honourable member were accepted it would, - in effect, negative our the attempt to give preference to returned soldiers. Apparently, although the honourable member wishes to give preference to returned men, his concern is rather for the preservation of the rights of those already in the Service. The Bill will enable the Commissioner to appoint men, who become eligible, to such positions as he may think them capable of filling. The Commissioner must be assumed to be fitted like that. for his ofiice, and to have the good of the Public Service at heart. No one would minimize the work of many of our public servants.

The object of the Bill is that returned soldiers shall have preference in the Public Service. honourable member for Brisbane said, in effect, "" I am willing to allow returned soldiers to have preference in regard to the lowest positions in the Service, if care be taken that they shall never get' any higher."" But the object of the B i which gives effect to the desire of the majority of honourable members, and of a still greater majority outside, is that any provision of the Public Service Act which prevents a fair preference being given to returned soldiers shall be thrust aside. It is our intention that there shall be no position in the Public Service which shall not be open to a returned soldier. Is a man who has spent two or three years at the Front, and has played a man's part in defendinghis country, to be compelled to enter into competition with schoolboys to secure a position in the Public Service ? An objection to the system of promotion which prevails in our camps is that it gives an advantage to boys who have just left school, and in consequence find it much more easy to get up textbooks and pass examinations than it is to men who have been away from school for five or ten years, and yet have a much wider knowledge and a better general education. If the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane, were accepted,- the preference offered to a returned .soldier would be like our Tariff preference, nothing but a farce. wish of the majority of honourable members is that returned men shall have preference in regard to every branch of Government employment; that wherever there is a position for which a returned man is fitted, he shall have preference in regard to it over all comers. He should certainly have preference over men who, by remaining at home, have had time to study subjects of examination. We give the Public Service Commissioner practically unlimited power in the administration of the whole Public Service of the Commonwealth, but in this-one case we. are told he should not be allowed to exercise his discretion; that he should be bound down by hard and fast rules which will make it impossible forreturned soldiers entering the Service ever to get very far beyond the lowest grade. Neither the Federal nor State Governments have gone far enough in this direction.. There are many positions, such as those of ticket collectors at railway gates, and - tramway conductors, The which might well be filled by maimed men who have returned fro m the Front. I say deliberately that the eligible who has stayed at home, and has not offered to go to the Fronts should make way for the man who has volunteered, and has l l , done his bit for the Empire. Instead of weakening this Bill , I would strengthen ib very considerably in the direction I have named. If there is one class to whom preference should be given every time, it is that of the men who have gone to the Fronti-in many cases, they have thrown up good positions in order to do so-and who, after fighting there for two or three years, have returned so injured as to be unable to follow their former occupations.' If there is in the Publio Service an eligible man who has not volunteered, then, be he married or single, he should make way for such a man.",41

331,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"- A man who has a large family certainly ought not to be displaced, but married men, with practically no one dependent upon them, and who have nob volunteered, although eligible for 'enlistment, should make way for those who have.

333,Mr YATES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Adelaide) [8.30] - There seems to be. a very laudable desire on the part of honourable members to do everything possible for those who have joined the Australian Imperial Force, regardless of how they got there, or why they joined. Every one says today, "" We cannot do enough for our ""heroes!"" but 960 Piiblie Servioe [REPRESENTATIVES.] ten years after the war it will be a case of, "" Yon cannot do enough to forget them."" The honourable member for Franklin said that he hoped that preference of employment would be given to returned soldiers in respect of not only the Commonwealth, but the State Public Services. Why not go further, and provide for such preference in private employment? I was going to say, "" Preference to unionists,"" and even had I done so, I should not have been far out, since the ratio of workers to idlers in the general community is well maintained in our fighting Forces. . When the men come back from the Front, they will still be unionists, and despite all Acts of Parliament the commercial community will take care .that they are bled just as freely as are any other section. Why should not this preference be extended to private employment? After all, it is the private employer who is reaping the benefit of this war. It may not be a sordid trade war, but it is a very payable war so far as that section of the community is concerned. A few nights ago, I referred to the increase of deposits in the Associated Banks of Australia since the outbreak of war. As a matter of fact I dealt only with the first two years of the war and showed that in that time these bank deposits had increased to the extent of £35,000,000. The latest figures, however, show that since 1914 the bank balances of the commercial community pf Australia have increased by £50,000,000. That increase is the result of the war, and it does not include the amounts which have been subscribed to various patriotic funds designed to carry on.the work that should be done collectively by the Commonwealth. This preference to returned soldiers and sailors should be extended to private employment for the reasons I have stated. In my camp there are hundreds, of fellows who have left good jobs to which, should they have the misfortune to be injured at the Front, they will never be able to return with any likelihood of earning their former wages.",41

I fear that it will then - be a case of '-' The devil take the man who cannot swim."" I hope that care will be taken to see that this law is equitably administered. We hear it said again and again, "" Too much cannot be done for the soldier. He should have the best."" Rut he does not get the best while he is soldiering.

' Mr YATES - We are told that the soldiers in camp cannot be allowed 4 oz. - of butter a day because that would mean an expenditure of £625 per diem. But the commercial community can make £50,000,000 in three years out of the war ,and nothing is said about it. I was told today of a returned soldier who has lost an arm, and who, before he volunteered, was earning £6 a week as a glassblower. To-day he is getting only HQs. per week, and has no hope of making any headway. ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - Is it not the very object of this Bill to help such a man ?",42

339,Mr YATES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There are men who have volunteered and who have returned' in bad heal®, although perhaps they have never actually seen the Front. Will they come within that term and so come under the Bill ? Men may throw up their jobs with the object of going to the Front, and yet at the end of the war find that they' have not been required. My own may be a case in point, though I do not intend to dispose of my job; notwithstanding the honourable member for Echuca, I shall still hang on to it in interests of those who have sent me here. Honourable members will see that I am quite frank in regard to the position I take up. I am ,not like some of the Fusionists opposite, who changed their political skins and accepted the vote of Liberals while still calling themselves Labour men,-with the sole object of hanging on to their jobs. I wish to know whether, in the judgment of the Commissioner, such remarks as fell from the honourable member for Hindmarsh are likely to be taken into account? It will be remembered that that honourable member said men had gone into the artillery so that they should not be sent to the Front; and I know that such an idea is resented in the camp where I am placed. In this connection I wish to make-my own position quite clear to those who are mean and contemptible enough to attribute wrong motives to me, in the hope that some consideration will be shown to others who are similarly placed, and who may have given up their positions in private life. The honourable member for Grey accused me of having made political capital out of my enlistment; and I should like honourable members to be in possession of the exact circumstances. After an interjection in this House from the honourable member for Grampians, I went straight home, and from there to the recruiting ofiice, without telling even my wife that-1 intended to enlist. ""When I gave my name to the officer' in charge, he asked me if I was the Mr Yates who was a member of Parliament, but I said that that had nothing to do with the matter-that I had come there for the purpose of enlisting. I was asked no further questions, and was passed right through. I informed the officials that I would go' into camp on the 30th October, after the referendum, and I was quite prepared to honour my promise, but circumstances intervened, arid it was the 7th November when I got there. I was not asked into which arm' of the Force I would go, but, on the 22nd December, was put into the camp where the men are treated for their teeth.

Whatever amendments may be made in the Bill or the Aot I hope that the generosity of Parliament will be demonstrated by more than these debates-that when .the measure becomes law the men will have the good time that they were promised. But what has the Commonwealth .given to the men ? The women of Australia have done more for the men than the Government have, inasmuch as they have, at least, provided a is shelter on the St..

If the prescribed examination other matters. mentioned in this.new clause means anything at all, it means an examination less severe than that which candidates have to the Public Service. pass today, because nobody would prosion pose that an examination paper to be before returned soldiers should be more difficult than 'that whioh is submitted the ordinary candidates from the State ""ud public schools, business colleges, and the University. This clause affords a fitting opportunity for somebody representing the Government to defend the ing system of examination, if it is right, or, if it is wrong, to announce their intentheThat tion to alter it at the earliest possible moment. I know that very often the examination is of greater educational than practical value. So far from the Service being the refuge of the uneducated, we very often find that there are in the Government Departments educated persons who are not able to transact departmental business as well as are many persons who - have not had a high education. In m y opinion, the men who have entered the t y years Commonwealth Service by competitive examination, will compare more than favourably with those who entered it before there was any public examination at all. .Every man who has held Ministerial proofiice will admit that to be a fact.

Several times during the consideration of this Bill , fear has been expressed, that in the administration of this law the Public Service Commissioner will assume that it is right that every man, no matter what his obligations, should be dismissed to make room for a returned soldier who may, and probably will, be a single man. We are told that we may trust to the administration of the Act, but the Commissioner will probably be guided by the definite language of the law. Por that reason I am proposing this clause as a safeguard. temporary employees can remain in the Service only six months, but returned soldeirs may, according to the provision to which we have already agreed, be kept in tihe Service for years. The clause is not meant as an instruction to the Public Service Commissioner, so much as an expression of the feeling of the Committee. Otherwise those who have to administer the Act will say, "" The whole object of the Act is to give employment to returned soldiers, and these men, because they had not gone to the war, must be put off."" All I ask is that while there is employment for them men who have given satisfaction in the various Depart, ments for one, two, or three months should be allowed to finish their six months' term. , Mr GREGORY (Dampier) [9.16] - I . hope the Government will stick to the Bill , and accept no amendment. I cannot understand the opposition to the Bill or the long delay in passing it. I should like to make it a great deal more .stringent than it is so far as regards a large number that have got .into the Service recently. One has only to go round the Departments,- and see a number of those who are there, to recognise how they have 'got there. The Departments will be all the better for a b it of cleaning up. If I had my way, I would put in the Bill an amendment which would prevent the Government from giving the preference they have been giving in the past to certain people. It is a lasting disgrace to the Government of the day that a very large section of absolutely disloyal people are getting employment from them at the present time. I want to refer more particularly to the Clerks' Union. This organization almost afc the beginning of the  then Prime Minister, pointing out that a great many of those who had gone to the Front had gone there only through empty bellies, to use their own elegant expression- a gross insult to the men who have gone on active service. It is the members of that body who are getting preference. Since then, we have seen resolutions passed by the same organization stating not only that they would do nothing in any shape or form to help recruiting, but that they are going to use all their efforts for a ""' just and honourable peace."" I have no time for that section, and am hopeful that the Government will Ordinary insist on seeing that the men who have gone to the Front, and are willing to make the supreme sacrifice for us, get all the preference that it is possible to give them when they return.",46
368,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [9.18] - I am sorry that I cannot see my way to accept the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. There may be several reasons why a man in temporary employment ought not to* be dispensed with, bub the honourable member is trying to l i m it his clause to one reason only-that he has not been accepted for service abroad. In any case the Commissioner has no power under the Act to dismiss. The only persons who can dismiss are - the Minister or the permanent head of the Service. It is quite conceivable that the equities of individual cases may be so strong as to entitle them to ' earnest consideration. I gave this afternoon two cases mentioned by members on both sides, one of a married man, a reject, with two or three months of service to run , being displaced to make room for a returned soldier who is a single man. I said a case like that was a matter for consideration. Mr TUDOR. - I am afraid the Commissioner will read into the Bill a direction to give preference to returned soldiers in every case.",46
369,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is not the Commissioner who reads anything into the Bill . The other case that appealed to members on both sides was that of a man well advanced in years, who hadgiven a few months' service to the Government, and had several sons at the Front, being displaced by a returned Soldier who was a single man. I u those circumstances, it would be the duty' of the officer to consider the equities case, and try to place the returned soldier somewhere else. While carrying out the distinct^ wish of Parliament that preferenee should be given to returned soldiers, it will be the duty of the officer to consider the equities of individual cases. That is the spirit in which he should approach the administration of this Bill . I ask the honourable member not to press the amendment.",47
370,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,You have not met us at all in regard to that matter.,47
371,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We have tried to meet the honourable member in every way. To do what the honourable > member wants we should have to d r a f t a clause setting out a number of specific cases and worded after this fashion: "" A returned soldier Should be entitled to preference, but this shall not apply (a) in the case of so-andso;, (b) in„the case of so-and-so; and so on.""",47
372,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is itJ not possible that regulations of that character may be framed ?,47
373,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think it is advisable to frame them. It is better to assume that the Bill will be administered with good sense and discretion, and with full consideration of the equities of each individual case. It has frequently happened, when it has been sought in Acts of Parliament to make exemptions T in regard to particular cases, that the result has been to exclude the consideration of other just cases.",47
374,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Brisbane) [9.22]. - The effect of the new clause will practically disappear before six months at the outside, because the men in the Service, affected by it are entitled fco only six months' employment. In 90 per cent, of the cases their employment would not be continued beyond the specified six months. The other 10 per cent, would be cases such as the Minister has quoted where special circumstances call for special consideration. Is it f a ir that the men now in employment should have their work interfered with merely because they have. not been accepted for active service? To many of them the clause is simply a polite intimation that they will be displaced at the end of their six months by. returned soldiers. .. Mr GROOM - The clause refers only to rejects.",47
375,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It refers to. men of the who have not been accepted for active service for any reason whatever. They are entitled to this consideration at any rate t ill the end of their term. Some of us have considerable misgivings that the Commissioner may act in a very drastic manner in order to make room for returned soldiers without considering the interests, commitments,- or domestic responsibilities of those in the .Service. I do not think returned soldiers generally desire men to be put out of employment summarily aiid without) consideration in order that work may be found for them. Mr JOSE PH COOK (ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [9.26] - I cannot help feeling thab the new clause has been very astutely worded. Look, at it how you will, it renders the whole Bill nugatory. It puts on an equality with a returned soldier the man who has not offered for service abroad, and gives him. a leg in .",47
376,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,For how many months ?,47
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not care for how many. Whether the Leader of the Opposition intended it or not, the effect of the clause is to render the Bill nugatory. I cannot help feeling that it is intended t'o do by a side wind what the Opposition have been trying to do all night. I never saw such support in my life as has been ofiered to this Bill by honourable members opposite/ who asseverate with every breath they draw that they are in favour of preference to returned soldiers; and yet try by every conceivable means to make the whole measure n u ll and void. This kind of thing is not quite honest and above board. Either they are in favour of preference t'o returned soldiers or they are not. If 'they are they should not be trying all the evening, as they have been, to make the Bill of no use. For instance, there is the proposal that the man who is doing something here shall be brought into this matter. We are told that certain men have gone to Rabaul and other places. Everybody has intense sympathy with the men who have done their duty.",47
378,Mr TTJDOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The man who goes to Rabaul is in it now.,48
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But the honourable member wants more. He has been asking all the evening that the man who happens to have been at Townsville shall be put in .,48
380,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know men who have contracted malaria through having been sent to Papua, and feel the effects still.",48
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"So do I . Those men will always be entitled to the generous consideration of the Government; and the Government will do all they can to help them. This Bill , however, sets out to do one thing directly. That is, to give preference to returned soldiers. By ""returned soldiers"" is meant soldiers who have been participants . in this great world struggle, and have returned from the fighting Fronts. It is felt that they should be given preference over and above those who stay here. Yet the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition is to strike away this preference. If it were agreed to, the only course open to us would be to withdraw the Bill . Reduced to its simplest terms, the amendment means that the man' who has not offered for active service, and therefore has not been accepted, shall have as much right to employment as the man who has gone to the war and returned. t",48
382,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment only to those now in the Service. i,48
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then it is most unfortunately worded. A man cannot be accepted if he has not offered ,48
384,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment merely says that the Commissioner shall not dismiss a man merely because he has not been accepted for active service.,48
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Honourable members are against the proposed preference to returned soldiers.,48
386,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We are against economic conscription.,48
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Bill says that where two men are applying < for a job, and one of them has "" done his b it , "" he shall get it .",48
388,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No one on this side objects to that. But we say that a temporary employee who has not served six months shall not be dismissed merely because he has not been accepted for active service ,48
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The real desire of honourable members opposite is that no distinction'shall be made between the man who has not offered and the man who has served. It would be more honest to declare against the Bill straight out.,48
390,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is what the honourable member wishes us to do. Mr JOSE PH COOK - That declaration could not be made more clearly than by the amendment.,48
391,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Thaf c is an exaggerated statement, which the right honourable gentleman would not make if he knew what had been said during the debate.",48
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have heard the pleas that have been set up all the evening for the stay-at-homes.""",48
393,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Me n with five sons at the Front have been dismissed to make room for single men. I shall fight against that.,48
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member has only one case in his mind. I understand that the man to whom he refers has five sons at the Front and five others at home. I do not know his circumstances, but surely his sons are all able to give their bit, and he cannot be the poverty-stricken person that he has been represented to be. Many persons' are worse off than he.",48
395,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And many better - off.,48
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have no doubt of that. I say nothing against this man, but in my judgment he cannot be refers the worse-off man in the community, and the Government are trying to meet his Public Service [9 AUGUST, 1917.] case. On this one case' honourable members would base a law. Honourable members will fijid that those now in the Service will be treated as generously as the Government can treat them. It seems to be thought that those concerned in the administration of the Public Service will act like callous soured. fools; but that is absurd. It is my experience that a permanent official is indisposed to part with men who are efficient, even to make way for soldiers. They do not like to have their offices disturbed any more than is possible. Honourable members may rely on that trait of human nature for a sufficiently conservative administration to do justice to those who have stayed at home. I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will withdraw the amendment'.",48
397,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,After the right honourable gentleman has made a violent attack on me!,49
398,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Capricornia) [9.37] - I am not surprised at the attack on the Leader of the Opposition made by the Minister for the Navy. The returned soldier was to be generously treated by this Win-the-war Government, but the only thing it can do for him is to find him a billet by discharging some unfortunate temporary employee who has not been accepted for active service. In every State returned soldiers are complaining that the Government has not fulfilled its promises. No wonder, then, that the Minister for the Navy is angrywhen the Leader of the Opposition proposes to deprive the Win-the-war Government of an opportunity to discharge married men in order to put returned soldiers in their places.",49
399,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment does not mention married men.,49
400,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The amendment is designed to prevent the Government from abandoning its promise to respect the vote of the people , on the 28th October last, when conscription was defeated. This Win-the-war Government desires to bring about economic conscription by discharging temporary employees from the Public Service, and giving their places to returned soldiers. Ministers have been ing of spending £22,000,000 in buying land for the soldiers.  talked about that, too. - Mr HIGGS - I spoke of the danger df doing that. Bill. 967  talked of it in his scheme.",49
401,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Grey was at one time very happy, but, having had to leave the Treasury' after only three months of office, he has become, as has been said, somewhat",49
402,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Capricornia was happy because he was there longer than the honourable member for Grey.""",49
403,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I was in the Treasury for twelve months, and should have liked to stay longer, but there are compensations in being out of the position. I do not think that there is a single returned soldier who wishes to get a job by the discharge of some man already in the Service. But the returned men look to the Government to carry out its promise. Has the Minister for the Navy no imagination ? Can he think of no other way of giving effect to the - promises to provide for the returned soldier and his dependants? This Win-the-war Ministry was hailed as a Ministry of. men of talent. Ministers were described as men of great business ability. Yet all they can do for the heroes who have returned from Gallipoli and Prance is to sack persons now* in the Service to give them a job. I remember the time when the Minister for the Navy used to say that no man was so unhappy as the unfortunate who could not get employment.",49
404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I say that now.,49
405,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why does the right honourable gentleman wish to discharge - temporary employees from the Public Service before they have had the nine months' employment to which they are entitled ? Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - I do not wish to discharge them.,49
406,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then the least the Minister can do is to allow the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to be accepted. I trust that the amendment will be pressed to a division, and that the Winthe-war Ministry will be compelled to find some other way of giving effect to its pledge to provide for returned men than talk- the discharging of men already in the Service.",49
407,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Denison) [9.45]. - I should not have risen had it not been for the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia, who is a past master in the art of acting. He plays a part in this 968 Public Service [REPRESENTATIVES.] House, so that the people may think that the Government and its supporters form a dreadful party.",49
408,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is splendid comedy. 1,50
409,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Knowin g the honourable. member, as I do, to me it is more like tragedy! The honourable member would have public servants believe that the Government intend to do something for which this Bill really makes no provision. As a matter of fact, all that we do in this Bill is to provide machinery to give effect to a section in the Act of 1915, which was inserted by the Government of which he was a member, and which really provided for preference to returned soldiers. helped the honourable member to put in v the Public Service Bill of 1915 a clause in which it was provided that no permanent appointments to the Public Service should be made until after the war. That provision was made by the Govern-. ment to which the honourable member belonged in order to show that we approved of men volunteering, and would do our best to assist them on their return. That being so. why should the honourable member for Capricornia endeavour in this way to throw dust in the eyes of public servants? They are an intelligent body of men, and have been too long associated with politicians not to "" have their weight."" A politician may deceive ordinary members of the public, but he cannot deceive public servants. I was for twenty years behind members of Parliament like the honourable member for Capricornia. over whom there has come a great change. When he was in office' he was a most cautious Minister. What a different man he is when he has not upon him the responsibility of a Minister. No more cautious man-n o man with a keener intellect-eve r sat on the Treasury bench. I hope that new members will not be tempted by the little baits thrown out by the Opposition.",50
410,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do not worry! This will be a party vote'.,50
411,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why should we have a party vote on any question affecting the welfare of men who have done so much for us? Mr TTTPOI? - I say that every honourable member opposite will follow the Leader of the Government in this matter.,50
412,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Adelaide this evening made Bill. statements which, upon reflection, he will regret.",50
413,Mr YATES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They were all absolutely true.,50
414,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member suggested that there was not a manufacturer, a commercial man, or a rich man in Australia who had a son at the Front.",50
415,Mr YATES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I did not.,50
416,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have no brief to plead the cause of the rich; but I wish to be just, and I say at once that I scarcely know of a wealthy family one member of which, at least, has not volunteered. Scores and scores of such famiI lies are represented at the Front, not by one, but by every son. Returning to the question immediately under consideration, I would point out that these appointments will not be made in the first place by the Public Service Commissioner. The Commissioner will merely make a recommendation to the responsible Minister, and it will be for him to make the appointment. Ministers are subject' to the criticism of this Parliament, and I have yet to meet a Minister of the Crown who would make an appointment without first givingj it careful consideration. Then there is a further condition that returned soldiers must pass 'a prescribed examination. The majority of returned soldiers who are appointed to the Public Service will only be given temporary employment.",50
417,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is this all the Win-thewar Government can do for the returned soldiers ?,50
418,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is doing far more than the honourable member would have attempted to do in the direction of giving effect to the clause in the Bill passed while he was in office. Why should there be all this make-believe on the part of the Opposition? During the recent election campaign I received from a constituent a letter, in which he said he had been informed by the Opposition that if our partu were returned to power all , Public Service increments would be stopped. We have been returned to' power, but nothing of the kind has occurred. Is this another of-the red herrings that the Opposition would draw across the trail in order to make public servants believe that their friends are to be found only on that side of the House? I shall never vote for any Bill that would do an injustice to public servants. For many years I was closely connected with public servants, and trusted by them. Whenever a vote was^ taken to select representatives to wait on the Government, I always occupied a leading position on the poll. It was known that I would do my best for them, and I shall still do so.",50

427,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Such remarks do not h u r t me. The honourable member there. is protected, because I desire to conform to the ruling of the Chair. I did not hear the whole of the speech made by clubs. the honourable member, because at the outments set of it I was introducing a deputation of unionists to the Postmaster-General. Many of the unionists still have confidence in me, although I am sitting behind the Governmenb. I hold that returned soldiers will not, some honourable members suggest, rush the Public Service. It is not so attractive some people would have us believe. The members of it are subject to criticism the like of which no other body of workdisplayed men have to submit, and many public serwhat vants would be much better off today i they had applied to some outside occupaWould tion the energy which they have thrown into their work as Government employees. in his place. For all these reasons I do not believe [37] returned soldiers will rush for positions in the Service, and we are not likely to have Ministers discharging public servants in a wholesale way in order to find employment for returned soldiers. My experience is that heads of Departments, in most cases, are anxious .to do justice to thenfellow servants. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member never knew one to be anxious to send away a good man.",51
428,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"D e c i d e d l y not. The honourable member for Franklin said that many eligible men in the Service had not volunteered. On the other hand there are many who would willingly go to the Front, but whose services are considered to be of more value here. , Mr TUDOR - The honourable member for Dampier made the same remark as the honourable member for Franklin.",51
429,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Such statements are not fair. Men cannot be trained in twenty-four hours to fill responsible positions in the Public Service. No one knows that better than does the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs.,51

It has been said by honourable members opposite that the proposal is really meant fco apply fco those who did notvolunteer, and personally I should have liked to see it that way. The people of Australia have decided that conscription shall not be enforced; and, in my opinion, unless the amendment is carried, the Government will dispense ,with the services of men, not because they are incompetent, but because they have not volunteered, thus, getting behind the verdict of the people, and giving a lead to private firms to indulge in what is termed outside "" economio conscription.""",52

456,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Melbourne) [10.20]. - I wish to make a suggestion to you, MT . Speaker, which, if adopted, will be of advantage to honourable members, and also to people outside Parliament. Many the general public are not aware of the of name of the honourable member for Ballarat, or the honourable member for Balaclava, or of any other honourable member who is referred to in Hansard by the The name of his constituency. I suggest that when the member for a constituency is mentioned, 'his surni&me should be printed in brackets, so' that a person may read Hansard with more comfort than is 21 possible at present. . It was at my suggesAYES. tion that we followed the practice of the Imperial Parliament in providing cards to be sent in to honourable members by visitors to the House, and I suggest that we again follow Imperial precedent i i i the matter I have just, mentioned. Only last week, in referring to Hansard ot seven years ago, I had to turn to the front of the volume repeatedly in order to discover the same of the honourable member referred to in the course of debate. The thought struck ine that if I , with my parliamentary experience, found difficulty in identifying honourable members by their constituencies, the general public would have even greater difficulty.",53
457,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think the honourable member's suggestion is one that would meet with the approval of honourable members. At any rate, it is worthy of consideration, and I shall confer with the Principal Parliamentary Reporter with that end in view. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.22 p.m.",54
