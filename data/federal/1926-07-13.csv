4,Mr GREGORY,PRICE OF SUGAR IN WESTERN,"I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that retailers in Perth and Fremantle refuse to sell sugar under the conditions laid down in the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the sugar-growers for the distribution of supplies, and ask him if something can be done to prevent the people of Western Australia from being under a greater disadvantage than that under which they now suffer owing to their remoteness from the source of supply?",14
5,Mr BRUCE,PRICE OF SUGAR IN WESTERN,"Under the revised agreement sugar was to be made available at the same price in all theprincipal ports of the Commonwealth. Under the' old agreement, that arrangement applied to supplies at Fremantle only, but the concession was .made that the people of Perth could have their supplies atexactly the same'price as that charged in the other capital cities. Difficulty, ever, arose owing to the fact that the grocers in Western Australia will not fall in with the arrangement which is in force in all the other States, and sequently the concession, which had been given, uot for their benefit, but for that of the public, was withdrawn. I am not quite clear as to the actual position at the moment, but"" I shall have it inquired into. FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY. FRANCHISE FOR RESIDENTS. Mr E. RILEY - I have received a communication from a number of men who are employed at Canberra, asking if there is any possibility of their having votes at the forthcoming referendum?",14
6,Mr BRUCE,PRICE OF SUGAR IN WESTERN,"There are grave difficulties in the way, because the Electoral Act states definitely what persons are, and what persons are not, entitled to vote. The extension of the franchise to the residents of the Federal Capital Territory will receive early consideration by this Parliament. LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL .",14

9,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,LICENCES TO SELL POSTAGE,"Many complaints have reached me from news agents who have recently purchased businesses in which part of the consideration was, I understand, the fact that associated with those businesses, were licences for the sale of postage stamps on commission. I should like to know from the Postmaster-General whether it is. a fact that in all such cases his de-how- partment has refused to allow the incoming purchaser any commission upon the sale of stamps, although it is willing to permit an existing news agent to'concon- tinue the sale of stamps on the Bame premises on commission?",14
10,Mr GIBSON,LICENCES TO SELL POSTAGE,"The department has never regarded a licence tosell postage stamps as a transferable right. Although many - licences have been terminated, in cases in which it - is recognized that the convenience of the public requires that any particular news agent should have a licence to sell stamps on commission, the department has continued them. CENSORSHIP OF PICTURES.",14
11,Mr YATES,LICENCES TO SELL POSTAGE,"Some time ago the Minister for Trade and Customs stated that imported pictures would be censored on the advertisements associated with them. I wish, therefore, to direct attention to the fact that there is displayed in Bourke-street, Melbourne, today, an advertisement of a picture called ""Hell's 400,"" which depicts three scantily-dressed ladies, one of whom is wielding a pick axe, another shovelling gold, and the third shovelling coal on to a motor car. Will the Minister ask the chief censor what, in his opinion, will be the effect of such an advertisement on the public mind ?",15
12,Mr BRUCE,LICENCES TO SELL POSTAGE,I shall bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs. HALF-CASTES AT ALICE SPRINGS.,15
13,Mr JACKSON,LICENCES TO SELL POSTAGE,"Some time ago, the Department for Home and Territories commenced, about 30 miles from Alice Springs, some buildings for the housing of half-castes, but they have remained unfinished for a long while, and from present appearances I should say will not be ready for occupation for some years. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories be good enough to tell me what steps are being taken to' improve the arrangements for the care of half-caste children in the Alice Springs district?",15
14,Mr MARR,LICENCES TO SELL POSTAGE,"The honourable member gave me notice of his question, and I was therefore able to obtain the following statement from the department:The Commonwealth Government is f u l ly alive to the seriousness of the half-caste problem in the Northern Territory, and is taking all possible steps to provide for the care, maintenance, and training of the half-caste children under its control. In Darwin the female children have been segregated and are separately housed under the control of a matron, who trains them in needlework and other useful domestic arts, whilst a regular teacher of the Education Department is entrusted with their general education. Consideration is being given to the possibility of arranging for the care of these children to be undertaken by one of the missionary organizations operating in the north. In Central Australia the half-caste children under Government control are accommodated in a building at Alice Springs known as the Bungalow. The Government recognizes that this building is unsuitable, and that the site on which it is located is an undesirable one. The position was viewed with so much concern that, in 1923, arrangements were made foT Sir Baldwin Spencer to visit Central Australia and in vestigate the problem on behalf of the Government. In the report subsequently furnished by Sir Baldwin Spencer he commented very favourably on the management of the Bungalow at Alice Springs, and stated that the children were happy and contented. He pointed out, however, that the site of the institution was most unsuitable, and that while the Bungalow remained in its present situation it would not be possible to do more for the children than was then being done. In this connection it should be explained that whilst the Bungalow is close to the local hotel, it is also immediately opposite the local police station, and is under the personal supervision of the police sergeant, whilst the children are under the immediate care of a competent white matron and three half-caste assistants. Sir Baldwin Spencer recommended that a new site should be selected at some distance from the overland route, or from any projected railway or stock route. Following upon Sir Baldwin Spencer's report, the Government made an unsuccessful endeavour to induce some suitable religious body to take over the care of the half-caste children in Central Australia. The Premier of South Australia was thereupon asked whether his Government had a suitable institution which could take charge of the female half castes, but he advised that no such institution was available. Tho only course remaining to the government was to proceed with the erection of suitable buildings in a desirable locality, and, after careful consideration had been given to several sites, it was finally decided to proceed with the erection of an up-to-date homo at Jay Creek, about 20 miles from Alice Springs, and well away from the main overland track. In June, 1925, instructions were issued for the erection of a home in the locality mentioned, under the supervision of Sergeant Scott. A site was acquired, and the work of construction was put in hand without delay. A quantity of material was delivered on the site and construction was actually eomm'inced, but progress was greatly retarded by the recent disastrous drought. Difficulty was also experienced in obtaining local supplies of timber, which had to be transported some 40 miles; whilst trouble was encountered with the tradesmen. In December last it became necessary to relieve Sergeant Scott owing to illness; and, as it was impossible to proceed whilst drought conditions prevailed, the tradesmen were paid off and building operations were suspended The suspension of construction work continued owing to boring operations having given rise to doubt as to whether adequate water supplies could be obtained for the home when erected, and with a view to resolving this doubt further boring tests are now being urgently proceeded with. As soon as a sufficiency of water supplies is assured, the construction of the buildings will be recommenced, and every effort will be made to bring the work to a speedy conclusion. In the meantime, negotiations are in progress with one of the best known and most successful missionary bodies in Australia to take over the buildings, when completed, and to conduct the institution on behalf of the Government. It is confidently anticipated that these negotiations will shortly result in an arrangement satisfactory to all parties. WIRELESS BROADCASTING. Mr E . RILEY - I understand that a recent conference in Sydney decided to ask the Government to appoint a royal commission to report upon wireless royalties, copyrights, patent rights, and broadcasting fees. Will the Prime Minister indicate the attitude of the Government to that proposal?",15
15,Mr BRUCE,LICENCES TO SELL POSTAGE,"Amongs t other matters a shorter wave length, royalties upon patents, copyright, and the administrative charge deducted by the department from the listening-in licences, are now receiving the consideration of the Government. It is not intended to appoint a royal commission-at any rate, not before the present investigation is completed. WAR SERVICE HMS. NA",16

Whether it is true, as reported, that owing to a lack of harmony between the War Service Homes Commission and the State Savings Bank authorities the latter have intimated that they do not intend to renew the agreement? 2. Is it a fact that this disagreement is owing to the action of an officer of the War Service Homes Commission? 3. Will this disagreement in any-way interfere with the erection of War Service-Homes ? 4. Is it the intention to make arrangements with the Commonwealth Bank to carry out this work in the future?",16
17,Mr HILL,AGREEMEN T WITHVICTORI AN SAVINGS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. Owing to certain difficulties which have arisen in the administration of the present agreement between the War Service Homes Commission and the State Savings Bank, the State Savings Bank recently gave notice in accordance with the terms of the agreement of its intention to terminate same at the expiration of the present year. Negotiations have since taken place with the State Savings Bank, and there'is every prospect that the difficulties which have arisen will be amicably adjusted. 2. No. 3. and 4. See answer to No. 1.

Is it a fact that the Contract of Sale of the Australian Wool Clips to the Imperial Government during the years 1916-20, provided (a) that where any profits were made on the re-sale overseas of any wools not required for Military purposes thatsuch profits would be equally ' divided between 'the Imperial Government and the Commonwealth, (6) that should any loss result on the sales overseas, such loss was to be borne solely by the Imperial Government ? 2. Will he ascertain the reasons why Sir J. M. Higgins in the latter half of 1920, after all the purchases had been completed and when the Wool Market had collapsed, agreed to share the losses as well as the profits, and by doing so large losses were borne by Australia? 3. Will he ascertain whether the then Prime Minister, the Right Hon. W. M. Hughes, P.C., KC, was ever consulted in the alteration of the Contract? 4. If the Right Hon. W. M. Hughes, P.C., KC, the then Prime Minister, was not consulted, what reason has Sir J. M. Higgins for not submitting for approval so serious an alteration to a contract entered into by the Prime Minister ? 5. Will the Prime Minister ascertain from Sir J. M . Higgins the actual amount of moneys saved by the Central Wool Committee out of the allowances of 7s. 8d. and 3s. 4d. made by BANK. the Imperial Government to cover the cost of delivering the wool ex warehouse and/or store to free on board steamer? 6. Did these savings clearly represent revenue earned by a Government Department and have no connection with profits on the resale of wool overseas. If so, did they go into the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth ? 7. If not placed into the Consolidated Revenue, what has become of these moneys, and crhat are the reasons given for their not going into Revenue Account? 8. Will he intimate to Sir J. M. Higgins and the Central Wool Committee that the amount of the savings thus earned as revenue, together with interest to date, rightly belongs to the Commonwealth, and request that the amount be paid to the Commonwealth Treasury?",16
18,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN WOOL CLIPS,"In the agreement and appendices attached thereto made on the 31st day of March, 1921, between His Majesty's Imperial Government and the Commonwealth Government, and in the agreement and appendices thereto made on the 1st of April, between the Commonwealth and British Australian Wool Association Limited, both having been executed for and on behalf of the Commonwealth by the then Minister (the Bight Hon.

Offices, Sydney. In 1921 the Public Works Committee recommended to Parliament the erection of a modern office building in Sydney accommodate and concentrate branches Federal Departments occupying rented premises in separated localities. As the site contemplated at that time could be acquired on favourable terms, a new and more suitable site in Phillip-street, near Hunter-street, was purchased at later date for £25,000. t h is site, which is returning fair interest upon its cost, carried certain leases which it was inexto pedient to determine at the date of its the motion. purchase, and as the transfer of tax collection to the State rendered the erection of a building less urgent, the work postponed. B ut the necessity for the buildthis ing has now become more acute. This is due chiefly to the Customs House building at Circular Quay being now entirely rewith, quired by the Trade and Customs Departin ment, and to the consequent necessary placement of branches of other departwould ments at present located in that building. Another factor pointing to early need the proposed new building is the general unsuitability and high reuts of some the rented offices. The existing leases of Canberra. half of the acquired site can now be veniently determined, and the proposal to proceed with erection of half of the building as a first section of work. The estimated cost of this section is £92,000. I lay the plans of the proposed building on the table. Mr E. EILEY (South Sydney) [3.26]. - I should like a little more inforpoint mation on this matter. Why should the committee be requested to report on construction of only half the building? If there is a big demand for office modation in Sydney it should be a proposition to complete the building at a once. Every one who has had anything to do with the building trade knows the construction of only half a building means.

That he have leave to bring in a bill for an act relating to the export of canned fruits, and for other purposes. Bill presented, and read a first time.  for Markets and Migration) [3.38] -(B y leave.)-- I move That the bill be now read a second time. This measure, which relates to the export of canned f r u it , is to enable those engaged in the production and the canning of f r u it to control the exporting and marketing of their exportable surplus. The bill is almost identical in every respect with the legislation passed towards the end of 1924 in relation to dairy produce and dried fruits, which has been more than justified. The Export Control Boards, established under that legislation, have done remarkably good work. Before proceeding to explain the bill, I desire briefly to show the advantage which that legislation has been to the primary producers generally, and that an extension of the principle to the canned fruits industry will also be of advantage to it . Dried Fruits Export Control Board, in conjunction with its London agency, sold the whole of the 1925 surplus pack of sultanas, currants and raisins, amounting to 23,258 tons, at a price which could not have been realized under the previous unorganized condition of the dried fruit s industry. It was also instrumental in obtaining a considerable reduction in overseas freights, representing a saving of about £30,000 per annum to Australian fruit-growers. That was prior to the general reduction of freights which has recently been announced. The Dairy Produce Export Control Board, established under a measure similar to this, has also done a greab deal for the dairying industry. It has succeeded in obtaining a substantial reduction in marine assurance which has not only saved the producers of butter and cheese about £20,000 per annum on that part of their produce which they export, but has also meant an indirect saving of approximately £30,000 per annum in connection with the dairy produce consumed locally. I point out that anv reduction of the expenses of exporting is reflected in the local market. During the past six months, the Dairy Produce Export Control Board has been successful in regulating supplies on the London market, according to the capacity of that market to absorb them. Previously large quantities of dairy produce from Australia and New Zealand frequently arrived i u England during the months of January and February of each year, with the inevitable result that a slump occurred. That has now bo a great extent been overcome. I was very .interested recently in a graph showing the fluctuations in the price of dairy produce during the firsb six months of the board's operations, and for the same period of the previous year. The graph for the period prior to the establishment in London of an agency of the Dairy Export Conbrol Board, was like a series of-mountain peaks and valleys; 'whereas for the six months just ended, when the marketing was under the control of the board, there were slighb fluctuations only; in no case did they exceed l j d . per l b . , although previously they were as much as 4d. or 5d. per lb.",20
47,Mr COOK,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"That was the result of manipulating the market.  only prevented the market from being The manipulated, but it has also enabled the Australian producers to obtain a greater share of the market than was' the case previously. This bill, which is similar to the two acts to which I have referred, has been asked for by the Australian Fruit-canners Association, which includes not only the co-operative fruib canneries, but also the proprietary .canneries and the Leeton State-owned canneries of New South Wales. The growers of the principal fruits bo be canned have supported bheir request. The bill is designed to deal with apricots, clingstone peaches, andpears, those being the three principal fruit s which are canned and exported.",21
48,Mr SEABROOK,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Does it cover pineapples ?  bo include Queensland pineapples at present, for the reason bhat the local markeb has, up to the present time, been capable of absorbing the whole of the pineapple pack. Nevertheless, the door has been left open to enable pineapples to be included so soon as the Queensland pineapple-growers reach the stage when they desire to export. Until that stage has been reached, they are not particularlv interested in an export control board.",21
49,Mr SEABROOK,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Will the bill deal with canned apples?  said, it leaves the door open for the inclusion of other fruits which may be prescribed. Mr E . RILEY - Will that mean another - board?  fruits industry is not only a primary but also a secondary industry. Just as the production of cream is regarded as aprimary industry, and its manufacture into butter a secondary industry, so the canning of fruit may be regarded as a secondary industry supporting the primary industry of fruit growing. Four States-Victoria , New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania-ar e mainly concerned with this bill. The bulk of the production is, of course, in the irrigated areas. Mr E. RILEY - L-oe s the Government accept the responsibility of selling the fruit?  produced in the four States mentioned, Victoria grows 53 per cent., New South Wales 32 per cent., South Australia 8 per cent., and Tasmania 7 per cent. During recent years the production has increased considerably, chiefly on account of the areas given over to the production of fruits in connection with the soldier settlement schemes of New South Walc-s and Victoria. In 1921-22 Australia produced 14,431 tons of f r u it ; in 1924-25 that production had increased to 26,278 tons, or nearly double that of three years previously.  soldier settlements alone?  1,140,000 dozen 30-oz. tins of fruit were canned in Australia; by 1924-25 that number had increased to 2,500,000 dozen tins. The local consumption of canned fruits in Australia prior to 1923 was about one tin per head of the population per annum. In 1923 the Government decided to wind up the then existing so called canned fruits pool, and to inaugurate an advertising campaign throughout Australia with the object of increasing the local consumption of canned fruit. That campaign was so successful that the local consumption of canned fruits increased to three tins per head of the population per annum.",22
50,Mr SEABROOK,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Was that increase not largely due to the lower price charged ?  may have assisted; but the greater consumption was chiefly due to the campaign undertaken. Despite that increased local consumption, however, there is still an exportable surplus amounting to about 30 per cent, of the total production. Eor that surplus Great Britain is our best customer. During 1922, Australia disposed of 450,000 dozen tins of canned fruit to Great Britain, and, in 1925, 850,000 dozen tins. The possibilities ot the British market can be gauged from the fact that the imports into that country of canned fruit represent about 4,000,000 dozen tins per annum. Australia's contribution to that total last year, although practically double what it was three years previously, was still only about 20 per cent, of the total importation of canned fruits into Britain, the remaining 80 per cent, coming chiefly from California. It is expected that, as the result of the preference being given to us by Great Britain, and also of the advertising campaign which is about to commence in the Old Country, Australia will each year obtain an increasing proportion of her canned fruit business. New Zealand takes about two-thirds of her requirements from Australia, although we have only a 5 per cent, preference. Since the reciprocal treaty between Australia and Canada has been entered into, small consignments have been sent to that country, so that it will be seen that there are outlets for this trade in other parts of the world than Great Britain. The Commonwealth Government has rendered great assistance to the industry, but the results have been well worth the outlay. One might say that the industry has undergone three stages of development since the war. From 1920 to 1923 there was a pool, under which the Commonwealth Government of the day purchased the whole of the processed fruit from the growers at a stated price, and accepted responsibility for its distribution and sale. That was a very bad arrangement. It is generally found that when a Government does work of this nature it is not done so well as when the industry itself undertakes it. In 1923, the Government, which had recently come into office, decided to abolish the original so-called pool, and make the growers and canners responsible for the sale of their own products, granting them a bounty on their production and export sufficient to enable them to overcome their difficulties and to place them on a sound footing. During th© 1923-24 season they became responsible for the sale of their own products, and the Government paid a bounty, first, upon, the whole of the productionon the number of tins produced-o n the condition that the canners paid a fair price to the growers; and, in addition to that, the Government granted another small bounty on the export. That may be regarded as the second stage in the development of the industry. Since then it has been in a much sounder position than previously. In 1924-25 and 1925-26 it was no longer necessary to pay a bounty on the production. All that was required was the payment of a small bounty, which could, perhaps, be regarded as a freight subsidy on export. No bounty has been paid on fruit sold for local consumption. That assistance has sufficed to enable the Australian canner to meet the very fierce competition from California. By means of the assistance given during the past year, the canners have sold practically the whole of the surplus to one large distributor in the United Kingdom, who is a multiple shop-owner. Australian-canned fruits can thus be placed on the table of the consumer in Great Britain direct through the medium of those establishments, with as few intermediate profits as possible. This bill affects 22 canneries, twelve of which are in Victoria, four in New South Wales, two in Tasmania, and four in South Australia. Of these, seventeen are proprietary establishments, four are co-operative, and one, in New South Wales, is a Governmentowned cannery. The small numbers are misleading, in so far as the co-operative canneries conduct operations on a very large scale. Last year, 62 per cent, of the total pack was dealt with by the co-operative factories, including the Government cannery at Leeton, New South Wales, which for the purpose of representation on the board to be established under this bill, regards itself as belonging to the co-operative group.",22
51,Mr WATKINS,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Has the Minister taken into account what is occurring in Canada in consequence of our reciprocal treaties?  that matter at the present stage. The co-operative group has also dealt with 81 per cent, of the export. Three years ago, the co-operative canneries, including that at Leeton, handled considerably less than half the total pack.",23
52,Mr WEST,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Does the bill interfere in any way with the State cannery in New South Wales?  cannery has signified its desire for this legislation, just as have the co-operative and proprietary canneries, and it has associated itself with the Fruit growers Association, which has asked for the bill. I had the pleasure, a year or so ago, of inspecting the canneries in the electorate of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) . There are large co-operative canneries at Shepparton and Kyabram, and during the past year a third one has been established at Ardmona, in the same division. A year ago the site of the latter cannery was bare ground, but on it today a large establishment with modern plant is in operation. This year 3,000,000 tins of fruit have been processed at this cannery. I notice that one enthusiastic morning newspaper declared that 3,000,000 ""tons"" had been dealt with. Obviously, either the reporter or the compositor was responsible for this error. Honourable members will be gratified to know that the export pack this year is of a higher quality than has been previously produced in Australia. This good result has been brought about by the rigid system of inspection now in force. It must be realized that, apart from the small preference, this industry has to compete practically on even terms with overseas manufacturers, who are very keen competitors; and it is necessary rigidly to inspect the export and see that no fruit that might damage the high reputation of the Australian article is sent abroad.",23
53,Mr MARRS,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Can the Minister give me any assurance regarding the labelling of the product?  labels used by the various factories, and they appear to me to be all that could be desired. I think that whatever difficulties may have been experienced in the past in that respect have been overcome. I may mention, in passing, that the annual value of the canned f r u it s dealt with in this way is at least £1,000,000. The growers and employees-and I am not including their wives and dependants - numbe r in the vicinity of 5,000. large number of workers are employed in the canneries-it is mostly female labour - and very good wages are paid. The in dustry is capable of further expansion, since there is an enormous market overseas for the product. This bill provides, as did the other two similar bills to which I have referred, for a poll of owners of canneries to determine approval or otherwise of the proposal embodied in the bill . The definition of a cannery under the bill will exclude only establishments that deal with less than 100 tons of f r u it a year. The number of these is small, and they have very l it t l e interest in the export trade. The control of export and overseas marketing will be in the hands of a board of three. In the export control measures previously introduced in this House a larger personnel than is contemplated in this case was provided. Both the co-operative organizations and the primary producers have agreed that the board shall consist of three persons, one representing the co-operative interests, including the Leeton cannery, one representing the proprietary interests, and one nominated by the Governor General.",23
54,Mr SEABROOK,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"What grower ?  be directly represented through the cooperative interests. The co-operative canneries provide more than one-half of the output, and as the votes will be given not in relation to the number of canneries, but to the volume of the output, the growers will be directly represented through their co-operative cannery representative. The scheme will be financed by a method similar to that adopted in the other two bills, that is to say, by a levy on the f r u it packed for export. Provision is made in another bill, which is associated with this one, for a levy of 3d. on eaoh dozen 30-oz. tins exported, which is equivalent to Jd. per t in . That amount may be reduced but not in creased by regulation. On a conservative estimate, the levy will yield about £10,000 per annum. Obviously, that sum is very much larger than will be required to finance a small control board of this description, but it is intended that part of the money shall be included in the f u n d for advertising purposes. A smaller levy than 3d. per dozen tins may A be made, especially in the event of the quantity exported next season being large. The kernel of the bill is clause 13For the purpose of .enabling the board effectively to control the export, and the sale and distribution after export, of Australian canned fruits, the Governor General may by proclamation prohibit the export from the Commonwealth of any canned fruits except in accordance witli a licence issued by the Minister subject to such conditions aud restrictions as are prescribed after recommendation to the Minister by the board. That is exactly the principle which has been adopted in the case of the Dairy Produce Control Board and the Dried Fruits Control Board, which have already been successful.",24
55,Mr WEST,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Hav e they paid their way ?  than paid their way. Reports from those boards will be received during this month and laid on the table of the House. The board may eitheT export the canned f r u i ts or permit others to export them under licence, the conditions of which will be prescribed by the board. The bill does not compel the producers to export any proportion of their product. They themselves will decide whether they will sell on the local market or about the abroad; but the board will have control, either directly or by licence, of all canned f r u it exported. Mr E .

On this occasion I am like the author who writes in the preface of his book that anything of merit in it should' be at t r ibuted to his friends, and that any errors should be debited to him. An y merits there may be in this amendment belongs act, to the honourable member for Macquarie, the presentation of ib are attributable to me. The principle underlying this amendment was discussed on a bill that was recently be before the Chamber. I do not propose to of repeat what I said on that occasion, but I wish to refer to one objection that was raised by the Prime Minister to an argushall, ment which I put forward, and which was annual supported by a large number of honourable members on both sides. The right honorthree able gentleman said that the amendment then moved, which was very similar to that which I am now submitting, was an not attempt to evade the terms of the Constitution. I quite recognize that that was the not intended to be in any way objectionout able, but I say, most definitely and disday, tinctly, that there is no attempt in this proposal to evade the terms of the ConstiThe effect of it is that, if a justice the High Court does not retire at the age of 70 years, his pension will not be as large as it would have been had he so retired. ' As a matter of fact, his pension would decrease by 10 per cent, for every year that he remained on the bench after reaching the age of 70, so that, if hedid not retire u n t i l he reached the age of 80 years, he would have no pension to draw. Of course, in the meantime, he would have drawn as salary double the amount he would have drawn as pension. There is a proviso to avoid any injustice being done to those occupants of the High Court bench who are now over 70 years of age. Mr ""WATT - How many of them are there ?",25
60,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"HUGHES - I have not looked up the ages of the justices of the High Court, but I believe that several of them are now over 70 years of age. However, I have not considered this question in the light of its effect on the present occupants of the bench. I cordially agree with the honourable member who, on the amending Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , dealt with earlier in the session, first put forward the proposal embodied in my amendment. Although the Prime Minister said that it was an attempt to evade the terms of the Constitution, I contend that it is quite clear to any one who looks at the matter fair l y that my amendment has no such intent or effect. The statement of the right honourable gentleman on the previous occasion came to me as a surprise. I had not had an opportunity to consider it , but, now that I have been able to give it some consideration, it seems to me that the Government, if it intends to oppose my amendment, must put forward a better argument to defeat it . The amendment in no sense seeks to evade the Constitution. At present we have no provision for pensions for our High Court judges. The bill now before us provides for these pensions, I imagine, for two reasons-firs t of all for the benefit of the justices themselves when they reach old age, and, secondly, for the benefit of the community at large, that is to say, to render it unnecessary for the justices to remain on the bench too long. Briefly, the bill is to improve the position of the justices of the High Court; and surely it is competent, without any suggestion of evading the provisions of the Constitution, for this Parliament to decide the terms and conditions upon whioh those justices shall receive pensions ; surely it is competent for it to provide that the pension which a justice may receive on his retirement at 70 years of age shall be larger than that which he will receive if he chooses to retire at the age of, say, 77. The intention of the bill, I repeat, is to benefit the* High Court justices, and, I think, clearly to give some advantage to the public, and there is no intention in my amendment to do any in j u r y to the justices. In no possible circumstances under this bill could the position of the justices be made any worse than it is under the principal act. I ' was anxious to deal with this matter, not only to refute the argument put forward by the Government that the amendment would seek to evade the terms of the Constitution, but also to make it clear that in submitting it I do not agree with the view expressed by the hofuorable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) and other honourable members opposite, that the justices of the H i gh Court should not receive pensions. I see no reason - why the justices of the High Court should be put in any worse position than the judges of the Supreme Courts of the various States. Is it fair that justices of the High Court should not receive as high a salary as judges sitting in Supreme Courts whose decisions they are called upon t n review ?",26
61,Mr SCULLIN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,But it is necessary for the honourable member to justify the payment of pensions to all judges.,26
62,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"HUGHES - If the system of paying pensions to the Supreme Court judges of the State is in existence, as we know it is in New South Wales, surely it is fair to take that fact into consideration and see that the justices of the H i gh Court are put in at least as good a position as that of judges whose decisions they may have to override. The Commonwealth High Court justices should be at least as well paid as the State Supreme Court justices. Their discomforts are far greater. They have to leave their own States and travel all over Australia; they have to submit to a gre.at deal of discomfort which State judges are not called upon to face.",26
63,Mr MATHEWS,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,They are paid for that.,26
64,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"HUGHE S - Surely the honourable member does not suggest that the justices of the H i gh Court should be put in a worse position financially than that of State judges. If the State judges in New South Wales are receiving the same salary as justices of the H i gh Court, and are entitled to pensions similar to those provided in this bill , surely it is reasonable for the Federal body to be in at least the same position as a State judicial body. ally, I think that the Federal body should be in a better position than a State body. Some honourable members would not pay any pension. I think we would need to pay higher salaries to make amends for depriving the justices of the H i gh Court of the right to retire on pensions.",26
65,Mr WATT,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"In every other country, particularly in America and England, the justices of the central court are better paid than the judges of a State or provincial court.",27
66,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"HUGHES - That should be the case here. cases where there is a right of appeal to the Privy Council, our High Court is the last court of appeal in Australia. It is the tribunal to which we are likely to draw the men with the greatest ability from every part of Australia, and they should be treated accordingly. A good deal has been made of the salary at present paid, but it does not compare very favourably with salaries paid not only to business men, but also to leading men in the Public Service in different parts of Australia. the Commonwealth has good reason to be proud of its High Court. It started off with a very notable trio-Si r Samuel Griffith, Sir Edmund Barton, and Mr . R. E . O'Connor-and , as mover of the amendment, I think I ought to say it has, throughout the history of the Commonwealth, been a credit to the country over which it has ruled judicially. I believe that every honourable member and the great majority of the people of the country will agree that, in ability, probity and independence-so independent has it been at times that it has reversed its own judgments-it has exhibited the best qualities to be expected of a judiciary. I commend my amendment to the committee as one which, without conferring any hardship, will remove any inducement for a justice of the High Court to stay on the bench after his best days have passed.",27
67,Mr LATHAM,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Kooyong-Attorney General) (""4.12] - The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) has presented his case for the amendment, I may be allowed to say so, in a most fair and reasonable manner, and placed his arguments before the committee in a very [156] persuasive way. The substance of his amendment is an indication from ParliaPerson- ment that the justices of the High Court ought to retire at the age of 70, and he proposes to provide something in the nature of what is considered to be a pecuniary inducement for the purpose of bringing about that object. On the amending Conciliation and Arbitratio n Bill it was argued that an amendment proposed in terms corresponding to this amounted to an evasion of the Constitution. The only point then sought to be established was that the Constitution, as interpreted by the High Court, provides that judges shall hold office for life, whereas the amendment was based on the view, that they should not hold office for Except in life, but on the other hand should retire at 70 years of age. I do not suggest for a moment that there are not weighty arguments in favour of fixing the retiring age at 70 years.",27
68,Mr WATT,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,It should be done.,27
69,Mr LATHAM,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"And it may be done if the Constitution is revised, but at present the Constitution, as interpreted by the H i gh Court,provides that judges shall hold office for life. It is an interpretation we must accept. It is not worth I think arguing about. We have a definite decision on the point, given, as I have already said, after all the existing judges had already been appointed for life, so that their decision did not affect their tenure in any respect. Therefore, with the Constitution declaring that the justices of the High Court shall hold office for life, and that they may not be removed except in a particular way, is it really consistent with the idea underlying the Constitution to insert in an Act of Parliament a provision the object of which is admittedly to procure their retirement at a fixed age ?",27
70,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,HUGHES - The amendment is not an attempt to procure their retirement.,27
71,Mr LATHAM,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Substantially, the honourable member's proposal is to offer an inducement to the judges to retire at 70 years rather than at a later age. The Constitution provides that a judge of the High Court may be removed by resolution of Parliament only for proved misi f behaviour or incapacity. The amendment proposes to achieve indirectly a restilt that could not be achieved directly. So far as I can see, the amendment is not unconstitutional, because it does not provide for either the removal of a judge or the reduction of his remuneration during his continuance in office, but it is designed to avoid the constitutional provision by making it relatively unprofitable for a judge to remain in office after 70 years of age. A similar amendment proposed on the Arbitration Bill was defeated. That bill has now received the approval of both branches of the Legislature, and accordingly judges of the Arbitration Court will, by the decision of Parliament, have pension rights unrestricted by any conditions relating to a reduction if retirement does not take place until after 70 years of age. It would be embarrassing, to say the least, to attach to the pensions for High Court judges provisions which do not apply to judges of a highly important, but nevertheless, subordinate tribunal.",27
72,Mr MATHEWS,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"""We could amend the Arbitration Act.",28
73,Mr LATHAM,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"-The legislation providing pensions for Arbitration Court judges is now Law, and can be amended only by legislation introduced in a future session. The mover of the amendment was very careful not to reflect upon existing judges, but he has proposed that those who are over 70 years of age-and several of them are-shal l have one year in which to elect to retire on a f u ll pension; if they do not so elect, their pensions will be reduced at the rate of one-tenth per anmim. That proviso, if enacted, would be a very clear indication to the gentlemen concerned that this Parliament thought they should retire. The Constitution provides a direct method of dealing with judges who are guilty of misbehaviour or who show incapacity.",28
74,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,HUGHES - There suggestion of incapacity on the part of the existing judges.,28
75,Mr LATHAM,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"But the proviso to the amendment is an invitation to certain gentlemen on the Bench to retire within a year on a full pension, or be penalized in respect of their pension rights. Such a grave step should not be taken lightly by this committee. Eor the reasons I have stated, the Government cannot accept the amendment, but leaves honourable members free to vote upon it in their own discretion.",28
76,Mr WEST,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"East Sydney)' [4.33] The amendment is not likely to be effective. A judge who is given the optioii of remaining on the Bench for another ten years, during which he would draw £35,000 in salary, and retiring upon a pension which in ten years would amount to only £17,500, is almost certain to reject the latter alternative. I am not particularly in favour of putting pressure upon judges to retire at 70 years of age. Much older men have functioned with remarkable success on the Bench, and their accumulated experience and mature judgment have proved of great value to the community. The only consideration that would induce me to vote for the amendment is that judges should not remain too long on the Bench. Like Parliament, the Bench should reflect the advance of public thought. The present High Court takes a much broader view of the Constitution than did the original Bench, which comprised Sir Samuel Griffith, Sir Edmund Barton, and Mr. Justice O'Connor. If it becomes customary for judges to retire at 70 years of age, the Bench will be vitalized and brought up to date from time to time by the appointment of younger jurists, whose judgment will not be warped by conservative prejudices. With a court taking an advanced and liberal view of the Constitution, this Parliament would have greater power to legislate in the interests of the people. I am not in sympathy with the payment of pensions to high officials. The pensions paid to judges and the parliamentary officials in the United Kingdom amount almost to a scandal. Large pensions are provided for persons who give only 12 months or two years' service to the country. A Chancellor of the British Exchequer, for instance, reis no tired after very short service with a pension of £10,000 a year. I believe that the Australian people will repudiate this principle at the first opportunity. State judges do not receive such high salaries as High Court judges. The provision of a pension will have very little effect upon our securing the services of the beat men for our High Court bench, for many privileges fall to the lot of judges. They get free railway passes.",28
77,Mr LATHAM,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,Does any one imagine that that is much of an advantage to them ? It gives them no more pleasure to travel round the country than it does honourable members who have to do it .,28

Howafter ever good a man's standing may be in legal profession, he would need to be friendly with the Attorney-General for there was. the time being in order to secure an appointment to the High Court bench. I repeat the' suggestion that I made some little time ago, that when vacancies on the Bench applications for the position should be invited from persons qualified to fill them.

79,Mr SCTTILIN,AUTOM ATIC TELEPHONE,"Y a r r a ) [4.44] - In discussing this bill, honourable members of the Labour party have stressed the point, as they did in dealing with the Conciliawith tion and Arbitration Bill , that they opposed to treating judges differently from other public servants. We favour the provision of pensions on a contributory basis. But having been defeated in the High Court bench. our attempt to include a provision of that character, we must face the situapension tion as it is. Undoubtedly there is someshall thing to be said in favour of the Gohe vernment's stand that judges should not the age of 70 years. be obliged to make big sacrifices in the public interests; but I agree with the honourable member for Boothby (Duncan-Hughes) that if we wish them retire on reaching 70 years of age we should increase the inducement to retire by providing that for every year they main on the Bench after they reach that age less pension shall be payable to them. large pension. I cannot see that such a provision would reflect on the personal integrity of the judges at present on the Bench. I believe that if this Parliament had the power, would fix 70 years as the age of retirevote ment, but as„it has not the power, i proper for it to take this means of i ducing the judges to retire on reaching that age, or soon afterwards. amendment cannot, by any stretch of the the same point. imagination, be considered to be drastic, and I intend to vote for it . Mr E.

The principal act was assented to on the 19th speciJuly, 1924, and the commission, which by was appointed in due course, assumed of its responsibilities on the 1st January,retire1925. After eighteen months' experience of the operation of the act, it has been words found necessary to make certain amend: be ments for the more efficient working of the commission; the improvement of the machinery set up for the management of the Federal Capital Territory; and for new a clarification of the commission's posibe tion in relation to certain of its activities. The amendments proposed are largely of High a formal character, and do not introduce One of to the most important alterations is for the but purpose of authorizing the commission to for the erect and dispose of residences and other to, and improvements on leaseholds, - both for cash and on extended terms of payment.

It is, therefore, provide that the 'commission shall have power to erect dwellings and sell them public servants on extended terms. Mr E . EILEY - The commission has not power to purchase residences in Melbourne ?",30
84,Mr MARE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . I merely mentioned that the proposals of the Government regard to the acquisition of houses in Melbourne were outlined in the paper which was tabled in the House. The bill, as I have said, gives the commission power erect dwellings at Canberra, and to sell them to public servants on extended terms. position of a municipal council. This involves consequential amendments to the section relating to the commission's revenue, to provide that any moneys received by the commission as interest repayment of advances may be regarded as part of the commission's revenue as prescribed.

The existing act prescribes that lands on which utilities and services are provided, and lands £25,000 or over? contiguous thereto, may be vested in the commission by the Governoris General. As the services include roads, water supply mains, . sewerage mains, electric mains, parks, depots, and other utilities of a municipal character, it difficult and costly to provide for detailed surveys in order to delimit all the lands on which such services are provided. volve duplication. It would be .simpler to vest the whole This At present it has authority to manage and control, in the of the Commonwealth, all the lands in the Territory, including the city lands, and to receive revenue therefrom.

The Government thinks that the whole of the city area should be comvested in the commmission in order to necessary to reduce expenditure.",31
87,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"""Would that do away to with the Government's control of the commission in regard to those lands ?",31
88,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"In order to avoid duplication, the Government thinks it wise to vest all the city lands in the commission ?",31
89,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,But has not the comi n mission got all the land now?,31
90,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . It acts as agent for the Commonwealth: it does not control the land.

It will be remembered that steps have already been taken to attain more uniform action between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to the borrowing of moneys. The proposal now made would fitin with that policy. The alterations which will be submitted for consideration will authorize the commission to arrange with the Treasurer to include its requirements in Commonwealth loans. In this respect the act will be brought into conformity with the Northern Australia Act recently passed by Parliament. The commission will still be able to arrange with the Commonwealth Bank, or other similar instructions, for small loans for purposes for which it is not advisable to obtain a large loan by arrangement with the Treasurer.",31

96,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The commission present has power to raise loans, but is proposed that its loan requirements shall be obtained by the Treasury as part of - the loans floated by the Commonthe wealth. It is also suggested that commission shall, from the mencement, make a contribution to a sinking , f u n d in respect of all loans which are raised in that way. It is also necessary for a clearer tion to be made in respect to the comaction mission's liability. The existing provides that the sites allotted for liament House and the residence of the Governor General are not to be vested in the commission. The commission is consequently unable to earn any interest by way of rent or other charges, on the sums expended upon the construction those buildings.",32
97,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Why has that provision been limited to those two buildings. Why are not the residences for the land? President of the Senate, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister also includedj",32
98,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No residence for either the President or Mr Speaker has yet been proceeded with. It is only equitable that the Commonwealth should meet the agreed cost of constructing Parliament House and the Governor General's residence, because the commission would have no means of recouping itself if it were to be held liable for the expenditure. It is, therefore, proposed to exempt from the commission's liability all expenditure in curred on Parliament House prior to the act coming into force, and to provide for all expenditure incurred since that date on Parliament House and the residence of the Governor General to be defrayed by the Commonwealth. W it h the exception of these two buildings, the commission will be responsible for providing all buildings and services required by the Government in the Eederal Capital Territory, subject to a reasonable arrangement as regards charges by way of rent and for services rendered. Other amendments proposed are chiefly matters of decommission tail. They include the alteration of the title of the chairman of the commission to "" chief commissioner"" in order to avoid confusion with chairmen of local boards and committees in the Territory; provision for convening meetings, so that cases of difficulty or deadlock the M in ister may direct meetings to be held; in at vesting the chief commissioner with the it functions of a permanent head under the Public Service Act in respect to permanent public service officers; empowering commission to make by-laws having the immediate operation in case of urgency, comsubject to possible disallowance by the Governor General or by Parliament; and making clear the commission's position in relation to leases granted by the Comdefinimonwealth, in order that it may take in its own name, if necessary, for act the recovery of rent or other moneys. ParAt the present time, the commission cannot sue for and recover any money that may be owing by lessees.

100,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,-The existing ordinances will remain in force.,32
101,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes . No alteration can be made regarding them, unless by resolution of Parliament.

They are .all in conformity with the policy already laid down by Parliament in respect to the Federal Capital Territory. No vital alteration of the provisions of the principal act is proposed.

102,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Ballarat) [5.28] While I agree with the Minister (Mr. Marr) that this is largely a committee bill, on one or two aspects of it I should like further information.

Mr Lis TEE - If a referendum people were taken, the proposal would defeated.",33

"" We should be very careful what powers we vest in the each. commission, since, to all intents and purposes, it will be the ruler of tory. It has already done certain things that make me doubt the wisdom of grantlittle ing it any extra powers. The Minister avoided giving any satisfactory explanaof tion of clause 8, which is the main prober vision of the bill. Under the existing act, the commission's powers include ""the construction and maintenance of all works and buildings required for the purposes of the commission."" That provision, however, gave no power to the commisslates sion to build homes for members of Public Service, because the bill proposes was to - add to the commission's powers "" the construction of buildings for use as, or in connection with, residences in the Terfurnish ritory."" Yet we find that the commission has let a contract for the building of houses, which involves an expenditure about £500,000. I contend that the mission has done an illegal thing. Section 14, sub-section 4, of the principal act providesThe provisions of the Commonwealth Publio WorkB Committee Act 1913-1921 shall apply in relation to works and buildings proposed to be constructed by the commission in like manner as they apply in relation to public works proposed to be constructed by the Commonwealth. Even if the contract had been referred to the Public Works Committee, I claim that the commission had no power to enter into it. Evidently it has seen the error of its ways, and now realizes that it has no power under the act to undertake the construction of residences.",33
104,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,No .,33
105,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If that is not the of the bill, I cannot interpret the plain English. Even had the additional, to power now sought been held by the commission, it should have referred the contract for the 300 houses to the Public Works Commitee. Although I have not of the been long connected with that combe mittee I , like all honourable members, realise that it is doing that excellent work in the interests of the public. A house that could be built in Victoria for about £800, will cost be £2,300 at Canberra. In South Australia, houses than those being constructed at Canberra have been built for £700  the TerriCanberra is certainly ""hot.""",33
106,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Undoubtedly . What I have learnt of the operations of the commission has made me suspicious it . Not long ago, the honourable memfor Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), was informed that tiles were to be used in roofing the houses at Canberra. It was subsequently discovered that one member of the commission was interested in a slate quarry, and then it was announced that were to be used instead of tiles. the When the honourable member asked a question in the House on this matter, he distinctly informed that tiles were to be used; but the commission asked a director of one of the tile combines in Sydney to a report as to whether any alterations were necessary in connection with 300 the manufacture of tiles at Canberra. of One naturally becomes suspicious when comone hears of such actions as that.",33
107,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member say that since a member of the commission has become interested in a slate quarry it has been decided to use slates instead of tiles?,34
108,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Yes ; according to the Hansard report of a speech by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini).,34
109,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is not the case. Mr E . RILEY - Of course, if a resident wants tiles he can have them.",34
110,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It was definitely stated in the first place that slates would not be used. Later on, a quarry changed ownership, and slates were substituted for tiles. The large architectural fees paid for designing and supervising the construction of the administrative buildingalthough I do not blame the commission for it-show s that unless a careful watch is kept over the work at Canberra, there will be great extravagance. The late Government called for designs for this building, and that of Mr Jones, an architect of Sydney, was accepted. Por his work as architect, he is to be paid the ordinary fee, and since the cost of the work will amount to £800,000, he w i ll be paid £38,000. The Government ought to have its own architect for a building of this nature.",34
111,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The chief architect, Mr Murdoch, is an able man-.",34
112,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"He is also a good Australian, and he would take care that Australian material, as far as possible, was used. I strongly protest against the action of the commission in letting a contract for 300 houses, when it had no authority to do so. The Minister, in moving the second reading of the bill , admitted that the commission had no power to do this. These houses will , it is understood, cost much more than their real value, and they are to be built by contract. Although the total' cost will be approximately £500,000, the commission claimed that it was unnecessary to refer the proposal to the Public Works Committee. It took advantage of the technical point that each house would cost not more than £ 2 , 3 0 0; but the Public Works Committee Act provides that before any work the cost of which is estimated to exceed £25,000 is undertaken, it shall be investigated and reported upon by the committee. W it h a number of matters to which the Minister has referred, I shall deal in detail in committee. posed to give the commission power to allow park lands to be used by golf, tennis, and cricket clubs. It must not be forgotten that only a short time ago, there was a proposal at Canberra to form one large club, embracing all these pastimes, that would be very exclusive in its membership, and would benefit only the wealthy few. Knowing this, I am very chary of giving the commission any further powers. Surely we are not going to raise the commission above Parliament. Something should be lef t for the Parliament to do. If the contract has been let illegally, a full explanation of the occurrence ought to be furnished on behalf of the Ministry, and honourable members ought not to treat the irregularity lightly. If the commissioners have done that, they are not fit for their positions. I movejThat all the words after "" That "" be left out with a view to insert, in lieu thereof, the following words, "" this bill be _ postponed pending an inquiry into the action of the commissioners in letting a contract for the building of 300 houses involving the expenditure of £500,000 in Canberra.""",34

Clause 8, which is the main clause of the bill, has not been explained by the Minister. The purpose of it is to extend the powers of the commission, and one of the proposed new powers is for "" The construction of buildings for use as, or in connection with, residences in the Territory."" The assumption is that the commission does not now possess that power. If the commission has exercised a power that it does not legally possess, why has it done so ? That is the first question that emerges from this discussion.

121,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is very debatable, and the Government desires, by passing this bill, to make the matter quite clear.",35
122,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The existing powers of the commission do not include the power to construct residences for public servants, and yet the commission has let a contract for 300 houses at a cost £500,000. Even if we assume that the commission has the power under the original act to construct these residences, there still remains the charge made by the honourable member for Ballarat that the conditions applicable to all public works should have been observed. One conditions is that if a work exceeds"" in cost the proposal to construct it must be referred to the Public Works",35
123,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It is not proposed to alter,35
124,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The charge made by the the honourable member for Ballarat is that that provision has not been observed by the commission. We have not heard one word from the Government in refutation,35
125,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Why should it be mentioned if it does not arise under the bill ? ; Mr Scullin - Because it is prohas posed to make the operation of this clause retrospective to the commencement of the act. That is not proposed to be done for nothing, but to validate everything the commission has done. There is, of as the Minister admits, a grave doubt in mind as to whether the commission it has the power to let contracts for residences, and to remove that doubt this clause has been inserted in the bill, and been made retrospective to the date of appointment of the commission. What the purpose of making the clause retrounless it is to validate something that has been done irregularly?",35
126,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The whole bill has been made retrospective.,35
127,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Whic h suggests that much has been done without authority. The honourable member for Ballarat is justified in saying that before the powers of the commission are enlarged the contract that has been let should be investiwith a view to ascertaining why it was not submitted to the Public Works Committee for investigation. That is an eminently reasonable proposition. The argument seems to be in favour of the contention that the commission has not the power to erect residences. Paragraph j gives power to construct works and buildings required by the Commonwealth. That, surely, does not include public serof vants' residences. The power conferred by paragraph k is the power to-construct and maintain all works and buildings required for the purposes of the commission. There are limitations in both those paragraphs. One limitation is that the works and buildings must be ""required of by the Commonwealth,"" and the other is that they must be "" required for the purposes of the commission."" The proposed new paragraph lea confers a power which was not included in the principal act. If the commission does not possess that power, on what authority did it let the contract for the erection of residences for public servants at a cost of £500,000, and why did it let the contract without submitting the proposalto the Public Works Committee? That is one of the most serious charges made against this commission since its appointment, and one that should be investigated before the House extends the commission's powers.",35
128,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Parramatta) [5.55] This is not the simple little bill that Minister would have us believe it is. In the first place, it is proposed to vest in the commission the city area, with exception of the sites of Parliament and the Governor General's residence. I do not remember why this was not done at first, instead of retaining the area the name of the Minister, and making a system. specific provision which any one could see would involve a great deal of expense and additional work. The Honorary Minister has explained that, under .the present tem, all reticulation work for electric lighting, sewerage, and water supply vested in the commission by the Goverand nor-General's proclamation, and that wherever a main is laid, whether above or below ground, a survey has first to made of the particular area covered by the main before that can be done. The Government asks us to avoid all this unrents are due. necessary work by passing this bill, what has happened must have been houses patent when the original act was passed. I have looked at that act, and I cannot see why what is now proposed to be done was not done in the first instance. The Government must have had some very good reason for retaining control, and inserting the provision requiring the granting by the Governor General of lands necessary to. cover the works and other operations of the commission. Some explanation needs to be given for the proposed change other than the fact that present system is cumbersome, costly, unwieldy, and involves a great deal work, because this must have been patent from the first. Personally, I can see great harm in vesting the whole of the city area in the commission. At present all the leases in the Territory, inside and outside the city area, must bear the signature of the Minister, and all arrangements are made by the commission in the name of the Minister. If this bill is passed, the land will be vested in the chief commissioner, and the seal of the commission will be all that is necessary for the granting of a lease. It will not be necessary to have constant references to the Minister, and, incidentally, the Minister will not have the control which he now possesses. I think one of the reasons for the appointment of the commission was that things could be better done by a commission on the spot than by a .Minister in Melbourne. Conthe sequently, I am in agreement with the alteration proposed; but what I am not satisfied about is why the need is apparent the now, and was not apparent when the House original act was passed.",36
129,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The Government had not in then the experience of the working of the,36
130,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It did. not require very much experience to realise that, when a service had to be vested in the commissyssion, it would need a proper survey and description before a proclamation could are be made. That it would be an expensive cumbersome process could easily have been forecast. The bill .proposes to vest the city area in the commission. To all be intents and purposes, the commission, and not the Government, will be the lessors, and will be in a position to collect what As to the commission but proceeding with the building of 300 at a cost of half a million without reference to the Public Works Committee, it is, no doubt, the duty of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) to point out what has occurred, but I doubt whether the investigation he proposes would carry us very, the far. We already know that, at the request of the Government, a contract for cottages, involving an expenditure of £500,000, has been entered into under the the powers conferred upon the commission and by sub-section j of section 14 of the of principal act which provides that the commission shall have power to underno take, "" subject to the approval of the Minister, the construction of all works and buildings required by the Commonwealth in the Territory, except works exempted by order in council from the operation of this paragraph."" that power, and at the request of the Minister for the time being, in order to make preparation for the transfer of the Seat of Government, a beginning was made with the erection of cottages. contract was let, and apparently, because not one of the cottages would cost more than £25,000, the department, very wrongly, I think, came to the conclusion that the matter need not be referred to the Public Works Committee, although the total expenditure involved was about £500,000. I think the department put a very strained interpretation on the law, which the sub-section I have read will not support.",36
131,Mr MCGBAITH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"At any rate, it against the spirit of the law.",37
132,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Nevertheless , fact should not be lost sight of that the department was confronted with the necessity for making this immediate provision, and the reference to the committee would have involved great delay. As it is, the houses will be ready in time for the transfer to the Seat of Government. It is against the spirit of the law, but the fact remains that at the request of the Government the commission entered into this contract, and nothing we do not already know can be revealed by any inquiry. Taking sub-sections j and k of section 14 of the principal act together, honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin) has raised the question as to whether section j , which deals with buildings required by the Commonwealth; does not mean buildings required by the Commonwealth for its own purpose, seeing that sub-section k provides for "" the construction and maintenance of all works and buildings required for the purposes of the commission."" At any rate, as the Honorary Minister (Mr . Marr) has already said, there is some doubt as to whether the two sub-sections are broad enough to cover the erection of cottages.",37
133,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Surely buildings required by the commission are buildings required by the Commonwealth.,37
134,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Building s required by the commission would probably be offices and similar structures required by the commission itself for carrying ou its own work. On the other hand, the power of the commission, subject to the approval of the Minister, to construct all works Under and buildings required by the Commonwealth has been given a very, wide interpretation, and has been taken to include anything the Commonwealth requires to be built at Canberra. Under that interA pretation of its power the commission, at the request of the Minister for the time being, has entered into this contract because it was necessary to make immediate provision for accommodation for the civil servants before the transfer of the Seat, of Government. It is quite possible that, in the haste of preparation for the transfer, matters were not scanned as closely as they ought to have been. Another great obstacle has arisen in the working of the principal act. Although the act is may give the commission power to build these cottages, the commission has no the power to retain for its own purpose the rents derived from letting them. It may spend money and be debited with the total cost of the cottages, but the instalments and the interest paid by their occupiers have to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue. They are not credited against the big debit created by the commission in the erection of the cottages. Mr E . RILEY - That is merely a matter of book-keeping, which can easily be arranged.",37
135,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Unde r the principal the act it cannot easily be arranged. That is the difficulty which the bill is intended to overcome by very properly allowing the commission to collect rents and interest instalments and charge them against its capital expenditure. Power is given to the commission to do all these things in its own name. Previously everything had to be done in the name of the Minister for the time being, involving all the circumlocution referred to by the Honorary M in ister. This bill removes that difficulty. It sets aside all possibility of doubt that the commission is given power to erect these cottages and collect the rents for them. There is also the retrospective power referred to by the honourable member for Yarra. The commission took over the whole debt of the Commonwealth in regard to Canberra. It is responsible for that debt, and that debt includes all the originally erected residences at the civic centre, the power-house, and other localities where houses had been built prior to the commission coming into existence, and also the buildings at Acton. As the law stands at present, it has no power to receive rents and use them as an offset against the capital charge with which it is saddled. In regard to the final supervision exercized by the Government, the restrictions that were in the original act still remain, and everything must be done by ordinance. Every ordinance must pass through the hands of a Minister and Cabinet before it is approved. Afterwards it must be laid on the table of Parliament, and any honourable member can move to disallow it . All of the restrictions still remain as they vvere in the original act, and Parliament's control over the commission is still the same as was intended in the first instance. It controls all the ordinances under which the commission acts. I do not see any objection to the bill, except that it does provided. not go far enough. It proposes to hand over to the commission all lands in the city area. The other portion of the territory will continue to be managed by the commission for the Minister, and the x-evenue therefrom will be paid into the consolidated revenue fund . If the commission is to function satisfactorily, all lands in the territory should be vested in it , and I am confident that later another amending bill will be introduced for that purpose. Why the Government should take two bites at a cherry I do not know. It would have been better advised if it had asked Parliament to vest all Federal territory lands in the commission, Parliament retaining control by its authority to disallow any ordinances after they were laid upon the Table.",37
136,Mr MACKAY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Lilley) [6.12] - The members of the Public Works Committee have no cause to be grateful to the orable member for Ballarat, who is a memshould have been referred to it . ber of the committee, for the amendhonorable ment he has proposed. Some months ago, without any prior reference to the Public Works Committee, tenders were called the erection of a large group of houses at Canberra. I do not desire to excuse whoever was responsible for that omission, serious. but I am convinced that the commission was not to blame. If anybody was culpable, it was the Department of Home and Territories. About six or eights weeks ago the committee drew the attention of the Department of Home and Territories to the breach of the Public Works Comtions mittee Act, and a formal acknowledgthe ment of the letter was received. Only today the secretary of the committee received a reply in which it is admitted that a breach of the act occurred. This letter, together with the opinion of the Crown Solicitor, is not yet officially before the committee, and therefore, I think the honourable member for Ballarat would have been well advised to have deferred bringing the matter before the House until the committee had had an opportunit y to consider the communication, and to express its. views thereon. The department's oversight can hardly be excused. Section 15 of the Public. Works Committee Act providesNo public work of any kind whatsoever: . . . . . the estimated cost of completing which exceeds £25,000, and whether such work is a continuation, completion, repair, reconstruction, extension, or a new work, shall be commenced unless sanctioned as in this section Probably the department took the erroneous view that the houses were so many separate jobs, and that it would not be necessary to refer them to the committee; but it made the mistake of calling for tenders for 300 houses in one contract, in volving a very large expenditure. I do not think that there has been any deliberate lack of courtesy or an attempt to evade the Public Works Committee Act. Unfortunate happenings of - this k in d will, occur from time to time, but the department should have had a better understanding of its responsibility. The fact is generally recognized that the committee has done very effective work in the checking of departmental proposals and estimates, and has saved to the Commonwealth a very large amount of money. This is the first occasion with in my knowledge that it has honbeen ignored in respect of a work that The member for Ballarat was wrong in attempting to make political capital out of the employment of the architect of for the permanent administrative building. ",38
137,Mr MACKAY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"When the facts are known, the matter is not so serious as it looks. In 1924 competitive designs were invited for a permanent administrative building at Canberra, and certain condiwere laid down for the guidance of assessors appointed to adjudicate upon the designs. Amongst other things, it was provided that the successful competitor should receive a premium in accordance with the assessors' award, and should become the architect for the building unless, in the opinion of the assessors, after consultation with the Government and the Federal Council of the Australian Institute of Architects, there was some valid objection to his employment in that capacity. Altogether, about 94 architects submitted designs, and Mr Jones, the successful architect, had a right to expect that he would be employed as the supervising architect. Clause 36 of the conditions of the competition providedAn agreement to be entered into between the Government and the selectedarchitect (or architects) shall provide for his (or their) execution of all services connected with the work which are usual and in accordance with these conditions and the rules and regulations of the Federal Council of the Australian Institutes of Architects, and the terms of remuneration will be in accordance with such rules and regulations. The competition was instituted at the urgent request of honourable members of this House. I do not think there is a better architect in Australia than Mr. Murdoch, the present Commonwealth Director of Works, but his architectural work is so much in evidence in public buildings throughout the Commonwealth, that it was thought desirable in connection with the designing. of buildings at Canberra to introduce somo new ideas and variation in style. The honourable member for Ballarat led the House to suppose that Mr Jones was being paid £39,000 practically for a trifling service, but that is not the case. Mr Jones, in 1924, had to make the necessary inquiries and submit the necessary drawings and specifications in compliance with the conditions governing the competition. Then he had to appear before the Public Works Committee on numerous occasions to explain the details. If the matter stopped there, I confess that a remuneration of £39,000 would be extravagant, but he has the great bulk of his work still to do.. He will be fully occupied for the next, four or five years in supervising the erection of the building,, and. he will also need to provide a staff of men towatch the details of the work. In all the circumstanees,, it. is hardly fair to criticize Mr Jones.",38
138,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I was criticizing, not him, but the department which made such silly conditions.",39
139,Mr MACKAY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I do not admit that the conditions were silly. Mr Jones will give about six years' work in return for his remuneration. It must be remembered that architects of his standing are able to command big money in all the capital cities.,39
140,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Does the £39,000 include travelling allowances?",39
141,Mr MACKAY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It includes all costs of complete professional supervision at the rate of 6 per cent, on the capital cost of the building. The original estimate of the cost of the building was about £430,000; but the latest estimate is that it will cost about half as much again. I understand that 6 per cent, is the recognized charge of the Institute of Architects.",39
142,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,For a job of this magnitude ?,39
143,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The Government could have got the work done for a great deal less if it had had sufficient brains.,39
144,Mr MACKAY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The payment is in accordance with the conditions of the competition, from which no self-respecting government would depart. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [6.24]. - I listened with interest to the remarks made by the Honorary Minister (Mr. Marr). in introducing this bill. The comr mission has done satisfactory work so far.",39
145,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"At a price. Mr E. RILEY - I have nothing to complain about in respect to it. But the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act should have been observed. The blame for their non-observance must be placed at the door of the Government, and not the commission, for the commission, I understand, acted as it did at the request of the Government.",39
146,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Whic h acted . under duress of the Canberra-ites in this Parliament. Mr E. RILEY - The commission was instructed to provide accommodation at Canberra by a certain date for so many public servants, and it endeavoured to do so. If it had wished to evade the provisions of the Public, Works Committee Act, it could easily have done so by letting a contract for, say, a dozen houses to one contractor, another for a dozen more to a different contractor, and so on. Had it done that, none of the contracts would have exceeded £25,000.",39
147,Mr MACKAY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That it did not do so is additional evidence that it did not attempt to evade the act. Mr E. RILEY - I blame the Home and Territories Department, and not the commission, for whatever evasion thore has been. The honourable member for Ballarat complained of the design of some of the cottages that are being erected. In my opinion, there would have been much less ground for complaint on that score had the matter been properly investigated by the Public ""Works Committee. I have inspected some of the cottages that have been erected, and have found that they are not by any means as convenient as they might be. Many of them, as a matter of fact, are quite unsuitahle for Canberra conditions. The kitchenettes are very small in some cases, and there is not nearly enough verandah space.",40
148,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"And they are too low in the roof. Mr E. RILEY --That is so. Altogether the position would have been much better had the matter been referred to the Public Works Committee. I agree that Parliament House and the residences of the Governor General and the Prime Minister should not be under the control of the commission, for they will always be unremunerative, and it would not be fair to saddle the commission with them. In my opinion, it would be fair also to relieve the commission of the burden of the water supply and sewers. We should not expect it to manage works which will always, or at least for many years, be unremunerative. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) referred to the roofs of the cottages that are being erected at Canberra. Any one who has visited the city must admit that the red-tiled roofs present a monotonous appearance. It would be highly desirable for the commission to use slates for some of the roofs.",40
149,Mr LACEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"A cheap shingle roof is all that some of the cottages have. Mr E. RILEY - I disagree with the policy of roofing cottages with shingles, for shingles are dangerous in many ways. Seeing that one of the finest slate quarries iii the world is situate near Goulburn, I think it quite reasonable that the commission should use slates. The Goulburn slates, some of which I have examined, are equal to anything in the world.",40
150,Mr CORSER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Slate s do not stand hailstorms. I have seen many slates broken by hail.,40
151,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"They must have been poor slates. Mr E. RILEY - And big hail. In the Old Country where they have real hail storms, slates are used practically universally. A slate roof would be cheaper than a tile roof in the long run, for the timber would not need to be so heavy.",40
152,Unknown,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. Mr E.' RILEY - My chief objection to the bill is that it validates the action of the commission in arranging ' for the erection of 300 houses without observing the provisions of the Public Works Committee. Act, which - provides that all public works the estimated cost of which exceeds £25,000 shall be investigated and reported upon by the committee. If we are assured by the Government that in future the provisions of that act will be complied with, there will, I think, be little opposition to the measure. The commission has let a contract for the construction of 300 houses at a total cost of, approximately, £500,000 without any investigation whatever being undertaken by the Public Works Committee. Public Works Committees have been the means of saving the country hundreds of thousands of pounds, and I have the greatest faith in their recommendations. If the construction of houses at Canberra had been referred to the committee we should have some idea of the style of cottages to be erected,' the estimated cost, and all the necessary details.",40
153,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"What is the contract price of the 300 houses proposed to be constructed? Mr E. RILEY - No detailed information is available; but it is in the vicinity of £500,000. The Government should see that commissions appointed by Parliament do not in any way usurp the power of Parliament, particularly in matters of expenditure as has been done in this instance. In this case I believe the commission has acted on the advice of the Government, which realized that, as houses had to be provided quickly for the large number of public servants to be transferred, the work would have to be expedited. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) referred to the construction of the permanent administrative offices at Canberra at an estimated cost of £800,000, for which competitive designs were invited. Mr G. Sydney Jones, a Sydney architect, was the successful competitor, and for supervising construction he is to receive £38,000.",40
154,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The building is only estimated to cost £800,000. Mr E . RILEY - Yes ; and the ultimate cost may be £1,000,000. If the Government had called for competitive designs for the Parliament House at Canberra, and the architect of the accepted design had been remunerated on a similar basis, heavy and unnecessary expenditure would have been incurred. that case, however, the which has a splendid staff at its disposal, adopted a common-sense view, and referred the design of the Commonwealth Director-General of ""Works, Mr Murdoch, to the Public Works Committee, and, with slight modifications, it was accepted. Mr Murdoch designed Australia House in London, and many other prominent Commonwealth buildings, and. his work is generally admitted to be of a very high standard. In Mr Murdoch and Mr Hill the Commonwealth have very fine officers, whose services should be utilized instead of calling for competitive designs, thus involving .heavy expenditure in architects' fees.",41
155,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is what I am complaining of. Mr E . RILEY - Yes Works Committee, which I believe recommended that competitive designs be in vited for the permanent administrative offices, is largely to blame, but I should like to know why the Department of Works and Railways did not submit design.",41
156,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The architect of successful design in such a competition usually supervises the work of construcwhich tion. Mr E . RILEY - Yes , but if the department had submitted a design, and it had been accepted, the architect's would have been saved. trative building at Canberra is the permanent public building to be erected, and it should be the policy of the commission to utilize the services of the experts at its disposal in connection with future construction. It is proposed to relieve the commission of the expense of constructing Parliament House, the remodelling of the Governor General's residence, . and the erection of the Prime Minister's official residence, as. these buildings will not return any revenue. The Government should also relieve the commission of the heavy cost of the sewerage and water supply systems.",41
157,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The commission will charge water and sewerage rates. Mr E . RILEY - Yes , but the revenue of £61,000 obtained is so small that it should not be put in comparison with the expense incurred} because it makes it appear excessive. If the commission were In relieved of those costs, it could possibly' Government show a profit on the other works. M t . MAXWELL - The whole thing has been a great mistake. Mr E . RILEY - F r o m the Victorian viewpoint. Mar. MAXWELL - The honourable member is only now finding it out. Mr E . RILEY - No . The honourable member for Fawkner will change his opinion when he finds that in that healthy climate years have been added to his life. I trust everything will be done to assist the commission- I believe this measure will help-to develop the territory, but, at the same time, the Government should see that in f u t u re all work undertaken in the Federal Capital Territory, the estimated cost of which exceeds £25,000, are investigated b$ the . The Public Public Works Committee.",41
158,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Lang) [8.12]. - A good deal could be said in support of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr . a . E . Riley). I Was rather surprised to learn that up to the present the comthe mission has not observed the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, provides that all Commonwealth works, the estimated cost of which exceeds £25,000, shall be investigated and reported upon by that committee. I do fees not think it was ever intended that the The adminis-' Federal Capital Commission should be first above Parliament, and if the Public Works Committee Act has not been observed, the commission should be informed at the earliest possible moment of its visions. In the Federal Capital Territory, the cost of the houses appear to be extraordinarily high, even after making due allowance for the remoteness of Canberra from Sydney, and the difference in the cost of building materials. It is generally recognized that the cost of building at Canberra is far in excess of what was anticipated.",41
159,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Who is responsible for that?,42
160,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not know where the responsibility lies. The cost of labour is probably higher, but that alone would not account for the difference. Material is also more expensive, and the cost of transport from Sydney to Queanbeyan and from Queanbeyan to Canberra is heavy.",42
161,Mr JACKSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The bricks of which the houses are built are made on the spot.,42
162,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Althoug h there is no transhipment of goods, both State and Commonwealth railway charges have to be met.",42
163,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Probably the climate of Canberra militates against energetic action.,42
164,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member must have been misinformed regarding Canberra's climate, because its effect would be in the opposite direction. It has been stated that the cost of bricks has contributed to the high cost of building at Canberra.",42
165,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The House is entitled to know the reason for the excessive cost of building there. So far, the Minister has given us no explanation.",42
166,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Consider ing that the material necessary for making the bricks is available at Canberra, their high price is difficult to understand. Sir John Harrison told me some time ago that the commissioners intended to erect two additional brick kilns, in the hope that increased production and improved methods of manufacture would reduce the cost of bricks. I confess to a feeling of great disappointment, not only regarding the price of bricks, but also because good bricks are quite unnecessarily covered with rough-cast. I could understand rough-cast being used to cover inferior bricks or poor workmanship, but Canborn. berra bricks are probably equal to the best in the world, and, if they are well laid, it prois not necessary to cover them with roughcast to hide either inferior material or workmanship. On the contrary, the rough-cast' attracts and retains moisture, dust and cobwebs, and gets discoloured quickly. There is nothing to justify its use, unless it may be thought that the dark background of hills requires buildings of a light colour. Nevertheless, I cannot see that any advantage is gained by not using the bricks in their natural state. Monotony of tone can be relieved by the liberal use of trees of varied and bright foliage. I consider that, in addition to Parliament House and residences for the Governor General and the Prime Minister, the cost of the residences to be erected for the President of the Senate and Mr Speaker should be charged not to the commission but to the Government.",42
167,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The full capital cost of houses for public servants should not be charged to them.,42
168,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"There is a good deal in the contention of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) regarding the initial charges for water and other public utilities. These services should be charged against the Government. The branch services, when they become a source of revenue to the commission, should be charged against the commission; but the main water supply and sewerage services and ether public utilities should be debited to the Government. While I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that it is desirable that the officers of the various departments should be allowed to submit designs and estimates for buildings at Canberra, I contend that national public buildings such as the permanent Parliament House, and others that will be erected there, should be open to a wider sphere of competition than the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Mr E. RILEY - The departmental officers should be permitted to compete.",42
169,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I understood the honourable member to say that they should be responsible for the designs. Buildings like the permanent Parliament House should, in my opinion, be open to competition throughout the world.",42
170,Mr JACKSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The men who will be responsible for that building are not yet,42
171,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Possibl y not, for its erection; but there are many living architects equal to the task of designing the edifice. I do not desire my remarks to be construed as detracting in any way from the capabilities of the very fine officers we have in our Public Service.",43
172,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Mr Murdoch is equal to the best architects of the world.,43
173,Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I think that he is. Moreover, he would be the last man to desire to exclude outside competition, because of his confidence in his ability to compete with the world's architects.",43
174,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Would it not be well for buildings at Canberra to conform to an Australian style of architecture?,43
175,Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That could be arranged for whin designs were in vited. While I believe that the bill is on right lines, I consider that the attention of the commission should be called to the fact that every proposal estimated to exceed £25,000 must be .submitted to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report before the work is proceeded with.",43
176,Mr LACEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Grey) [ 8 . 2 6 ] - I should not have spoken had it not been for the attack of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) on the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH). The honourable member for Ballarat, in submitting his amendment, was performing a public duty. I intend to support his amendment. I take exception to the new paragraphs, ha, hb, and he, proposed to be inserted in sub-section 1 of section 14 of the principal act(ka) the construction of buildings for use as, or in connection with, residences in the Territory; (Kb) the disposal, upon such conditions as the commission determines, to lessees of land in the Territory, of residences and other improvements erected or made by the commission on that land; (kc) the advancing, upon such conditions as the commission determines, to lessees of land in the Territory, of money for the purpose of building or other developmental work on that land; This is a matter which affects not only the Public Works Committee; it is of public interest. In its issue of the 8th J u l y last, the Melbourne Age condemned the Government for having introduced a bill to override the provisions of the Public Works Act. Some time ago, when it was known that this legislation would be introduced, the honourable member for Ballarat agreed to look into the matter to which he has referred today. Before moving his amendment, he intimated to the chairman of the Public Works Committee that he intended to do so, believing that, by so doing, he was discharging a public duty. I take it that honourable members are entitled to discuss the various matters brought before them in measures submitted by the Government. If members must remain silent because they are members of committees which are interested in the matters brought before this House, I predict that it will be difficult in the future to find members will in g to act as members of those committees. If the honourable member for Ballarat had not introduced the subject with which he dealt, the probability is that another honourable member would have done so. His membership of the Public Works Committee should not preclude him from speaking in the way he did . In the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Needham) expressed the same view as that of the honourable member; and the honourable member for Lilley, who is the Chairman of the Publio Works Committee, sought a few weeks ago to move the adjournment of the House in order to make a similar protest. The inquiries conducted by that committee have saved Australia large sums of money, and during the short time tEat the honourable member for Ballarat and I have been members of it , we have realized more than ever previously that it is essential that the committee should keep a watchful eye over public works estimated to cost over £25,000. The attack made upon the honourable member for Ballarat this afternoon by the honourable member for Lilley was unjustified. He divulged a gre.at deal more concerning the proceedings of the committee than did the honourable member for Ballarat. While the latter merely discussed the matter in general terms, the honourable member for Lilley traced the history of the committee's protest. If any honourable member stated facts that perhaps should not have been disclosed, it was the chairman of the committee himself. I admit that he would have been justified in protesting against the provision in the bill to validate the mistakemade by the Federal Capital some time ago. The honourable for Lilley stated this afternoon thab the committee protested in the first instance against the letting of the contract the 300 houses until it had the proposal. When the letter asking the Attorney-General's partmenb for an opinion as to the authority on which the commission had acted, was under consideration, the present bill was prepared. Evidently that a provision of the Public Committee Act had been In common with other honourable bers, I have had an opportunity specting the houses bhat have been built at Canberra. We have been told the average cost is about £2,000. also seen the houses erected in Australia under the Advances for Homes Act introduced by the Gunn ment about two years ago. The cost of these houses is only £700 each, and repayment of the principal is spread over a period of about weekly paymenb of 18s. providing both interesb and principal, although the renb charged houses of a similar bype in Adelaide is as high as 35s. a week. wish to make is that the houses erected in Adelaide at a cost of £700 are better than those built at Canberra ab a cost of £2,000. I agree with the honourable ber for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) the bricks manufactured at Canberra are of high quality, and should covered by rough-cast is no exaggeration to standing in one position, could look through parts of the walls before the rough-cast plaster apnlied. The builders knew well that once the brickwork, badly constructed, was covered rough-cast, the public servant would not be aware of the fact that he was living in a ""jerry-built."" house. able member for South Stydney (Mr E. Riley"") referred to the roofing of these premises, and by way of interjection remarked that neither slates nor tiles were being used in many cases, but that shingles were being employed. orable member who has noticed the class of shingles in use will agree that will probably not last more than two or three years.

When The point I the No r t h Australia Bill was before the House, honourable members protested against a proposal that works costing over that sum should be carried out without mem- reference to the committee.

Surely the erecby bho tion of 300 houses at a cost of approximately £500,000 is a sufficiently i m portant matter to warrant inquiry by the The honor- committee. Why , when the committee sought an opinion from the Attorney General's Department as to the legality I nf the commission's act, was this b i ll hurriedly brought . before Parliament? Honourable members, irrespective of the Any hon- side they take in politics, should insist on the provisions of the Public Works they Committee Act being observed. The facts imported emphasized by the honourable member for memory, Ballarat are within the knowledge of every honourable member, because of the criticisms that have appeared in the press and the speeches that were delivered in the Senate when the bill was introduced.",44

A number of its provisions are equitable, and it is imperative that the conunission should have the authority sought: but I trust that in committee certain amendments will be made. Much has been said about the poor quality and excessive cost of the houses at Canberra. I agree with those statements, but with whom does the f a u l t lie? Does it not lie with this House ? Have honourable members not evinced a mad desire to reach Canberra in an unreasonably short time? Mr ""WATKINS - Wak e up !",45
180,Mr COOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is waking up now, but it is too late to prevent these excessive costs. Many civil servants transferred to Canberra will have to pay £600 more for their houses than some are worth, because honourable members were not ' willing to delay the transfer to Canberra for a reasonable time. The Seat of Government ought not to be transferred for at least two years, so that the preparations can be made without the expensive haste that is now taking place. Members of the Opposition, as well as members on this side of the House, must accept responsibility for the ' high cost of building. It is a pity that the contract for the 300 houses was not submitted for investigation by the Public Works Committee. An act of parliament has been violated, and the reason for violating it was the demand of honourable members that the Parliament should be transferred to Canberra within an unreasonably short time. There was not time to submit the proposal to the committee. If the commission is allowed sufficient time in which to carry out the work, it ought to be able to construct houses as cheaply as they can be constructed in any other large centre in Australia. It is doing business on a wholesale scale, and can purchase hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of materials at a time. But the rush to Canberra has created such a demand for builders that the cost of building has been increased, not only there, but also in Sydney. The best tradesmen can go to Canberra and demand their own price. In the course of time, when there is a collapse of the artificial conditions now created, honourable members will wonder what has happened. The extra cost i m posed upon public servants has been brought about by this House. I do not blame the commission, which.has done the best it could do in difficult circumstances. Some honourable members favour saddling the long-suffering taxpayer with the cost of Parliament House, and the Prime Minister's and Speaker's residences, and the sewerage and water services at Canberra for a period. Why should we not saddle him with the whole burden and make a complete job of it? I u any case, we shall have to saddle him with a considerable increase in the salaries of public servants, to enable them to pay the excessive cost of houses in Canberra; or, alternatively, we must write off £500 or £600 from the capital cost of some of the houses. I am inclined to think that it would be wiser to wipe off the excessive capital cost, which is the price of the breakneck speed at which we are travelling.",45
181,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Dalley) [ 8 . 5 3 ] - I am not surprised at the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook), who adopted his customary "" yes-no"" attitude. He first condemned the Government for erecting the cottages illegally, but said that the violation of the provisions of the Public Works Oommittee Act was justified because of the breakneck speed of the work. If the honourable member stands for anything he stands for private enterprise as opposed to State socialism; but he condemns these cottages, built under the system of private enterprise. He told us very eloquently that they were ramshackle place's, that their cost was excessive, and that it would be impossible for public servants on their present salaries to live in them. We do not. hear orte word from him in condemnation of the system of private enterprise under which they were b u i l t ; but if a government department had built them, he would have denounced it roundly. This discussion demonstrates, if it has demonstrated anything, the necessity for a searching investigation into the circumstances surrounding the letting of this contract. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) said that it was, at least, suspicious; I would go farther, and say that it is rather smellful. It is amazing that hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money can be spent in direct violation of an act of parliament, although the procedure is condemned, not only by members of the Opposition, but also by supporters of the Government. An immediate inquiry should be held. want to know why the commission evaded its responsibilities under the act, and why it did not provide for proper supervision of the work. Are private contractors to be allowed to appropriate hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money in return for defective work? The honourable memher for Grey has told us that the roofing of some of these houses . is shoddy shingling imported from America. This Parliament stands for the encouragement of Australian industries; and if the commission evaded the Public Works Oommittee Act in order to indulge in a policy opposed to the protection of Australian industries, a searching inquiry should be made into its motives. There is a tendency to evade inquiries by committees appointed by this Parliament. The Public. Works Committee is charged with the duty of protecting the public revenue. Will honourable members stand quietly ""by and allow the Government to throw the act under the table, and say ""At our own whim, we shall do what we like, and allow the commission to carry on any work we think fit."" We have learned from the chairman of the Public Works Committee that the committee protested by letter against the action of the Government. Honourable members ought to be told what were the committee's grounds of protest. Was it a protest against the class of work being carried out at Canberra, or against the illegality of the action of the Government in allowing the commission to enter into a contract to have certain work done without first referring it to the committee? House is entitled to an explanation. Can the honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) tell me what reply has been furnished to his letter of protest? Or is the Public Works Committee prepared to smother things up on behalf of the Government? Are we to have some more secret work like that dione by the Public Mr Mahony. Accounts Committee last week, when, instead of furnishing a report to Parliament., it secretly supplied the Prime Minister and other Ministers with the result of its investigations, leaving Parliament and the public unaware of what had been done? We ought to have an inquiry to find out who has been responWe sible for this illegal action on the part of the commission, as well as for the shoddy work done in the houses at .Canberra, and for the importation of the shoddy material which has been used in the construction of those houses. I wholeheartedly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), and I hope that honourable members will see that work at Canberra is carried out in a proper legal way, and that if it is to be done by private contractors, it will be properly supervised, so that the contractors may not rob the taxpayers of Australia.",45
182,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Franklin) [9.4] The bill contains many amendments which I hope will do a great deal of good; but I think that by moving his amendment the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) has been a little indiscreet. As a member of the Pnblie Works Committee, he knew perfectly well that the chairman of the committee (Mr Mackay),, voicing the views of every member of the committee, had communicated to the Department of Home and Territories the protest of the committee against, the action of the Federal Capital Coiamission in calling for tenders for the construction of these cottages, and he should have waited until a reply had been received and. considered by die committee, before taking action in this House.",46
183,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,But in the meantime this bill would be passed.,46
184,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It seems to me that the honourable member has brought the matter up in the House for adverThe tising purposes. There is no doubt the Public Works Committee takes the greatest interest in its investigations into the works that come before it. Already 1 by its careful study of the evidence it has called it has been the means of saving hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth. In one instance alone it has saved no less than £58,000. I quite agree that the Federal Capital Conunission has. overstepped its bounds in calling for tenders for these cottages without referring the work to the Public ""Works Committee. As a matter of fact, the committee knew nothing about the contract u n t i l it saw in the press the announcement that tenders had been accepted. It took the matter up immediately, and, as I have already pointed out, the chairman, with the consent of every member of the committee, communicated a protest, to the Minister for Home and Territories. A great deal has been said about the cost of building at Canberra. Every one with oommon sense will admit that houses cannot be built as cheaply at an isolated spot as they can be built in more populous localities. But the isolation of Canberra is not the real cause of the high cost of building there. Many of the cottages have been built by day-work, and much of the work has been done by men who are not tradesmen, although they are paid 25s. and 30s. a day. The brickworks at Canberra turn out the .finest bricks I have ever seen in Australia; but the bricklayers are not doing half a day's work for the money they receive. It is a. scandal. A good man can lay 1,000 bricks a day on a 9-in. wall, 1,200 bricks a day on. a 14-in. wall, and 1,500 bricks a day on an 18-in. w all ; but the men at Canberra are insbrucbed by the Trades H all in Sydney nob to lay more than 350 bricks a day. To-day, by the adoption of this policy, brick-work costs nine times as much as it cost twenty years ago. In the circumstances it is not surprising that the cost of building is so high. The Minister for Home and Territories, in a communication in reply to a letter I read in the house a week or so ago, told me that the commission has entered into an arrangement with the Sydney Trades H all to supply labour for Canberra, and out of the hundreds supplied by that Trades there are only 26 of the original men left . It is quite clear that men who are not tradesmen have been sent to Canberra. The commission has been to all the expense of bringing these men to the Federal Territory, only to find that they are unable to do the work. It is not to be wondered at that there is, in the buildings there, the "" shoddy "" work referred to by some honourable members. While the Government and commission are entirely in the hands of the Sydney Trades H all , we shall always get that class of work. The good men are kept to do the work in Sydney; the rubbish are sent to Canberra. The letter which I read in the House a few weeks ago was from a Hobart man, a first-class plasterer who, because he did not go. through the Sydney Trades H all , was not allowed to work on a job at Canberra.. He told me, in his letter, that men who are working on government jobs in the Territory, go into Queanbeyan on Friday night and take contracts which they carry out on Saturdays and Sundays. During the week they take good care that they do not work too hard for the Government but they work mighby hard when they are. working for themselves on contracts in Queanbeyan. Being a practical man and an employer of labour for many years, I am quite competent to speak of the class of work which any one can see being done at Canberra. A man who can furnish a cart drawn by a brokendown racehorse is paid £ 2 a day, and in that cart he can be seen any day conveying about a barrow-load of d i r t for half a mile. He is, actually, not doing 10s. worth of work, but is paid £ 2 a day for it . Is it any wonder that the houses are costing so much money? While that class of labour is employed, while the men adopt go-slow tactics, and while the commission is tied to the Trades H all in Sydney, the buildings at Canberra will cost a j o t of money, and their cost will f all very heavily, indeed, on the public servants who will buy homes there. The sooner some alteration takes place the better. I hope that the bill will go far enough to provide for better conditions than now exist in the. Federal Capital Territory.",46
185,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Darling ) [ 9 . 1 5 ] - I Hall have pleasure, in supporting the proposal that the failure to refer the Canberra, houses to the Public Works Committee should be investigated. Regardless of the side of the House on which they sit, honourable members should be jealous of the privileges of Parliament, and quick to resent any violation of the law providing for a full inquiry into all proposals for public works estimated the to cost more than £25,000. For three years I was a member of the Public Works Committee, and the more experience I had of its operations, the more convinced was I that it justified its existence, and should continue to function without hindrance or limitation. The 300 cottages at Canberra should have been referred to the committee. This is not the first occasion on which it has been ignored. Prior to my joining the committee, it had approved of the first portion of No. 1 hostel, now known as the Hotel Canberra, but before that job had been completed the Government proceeded with the construction of an extra wing at a cost considerably in excess of £25,000. That was unquestionably a violation of the Public Works Committee Act, although it might be pleaded in extenuation that as the right wing was only a duplication of the left wing which had already been approved, a further reference to the committee would he superfluous. In connection with the Canberra houses, either the commission or the Minister has blundered. The Government should frankly tell the House who, if anybody, authorized the commission to call for tenders for the construction of 300 cottages. Even a most cursory perusal of the Public Works Committee Act would convince one of the illegality of letting such a contract without first referring the proposal to the committee. Those ministerial supporters who are endeavouring to cloud the issue and cloak somebody should have more regard for the laws of this Parliament and the positions they occupy as custodians of the public purse. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) reproved the honourable member for Ballarat, and said, in effect, that a member of the Works Committee should not discuss in this House matters that are under consideration by the committee. That is carrying etiquette to a ridiculous extreme. Election to one of the standing committees does not gag a member in this chamber. Things will have reached a pretty pass when members of standing committees cannot speak in this House as their duty to their constituents dictates. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Ballarat discussed the Canberra cottages with me in the party room about five weeks ago, and frequently since then the Mr Blakeley. matter has been the subject of conversation amongst honourable members. The fully honourable member for Lilley as chairman of the Public Works Committee should be foremost in jealously guarding the rights and privileges of that most useful body.",47
186,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,So he is.,48
187,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is not so; both he and the honourable member for Franklin should be supporting the honourable member for Ballarat.,48
188,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member for Ballarat should not have brought this matter into the House. Mr BLAKELEY. - Does not the honourable member accept my word that five weeks ago I privately discussed these cottages with the honourable member for Ballarat? The statement that the honourable member for Ballarat made improper use of information that came to him as a member of the Public Works Committee is entirely unwarranted. The honourable member for Franklin, in a spirit that is alien to this age and this country, has once again attacked the workers. He heatedly denounced the Trades Hall, but forgot to suggest that the hand of Moscow is interfering with the progress of Canberra. From time to time the honourable member repeats a speech which apparently he learned when he first contested the Franklin electorate. I can imagine him telling the electors how the Trades Hall is ruining the country. At least, five times during the last three months he has made the same speech about the bricklayers who are hounded down by Trades Hall agitators, and are forbidden to lay more than 300 bricks a day. Mr E. RILET - The statement is not true.",48
189,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Of course it is not.,48
190,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It is true.,48
191,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member makes himself absurd by repeating such statements.,48
192,Mr SOTLLIK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It is like the statement he made regarding the tenders for the Grafton to South Brisbane railway, in respect of which he was given the lie direct by the Minister for Works.",48
193,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member claims to be a judge of a fair day's work. Where did he get his knowledge? He can have had no practical experience, or he would not make such ridiculous statements. Invariably the men who continually traduce the workers are those who never did an honest day's work.",48
194,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Order ! The honourable member must address himself to the bill.,49
195,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The man who does no work is always the critic of the workers. Investigate the lives of the men who defame the workers, and they will be found to 'be either sweaters, or drones living on the labour of somebody else. "" They toil not, neither do they spin."" The honourable member for Franklin took exception to the Trades Hall being asked to supply labour for Canberra. Thank God, labour cannot be got except through the Trades Halls, and it is a good thing for the workers, the employers, and the country generally that the Trades Halls and the Political Labour party have been able, despite the united resistance of the wealthy classes, to establish a fair basic wage and good working conditions. The honourable member for Franklin belongs to that class whom we have to continually fight in order to retain those advantages.",49
196,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I have never been opposed to the payment of good wages.,49
197,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member has never made a speech in favour of the workers, and his mentality is such that he never will.",49
198,Mr MACKAY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I rise to a point of order. Is the subject before the Chair the character of the honourable member for Franklin, or the Seat of Government Bill?",49
199,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member for Darling is legitimately criticizing the attitude of the honourable member for .Franklin-, but I suggest to him that the exclusion of .personalities would be in the interest of sound debate.",49
200,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Obviously the workers who have been libelled by the honourable member for Franklin cannot be heard in this chamber, and, as a representative of the working classes, it is my duty and privilege to refute some of the lies which are told about them. If words were bricks, the honourable member for Franklin would lay a lot. With that summary of his character I leave him. A fifth-rate clerk would know that the construction of 300 homes at Canberra should have been referred to the Public Works Committee, and the Government should frankly tell the House whether the Minister or the commission is responsible for the omission to refer it. The members of the Public Works Committee, whose first duty is to the House and the country, should not allow that body to be ignored and attacked as it has been.  - A portion of my electorate is close to Canberra, many of thp workers at Canberra are my constituents,. and I feel it is my duty to defend the commission, the contractors, and the workers against the attacks that have been made upon them. When the Federal Capital Commission was first appointed, some doubt as to .its .success was expressed, but, living near Canberra, I know that the general opinion in the district is that the commission has proved a pronounced success. Of course, it is criticized, and, on my last visit to the district, I was told of several directions in which it was alleged to be wasting money. An investigation of such charges, however, convinces one that less money is being wasted now than under the former regime. I do not reflect upon any previous administration; such mistakes as were made were inevitable when the centre of control was so far from the seat of operations. The commission had to accept responsibility for the sins of the past, and take over Canberra as it found it. The consensus of opinion is that it is handling the job well. In regard to the houses that are being built there, I agree with other honourable members that this House is as much to blame as is the commission for some of the faults of which complaint has been made. Shortly after my election to this Chamber, I attended a meeting in Sydney of New South Wales representatives, at which a deputation was appointed to wait upon the Prime Minister and urge that the work at Canberra should be expedited so that Parliament might meet there on the 26th January, next. The Government recently decided that the date of the first meeting at Canberra should be postponed until the 9th May, and, in order that the city might be ready by even that date, construction had to be hastened. Before Parliament can meet at Canberra, accommodation must be found for the officers. Had the housing been referred to the Public Works Committee, have reported in favour which the commission namely, that contracts for the construction of a large group of houses should be let as soon as possible. nothing has been lost by the omission to refer the houses to the A serious charge has been made against the commission, and it should be investigated by the Government. intention to support the amendment, cause I have no desire to delay the work at the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Dalley, (Mr Mahony) made some caustic remarks regarding the work being done at Canberra, but the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) was more severe. He said that some of the work was shoddy. Having seen the buildings at Canberra, I cannot that the work in them is shoddy. general complaint is that the buildings are unnecessarily strong, and could be less elaborate without affecting stability. The charge that the work is shoddy is a reflection on the commission, the contractors, and the workmen. disagree with the honourable member for Franklin (Mt. Seabrook), regarding the workmen engaged in erecting in Canberra. In my opinion, they comprise some of the best workmen in Australia. Many of the men are known to me, they having gone from various centres in my electorate to work there. cannot believe that their transfer to Canberra has caused them to adopt "" goslow "" tactics. T cannot see how the cost of building in Sydney has increased in consequence of good workmen having left Sydney for Canberra. The work being undertaken at Canberra does not compare with many of the big jobs in Sydney. The activity in the building at Canberra has, however, affected the towns in the surrounding - Builders from various country have accepted contracts at Canberra for the erection of a small number of cottages, with the result activities are practically at a standstill in the neighbouring towns; but I cannot believe that they have descended building shoddy houses at Canberra. Ur. Perkins.",49
201,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Is it a fact that ini some of the houses the partitions are made of bricks set on edge ?  of the step rect. has taken, Mr Scullin - That would not be .tolerated in Melbourne.  So different ideas regarding the construction of houses; some object to the buildings committee. being finished in rough-cast, saying that it tends to monotony, that it adds to the glare in the summer time; others It is not my object to so many red-tiled roofs; still be- others to shingled roofs. Personally, I object to so much imported timber being used in the Federal Capital. In the South Coast district of New South Wales there are large quantities of suitable hardwood, which could be used. At Berrima I saw some of this timber after it had been in use for nearly 100 years, and it was still good. The commission would be well advised to use the local timber. agree Mr WEST - Is pine timber available The in the district ?  of that nature would have to be obtained their elsewhere. I agree that money received as rent for the buildings which were erected before the constitution of the I commission, and which under existing legislation must be paid to the Treasury, should be paid to the commission. I buildings hope that the bill will be passed, because I believe that the commission has done good work, and that its powers should be extended. Nevertheless, I feel that the Government should investigate the I charges that shoddy workmanship and materials have gone into some of the buildings.",50
202,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"East Sydney) [ 9 . 3 6 ] - I should not have spoken had it not been for the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), who said that he spoke as a contractor. He may be a contractor, but he is not a mechaoic, trades or he would not have spoken as he has done to-night. This debate has resulted ' districts. from the action of the commission in accentres cepting tenders for the construction of buildings estimated to cost about £500,000 without the proposal having first been that building referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. I believe that that action on the part of the comto mission was due to its having received in structions to proceed with certain works. .Reference has heen made to the quality of the workmanship in some of the buildings at Canberra. I say, without fear of successful contradiction, that the workmanship in the buildings there will compare favourably with that in any other part of the world. With the possible exception of the bricks made by the New South Wales State brick works, Canberra bricks are equal to any in Australia. The honourable member for Franklin never tires of abusing those who have to work for their living. He spoke of the number of bricks laid in a day. I point out to him in this connection that cottages are very different from larger buildings - Cottage walls are usually built with a cavity, which means, that two separate walls, each 4$ inches in thickness, have to be built, and ties placed between them every second or third course. Moreover, window and door openings and struck brickwork require great care. The honourable member said that 1,000 bricks should be laid by a man in a day of eight hours. That would necessitate more than two bricks being laid every minute. That is impossible when building a cavity wall, where allowance has to be made for windows and doors. It might be possible on a big building with walls 18 inches thick with struck joints on one side only, and with the centre bricks merely grouted in j but it is not possible when building cottages. Because of the difficulty of getting contractors to undertake cottage construction, the Government should have erected these cottages. Many contractors when giving evidence before the Public Accounts Committee have stated that cottages do not pay them, and that they lose money on Government contracts. The honourable member for Franklin also referred to the action of the commission in getting the Sydney Trades Hall to send workmen to Canberra. None but the best tradesmen are sent there. I know that the secretary of the Plasterers' Union visited Canberra, and that he has - done his best to get men to go there. Competent tradesmen, whose wives and children live in Sydney, cannot be expected to leave their employment in the city to go to Canberra, even to receive 30s. or £2 a week more. When I was working at my trade I should not have done so, because it would have paid me better to lose one day a week in the city than to go to the country. I sympathize with the commissioners, because of the difficulty experienced in getting qualified workmen at Canberra. There is no necessity for first-class artisans in Sydney or Melbourne to be unemployed, and the only persons who are out of work there are casual labourers, who have not any particular trade. As honourable members are aware, the Public Works Committee Act provides that all works the estimated cost of which exceeds £25,000 shall be referred to the committee for investigation and report; but, in this instance, the commission, at the instigation, I believe, of the Government, evaded the law. A PubliG Works Committee and a Public Accouaits Committee, which are responsible only to Parliament, have been appointed with the object of supplying Parliament with information of public, importance, and in this instance the Public Works Committee could have given this House valuable information. It is surprising to find that the Government has assisted in breaking the law, particularly as the composition of the House is such that, if it were considered imperative that certain works should be undertaken without inquiry by the committee, approval would, I believe, have been readily given. The rights of Parliament should be jealously guarded by every honourable member, and I trust that in future such action will not be countenanced. If the law is to be broken, expenditure involving £1,000,000, or even £2,000,000, may be incurred without investigation. The ventilation of this matter has enabled members of the Opposition to express their strong disapproval of the action of the Government, and I trust that the discussion which has ensued will prevent a recurrence of the mistake.",50
203,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Swan) [9.55] - About three weeks ago, I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) if, in view of the heavy cost of constructing cottages at Canberra, the Government would appoint a committee, or some similar body, to make a comparison between the cost of the cottages being erected at Canberra and those being built in Adelaide under the Thousand Homes Scheme at a cost of £750 each. For the last four or five years it has - repeatedly been stated that the cost of the buildings erected departmentally was excessive, and the cottages now being built are costing more than they should. The Public Works Committee recommended that the services of some outside - person be obtained, not only to institute a comparison between the cost of houses at Canberra and elsewhere, but also to consider the desirability of a change in the style of architecture. The Chief Gommonwealth Architect was quite agreeable to the proposal, and said that he thought the idea a good one. The Federal Capital Com*mission, as honourable members are aware, is an independent body, which has absolute control of affairs in the Federal Capital Territory, subject to the act of Parliament under which it operates. The evasion of the act is the responsibility of the commission, and not of the Government. The commission has made a mistake, but there is no doubt that it was under the impression that in building a number of cottages, the individual contracts for which were for less than £25,000, it need not comply with the provisions of the Public Works Oommittee Aet. In that it was wrong, and the mistake will have to be rectified.",51
204,Mr SCULI,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"JN - Does the honourable member think that the 'commission had power under the act to accept that contract? Mr GREGOEY.I-In doing what it has done it has exceeded statutory powers. Reference has been made to the use of slates and shingles for roofing purposes; but I understand that slates were used because the owner of the house preferred them, and shingles were used at the request of the architect, who was anxious to show that they produced an entirely satisfactory effect. Before any bitter declamation is made against the commission or its officers, further inquiry should be made. As the commission was extremely desirous of providing the necessary accommodation for the public servants to be transferred to Canberra, prompt action had to be taken in constructing homes. D u r in g three or fou r years, the Public Works Committee has kept the Government well advised concerning the necessity of expediting the construction of cottages. But there has been too much anxiety to transfer the Seat of Government to Canberra. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber have urged that Parliament should meet there this year, or early next year, but I know that it would be impossible for it to do so in any degree of comfort u n t i l next June or July. The commission, in pushing on with this work, considered that it was meeting our wishes.",52
205,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,But was the commission responsible for over-riding the act?,52
206,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"In my opinion, it made the mistake of assuming that it had the right to let separate contracts for cottages without giving any consideration to the total amount involved; but the Publio Works Committee Act makes it quite Clear that any work that w i ll u l t i mately cost more than £25,00 0 must be referred to the committee. The mistake that has been made should be rectified. Costs are altogether too high at Canberra. I cannot understand why bricks are so dear there, for one of the most up-to-date kilns in the world is operating there with a magnificent shale deposit right alongside it . Bricks ought toi be obtainable there as reasonably as anywhere in Australia, and the commission ought to be able to purchase its requirements as advantageously as building contractors anywhere else, for it has the credit of the Commonwealth behind it . An investigation should be made into costs generally there. Livin g is much dearer than it should be. I suppose not a single person its in the Federal Capital Territory is growing his own vegetables. When the Public Works Committee visited the city all the vegetables that were being used at the hostel were imported.",52
207,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Eve n members of Parliament have to be imported.,52
208,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Some members of Parliament have been altogether too anxious to get there, and the haste is a good deal responsible for the high costs that prevail. Seeing that we have such a huge war debt to shoulder, we should have been content to remain in Melbourne for the next ten or twenty years.",52
209,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Whic h is nearer to the last Western Australia-Melbourn e or Canberra ?,52
210,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Honourable members know that I have been opposed to a hasty move to Canberra ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, although I do not like living in Melbourne; the climate here does not agree with me. But I have no desire to see the .taxpayer despoiled. However, we have gone too far to withdraw, and we should make an effort to get to Canberra next year. In my opinion the Government would be well advised to appoint a commission to visit .Adelaide to inquire into the cost and type of cottages being erected there under the Thousand Homes scheme. The splendid scheme in operation there is well worthy of examination. I understand that a right-of-way runs behind every block, and that the water supply, sewerage, and mains of every description run from the right-of-way into the blocks, so that footpaths would need to be broken up only when surface drainage was necessary. I am sorry that some of the provisions of this bill are to 'be retrospective. I object to retrospective legislation. I regret, also, that it is proposed to give the commission power to make regulations which will become effective before submission to the Governor General in. Council. Power to make regulations should be granted to the commission only under the ordinary condition that the regulations must be approved by the Attorney-General's Department and gazetted before becoming effective. I hope that I shall not throw a bombshell among honourable members, but I trust that something will be' included in the bill to determine definitely whether Canberra is to be a licensed or an unlicensed area. We should not shirk our responsibility in this direction. When a bill somewhat similar to this was before Parliament in 1909 an honourable membermoved a motion to provide that no spirituous liquors should be sold at Canberra, that no licences should be granted there, and that no alcoholic liquors should be manufactured i h the Federal Capital Territory. Mr Mauger, on behalf of the temperance bodies, opposed the motion, and said that it was preferable that power to issue ordinances in connection with the matter should rest with the Government. I disagree with that. I also disagree with the suggestion that this is a matter for the Canberra residents to determine. It is an Australian question, and this Parliament should decide it . 1 submit that, as this bill deals with the administration of the Federal Capital Territory, it would be quite in order for us to set out in it our liquor policy there. I am quite prepared to take full responsibility for anything I may say or do in connection with this question. As a member of the House Committee and chairman of the Publio Works Committee, I had. something to do with providing a bar in the provisional parliament house. We have had six or seven years' exfperience of the present ordinance, and I consider that we should not allow the existing conditions to continue. A few people in Queanbeyan have made fortunes through this dry ordinance; and large quantities of liquor have been surreptitiously sent into the Territory. In my opinion this Parliament should at once determine its policy in connection with this matter. I favour granting licences to the government hostels, but not to ordinary hotels. Parliament should not attempt to evade this issue, but should settle it . Every honourable member has had dozens of letters and pamphlets from people of all shades of opinion on the liquor question. I am not prepared to shirk my responsibilit y in a matter that should be settled once and for all.",52
211,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wannon) [10.10] Personally, I am. alarmed at the extra cost of building that the nation will have to bear in the construction of the new capital. We are now being provided with progressive examples of increased costs that were never expected. The high price of the houses at Canberra, of course, is largely due to the adoption of a programme of rapid construction. Whenever a government lays down a programme of huge expenditure with in a limited time, the economic and financial position is disturbed to such an extent that costs are forced up to an inordinate degree. The agitation that has commenced among the public servants who must go to Canberra will never cease u n t i l the cost of housing has been reduced to a figure proportionate to their salaries and wages. I cannot let this bill pass without expressing the opinion that the Government must now face the responsibility of either increasing their allowances or writin g down the value of their houses to a reasonable sum. I am not advocating the adoption of either course at the present moment; but I regret that the expenditure of huge amounts of public money, and the dislocation of ordinary economic conditions consequent upon the adoption of a rushed programme, has inflated building costs to such a serious extent as has been indicated. This is due to calling suddenly upon a great army of men to do work in a short time that ought to be spread over a considerable period. The matter cannot be allowed to remain as it stands. The problem will be much more difficult to deal with than it now is, i i the Seat Government is removed to Canberra without our having properly adjusted matters between the public servants and the Government that requires their attendance at the new capital. I hope that the Minister has some definite statement to make regarding the Government's proposals. It cannot suddenly call upon a great body of public servants to incur the high capital cost of housing at Canberra, and expect them to break up their present homes, unless it is prepared either to give them an allowance to compensate them for the increased cost of living at Canberra, or to write down the cost of houses there to a reasonable figure. I regard it as a criminal waste to spend public money and write down the value of the asset immediately it has been created. But whatever may be the conditions that the Government, through the Eederal Capital Commission, has created, the fact remains that the cost of building is much higher at Canberra than elsewhere. In ordinary circumstances this would not be the ease, since the only additional cost should be the extra railway freight on materials required. We should not, by reason of having created a special tribunal at Canberra for the regulation of wages and conditions there, set up a standard of wages higher than those obtaining in any other part of Australia.",53
212,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Frequentl y the wages paid in Canberra are lower than those in Victoria.,54
213,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I have been informed recently by a representative of the commission that it has to pay higher rates for labour at Canberra than are charged in both Melbourne and Sydney.,54
214,Mr GBEGOBT,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I think that that is the position.,54
215,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member will never again see low wages paid in Australia.,54
216,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am not discussing, that aspect of the matter, but am merely dealing with the comparative costs of labour at Canberra and in other parts of the Commonwealth. I am not specially pleading on behalf of the public servants; I am merely drawing the Government's attention to the position of that it has created. Many members of the Service are unable to make the large capital outlay that housing at Canberra will involve. The proposed weekly rental is beyond their means, and the Government must face the situation sooner or later.",54
217,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The sooner the better.,54
218,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes . If it does not do so it will have hundreds of dissatisfied public servants to deal with when they are resident at Canberra and Parliament is sitting there. I know that representations have been made to the Government by the Public Service, and Ministers have no doubt had time to consider the matter.",54
219,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [10.17] - The bill has evoked discussion along lines that one did not contemplate. The advisability of the Seat of Government being transferred to Canberra, and the wisdom of selecting it as the site of the new capital, has been discussed ; but the time has long passed when that matter need be considered at all. Rightly or wrongly, this Parliament is faced with the position that it must provide for the establishment of the Seat of Government at the site selected by a previous Parliament. The work of preparing for the transfer has been proceeding for years. During the debate several honourable members have stated that huge sums of money have been figuratively thrown into the sink-that millions have been wasted. My reply to that statement is that it shows how little they know about the matter before the House and about the return that is being received today, and' that will be received in the near future, from the money that has been, and will be, expended. Statements such as those about wasted millions and excessive grants of public funds, that we have heard in this chamber, have been made also in the press of Melbourne and the other capital cities. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) was the first to say in this debate that many millions of pounds had been wasted, and that, if the people had an opportunity to vote on the question of transferring the capital to Canberra, they would vote against the transfer. It is questionable that they would do so. I have said, and I now say again, that people in Melbourne imagine that, when they climb the post office tower, they can see the whole of Australia. That is the parochial view of the people and the press of Melbourne; but I am glad that there are persons in Australia, and honourable members in this House, who take a broader view than that. Those criti cisms prove that the selection of Canberra was wise. The same influences that are at work in this city would probably be intensified if the capital were now in Sydney. Several honourable members said that cottages could be built in South Australia for £700 or £800. I have seen houses which the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), when he was Minister for Works and Railways, had built at Canberra at a cost of £300 each. When considering price one must also consider quality. Sixty cottages which will cost from £1,600 to £2,200 each, are being built to designs drawn by. a Melbourne firm of architects, which won the competition for house designs,'and if any honourable member can build a cottage in Sydney equal to the £2,200 cottages in Canberra, at the same price, I will buy it from him. I know the cost of labour and building materials in Sydney, and it is not a penny less than at Canberra. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony) said that money was being wasted in shoddy cottages with shoddy roofs, and the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) said the Government was wasting £500,000 on a contract for 300 cottages. No contract has been let for 300 cottages, and, therefore, £500,000 is not being wasted. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) complained that some of the cottages were roofed with shingles. In the whole of the Territory there are only six cottages with shingle roofs, and in those instances the architects asked that shingles should be used to introduce variety.",54
220,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,But has a contract been let for 300 houses?,55
221,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No , and it is not proposed to let one. I could take those honourable members who have complained of shingle roofs to Sydney, and prove to them that they would have to pay more in that city for a shingle than for a tile or slate roof. I do not defend the use of imported shingles. Regarding the statements about the use of slates from the a quarry of which one of the commissioners was a director, the facts are that one cottage was covered with slates,' because the occupant asked for slates, and one member of the commission who happened to be a director of the slate quarry from which the slates had to be obtained immediately resigned from that position. Honourable members have made unfair allegations, probably because they are not aware of all the facts. It has been said that the commission should have built these cottages more cheaply; but no one is more anxious than the commission to build cheaply. Every one who has been to Canberra knows the enthusiasm with which the commission is carrying out its task, and its anxiety to receive suggestions that may result in cheaper construction. The comparison between Adelaide, where there are facilities for obtaining cheap timber and other building materials, and Canberra, is not fair. The honourable member for Swan said that Canberra ought to be producing the ' cheapest bricks in Australia, because there is an up to-date plant there, and the necessary materials are close at hand. The commission is doing that. It is producing probably the best class of brick in Australia. I know of only one brick that can be compared with the Canberra brick, and that is produced by the Thornleigh Brick Works, New South Wales. The brick works at Canberra, like many other Government undertakings, were loaded at the outset with heavy overhead charges. One could eat one's meals in that brick yard. But when private companies undertake brickmaking, they erect a sheet metal building, with as cheap a framework as 'possible. At Canberra, a previous Government erected a building of stout timbers, in a location where there should have been a good natural draught. The chimney, however, was kept low, and £10,000 was spent to install a system of forced draught to make the kilns burn properly. These are the overhead charges that the commission and the present Government have to carry. Recently, there were 11,000,000 bricks at grass at Canberra, but, today, they are gone. The commission proposes to duplicate the plant, but it will not repeat the foolish action taken previously by erecting a huge building .at unnecessary cost. It should be our ambition to try to find tenderers to build cottages at the wonderful prices referred to by honourable members. If that could be done, the 'commission would be very pleased'. The honourable member for Ballarat referred to the architect's fee of £38,000 for the administrative block, but the present Government, which is blamed for that, had nothing to do with it . A former Public Works Committee recommended that competitive designs should be called for that building, and this House, rightly or wrongly- I suggest rightly-adopte d the report, and the Government advertised for competitive designs. We' cannot have too many brains at work in evolving designs for buildings. As the committee recommended the scheme, and the House approved of it , the Government can be relieved of blame.",55
222,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Did the Public Works Committee recommend the rate of payment ?,56
223,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is determined by the Architects Association.' The architects have their union, and there is a union rate of pay of 6 per cent, for plans, specifications, and supervision, and no architect will do work for less. my honourable friend, as a trade unionist, would not work for less than the - union rate of pay. I can point out in Sydney and Melbourne many huge buildings on the cost of which architects drawing 6 per cent. The architects for the new Government Savings Bank in Sydney, which is costing £750,000, w i ll draw about the same amount as is to be paid to Mr Jones, who won the competition for the design for the first permanent administrative building at Canberra. But Mr Jones will not pocket the whole of the £38,000. will find it necessary to employ persons not only' to assist him in the preparation of his drawings, but also to supervise the mixing of concrete, the class of material employed in the work of construction, and so for t h . make £10,000 for himself, but surely honourable members will not contend that that is not a fair return for a man who has won a competition among the architects of Australia. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) declared that the Government was getting away with thousands of pounds, and had evaded the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act. The Government has done nothing of the sort: I shall state the whole position, and leave it to honourable members to decide whether the action taken by the Government has been with in the provisions of that act.. At the outset, I may say that Ministers agree with the view taken by the Public Works Committee. In its report On the proposal to erect hostels at Canberra the Public Works Committee recommended the Government to push on with the building of cottages as speedily as possible. Rightly or wrongly, honourable members on all sides were urging the Government to push on with the work of getting to Canberra as speedily as possible. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has said that the Government should give earnest consideration to the question of transferring public servants. As a matter of fact, Ministers have had this matter in handfor years past. Subcommittees of Cabinet have dealt with the question, and the Canberra Commission has evolved a scheme for the transferring of officers from Melbourne to Canberra. I came into the Government Even imagining, like a lot of honourable members do, that with a wave of - a wand one could transfer the - officers to their new quarters at Canberra, but I was very speedily awakened to a realization are of the difficulties of the position. By inquiries as to bow many officers are to be transferred this year, next year, and so on, over a period of five years, the commission arrived at the number of houses required this year, next year, and so on, for five years. It then told the .Government that if it was decided to He open Parliament at Canberra on the 26th January next, it would be an exceedingly difficult task to accommodate the public officers who would have to be transferred by that time, but that if the opening of Parliament was postponed u n t i l the He may 9th May it could accommodate so many officers. When the Prime Minister made his statement that Parliament would not open at Canberra until the 9th May, it was because if an earlier date had been decided upon, it would have been impossible to provide accommodation for the public officers who would require to be in the Territory before Parliament sat there. The commission informed the Government that in any circumstances it would be necessary to build 500 or 600 cottages. Through all these negotiations the Government has been in close touch with the public Servant. In quiries have been made to ascertain if officers to be transferred are married or single, or if they desire to build for themselves or to finance the building of homes through banks or other institutions or through the commission. Every public servant who is liable to be transferred has been asked whether he is living in his own house, and, according to the statement tabled the other day, the Government is willing to take over the Melbourne house of any officer liable to be transferred. A special valuator will place a value on the officer's house, the officer will be given a month in which to decide whether he will accept that value or otherwise, and if he does the Government will take over his house and all the responsibilities attaching to it. The officer's equity in the place will be transferred to his credit in the books of the commission or of any financial institution that will be building for him at Canberra.",56
224,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Will the Minister tell us about these contracts ?,57
225,Mr MARE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Thes e cottages had to be built to accommodate the public officers on their transfer to Canberra, and, as the commission was very anxious to get on with the work, particularly in view of the recommendation of the Public Works Committee that the Government should push on with the building of cottages, it called for tenders for 100, 200, and 300 cottages. But it did not accept tenders for 100, 200 or 300 cottages. It accepted tenders for individual cottages. There is no desire on the part of the Government or the commission to - evade any responsibility. The commission accepted the tenders of three tenderers, but tbese tenderers have not been advised as to how many cottages the commission will give them to build. The commission invited them to submit plaus and specifications of various types of houses, but reserved to itself the right to select so many of each type. It has given some of the tenderers authority to go ahead with the erection of so many cottages, but it has not told them how many they are to build. It told one man to build a dozen. It said that it was not certain of its position under the Seat of Government Administration Act, or whether the building of these cottages would be regarded as one work or a number of works. Furthermore, it was not anxious to evade the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act.",57
226,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"In the case of the contractor who was given a dozen cottages to build, did he submit a price for twelve houses' on the understanding that he would be given other cottages to build?",57
227,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I have explained that the commission called for tenders for 100, 200, and 300 cottages, and accepted the tenders of three different contractors at a flat rate per cottage. Mr iScuLLiN -^For 100 cottages in each contract?",57
228,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . The commission called for prices for cottages, and the number of cottages given to the contractor to build might run to 100.",57
229,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Does the Minister mean that the commission got a price per cottage, and the contractor might be called upon to build one cottage or 100 cottages?",57
230,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No ; the contractor mo3t likely assumed that the full contract would be, at least, 100 cottages.",57
231,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Were the tenders called for on that assumption?,57
232,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Tender s were called for 100, 200, and 300 cottages. The tenderers were asked to submit prices and designs, and the commission has accepted the tenders of three different men. It has selected, say, twelve cottages of one design, twelve of another design, six of still another design, and six of, perhaps, another design. Then it has given authoritory to the contractors to go ahead, but the contractors are to be paid at the rate of so much per cottage. The commission is not adopting this method to evade the act. It asked the Government whether the building of these cottages is one work or a number of works, and whether the whole matter should be referred to the Public Works Committee. at the same time the Chairman of the Public Works Committee wrote to the Government asking whether it was a fact that certain works were to be carried out without reference to the committee. The Government has submitted the whole matter to the Attorney-General for an opinion. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. BOUNTY ON SEED COTTON. Motion (by Mr GIBSON) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",57
233,Mr FORDE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Capricornia [10.40] desire to bring under the notice of all Oabinet Ministers some telegrams I have received fro m cotton-growers and repreof sentative farmers' organizations in land in regard to the proposed Commonconclusions wealth bounty on seed cotton.

Appreciate you according strongly urge for Tariff Board report to tabled in House, and, further, strenuously support Tariff Board's recommendation payment of 2d. Go your hardest!-RITCHIE . The District Council of Agriculture in Central Queensland represents thousands of primary producers, the majority of whom are growers of cotton. Another Almost telegram is from Mr J . Bourke, secretary of the Maryborough District Council of AgricultureCotton growers amazed Government's announcement pay .bounty l i d . Burnett council agriculture requests your support Tariff Board's recommendation - J . BOUBKE, secretary. The Government has announced that it intends to introduce at an early date a bill to provide for the payment of a bounty of l | d . per lb.« on seed cotton. As I understand that the bill has not yet been drafted, there is yet ample opportunity for the Government to reconsider the matter .and grant to the cotton-growers the'bounty of 2d. a lb. for which they have asked, and which has been recommended by the Tariff Board. When speaking upon the motion of the M in ister for Trade and Customs that the I report of the Tariff Board be printed, I the had not had an opportunity of reading that report. I have since obtained a copy it , and after studying it I am more Queensthan ever convinced that the board's were based upon the reliable evidence of practical men. The board is i l - a fair and impartial body, comprising George Hudson, Mr Herbert Brookes, Mr David Masterton, and Mr . George Leitch. Two of those gentlemen make are practical business men, who thoroughly understand the economic effect Mr Masterton represents the primary producers, and was appointed at the instigation of The board recommended (1) that a bounty be granted in of seed cotton grown in Auslb. for tralia, (2) that the bounty be for a via period of ten years from the date of coming into operation of the Bounty Act, (3) that during the first six years the bounty be at the rate of 2d. per lb. board took evidence from practical like Mr R.

""When I discussed this matter on a previous occasion, the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced a personal element, and took me to task for urging ab that time the payment of a bounty of 2d. per l b . ; but I should be recreant to my duty to the cotton-growers of Central Queensland if I did not take every opportunity to urge that the Government's decision be reconsidered before it IB expressed in a bill. Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [10.44] I do not desire the people of Australia to believe that the honourable member for Capricornia the only member of this House who is interested in the cotton-growers of Queensland. Less than an hour ago the honourable member discussed with me a deputation of members from Queensland, that is to wait upon the Prime Minister to ask him to consider the opinions of the growers, but the honourable member said not a word about that in his speech, nor did he give the slightest indication that anybody but himself is concerned in the fate of the cotton-growing industry. He is endeavouring to obtain a political advantage, and is more than justifying the statement made concerning him - by the Minister for Trade and Customs a few days ago. By resorting to these tactics, the honourable member is not "" playing cricket,"" nor is he helping to create an atmosphere in this Parliament thab would be helpful to the interests of the Queensland producers or to the favourable consideration of their just claims. All the Queensland members on this side of the House made strong representations to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Customs while the Tariff Board's report was under consideration, and on many occasions since. It is the desire of all the Queensland representatives that the Government should reconsider the bounty it proposes to recommend to Parliament, and that for the first few years, at any rate, the rate should be 2d. per lb. I have a speech prepared in support of .this proposal, but I do not intend to deal with the matter at length to-night on the motion for the adjournment of the House. My only object in rising is to let the House and the people know that the Queensland repre[157] sentatiyes on the Ministerial side .have a more sincere interest in the primary producers engaged in the cotton-growing industry than has the honourable member for Capricornia, andour efforts to assist this primary industry are more likely to meet with success than are the tactics employed by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde).
