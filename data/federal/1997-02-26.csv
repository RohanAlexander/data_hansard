2,Mr MOORE,CORPORA TION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Last budget, the government announced that it would transfer the development import finance facility, DIFF, loan liabilities from Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to the government's account. As a consequence, EPIC would make a special payment to the Commonwealth, estimated to be $40 million. At that time, it was noted that amendments would be required to EPIC's legislation to allow the transfer of loan liabilities and associated payments. This bill implements that decision. EPIC is a statutory corporation which exists to increase Australia's exports by providing international competitive insurance and export finance services. It has traditionally filled a gap left by the private sector, which has often been reluctant to finance or insure exports in certain markets because of the risks involved. EPIC operates on a commercial basis and mee"" all of its costs from revenue, including the need to build up reserves to enable it to meet future claims. EPIC operates essentially at no cost to the taxpayer and will, in fact, pay a dividend to government during the current financial year of $12.6 million. In 1995-96, EPIC supported $7.5 billion of Australian exports, supporting over 1,000 Australian businesses exporting to some 155 countries around the globe. Most of EFIC's clients are small to medium enterprises with an annual turnover of $50 million or less. The availability and cost of export risk mitigation is extremely important to these smaller companies. Some 87 per cent of new clients to EPIC in 1995-96 were SMEs, of which 60 per cent were manufacturers-exactly the type of company needed to drive Australia's future prosperity and employment. EPIC's role as a direct financier or guaran1997 tor has become increasingly important in line with the need to match overseas government supported involvement in the area of trade financing. EPIC's financing book stood at nearly $3 billion at the end of last year, all involving the export of capital goods and services from Australia. An important part of EPIC's financing role has been to deliver the soft loan component of Australia's overseas aid program through the former DIFF scheme. DIFF loans were concentrated in Asia and were long term-up to 25 years in the case of loans to Indonesia. A DIFF grant component the of some $120 million per year translated to soft loans through EFIC of some $350 million. Delivering DIFF loans of this magnitude presented EFIC with two problems. The first was the need to build up reserves in case of defaults on these loans, noting that the loans covered a significant portion of EFIC's exposure at anyone time. The second problem, a result of Australia's overseas aid program focussing on Asia, was the concentration of exposure in a fairly narrow range of countries. Like all insurers and financiers, EPIC would normally seek to spread its exposure. However, the concentration of DIFF loans made EFIC's loan exposures undesirably lopsided. In addition, this concentration also had the potential to restrict EPIC's ability to provide non-aid medium-term credit for Australian exports in these countries, particularly Indonesia. This was a matter of concern to the government, given the increasing interest of Australian business in Asia. The removal of DIFF loan liabilities from EPIC's account to the government's account, managed by EFIC on behalf of the government, removes these unintended consequences. This transfer will change EPIC's risk portfolio for the better, allowing room for EFIC to grow its mediumterm business, particularly in Asia. In relation to the financial impact of the bill, EFIC will make a special payment to the Commonwealth of $40 million. This amount reflects the liability that the Commonwealth will be assuming for the loans. The calculation of this amount was made by the government in the knowledge that EFIC's viability, and capacity for growth, to a large extent depends upon its reserve structure and the income generated from those reserves. The government will be liable to reimburse EFIC for any losses occasioned by loan defaults or other interruptions to repayment. The Commonwealth will also pay EFIC a fee for managing the loans. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA INCENTIVES BILL 1996 Cognate bills: NA AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES) BILL 1996 NA BILL (No.2) 1996 NA (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 February, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Lee moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (I) deplores the Federal Government cuts to public hospitals, pharmaceuticals and public dental services which have been made to fund these incentives in direct breach of an election promise; (2) is dismayed by the inefficiency of the measures which will do little to ease the funding pressure on public hospitals; and (3) is firmly of the opinion that the $1.7 billion would be better spent in providing extra Federal Government funding for public hospitals and direct subsidies for private hospital accommodation"" .",13
3,Mr ROCHER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The most contentious of the proposals being debated is undoubtedly the Medicare levy surcharge. It is remarkable on more than one count. Amongst its controversial features will be the introduction for the first time of an income test, excepting of course the levy-free threshold that has applied to this tax since its inception. The levy is and remains a tax on income, of course. To borrow from a television program aired way back when, only the name of this tax has been changed to 'levy' to dupe the innocent. The surcharge of one per cent will be levied against individuals and families who have supposedly high incomes and have not taken out private patient hospital cover. The income test to be invoked will operate with the same effect as tax brackets applicable to taxation of income. In other words, tax brackets will apply to the Medicare levy tax for the first time, however qualified. Governments love tax bracketing. Tax bracket creep has always been a source of joy to spendthrift governments because it enables greater income in the form of tax revenue to be gathered off wage and salary earners without changing either tax laws or tax rates. Even in times of low inflation it is a realised expectation of the majority of salary and wage earners that their incomes will increase commensurate with the experience and skills accumulated the longer they are in the workplace. Increases in income take those same taxpayers into tax brackets which attract a higher percentage of income tax than previously payable. Admittedly, the Medicare levy in the form to be created by this legislation will result in only two income brackets, whereas there are several for ordinary income tax purposes. But, as with the proposed superannuation surcharge, the precedent for tax bracketing will have been established. What then will there be to stop this or any future government which falls on hard times and finds itself irretrievably spending more than it collects from adding a couple more brackets? The principle having been set by the passage of this legislation, no-one will be able to argue against, say, a l1f2 per cent levy on single incomes over $70,000 and a one-half of one per cent levy on single incomes in the $40,000 to $50,000 income range. After all, four brackets applying to a Medicare levy tax would arguably be more progressive than a regressive one or two income brackets. Then the theorists will have a field day arguing the relative merits of progressive and regressive tax systems all over again. Happy daysl That is happening. Government apparatchiks will be rubbing their hands with glee, delirious in the knowledge that the proceeds of another growth on expansionary tax are there for everyone to enjoy. Growth will occur naturally through the medium of bracket creep supplemented by expansion, only a few strokes of the pen being needed to change taxation laws as they will then be as a result of these measures. Another controversial element of the Medicare levy tax proposal is that it arose out of not one but two broken election promises. The first promise to be broken was to the effect that the coalition in government would not touch the Medicare levy. It intends not only to touch it but to touch it along. The second broken promise was that a coalition government would neither increase existing nor impose new taxes. If the levy surcharge does not increase an existing tax, then it most certainly is a new one and vice versa. That is not a bad quinella of broken promises-two as a result of one measure. The original intent was described by Dr Blewett, a former Labor minister for health: ... this levy would provide cover for medical and specialist services outside hospitals, and accommodation and treatment without direct charge in hospitals by salaried or sessional doctors. There has been a lot of water under the bridge since then. The Medicare tax has become just another means of raising revenue, with the downside psychological effect of giving taxpayers the impression that the levy should be sufficient to meet all or nearly all their health costs. How often do we hear from constituents claiming that, because they have made their contributions by way of the levy on their incomes, they should not have to pay anything more or as much as they do in practice towards their health care needs? The answer to that question is: all too frequently. It is all too easily forgotten that the Medicare tax has never raised more than 35 per cent in anyone year of the total government expenditure on Medicare. Even with the passage of these proposals, the total raised is unlikely to exceed one-third of the cost of Medicare. Indeed, according to the information provided on the cost implications of these measures, there is to be a reduction in revenue of no small consequence over ensuing years. The estimated net figures, after taking into account a late government amendment to raise the threshold to apply before a tax rebate of 20 per cent can be claimed for the costs of health care in anyone tax year, from $1,000 to $1,500, are $8 million in 1996-97, $436 million in 1997-98, $504 million in 1998-99 and $491 million in 1999-2000. Mind you, given recent revelations following a mid-year review of the Commonwealth's fiscal position in relation to its budget, it is much harder now to have faith in those estimates. The House will recall that company tax yields to the consolidated revenue were in fact overstated in the budget papers by perhaps billions of dollars. The reason for that is said to be the failure of the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of the Treasury to factor into their predictions companies modifying their behaviour and legally paying income tax on profits earlier to avoid an announced future increase in the company tax rate. The failure by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Treasury gives rise to misgivings about the estimates of the public financial impact of these proposals. As with the proposed supercharge on contributions to superannuation by higher income earners, individual taxpayers will modify their behaviour to minimise or legally avoid the proposed hike in the Medicare tax. It is fairyland stuff to believe that, on the best professional advice, affected taxpayers will do otherwise. The ATO and Treasury should be as aware of that inevitability as they should have been alert to the reaction of companies in the example just given. Being a predictable probability and given the failure of the relevant government agencies to accurately advise the government accordingly, any nervousness about cost impact estimates in explanatory memoranda is entirely excusable. Such doubts extend to all cost impact estimates for all proposed legislation. After all, if figures so fundamental budget. to the budget can be so wrong, given that actuals are eventually measured against budget forecasts, why would the cost impact estimates in proposed legislation, which are never subjected to tests of their accuracy, be believable? There are more than superficial reasons for thinking that the revenue and expenditure consequences of this proposed legislation could be well wide of the mark. Most important is the lack of any advice or assurance that the likelihood of affected taxpayers modifying their behaviour has been factored into the government's predicted overall reduction in tax collectable during subsequent years, pursuant to these measures. Questionable also is that the carrot and approach adopted by the government to entice or motivate more people to take out private health cover will be successful. It is hard to fathom why anyone in the higher income tax brackets targeted will be induced by these measures alone to take up private health insurance. Presumably, such taxpayers took a conscious decision to either not join or to opt out of private health insurance. If that original decision was based on personal cost benefit analyses, as seems likely in most cases, these proposals will not tip the balance back in favour of private health insurance, given the safety net provided to everyone under Medicare. The incentives, at best, will narrow the gap between prudent self-interest and the cost of private insurance. However, increases in premiums have already eroded the potential benefits substantially since the government announced its well-intentioned proposals. In most cases those higher income earners confronted with the decision are hardly likely to be persuaded to take out private health insurance by what is now proposed. That assessment is merely as hard-headed as will be tile decisions of the affected taxpayers and not necessarily a preferred outcome. If that is an accurate prediction, then the total Medicare tax take might very well be greater than the cost impact estimates imply. That may very well suit the government in terms of going some way towards eventually balancing the A late amendment, which the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) kindly advised me about, is to be moved by the government some time during this debate. It gives rise to some concern. It proposes to raise from $1,000 to $1,500 in a full year the threshold to apply to medical expenses an individual must incur before he or she can claim a tax rebate on the surplus at the rate of 20 per cent. This represents a pretty hefty tax slug, being an increase of 50 per cent. Even more significantly for most people, it will have been a pretty bad year to have spent $1,000 or more on health care costs. There has to have been a bit of pressure on the old purse strings, as well as on health, to have to stick payout over $1,000 after Medicare claims and perhaps even private health insurance refunds. It will be even worse if it is over $1,500 as is now proposed. If some battler, whose health is also likely to have suffered during a catastrophic year in terms that we can all understand, cannot in the future claim a 20 per cent rebate on all expenditure over $1,000 in that same year, it may very well induce a relapse. It is to be hoped that it is not to be the case for too many, but it will be for some. The same battler will forgo up to another $100 in the form of a tax rebate on top of what is already probably a forgettable year for him or her. Another element to the government's proposed amendment is worrisome. The separate explanatory memorandum tells us that the raising of the tax rebate threshold will benefit the revenue by between $45 million and $50 million in a full year. Given that the maximum rebate to be lost for anyone person is $100-that is 20 per cent of $500-simple arithmetic suggests that 450,000 to 500,000 people will personally outlay $1,500 or more per year on health costs over and above Medicare and private health insurance refunds. On the face of it, that appears to be a little over the top; and perhaps the relevant government spokesman can enlighten the House when responding in the second reading debate.",14
4,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996. This bill provides incentives in two components of health care: hospital and ancillary cover. There are three levels of incentive. For singles earning less than $35,000 a year, there is a total incentive of $125. For couples without children earning less than $70,000 a year, there is an incentive of $250 per annum. For families with one child earning less than $70,000 a year, there is an incentive of $450 per annum. That ceiling rises by $3,000 for each additional child. This measure will benefit at least five million Australians who have over 2.5 million private health fund memberships. It will cost the coalition government over $600 million per annum. One of the most pleasing aspects of this bill is the Medicare surcharge. For those who can well afford to fund their own private health insurance, there will be a surcharge of one per cent of income. It will affect singles earning over $50,000 and couples or families earning over $100,000. This is absolutely necessary. The pressures on private health insurance are great. In March 1983, when the previous Labor government took office, 65 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. In June 1996, that had fallen to 33.6 per cent. There is a vicious circle at work in Australian private health insurance. As the funds payout more claims, either their reserves dwindle or they have to increase their premiums. Of course, when they do increase their premiums, there are those who will not or cannot pay that premium. These are usually people who believe that they will not be making a claim on the health industry: young healthy Australians. This leaves those with higher health care needs to continue to pay the higher premiums. So the vicious circle goes on. The Chief Executive Director of the Australian Health Insurance Association, Mr Russell Schneider, recently revealed the difficulties in and the squeeze on the private health insurance industry. In the Financial Review of Monday he said that the private health fund payouts had increased nine per cent in 1996. The claims had now topped $4 billion. Membership, however, had fallen by 1.2 per cent. Although this has slowed with the recognition that the government will be giving incentives for private health insurance, there is no doubt that there is still a terrible squeeze in the private health insurance industry. This difficulty is fuelled by older members. In 1996 those aged over 65 years made up 14 per cent of private health holders; whereas in 1995 it was 13.5 per cent. Claims by over 65s have increased by $200 million to a total of $1.3 billion. Private health demand is soaring, with claims for private hospital treatment rising 13.5 per cent in 1996 to $2.2 billion. It is timely that our Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) moves to halt the exodus from private health insurance, to persuade people not only to rejoin but also to maintain their private health insurance, to ease the pressures on the private hospital system and to ease upward pressure on premiums. I was interested in the addresses made by those on the other side of the House yesterday. Some of them said that the incentives would not work. Others said that the surcharge was unfair. What did Labor do? How many health insurance premium rises in the health insurance industry did they stop in their period of government? None. How many incentives did they give to halt the declining membership in private health insurance? None. How many punitive measures did they take against wealthy and comfortable Australians who could well afford to fund part of their own health care? None. In fact, they boasted that their Prime Minister and their minister for health did not take out private health insurance. They were irresponsible. The average premium rise under the previous government was 12 per cent per annum. In one horrific period-1986 to 1988-private health insurance premiums went up by 40 per cent. It was irresponsible and was fuelled by the Commonwealth removing two of the advantages that they had given the private health industry: the Commonwealth bed day subsidy for private hospital beds and the Commonwealth contribution to the private health .insurance reinsurance pool which enables them to average their risks. It is salutary to look at some of the figures given out by the Australian Health Insurance Association in February 1997 on those Australians who are doing the right thing. Of those over the age of 65 on fixed incomes, over 850,000 people have private health insurance. Of single people earning less than $20,000-and that is a modest income580,000 people have chosen to take out private health insurance. Of families with an income less than $20,000, 220,000 have taken out private health insurance. Those people are doing the right thing. Let us have a look at those people who are being less responsible. Of families earning more than $100,000 a year, 50,000 do not have private health insurance. Of single individuals earning more than $50,000 a year, 105,000 do not have private health insurance. In fact, of singles earning over $70,000 a year, 25,000 do not have private health insurance. These are people who could well afford the private health insurance premium and so relieve the burden on the public health system and the burden of premium rises. But they have chosen not to. An insured family on $35,000 a year contributes $3,476 to the nation's health bill which is more than the $3,442 contributed by a single person on $64,000 a year. I believe that the surcharge is necessary; it is certainly the tax that the government does not want to collect. But it will persuade people who can well afford to insure themselves to do so. It is interesting that the Productivity Commission this Friday will release its recommendations on the private health insurance industry, and the Health Department apparently will be making recommendations to cabinet. We all recognise that this incentive package, while it is very worthy and helpful, is only part of the solution needed to meet rising health costs, with an ageing population and increasingly costly new technology. Community rating plainly is not working and needs to be reinforced. There are too many hit-and-run members. What I mean by 'a hit-and-run member' is somebody who may be over the age of 65 or 75 who suddenly decides, 'Goodness me, I'm going to need more medical attention, my needs are increasing. I'll take out private health insurance; I'm going to need it.' At present that person will receive the same benefit as received by one of my battling families--one of those families I have mentioned with children which earns less than $20,000 a year and which has taken out private health insurance. It is hardly fair that people who have done the right thing, who have found it very difficult with children to take out private health insurance, should receive the same benefit as someone who has decided they will leave it until they need it. Community rating needs to be examined for the viability of the funds and to make it more attractive for Australians who want to do the right thing-get in young and insure themselves, and to keep their cover until they are older Australians when their needs are greater. This will be a very difficult situation. But I believe that we now have a health minister who really is facing many of the difficulties in our health system. To date, he has shown that he is wise and has the courage to take the hard decisions. It has been instructive, again, to watch the reaction of those on the other side of the House to many of the changes that our minister has brought forward. I know that the rabid Left will never be convinced. The shadow minister for the aged, family and community services-and general doom and gloom-will never accept any of our changes. But I notice that more thoughtful members do recognise the long-term problems in the health system in Australia. I think, certainly after having listened to some of them yesterday, those more thoughtful members perhaps have a touch of regret that the 13 years of Labor government did not see a minister willing to tackle the long-term difficulties in the health system. We have an excellent minister for health. I guess it is somewhat ironic that the man who rode into town to give the bush a fair go was a doctor from Melbourne. But throughout all of my country towns, people recognise that now they have an opportunity to have a doctor come to their town. In Collinsville, Glendon and Bowen, in many of our small bush towns, it is very difficult to encourage a doctor to serve the community there. The Minister for Health has taken that difficulty, faced it, and now we will see a far better situation with country doctors. He has brought in tough action on immunisation and a range of other measures that will assist all AustralIans. I commend the Minister for the latest incentives in private health insurance. I believe that we finally have a minister with the calibre to face the difficult situation in our health insurance industry.",17
5,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We have had a very interesting debate on these health bills which obviously has enabled us to have a comprehensive discussion about the health system, and especially the role of private health insurance in that system. It is interesting that throughout the debate we have had, on the one hand, people proclaiming that everything was wrong with the health system under the Labor government and claiming that all these changes will fix everything up and then, on the other hand, the view that everything was all right in the previous administration. I think it is true to say that there have always been problems in the health system. However, rather than bombastic political comment, what is required in this matter is an assessment of what can be done to achieve the best health system for Australia, based on the contribution of ideas from a range of people. Those who think that all the solutions lie with private health insurance and the private health system are obviously mistaken. We know from what has happened in the United States and other countries that, if you place excessive emphasis on private health insurance, on private health generally, a large number of people drop out of the system. You then get a situation in which health, rather than being universally available, becomes something which can be afforded only by the rich or those in the middle classes who are prepared to sacrifice considerable resources. We have all heard of the horror stories in the United States where someone goes into hospital and effectively loses all of their life savings-their house, their property, everything-in order to pay for their health costs. I do not think anybody, no matter whether they are on the right or they are on the left of the Australian spectrum, with the exception of a few fanatics, really wants us to move into that system. I hope not anyway. If that is what people are trying to say we should move towards, then they should look at the American experience and see how disastrous it is. What is even more serious in America is that the Congress and the President have been for years and years trying to bring in a universal scheme. Every time they try, vested interests in America who obviously benefit from this situation where health costs are excessively high and where individuals suffer dramatically from those costs have prevented legislative change. They have prevented the President-President Clinton, for examplebeing able to put in a national health system. We are very fortunate in Australia that we have been able to maintain a national health system. Anyone who has studied this matter will remember the history. The Whitlam Labor government introduced a national health system. As soon as the Fraser government was elected, they dismantled that system. When they dismantled it, they thought, 'What will we put in its place?' They tried a variety of health insurance schemes which were a combination of private and public. All of those combinations-every one of themdid not work. None of them worked. They kept changing the scheme because they could not get it right. They could not get it right because they had missed a fundamental element, which was universality. The number one requirement is that everybody must be covered in any decent health system. That is a requirement of natural justice. That is a requirement which everyone in a civilised society is entitled to. So that should be the premise with which we all begin. Unfortunately, during the Fraser government and by the election of 1983, which swept Labor back into power, they could not get it right in the final analysis and as a result two million Australians were not covered by health insurance. Two million Australians did not have any coverage, and that was a disgrace. That was one of the fundamental issues in the election. No matter whether the economy was growing or whether there were prospects of that-in fact, it was not growing at that time-the basic reality is that, if you do not provide certain essential services as a human right, especially health, then people will vote against you. And they did. When we came into government, we introduced the new Medicare system as a universal system. That universal system has served Australia very well. More than 80 per cent of Australians think that the Medicare system is a great system. One of the foolish actions of the coalition going to the elections over those years, especially in the 1993 election, was that they never embraced the universality of Medicare-that is to say, until the Howard opposition came into being in the election of 1996. I will come back to that point in a minute. Nevertheless, right up to that time, in every election the conservatives could not find the heart to say, 'We really understand that the Australian people want a universal health system and they want the Medicare system. They want a system that covers everyone where, if you are in real trouble and in real crisis, you can have medical care and you do not have to worry about losing your house or your property . You can get medical care that is affordable and that is in most cases free, with the exception of some cases where there are small charges.' We had the election. The conservatives, having lost so many elections on the health issue, decided that this time they would commit themselves to Medicare. And so they did. They made a commitment to the principles of Medicare. But the question now is: are these changes that have been announced and the ones that are going through this chamber today consistent with the principles of Medicare? What are they actually doing? More importantly, are they actually dealing with the real problems of the Medicare system? The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who is a doctor, waxed lyrical about how progressive and wonderful these changes are. 'After all,' he said, 'this surplus charge on the rich, which is going to make most of them go into private health insurance, is going to be something which, obviously, any person believing in social justice should support.' That is essentially what he said. He said that this surplus charge on the wealthy was something which the Labor Party should support unqualifiedly and there should be no problem. At first sight you might think that that is correct. But the problem is, as has been mentioned and as figures given in detail by the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and other members on this side of the House show, that the concession which the government gave to people to get into private health insurance has virtually been swallowed up by the increased charges in private health insurance. I know members opposite have tried to make naught of this matter. I do not think that one single one of them has addressed this Issue. If the member for Bradfield had been less sanctimonious and more to the point, he would have got up and said, 'The government intended to do something on this matter, but it has been ruined by the private health insurance companies.' There is no doubt about it that it has been ruined, because virtually the total concession has now gone into increased charges by the health insurance companies, and we even hear of more charges to come. After all this happened, the Prime Minister thought, 'Oh, God. The whole scheme looks like it's going to collapse in a heap,' so he ordered an inquiry. That is very consistent with this government. Every time there is a problem which they cannot resolve, there is another inquiry. Let us see what this inquiry is going to come up with and let us see whether it is going to address the real problems which we face in relation to this balance between private health and public health, because we have to get the balance right. Obviously this move by the Howard government did not get it right, because it failed to take into account the fact of greed in the health system. What is driving this greed? You have a cosy little deal between the health insurance companies and the private hospitals. Charges go up in the private hospitals and the companies say, 'Oh, that's all right. We'll put up the charges in the health insurance area,' and Bob's your uncle. There is no requirement to justify what they are doing on the basis of facts. They put forward some rationalisations, and who doesn't when they are trying to make excessive profits? The reality is that those increases should never have been granted. The government should have said, 'Okay, we'll hold an inquiry, but we will freeze charges until the end of that inquiry.' That is what a decent and sensible government would have done in this context-a government that was concerned that this matter be resolved. Instead, what has happened? They granted all the increases and then they said, 'We'll have an inquiry afterwards.' Talk about after the horse has bolted. What is going to happen because of these increases? Are people really going to be induced to go into private health insurance with these increased costs? Of course they are not. They are going to say, 'Oh, well, in this situation there is nothing in it for me.' It was mentioned by the member for Bradfield and others that there were problems even before, when we were in government, which were being addressed by former Senator Richardson and other health ministers. It was claimed that our health ministers did not do any good on this matter. It is all very well, when you do not have a solution, to get up and say, 'Well, they didn't do any good on this matter.' The reality is, however, that the matter is a very difficult one. It is difficult because there is a division powers in the area of health between the federal government and the states. We have had the continuing problem of cost shifting, and the public hospitals have been under the control of the state governments. While they are under the control of the state governments, the state governments are able to undermine the intentions of any federal government, of whatever colour, by insufficiently funding public hospitals. Of course, this is what has happened in Victoria in particular. The previous speaker, the member for Dawson, (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) had the audacity to say that something had been done about health for people in the bush. The minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology, (Mr MCGauran) would know what has been done about health in the bush by the Victorian government, alright. All sorts of public hospitals in the country in Victoria have been closed down by the Kennett government. That is what has happened. That is the idea of the conservatives, not only in Victoria but throughout Australia. The response from state governments to the health crisis has been to close public hospitals or to reduce the number of beds or to reduce budgets and thereby force the hospitals to adopt unacceptable practices. Then we have the impertinence of the government coming in here, saying, 'Look, these measures are going to solve our health problems.' They are not going to do anything of the kind. What is essential to solve this issue is to ensure that, no matter how many people there are in the Medicare system and in private health insurance, when a person under their universal entitlement wants to go to a public hospital, they are able to get into a bed in a public hospital. That is the fundamental requirement. It is that requirement which has not been achieved, espeCially now with the cutbacks in health by state governments. Do the proposals before us have any suggestion as to how this problem might be solved? Of course not. Do the member for Bradfield and the others who sanctimoniously of talk about this system as being wonderful have a solution to this crisis? I did not hear it. The member for Bradfield spoke for 20 minutes, and he did not suggest one idea in relation to this matter. Unless you suggest something to deal with this issue, how are you going to be able to say that you have some solutions to the problems of health? I was parliamentary secretary for health in the previous government. During that time, we looked at a whole range of proposals to get the states to meet their responsibilities in relation to public hospitals. Certain actions were taken by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she was minister to try to ensure that the state governments, of whatever colour. met their responsibilities in terms of public hospitals. The reality is that what you got was an attempt by the states to shove costs onto the Commonwealth and a refusal by the state governments to really meet their responsibilities in health. If this situation is going to continue in this country, then a question has to be considered as to whether there ought to be a referendum, or an issue to be considered is whether health should become a responsibility of the federal government alone. We cannot continue to have this buck-passing in relation to health by the state governments. For example, the Kennett government finds millions of dollars to spend on various circuses and shows and various other things that are totally unnecessary, but it 'will not fund the fundamental issue of health and human rights. Mr Fitzgibbon-The people of Gippsland west have spoken.",19
6,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Good on you, the people of Gippsland west. The people of Victoria are furious about this issue. There has to be a solution because we cannot leave it just to whims-Kennett might go out and somebody else might come in. The question really is: what is going to happen to the health system in the long-term, particularly public hospitals? One of the factors that was mentioned by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) when he was trying to restrict access to Medicare numbers was that he had discovered that there was a certain attitude amongst doctors about serving in public hospitals. I must say I am appalled to hear about that attitude. We have so many great public hospitals in this country, but there is this idea that doctors serving in public hospitals are somehow not performing as useful a public service; it is not thought that they are providing an important service to the community. One has got to ask the question: what is the AMA doing about these sorts of attitudes? Why hasn't the AMA promoted the idea that serving in public hospitals and serving the people through public health is an important and noble goal? Have we totally forgotten about the Hippocratic oath? The fundamental thing for a doctor is to be committed to serving the patient-to be committed to the good health of the patient, irrespective of whether that patient is rich or poor, irrespective of whether that patient has to be served in a public hospital or in a private practice. As a beginning in this process, I think we need to get much greater emphasis on the importance of doctors' service in public hospitals. But, as I said, we might also have to think about how we can deal with this constant problem of cost shifting to the Commonwealth by the states. They refuse to understand that, if they have a constitutional right for public hospitals, they have to fund those resources. It does not matter what else they have to forego-such as their circuses, and other perks and nonsense-they have to be able to fund those hospitals in the way that is required. As the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said, if you are going to have a universal system it has got to be truly universal. It should not matter how many people are in the private system, your public system should service them. That does not mean that you should not do something about the private system as well.

7,Mr BARRESI,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The four bills being debated today, which essentially cover private health insurance and the Medicare levy amendment, represent both a solid commitment by this government to its 1996 election promise, as announced in our Healthy Future policy, and a recognition of the importance that we on this side of the House place on the role of the private health sector. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) is a living example of the ideologically driven obsession that the opposition has against the role of the private health sector in the health system of this country. These bills, when passed, will go a long way to restoring the sense of security and well-being which all Australians look forward to when demanding medical treatment. They will also go a long way toward stopping the rot in our health system that was spawned under Labor's ideologically driven disregard for the private health sector-an obsession which led to increasing pressure on our public hospital system., I will provide a quick sketch of two typical cases that I have encountered in my electorate. They are typical-I am sure that most members will have examples similar to these-and I am sure they will illustrate how that rot has set in in the electorate Deakin. In the first case, the director of of the public hospitals covering my electorate tells of aged people forced by rising miums to drop private cover; this at a time their lives when they are four times more likely to need it. These aged people, after undergoing surgery or suffering an acute affliction such as a stroke, are forced to a waiting list for rehabilitation services. While they are waiting they are forced to hospital because they are too weak or incapacitated to look after themselves. The extra stay in hospital results in higher costs for government and immense frustration, of Australia course, for the patients. In the second case, another constituent broke her back four years ago and lost all sensation from the waist down. Even with surgery it was unknown whether she would ever walk again. What was certain was that without the operation she would not improve and would suffer constant pain for months the defonned bones re-fused, yet she required was considered elective surgery. The situation was not life-threatening, but fortunately for this woman she had private health insurance. She elected to have the fivehour operation at the hospital with the surfor geon of her choice. She now swims up to 15 kilometres a week. You would think that in this case my constituent would be a lifelong convert to the need for private health insurance, yet this person, too, has given up private health insurance; given it up because, like many others, the spiralling cost of private health insurance is beyond her nonnal means. She is now taking a punt that her condition will not deteriorate with age. These two constituents are not an exception; they are the rule out there in Australia. They typify the almost seven in 10 Australians who do not have private health cover. More alanningly, they are among the one in three who have let their cover lapse since Medicare was introduced by a Labor government in 1983. But in saying this I am not critical of the Medicare philosophy. Contrary to what the member for Calwell was insinuating, this just government is not about dismantling the of national health system. We are not the United one States. We are not ideologically driven to dismantling Medicare or the public hospital presystem. It is obviously one of those nice in catchcries from the opposition. The member for Calwell talks about us not having ideasthat we are bereft of ideas! They had 13 years to introduce ideas to address the spiralling join decline in private health insurance and the pressure on public hospitals, and we still find stay in ourselves in this situation. The Medicare philosophy is a right one. It the is important and it is a successful system in and we should be proud of it. I will certainly resist any attempts to try to go down the American path. Australians should rightfully feel secure knowing that they can receive medical treatment when they need it, without worrying about whether they can afford it. But Medicare was never designed to stand alone. In announcing details of how the new Medicare scheme would work on 24 May as 1983, the then health minister, Dr Blewett, the operation said quite clearly: We believe that cooperation between the private health funds and government will ensure an improved, cheaper health insurance cover. Medicare was originally seen as a safety net low income earners. It was introduced to a society where 65 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. Ten years later in 1993, the then Labor health minister, Senator Graham Richardson, who has been quoted a number of times in this debate, prophetically stated that Medicare would become financially unviable if the proportion of Australians with private health insurance fell below 40 per cent. We passed that mark many years ago. Today 12 million to 13 million Australians are dependent on the public health system. By last March only 34.6 per cent of Australians-barely one in three-had private health cover. The most recent figures published last week show that by December last year another one per cent of Australians had given up on the private health system. These are indisputable figures in simple to understand terms that even the opposition should recognise and respond to. At this rate of exodus and cost, it is impractical to expect the Australian public to completely fund the public health system either through existing taxes and/or the Medicare levy. The private health sector must have a significant role to play in our health system. Even after the massive exodus of people, the private health system still contributes $4 billion towards the nation's health costs. A 1995 report commissioned in part by the Labor government found that 69 per cent of people who drop out of private health cover do so because of the cost of premiums. Since 1990 the cost of cover has risen on average three and a half times faster than CPI. Between 1990 and 1993, the cost of premiums rose by 72 per cent. Who was in government between those years? It was a Labor government. Let us not be hypocritical in making accusations towards this government and feigning some sort of concern when the health funds come to us asking for premium increases. The Labor Party knows full well that increases by health funds are necessary at times in order for them to maintain their prudential requirements. They know this because under 13 years of Labor every single request by the health funds to increase their premiums was approved. Under Labor we had a 12 per cent per annum average increase in premiums. The rise in premiums under Labor essentially occurred because of changes made by its leaders throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Let us have a look at some of these changes very briefly. First of all there was the abolition the Commonwealth's contribution to the reinsurance pool. The reinsurance pool is a measure that makes community rating work. Secondly, in 1986 Labor removed a private day bed subsidy paid to patients in private hospitals-a subsidy which today would be worth $235 million a year. It has gone. More private health patients are out of pocket and more are leaving the system. Thirdly, in 1987 the Medicare rebate was cut from 85 per cent to 75 per cent, forcing health funds to either cough up the difference or yet again leave people with private cover still further out of pocket. The result is that Australians pay a total of $850 million more in premiums each year and these increases have occurred, as I have mentioned, throughout the Labor government's reign. The incentives for private health insurance that we are debating here today are designed to stop this downward spiral. They are measures the coalition demanded while in opposition and which Labor ideologues stubbornly refused to consider. Figures from the Australian Health Insurance Association (1994) showed that 66 per cent of people without private health insurance would take out cover if incentives were introduced. I believe our incentives will encourage my two constituent cases, and many more like them, to reconsider private health cover. The private health incentives scheme will also recognise and support the 33 per cent of people who still do have private health insurance. Ironically, many of them are the ones who need it most. These are people who are sick, elderly, or have disabilities. Many of them are on income support. At a local level in my electorate of Deakin, the government's private health incentives scheme will potentially benefit more than 20,000 families whose household income is less than $70,000 a year. Approximately half of my electorate will benefit from these private health incentives. It will substantially increase the choice that these people have as to whether or not they take out private health insurance. In recognition of the substantial costs of raising children, we have introduced even more generous income levels at which this of rebate applies than were promised during the federal election. This measure takes the pressure off the public hospital system. It also indirectly provides additional health dollars to the states and territories-dollars that the minister states the federal government will not claw back. At the same time 1,000 families in my electorate who presently earn more than $100,000 a year will be encouraged to take out private health insurance if they do not already have it. At the end of the day this is the surcharge that the government hopes that no-one will have to pay as long as they take out private health cover. There is nothing fairer in terms of a private health system. These changes will take place in the context of wider health reforms that benefit both public and private sectors of our health system. In discussing the matter with local public and private hospital CEOs in my electorate, they have told me that the incentive schemes 'would be a tremendous help for many people.' Furthermore, they have made some suggestions which I am sure I will be able to present to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for his consideration, measures which will add to those suggested by the Productivity Commission when it brings down its report. In fact, I look forward to reading the Commission's final report. I also look forward to a positive and constructive dialogue between the state health ministers and the Commonwealth when they negotiate the next Commonwealth-state health agreement. It is clear that while the private health incentive scheme may not be the only reform that this government introduces to our health system it is a significant one. It is a reform we took to the electorate last March and a commitment we are proud to be able to deliver in full. I look forward to these bills delivering a stronger public and private health system to the people of Deakin and therefore I commend these bills to the House.",22
8,Mr CADMAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Do better than that. Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (10.37 a.m.)I thank the Chief Government Whip for the additional bit of motivation. I hope he will pay me the courtesy of sticking around and hearing what I have got to say. I have been watching the debate on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and cognate bills before the House today with a great deal of interest-and why wouldn't I? Despite the plethora of decisions taken by this government since its budget last year-decisions which adversely impact upon rural and regional Australia-there are few issues in my electorate causing more concern, more fear and more confusion than the issue of private health insurance and the implications of its problems. Why wouldn't people in my electorate be concerned when they pick up their newspaper off the lawn each morning and read headlines such as those in the Newcastle Herald which say 'NIB raises premiums by 17 per cent' and 'Members are sick over NIB's increased premiums'? Why wouldn't they be further concerned and confused when they see advertisements in the Newcastle Herald placed by private individuals expressing concern about the way in which our private health system operates? I refer to an ad placed in the Newcastle Herald by my constituent Mr Bill Vercoe. Mr Vercoe had a motor vehicle accident in 1994. He was not the driver at fault. You can understand that he felt comfortable in the knowledge that behind him he had the third party cover of both himself and the driver at fault and, in addition to that, he had top private health cover with NIB health funds. But, alas, CIC, the third party insurer, decided to challenge the validity of the connection between Mr Vercoe's injuries, or at least the extent of them, and the 1994 accident, and there has been a protracted legal wrangle ever since. NIB have a policy that says that they do not make a payment to an insured while ever he or she has pending a right of claim. So Mr Vercoe, despite having top cover and despite having felt comfortable in that knowledge for many years, has found himself with spiralling private hospital bills since 1994 and no avenue to tum to in terms of insurance. It is the case that most of our private health insurers voluntarily offer a provisional payment in the same way that Medicare offers a provisional payment in compensation cases, but NIB and others do not. I have made my own submission to the Productivity Commission, notwithstanding the fact that it may be outside its terms of reference, suggesting that it recommend to the government that it should legislate to make compulsory the idea of private health insurers providing a provisional payment in the case of compensation claims until that claim has been settled. I have also put a question on notice and asked the minister to consider doing the same. It seems a common sense approach to me and I do not see any other negatives attached to that proposal. As I said, I have watched this debate with intense interest, and I listened particularly to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). I have a great deal of respect for the member for Bradfield, particularly on this issue. As he is a doctor and a former president of the Australian Medical Association, I think it is fair to say that the member for Bradfield should have and would have a very good grasp of this issue before the House today. He shared with the House many of his personal experiences and many of them are heart-rending. Many of them did highlight the deficiencies in our health system in this country. It is often said that, while our health system is a bit of a mess, it is also the best in the world, and I think that is pretty true. No health system will ever be perfect and, at around eight per cent of GOP, I think it is fair to say that our health system is one of the most cost efficient in the world. But it is true that we must address this rapid decline in the participation rate in the area of private health insurance. I think it is incumbent on us collectively to put politics aside and to do that together. But what the member for Bradfield and, indeed, what the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi), and all those on the other side who spoke before them, did not recognise is that the bills before the House today will do absolutely nothing to address the problems in the system. Rather, the bills before the parliament today are simply a manifestation of an electoral strategy, a plan put in place in 1996 to ensure that the mistakes of 1993 and the electoral consequences of them were not repeated. Because of the overwhelming support of Medicare among Australians, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was forced to attempt at least to convince Australians that he is now a supporter of it, despite the plethora of public examples of his long standing opposition to the scheme. He was determined before the election to convince the electorate that he recognised Medicare's legitimate role, that he understood the importance of its universality and that he understood the importance of a health system underpinned by a strong public scheme. But he went further than that. He promised to address the rapid decline in private health insurance membership at no expense to the public system. Of his private health insurance initiatives, in his 1996 election policy he said: The incentives will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States. But within months all of the Prime Minister's promises have gone out the window. I have brought in with me Budget Paper No.1. Not too many Australians get to see Budget Paper No.1. If they did, they would probably find its reading a little challenging. But it really can be very simple. It is certainly very simple to read pages 3-94, 3-95 and 396, which are all about the effect of function measures on outlays. A quick glance demonstrates the massive slashing of funding in the area of health in this country: the across the board reduction of two per cent in running costs, $46 million; the limited Medicare access for new doctors, $570 million; the cessation of the Commonwealth dental program, $399 million-these are over four years, of course-the pathology reform savings package, $345 million; the diagnostic imaging reform savings package, $240 million; the withholding of the 1 November 1996 Medicare fee increases, $238 million; the increase in the Medicare maximum patient payment, $57 million; the reductions in hospital funding grants to the states, $312 million; and the increases in the copayments for pharmaceuticals, $503 million. The list goes on and on. I have just highlighted some of the bigger ticket items. With respect to the surcharge-the idea of imposing an additional one per cent Medicare levy on those earning either $50,000 or $100,000, depending on their circumstanceswe see the breaking of an absolute core promise. That is the promise that no new taxes will be introduced. There is no other way of looking at the Medicare surcharge. It is simply the raising of an additional tax. That is why the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has sought to split these cognate bills-so that the betrayal can be highlighted by way of an amendment to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill. I think it is an appropriate time-it has not been done today since the adjournment last night-to remind the House of the amendment. The amendment states: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (l) deplores the Federal Government cuts to public hospitals, pharmaceuticals and public dental services which have been made to fund these incentives in direct breach of an election promise; (2) is dismayed by the inefficiency of the measures which will do little to ease the funding pressure on public hospitals; and (3) is firmly of the opinion that the $1.7 billionthat is, the cost of providing the incentiveswould be better spent in providing extra Federal Government funding for public hospitals and direct subsidies for private hospital accommodation"". As I said, the Medicare surcharge is a direct breach of a core promise-that is, not to raise any new taxes. Let us look at the government's plans to fix the ills of our health system. They are going to take $1.7 billion, as I said, of taxpayers' money. So it is a case of taking out of one hand; there is no other way of looking at it. They are going to take $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money which, as the member for Dobell has said, could be spent on reducing waiting lists in public hospitals. They are going to use that to subsidise the private health insurance industry. There are no tricks in that. That is quite obvious and quite clear. We have already seen the result of that. People in my electorate have been wearing an additional increase on their private health insurance premiums, as I indicated by giving those examples of articles from the Newcastle Herald, since this great incentive was announced. Yet no relief under the bills before us today will be available to them until July this year. For almost a year now my constituents have been paying up to $200 more per month, if they are part of a family, to be covered under their private health insurance scheme. If these bills do pass the House, they will get some relief after July this year. I think they will be a long time catching up. The second main proposal is to introduce a surcharge on those earning more than X dollars per year. What can we say about that? It will raise about $60 million a year. We have heard the member for Deakin say, 'We hope it is less than that.' That will do wonders for the public health system. It will reduce a lot of hospital waiting queues. I can just see it: $60 million. The figures show that around lOO,OOO individuals and 110,000 families will be affected. Obviously, as the member for Deakin quite rightly pointed out again, no-one is going to cop the surcharge. In any case, those who are likely to be affected by the surcharge are already participants in private health insurance. The wonderful initiative will do nil to address the ills of our system and will do nil about driving people into private health insurance. But what it will do is introduce for the first time a two-tiered system in our Medicare system, something we should all be resisting. It is something, I know, that others on the other side will say that we ourselves contemplated as a party at one point-but it is also something that we rejected; and it is something I believe the parliament should reject today. A reading of the Productivity Commission's draft report into the private health insurance industry indicates that the commission is at best ambivalent about the initiatives contained in these cognate bills. The former Labor government also went to the 1996 election with some incentive schemes to encourage people to go into private health insurance, but we did so in such a way as to strengthen the public system. We encouraged people to stay there if that is what they chose to do. They were able to stay there and still attract those incentives. We were going to allow them to stay in the public system but stIll enable them to access some of those additional benefits people enjoy in private health insurance schemes. I say to the government that where the largest contrast lies between what we were offering and what you are offering today is that our policy strengthens the public system and yours undermines it. That is the very big difference. That is why we as an opposition are expressing concern about these bills before the House today. I suggest that if the government is really serious about doing something about the ills of our health system, it should expand the Productivity Commission's terms of reference and have a look at the whole system. Looking at private health insurance in isolation really is a waste of time. You really need to look at the system as a whole. But I suspect that the government were not too interested in having the Productivity Commission put its tentacles into Medicare because they would know the result. I know they know that the Productivity Commission would give Medicare its overwhelming stamp of approval. But we could not have that because, despite the Prime Minister's protestations-and he is on the public record enough-we all know that he does not like Medicare. It is some sort of socialist plot to the Prime Minister and his supporters. They do not like the way Australians love it, because they have always opposed it. They hate its universality; they basically hate the fact that it works. Rather than get up and say so, they misled the Australian public and then came in the back door by introducing for the first time a two-tiered system, which is the thin end of the wedge and which could very well spell the beginning of the end of Medicare. That is their plan; that is their ideology; and that is what these bills are all about. I commend the amendment moved by the m_ember for Dobell to the House.",25
9,Ms WORTH,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I hope the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), sticks around to hear a few of the facts instead of his wild imagination which we have just had to listen to. The future of Au-(ralia's health system depends upon an effective public sector and a revitalised private sector. The mess left behind from years of neglect under Labor has placed the responsibility of rescuing Medicare from collapse firmly with the new coalition government. Simultaneously, there is an interdependent need to encourage Australians, especially young families and the middle aged, back into private health cover. The Labor government ignored the significance of the private health sector and remained unresponsive to the desire of Australians for a choice in health care services. Ironically, this approach jeopardises the viability of the system as a whole-and Labor got it wrong. In 1983, 65.1 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. After 13 years of Labor, this figure had dropped to 33.6 per cent. The human costs associated with this departure from the private sector has resulted in extended waiting lists and declining levels of service in the public sector to the point where Australians were subjected to the absolute tragedy last August in Victoria where 124 patients waited on trolleys at St Vincent's Hospital for more than 12 hours in emergency-such is the pressure on our public health system while beds in the private sector remain vacant. In my own state of South Australia, the figures are amazing. The failure of Labor to maintain a competitive and viable private health sector meant that by September 1996 only 502,000 South Australians had private health insurance-this was less than half the number of policyholders in 1982, which totalled over 1,030,000. With the growth in long-term and youth unemployment figures, these figures are the most damning evidence of Labor's incompetence and neglect. The legislation before the House today, however, is one measure in keeping with the coalition's election promise to address the structural crisis in the health system inherited from Labor. The Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill acknowledges the role private health services have to play in getting the balance right to ensure a high standard of health care for all Australians. The bill provides incentives for people to purchase private health insurance and, therefore, lift the weight of demand on public health services. Between 1984-85 and 1994-95 the contribution of the private sector to total health expenditure had increased from 8.8 per cent to 10.9 per cent. Medicare remains the centrepiece of Australia's health system but its effectiveness is directly dependent on a strong private sector. For the Labor Party to market themselves as the great champions of a national public health system and then remove the private hospital bed subsidy and Commonwealth contribution to the private health insurance fund reinsurance pool shows just how confused they are over what a viable Medicare system requires to remain successful. The shift in demand to the public sector during the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting from Labor policy, threatened the entire health system and resulted directly from inaction over the decline in numbers of those with private health insurance. The turnaround will cost $491 million next financial year and $609 million in 1998-99. In the current climate of fiscal restraint to haul in Beazley's black hole, this expenditure is testament to how seriously the government takes the rescue of Australia's health system. The coalition government, in stark contrast to Labor, is prepared to take the tough decisions to reverse this trend. The private health incentives scheme and the complementary initiatives, such as the Medicare levy for high income earners, will halt the slide away from private health insurance. These reforms may take time to reverse trends, but at least they mark the end to Labor's do nothing approach. Apart from the pure economics of the government's reforms, I also believe it will take time for Australians to again recognise the value of the partnership of viable private and public health sectors. This is not solely dependent on the government. This legislation also provides the private health sector an opportunity to regain lost markets and improve consumer relations and management practices. The spiralling cost of health insurance premiums remains, however, the major hurdle for most Australians entering or returning to private health insurance. As reported in the Bulletin last September, 44 per cent of Australians believe private health care is too expensive. It is not hard to see why. Almost 850,000 people over 65 have private health insurance. Most are on a fixed income. Over half a million of these people with incomes below $20,000 per annum have had to cope with spiralling premiums. Those people wanting to receive the premium reduction may obtain information from their participating health scheme. Alternatively, if people choose to recei ve the tax rebate they can pass on the details of their membership in private health schemes when they complete their records for the Taxation Office. The ATO will then adjust the applicant'S final refund or liability. From the beginning of July this year singles earning under $35,000 a year will be entitled to up to $125 each year to help pay premiums. Couples earning up to $70,000 may receive up to $250. Couples earning less than $70,000 with a child will receive up to $450 per annum. Consistent with the government's efforts to assist families, this income threshold will increase by $3,000 for each additional child. VVhat constitutes a couple or a family unit for private health insurance purposes will be left up to individual health funds, and that will be the basis of registering the couple or family for the incentive scheme. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has estimated that these measures have the potential to affect five million Australians, and the previous speaker should have listened to that. The incentive payments will cover two components of health insurance: hospital insurance; and ancillary cover, including optical, physiotherapy and other non-hospital items. Firstly, these measures will encourage those already in private health schemes to remain there. I believe that this may provide a much needed breathing space for the sector to induce stability and long-term planning. Secondly, they will encourage many Australians who have not formerly thought about taking out private health insurance to do 5 0 many for the first time. Some of these Australians will be high income earners. It has been estimated that 50,000 families on incomes in excess of $100,000 do not have private health insurance. The Medicare levy surcharge will be an additional contribution of one per cent of the taxable income of high income earners. It will apply to singles earning over $50,000 per annum and couples or families earning over $100,000. This levy will be over and above the 1.5 per cent Medicare levy already paid by eligible Australians. It will apply only to high income earners who choose not to take out private health insurance. This legislation will be the second dimenoffice. sion of the government's attempts to rebuild membership of private health funds. Those affected will be able to avoid the surcharge taking out at least hospital cover with private health fund. This is a tax, however, that the government would prefer has to pay. Most health funds offer basic hospital cover at a rate less than the amount the person would otherwise have to pay as a surcharge liability. The government is expecting about 70,000 high income earning single people and 65,000 couples and families to join health funds as result of this measure. It is estimated that measure alone will increase the participation rate in private health insurance by 1.5 percessation centage points. This should be considered positive development as the costs of advances in technology and the pressures of an expandhospital ing ageing population increase. As the million. minister has stated: Our strategy will work on two fronts. Lower and middle income earners will be able to claim incentive payment if they have private health insurance, and the higher income earners will an increased Medicare Levy surcharge if they not choose to take out private health insurance. The legislation before the House today affirms this government's commitment not to simply remain idle while Australia's health system destroyed. The government is dedicated to a strong national public health system and complementary and effective private health sector. If the truth be known, the coalition have far better credentials as the managers Australia's public health system not despite, our ability to see the interdependence of both sectors. Mr Tanner-That is not what Peter Shack said in 1990.",28
10,Ms WORTH,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"All members would remember the nonsense being circulated by Labor at the last election that the coalition would destroy Medicare if they were elected to government. Today, almost a year after coming to office, this government has begun introducing a series of measures aimed solely at rescuing Medicare. I cannot, indeed would not want to, imagine what the future of Medicare would have been had Labor won The former Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), asserted that Medicare could by survive without a private health system. This a is clearly not the case and indicates the inability of the former government to grasp that no-one the fundamentals. Since Medicare was first introduced, Labor's withdrawal of subsidies to the private health sector has been responsible for the bulk of premium rises. It has been estimated by the Productivity Commission's private health insurance inquiry that Labor's attack on a private health is responsible for around 30 per this cent of the current levels of insurance premiums. The AMA has also estimated that the of the contribution to the reinsura ance pool has had a $220 million effect on cost shifting and the cessation of private bed day subsidy a further $235 The immediate effect of premium increases has been the spectacular drop-out for persons an under 65. The subsidisation of the reinsurance pool in particular reduced the cross-subsidy face required from low claiming members. The do over-65 age group now represents 13.6 per cent of the total insured market. These changing demographics of those holding private health insurance are the worse possible result is if the intention is to keep premiums low. Statistics on Medicare usage show that a females aged over 75 years are five times more likely to use medical services than girls between the ages of 10 to 14. In the AMA' s of submission to the Productivity Commission it because of, was noted that: Elderly people not only have relatively more health problems requiring hospitalisation, they also need longer time to recover from major procedures and require greater length to stay. As a consequence, the age variation in the use of hospital service is far greater than for medical services. Our younger population between 21 and 35 need to be given far more encouragement to take out private health insurance, especially those who can best afford to do so. This can happen only with a coordinated approach by government and the industry being more effective in its marketing and in providing a service that is deemed reasonable. There has been more recent nonsense from the opposition benches to the effect that recent increases in private health insurance premiums have eroded any benefit which this legislation would provide to low and middle income earners taking out private health insurance. I remind members opposite that, under Labor, premiums rose by an average of 12 per cent and that between 1986 and 1988 premiums rose by a massive 40 per cent. The out. resulting reduction in private health membership by a further two percentage points politically increased demand on the public sector over 320,000 bed days. Labor have this record, yet they can still come into this chamber and berate us for trying to revive the private sector. Unfortunately, increases in premium levels will remain a fact of life until the exodus those with private health insurance is stopped. It is interesting to note that in the last quarter the private health insurance industry House. made a loss of $40 million. The opposition health spokesman, the member for Dobell Lee), stated in August last year: Everyone in Australia knows that if you're providing a tax concession for people with private health insurance, that helps the private hospitals people in private medicine. What I'm concemed about is the waiting lists and the delays that taking place in our hospitals. This statement shows his total lack of undercontribution standing of the situation. Graham Richardson had a better understanding, because he has already told us: Convincing the Labor Party that the rapid decline in the number of Australians who take out private health insurance is any sort of problem is difficult task . . . Labor health ministers are not allowed to believe that the decline in private health insurance is anything other than a vote of confidence in Medicare. The previous speaker should have listened to this. Returning to Graham Richardson, he said: They are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find itself unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which one day will create one hell of a problem. How right he has proved to be. The cynicism in Labor criticising these measures is also hard to understand. At the last election Labor offered a family health rebate of up to $500 the to families on an income up to $63,700, including a component of $350 to assist with private health insurance premiums. In principle, is there a huge difference between this position and the government's legislation? I do not believe so, except that under Labor's policy the elderly, single people, the chronically ill and couples without children missed Labor's opposition to these measures is hypocritical, ignorant of industry by needs and completely unresponsive to the crisis in Australia's health system-a crisis which was created by them and a crisis which this government is setting about fixing up. I commend the minister for his dogged determination to push a broad range of reforms and of in taking these tough decisions. I am aware that my colleague is ready to speak, so I will June finish there and commend the bill to the",30
11,Mr WILTON,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I (Mr would like to commence my comments today on this private health insurance legislation by reminding the House that if there has been one specific area of policy in which the and Liberal and National parties have in modem times failed to deal with adequately then it is are the area of health policy. As the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) interjected during the of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), in 1990 the then Liberal Party spokesperson on health matters, Peter Shack, one of the rather infamous predecessors of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), summed up quite succinctly in a very what was proved to be one of the most famous press conferences in Australian political history when, prefacing the launch of the coalition's health policy for the election of that year, he said: Now, I want to say to you, with all the frankness that I can muster, the Liberal and National parties do not have a particularly good track record in health and you don't need me to remind you of our last period in government. That is a quote which I am sure sends shivers up the spines of all those opposite. Despite having had a subsequent six years to formulate a workable and an effective policy, and the experience of two further electoral defeats, the members of the Liberal and National parties in government in 1997 appear to have little more idea than their colleagues in the dark, old days of their long stint in opposition during the 1980s and 1990s. If there was one simple theme which ran through many of these years of wandering aimlessly through the policy wilderness it the coalition's unerring faith that the answer to all our health care problems lay in private health insurance-a simple, easy solution that required the government encouraging people to take up private health insurance through the use of subsidies. The government has shown that it intends to pursue this process a part of a two-pronged approach to shrouded Australia's health system. The first prong the introduction of the public health insurance incentives and changes to the Medicare contained in these bills. The second prong is indeed far more sinister and involves the dismantling by stealth of the Medicare systhis tem, perhaps one of the best systems in the world. The government announced its plans last year in the budget to introduce subsidies which will give a tax break, as the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has said, of some $1. 7 billion to the private health insurance industry. The Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge; went to great lengths to assure the House and the Australian public that the full benefit of this $1.7 billion would be channelled back into the pockets of ance. contributors and that, indeed, we could be assured from that comment that his intent not to pay that money in some unscrupulous way back to the health funds. Of course we were then treated to the spectacle of the minister being made to look like something of a fool by the very industry that he so generously rewarded when in the following days after the budget announcement the private health funds announced major price increases in their premiums to the extent that in some cases the rebate would be totally absorbed by the price hikes some 10 months before the contributors would be in receipt of their rebate relief. If it were not for the hardship that many people had to endure to meet the new premiums, even with the benefits of these new rebates, the quick succession in which the major funds upped their premiums appears to be a rather satirical reflection on the way that this insurance industry works. In August of last year, HBA in Victoria and Australian Unity increased their premiums by six and 8.6 per cent respectively. This was followed was shortly afterwards by a whopping 17.5 per cent increase in Manchester Unity's premiums. These increases make the sorts of increases acceded to by the ALP in its term of government pale into insignificance. In October, HBA increased its premiums in a range of states by nine per cent and, in as November, timed of course very nicely to be by the glory of Bill Clinton's visit, is Medibank Private and MBF announced increases of 12.9 per cent and 15 per cent levy respectively in their charges. It has become glaringly obvious, even to point, that the $1.7 billion which was to be allocated as a rebate to the health system by the government in its last budget announcements has not fulfilled that objective. Providing that $1.75 billion as some sort of tax break has in practice turned out to be nothing more than a very expensive taxpayer subsidised handout for the private health insurance industry-{)ne which has little or no financial gain for those who need it most, they being the low income Australians the government expect to take up health insurMr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to think just was how much more efficiently $1.75 billion could have been used and spent on ensuring that all Australians have equitable access to quality health services. It could have been spent, as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has so lucidly pointed out, on measures to reduce waiting lists and to improve the quality of health care in both public and private hospitals in the Australian system. Having pinned such faith in its policy of encouraging people to take up private health insurance through tax incentives, the minister had set a target of getting 40 per cent of Australians to take up private health insurance. It seems that this figure was at least more than a little too ambitious. Now the government will settle quite happily for the current private health insurance take-up arrangements to remain stable. Then again, if you look at last week's figures showing another fall in private health insurance from 33.5 per cent to 32 per cent, and if those figures are any guide, the government's new private health insurance arrangements and initiatives do not appear likely to achieve even the government's most modest take-up objectives and expectations in this area. The members of private health insurance funds who have dropped out of those funds in the last few months are doing so despite having received letters spelling out the government's new tax rebate initiative. Clearly, this is an early vote of no .confidence in the government's health policies by the Australian electorate. Indeed, even the Department of Health and Family Services has estimated that, at best, the measures contained in these bills will only add a 1V2 per cent increase to the level of coverage of private health insurance, which will only increase from 32 per cent expected in July 1997 to 34 per cent before stabilising. The government asked the Industry Commission to investigate and examine the matter of private health insurance and its report was subsequently quite expectedly critical of the tax rebate scheme. The Industry Commission in its report predicted: The net budgetary cost of the incentives is likely to be quite large. This is because most of the people who will receive the incentives are already insured and the commission estimates that those people who do take up private health insurance as a result of these incentives are likely to be the lower users of the public health system anyway. It then went on to explain that the government will spend $560 million a year on these incentives, leading to savings of around $240 million. This means the government will be wasting $320 million, money which is desperately needed in our own health system. To recap, the coalition quite clearly in its election policy before the last election stated: The incentives will not be funded from the public health system or health grants to the states. Other than the $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio. This has been added to a litany of government broken promises. The budget last year cut grants to the states by some $1.5 billion over three years, effectively meaning a cut of around $500 million to the states' health funding. There were also direct funding cuts to public hospitals of more than $300 million over four years. When these cuts to hospital funding are added to the $500 million taken from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the $400 million saved by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program, we see that the incentives are almost entirely funded by cuts to health services, completely opposite to the government's election promise. As the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell, has ably pointed out, the $800 million taken out of hospital funding could quite easily have financed 1,000 beds in public hospitals or some 66,000 operations, which no doubt were badly needed. I am sure that the Australian people had expected, with the appointment of a doctor to the health portfolio, that this government would take a more responsible, more understanding and more compassionate approach to the issue of health funding than have their state colleagues. My own state of Victoria springs to mind. As has been pointed out by the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in his contribution, in Victoria they put budgetary bottom lines ahead of providing decent health services. How disappointed voters in that state must be now. This is why the opposition has moved an amendment to ensure that any extra revenue raised by the increase in the Medicare levy for those on higher incomes who do not have health insurance is used to increase federal government spending on public hospitals. The opposition recognises the crucial role that private health plays in our system, contrary to the exhortations of the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) yesterday. Hence, we accept the substance of these bills. However, a balance must be kept because many Australians, particularly those who for financial reasons have little choice in the matter, will continue to rely on the public health system for their basic underlying health needs. Hence, this government-in fact, any government-has a responsibility to ensure that the public health system receives the necessary funding to fulfil this most fundamental of roles. The ALP has always accepted this responsibility, and the amendment moved by the shadow minister for health clearly demonstrates that this is one principle which we will never depart from. The other major initiative contained in bills is the imposition of a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge on individuals who have taxable incomes above $50,000 per annum and on families with a combined income of $100,000 per year who do not have private health insurance. This measure will increase the Medicare levy to 2.5 per cent of their taxable income. The effect of this measure will be that a single person with a taxable income of $50,000 per annum will pay an extra $500 through the Medicare levy, while a family on an income of $100,000 or more will be hit for an extra $1,000 per year if it does not take out private health insurance. Unlike the incentive measure, the government made no mention of the Medicare levy surcharge in its 1996 election policy. It did, however, make much of its promise not to increase taxes. This is something else we can add to its litany of broken promises. The government has also neglected to index the income levels at which the penalty takes effect. By way of bracket creep, more people will be affected each year as their income rises. It is doubtful that this measure will either force many people to take out private health insurance or raise much in the way of revenue for the government, as people with higher incomes have a much greater level of participation in private health insurance than do people on lower and middle incomes. Hence, the measure will affect a relatively small number of people. For instance, only some 16.3 per cent of families with incomes over $70,000 per annum are uninsured compared with 53 per cent of families within the income bracket $20,000 to $29,000 per annum. As I said earlier, the first prong of the government's health policy is the introduction of these private health insurance incentives and changes to the Medicare levy contained in the bills before the House today. The second prong is, as I have already said, far more sinister and involves the surreptitious dismantling of the Medicare system. In 1990 the coalition-or at least its hapless shadow minister for health, Mr Shackpromised to leave Medicare intact because these they were honest enough to admit that they could come up with no workable alternative. In 1996 the coalition promised to leave Medicare intact because they knew that that was what the voters wanted to hear. Immediately upon being elected to government in 1996, they began the long process of breaking this promise by slowly dismantling, brick by brick, our most cherished Medicare system. The government is taking a carrot and stick approach to health policy, the carrot being the tax rebates, the stick being not only the increased Medicare levy as a penalty to high income earners who do not subscribe to private health insurance but more importantly the cutting away at the edges of Medicare. Indeed, last year's budget saw a 66 per cent increase in the maximum in-patient payment for rebates, up to $50; arbitrary limits placed on psychiatric benefits; cuts in IVF funding; and the failure to index GP's fees for inflation, resulting in many doctors abandoning bulkbilling. Brick by brick, we see the dismantling of the Medicare system by stealth. Goodness only knows what we can expect in next year's budget. In conclusion, I reiterate my earlier remarks that the opposition supports a significant level of private involvement in the delivery of health and health insurance services-again, contrary to the protestations of the member for MCPherson in his contribution yesterday. But this can never be at the expense of the public system on which so many Australians will continue to rely despite these bills. I commend the bills, as amended, to the House.",31
12,Mr MCARTHUR,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The fundamental conundrum facing policy makers in the health portfolio can be best put as follows: at a time and even in circumstances when Australians are healthier than ever, living longer and with medical practitioners who can cure and treat more diseases with greater effectiveness than ever before, 43 per cent of Australians believe that health services in Australia are getting worse, not better, and 58 per cent of Australians believe the public health system to be in a state of crisis. These are some of the sobering results of the MorganlMBF Healthwatch survey published in March 1996, when the Howard government took power. They indicate the size of the task which confronts the government in providing a basis for a workable and affordable health care system for the 21st century. They clearly show that, in an era when medical expertise is steadily improving, public confidence in the public health system is steadily eroding. The perceived problems of the health care system identified by the Healthwatch survey are such as waiting lists, inadequate staff numbers, hospital closures and lack of funding. These are all symptoms of an industry whose resources are seen to be strained to the limit. These perceived problems in Australia's public health system are all symptomatic of a sector which is far too reliant on the public system, with insufficient involvement by private health insurance. As Mr Ross MCLeod recently put it in the summer edition of the ANU publication Agenda: . . . although the charming fiction of near-free access to health care for everybody has been sold to voters in numerous election campaigns, time shown that we are not prepared to be taxed heavily enough to make this possible. The task of governments in reality has been to find an electorally acceptable balance between taxing us to pay for Medicare, and winding back the quality of health treatment available to Medicare users. In 1983, some 66 per cent of the Australian population held private health insurance as their primary means of financing their health care needs. Today, that figure is down to around 30 per cent-a remarkable drop indeed. Today's Herald-Sun, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, reports that 300 people a day are dropping out of private health cover. The decline in the number of Australians financing their own health care through private insurance has meant that the public health system cannot absorb the demands on its resources without showing clear signs of strain. Every media current affairs show and every state opposition across Australia can seemingly produce endless horror stories of patients dying while on waiting lists, a patient discharged too early, an ambulance taking too long to respond to a call for help or a small country hospital forced to close its doors as a result of government cutbacks. The political system has engineered the popular myth that our health sector is in decay when in fact the standards of health services enjoyed by Australians today are extremely high by historic and international standards. Our reliance, however, on the public health system is due in large measure to the easy availability of the publicly funded Medicare system. We have bulk-billing GPs on every metropolitan block. Today's front page of the Herald-Sun also reports that the number of visits to GPs has almost doubled since the introduction of Medicare-something that I have brought to the attention of this House on many occasions. Pharmaceutical subsidies provide easy access to expensive medicines. There is free hospital admission. Also, hightech radiology and pathology services arc being provided virtually free of charge. The increasing life span of the population has also played a role in the raising of health care costs. Improved technology and increashas ing expectations by the community about what constitutes an adequate standard of care, particularly in the latter stages of the lives of individual Australians, are also factors which will see Australia's health care expenditure rising as a proportion of GDP. The easy attractiveness of the public system and the effects of demographic change have been compounded by decisions of the previous government, which starved the private system of funds. In particular, I refer to the Commonwealth's withdrawal from the reinsurance pool, the reduction of the inhospital Medicare rebate from 85 to 75 per cent and the abolition of the bed day subsidy. Against this backdrop, a key priority of the Howard government has been to stem the flow of people away from private health insurance through direct financial incentives. The Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and other associated bills at present before House are the legislative enactment of the coalition's stated policy intention to attract individuals back to private health funds. The strategy is two-pronged: low and middle income earners will be granted a tax rebate for taking out private health insurance and the very high income earners will incur a tax penalty through an increase in the Medicare levy, if they choose not to take up private health cover-a very desirable incentive and, I think, a very well thought through policy which has been debated for many years. The tax rebates will be available to individuals earning less than $35,000 per year and to families earning less than $70,000 a year, although these income thresholds increase by $3,000 for each dependent child. There is also the option of taking the incentive in the form of a payment made directly from the government to a health fund in return for guaranteed lower premiums. For a single person taking out hospital cover with ancillaries, the incentive is worth $125 per year; for a couple that figure rises to $250; and for a family the incentive is worth $450. The initiative will cost the government an estimated $1.7 billion over a four-year period in return for an estimated increase in private coverage of anywhere between two and five percentage points. Meanwhile, the tax penalty for high income earners applies to individuals with income over $50,000 or families with income over $100,000-again, a very worthwhile incentive. This initiative completes the carrot and stick approach to the private health incentive package, both encouraging and providing incentives for individuals to join private health insurance programs. These high income earners will pay an additional one per cent on the Medicare levy if they choose not to be privately insured. According to estimates by the Department of Health and Family Services, approximately 110,000 singles and 100,000 couples will be affected by the measure, and around 67 per cent of this group will join the private health system as a consequence of these recommendations before the parliament. The remaining the 33 per cent will pay the increased Medicare levy, netting $60 million to federal government revenue. The savings to the government from a small rise in private insurance are only modest and the revenue from the Medicare levy surcharge will also be minor. It is clear that the incentives package will have an overall negative impact on the budget bottom line. So, in effect, it arguably costs more to attract patients out of the public system than it costs 10 treat them there. Nevertheless, there are very important justifications for private health insurance rebates. Firstly, attracting patients to the private system does have the net effect of improving the overall freedom of choice, which is a very important aspect of the coalition's philosophy, given that the private system offers choice of both doctor and hospital. Secondly, the privately insured already pay health care three ways, which many Australians do not fully understand. They pay through the Medicare levy (sometimes they understand the actual cash figure and sometimes they do not); they pay through the general taxation system-and the shadow minister at the table, the member for Fremantie (Dr Lawrence), would have no idea exactly how much is involved in that particular figure; most Australians and most members of this House do not fully understand the total figure that is taken out of taxation revenue to pay for the health system-and they pay through their own health insurance premium, of which they have a very clear and exact idea because they pay the cheque. In effect, they pay for the insurance of others who are not medically insured as well as for themselves. The imperative of fairness demands that they be provided with some relief in recognition of this fact. In addition, moving to the private system creates a greater individual awareness of the true cost of medical services. That is a point that I have argued both here and in other forums. Individual Australians will greatly appreciate what the cost of their health is and they take some responsibility for their own health because they make some payments which they are aware of. Free access to the public health system completely masks the true cost of hospital stays and medical procedures. Moreover, very few people can tell you how much they pay in income tax or the Medicare levy, which I have just mentioned. By contrast, most can tell you the size of their insurance premiums, their doctors bills and their hospital bills in the private sector. By moving away from the public system, we create a greater awareness of, and transparency in, the true cost of health care in Australia. The predicted overall benefits to the health system of these incentives are modest, but we do find a competitive and alternative system. They have certainly never been put forward as the sole solution to Australia's health care woes. There are already calls from a number of quarters for more far-reaching reform to both the private and the public health sectors to address the fundamental underlying problems facing both the government and the health insurance industry. One aspect of the system being sUbjected to increasing scrutiny is the principle of community rating, whereby all members of the health fund pay an identical premium based on the average risk profile of the fund's membership. The alternative-actuarial rating-would involve a system where individual premiums reflect the actual risk of individual members. As members would be aware, car insurance is a good example of this approach to insurance. Under community rating, the low risk contributors subsidise the high risk contributors. Unfortunately, the net result of community rating has been to discourage the young and fit from belonging to private funds. The membership of private funds has become older, less healthy and more likely to require medical help. Premiums have inevitably risen. In 1989-90, people over 65 accounted for 10 per cent of health fund membership. Today, that figure has risen to 14 per cent. No doubt in future years that will rise to a higher figure because of the rising demographic age of the older people in Australia. The recent Productivity Commission report into the private health insurance industry recommended some provisions for funds to offer incentives to the young and fit to join the funds. That debate has been around over the last 10 years about providing some mechanism to get the younger, fitter members of the community into the funds. Such provisions could include lower premiums for loyal members-referred to as 'lifetime community rating'-a no-claims bonus, longer waiting periods for pre-existing ailments and penalties for the hit and run fund members, such as those who join a fund just before getting pregnant. Those initiatives would not be controversial. Most Australians would agree with the fairness implicit in them. A recent Agenda article by Mr Ross MCLeod of the ANU put forward an innovative model for a health care system based on a move away from community rating towards a system of actuarial rating along with subsidies to the elderly, the chronically ill and the low paid for their insurance. Those subsidies would be higher for the higher risk groups and the chronically ill as well as being linked to income so the low paid would get more assistance than the well-off. There would be freedom for the funds to offer tailored packages and every incentive for the young and fit to join a fund. I notice that there are comments in today's press about funds being able to attract those people who have a desirable lifestyle in that they do not smoke and keep reasonably fit. Again there should be some incentive for people to join the funds if they adopt that particular lifestyle. The distinction between public and private hospitals would disappear. Both sectors would simply compete with one another to attract patients. Mr MCLeod says that this proposed model is an example of the sort of legitimate community debate over possible future models for our health system, which could inject greater competition and more efficient allocation of resources. The private health insurance incentives before the House are important. However, they will not solve overnight the underlying problems faced by the private health insurance industry or by Australia's health system as a whole. It will require more debate, more discussion and possibly some far-reaching reforms. We need not have declining confidence in the health system at a time when medical standards are steadily improving. There is absolutely no reason for Australia to have anything less than a high quality, affordable and highly regarded system of health for the 21st century.",35
13,Dr LAWRENCE,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"As a former minister, I am very keen to speak on these health bills, not least because during the election campaign, when the then opposition announced this policy, I had the prescience to very clearly indicate what would be the weaknesses of this proposal. They are weaknesses that have not been amended in any way by the legislation that we now see before us. At the time, in February 1996, I indicated that these tax rebates in particular would be a hoax-a very cruel hoax, indeed. I intend to outline in some detail why that is so. In the long-term, if people were to take up private health insurance as a result of these so-called incentives, they would be worse off. The coalition also clearly misunderstand the contract that was entered into with the Australian people when Medicare was introduced. Medicare was designed to be a universal system that everybody would share in, regardless of their wealth. It was deliberately designed for that purpose. It was deliberately designed to reduce the number of people with private health insurance-many of whom could not afford that private health insurance, many of whom had no cover because of the system that existed at the time. The idea was that through progressive taxation, where the rich pay more, and through the Medicare levy, where the rich pay more, there would be a system that all Australians could share in. Indeed, the wealthy in the community would contribute more of their income to ensure that the less well-off would have a quality system. These so-called incentives-as applied to all of those people who currently have private health insurance-do not purchase, as I said in February 1996, a single extra operation or a single extra bed. You are applying $1.7 billion of taxpayers' funds to all of those people who currently have private health insurance-in most states, about one-third of the population. About two-thirds of the population pay this $1.7 billion. I said at the time that, before you get the first extra person into private health insurance, you actually spend an enormous amount of money without buying any extra health services. The second point is that, if families were inclined because of this incentive-which is very modest in terms of the total cost of private health insurance-to see this as a reason to take up private health insurance, many of them would be financially crippled by the private medical bills the first time they had a major operation, or any operation, in a private hospital. As members should be aware, the rebate would be gobbled up by the gap between what the health funds pay and what Medicare pays and what specialists actually charge. Since you cannot control doctors' fees-and constitutionally that is probably correct-what you are offering people is a rebate which is immediately gobbled up the moment they have their first major operation. Those fees are, on average, 17 per cent higher than what they get after Medicare and their health insurance funds pay. So I think people would be seduced-and they already are in many cases-into taking up private health insurance when they cannot afford it. It should be a matter of choice, not of necessity. That means you have to ensure that the public health system is in good order. Medicare is designed to protect those families from those extra bills. That was precisely what it was all about. It was understood that our taxation would pay for Medicare and, through it, every Australian should have access to high quality care according to their need, not according to their wealth. This policy-as it was announced before the last election and is now effected in this bill-does not do that. It robs Medicare of $1.7 billion, and it has done that-explicitly and directly outlined in the last budget. It is interesting that at the time when we said, 'Where is all this money going to come from? It is a very substantial bill that will have to be paid here, purchasing not one extra bed, not one extra procedure; where will it come from?' during the election campaign in the coalition's health policy A Healthy Future, we were told: The incentive will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the Statesan explicit clear promise: 'not be funded those sources'Other than $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice Program, the incentive be funded entirely from savings outside the and Human Services portfolio. What did we see? Just the opposite. The and entire $1.7 billion is funded from the health budget, including grants to the states and including funding from hospitals. I think it is worth reminding members of those cuts---cuts over four years, totalling $312.7 million, hospital funding to abolish so-called cost shifting. I know the shadow minister has surprisingly, already spoken about it at length, but it hardly makes sense, when hospitals are struggling, take $300 million from them over that period. A further $450 million is the effect of cuts states grants. That is a direct breach of promise. The abolition of the dental health propolicy-again, gram-straight out of the health budgetthat saves $399.4 million. There is a number of other measures, including medical work force changes. We do not quite know what the total cost of those will be these days, there have been so many shifts. They will also freeze the Medicare rebate-$238 million. In total, it is just about the amount required to pay for these private health insurance premiums. In other words, the less well-off in our community, the people who need things such as the public dental health scheme and access to public hospitals, are funding these rebates, these incentives. So that is a very clear breach of promise and, in my view, very bad policy. It shows that, although they snuggled up to Medicare during the election campaign-they wanted to say that they really did approve of it-the government did not understand it. The government did not understand the principle of universality, of everyone sharing in a high quality system. The other thing that we have already seenagain, I said this in February 1996-is that if families do choose to have private health insurance the policy will push up premiums by blowing out the costs of specialists and private hospitals and, hence, blowing up the premiums they are required to pay. That has already happened. We have seen very subfrom stantial increases in the premiums right throughout the country in the order of 13, 14, 15 and 16 per cent, and there is more to will. come. This is an uncapped price. Doctors can Health charge whatever they like. Hospitals, with some exceptions, can push up the prices too, there is no restriction on the health funds. So you get your rebate, that is fine, but within the first six months it has already been dissipated by the fact that the cost of the to premium is now 15 or 20 per cent higher than it was when the rebate was introduced. Not people are continuing to drop out of private health insurance because they can to see these consequences. I think what the population of Australia has demanded in the to past, and should continue to demand, is a this universal sector which is properly funded. I think it needs to be said that the kind of I said it in February 1996subsidises the private sector at the expense of the public sector would take us down the road of the United States route, a system which costs American taxpayers twice as much as it does us in terms of their gross domestic product but still leaves approximately 40 million people without any health insurance at all. I will return to that point in a little while. So we are extremely foolish if we adopt a system which cripples the public sector and leads to a two-tiered system, the private part of which is far more expensive. This is currently the case: per procedure, per bed day, the private health sector is more expensive than the public health sector. So we are substituting a more expensive system for a less expensive system. That does not make economic sense, and it certainly does not make health sense. What we have seen here is certainly the implementation of a policy in part, but funded at the expense of the public system. I guess we could ask why this is so. Why has the government got this so thoroughly wrong when it said it actually supported Medicare? I think it is worth going back through a bit of history, because we need to be reminded where the conservatives have been on this issue for a very long time. They do not change their stripes-whatever they might like to say publicly. When we got into government in 1983, the health system, by everyone's assessment in this country, was in a shambles. It is a shambles we look set to return to, sadly. Under Fraser and Howard the conservatives lurched through five chaotic health systems in seven years-five changes as they progressively dismantled Whitlam's Medibank. Again, they had promised not to do it, and they did. When the electorate finally rejected Fraser, Australia had gone from universal access to services based on need so-called-the sort of thing that we are hearing now-to the confusion and injustice of a two-tiered health system where income was again the main determinant of the quality of health care received. That is the direction in which we are heading again. Fraser's claim that he would keep Medibank had more to do with the name than wi th anything else, because he successfully dismantled it. By 1983, Fraser and Howard had gone back to the fifties-something they seem set to do again-to the basic principles that had actually been adopted when Earl Page was minister for health; to the harsh view-we heard it again here a moment ago from one of the members-that health services are essentially discretionary and that, by and large, the user should pay. Under the coalition at that time, until we got into government in 1983, only health care card holders were eligible for special assistance from the government. It was welfare medicine. Everyone else was either forced into private health insurance or took their chances. A lot of people had to take their chances because private health insurance was too expensive for them. Beyond the very disadvantaged, those without insurance received no government assistance at all, regardless of their ability to pay. As a result of this, over two million people had no health cover at all. This was supposed to be the golden era of private health care-one that members opposite obviously want us to return to. You would have to say that, at the time, every sharp operator in the private health sector could make a profit under Fraser and Howard. The conservatives spent billions-as they are planning to do again in a slightly different form-pumping bed day subsides into private hospitals, making contributions to the reinsurance pool for the private insurers and paying for high cost patients the private insurers did not want. In other words, they were encouraging cream skimming. The public hospitals had to deal with all the complicated cases. They also provided tax incentives for health insurance-again, we are returning to that-to benefit high income earners and they set free, it has to be said, unfettered fee-for-service medicine, which is often attached to Medicare quite unjustly. All this was provided at the expense of the taxpayer, so rich and poor alike paid for it. At the same time, they neglected the interests of ordinary Australians. Over 400,000 middle income families struggling to make ends meet had neither insurance nor access to Medibank. They could not get in either way. Free access to public hospitals was restricted to the very disadvantaged, to say nothing of the lack of information and the confusion that ordinary Australians then faced in trying to sort out what was best for them and their families. We are seeing that develop again-a complex system; unnecessarily complex and expensive. To add insult to injury at the time, the special purpose grants established by Labor to fund free public hospital care were rolled up and handed back to the states through general revenue sharing agreements. Again, we are seeing pressures in this direction under the current government. The states were not actually required to spend the funds on health, let alone on public hospitals. But even here the conservative user-pays ideology dominated their support for state's rights. In handing back responsibility for the hospitals, they actually tried to force the states to introduce user charges for their public hospitals by discounting funds by the amount the Commonwealth minister for health deemed should have been raised through a hospital charge to each state. So they punished them at the time if they did not have user charging. Mercifully, in my view, Labor's election in 1983 put an end to this health debacle and brought relief and peace of mind to most ordinary Australians-something that they subsequently embraced very strongly. It was quite the opposite of what the then Leader of the Opposition said of Medibank. He said: If this . . . scheme goes through this generation be passing on a vast failure and those who vote for it will regret it. ... It will bedevil the future. It will reduce the standard of living for generations to come. He has been shown to be absolutely wrong about that. Indeed, in time the conservatives realised that they had to embrace Medicare too if they were ever to get into government. But should we believe that? In my view, we should not. This legislation in a sense confirms that lack of belief. If you go back through what those in government said while they were in opposition, it is very clear that they have not changed their tune since they were in government. Despite the fact that a great majorityover 90 per cent-of the community were satisfied with Medicare during this time, the conservatives were saying that they were going to pull Medicare apart because it was a mess. In the four elections previous to the last, they opposed Medicare as a matter of policy. In three of the four they had detailed plans for dismantling it. On the other occasion-in 1990-they made such a mess of their co stings that immediately before the election their spokesperson, Peter Shack, announced that they would have no policy at all for that election. Over and over again through this time in opposition, they argued for the abolition of bulk-billing (it is interesting that they are now doing that by stealth); limited access to public hospitals to the disadvantaged (they are now doing that by cutting direct funds to the states and to hospitals); increasing the Medicare levy (they are doing that for one section of the population); the introduction of compulsory fees; the introduction of unaffordable tax breaks for private health insurance (they are doing that now); opting out of Medicare in favour of private health insurance (they are pushing people in that direction as well); reducing the Medicare rebate (it has been frozen); providing subsidies to health insurers and private hospitals (we have not quite seen that yet); and allowing unfettered gap insurance (they do appear to have retreated from that particularly stupid idea). For the whole of his political career, John will Howard, now the Prime Minister, has been an opponent of Medicare and universal health care. One of his first acts when he came to this parliament was to vote against Medibank in the first half of the 1970s. In the early 1980s, when he was Treasurer, he was behind dismantling it. He opposed it again in the late 1980s as opposition leader, and again in 1993 with Fightback. I think it is worth quoting some of the Prime Minister's own words on this. In 1987, in particular, he was not afraid to show the Australian public what he thought of Medicare. He said, quite bluntly, Medicare was a failure. Medicare was a failure, in the view of the Prime Minister. Along with words like 'incentivation'-remember that?Howardspeak gave us phrases like 'Medimess' and 'Medi-queues'. He was fond of using those phrases. I must say that what we have in 1997 from the Prime Minister is 'Medi-fraud'. But one of the most revealing examples of what the Prime Minister actually thinks of Medicare was given in a 1987 address to the Private Hospitals Association. It reveals what he really thinks. He said: Medicare, a mandatory national monopoly service, has degenerated into a second rate service and failed the great majority of Australians. I give you an undertaking that a Howard Government would break the monopolistic stranglehold. As the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard said he believed Medicare had become an 'administrative quagmire'. It was a 'financial monster' and a 'human nightmare'. I have to say that I think the sudden love that has developed between the conservatives and Medicare is not to be believed. Is the Prime Minister a man who has seen the light after listening to the people? Has he gone back and thought hard about what he was actually proposing during his time in government and previously in opposition and said, 'I was actually wrong about this'? Not at all. It is about as believable as Homer Simpson renouncing beer and television. The Prime Minister is a man who might be prepared to cap his teeth, clip his eyebrows, get new glasses, update his suits and get his colours done, but he is not a man who changes his philosophy on this or any other matter. I was very clear in warning the Australian people of that during the election campaign and they need to be reminded of it at frequent opportunities as we see Medicare slowly dismantled. The coalition's support for Medicare has been and is cosmetic, as these bills clearly show. They simply do not understand the basic principles that underlie Medicare and, in funding it as they have done in explicit breach of their promises all from Health and Family Services, they have shown that they are embarked on a course of shifting the balance of health care in this community away from that universal provision towards provision based on wealth. I hope that is something that Australians will reject. I know the Prime Minister is fond now of talking about the battlers. The battlers-those people who do not have high incomes and who have families and a good many responsibilities-are in fact the people most hurt by this, because in taking out private health insurance with these modest incentives, they would be forced to pay much higher bills than they pay at the moment in the Medicare system. They would be forced to meet expenses that they do not currently have to make. But I can understand them being concerned about the state of our public hospital system in particular, as they have seen since the early 1990s conservative governments at state levels significantly reduce the amount of funding in public hospitals. Yes, there has been cost shifting and yes, I did complain about it, but that was directly the result of the fact that state governments-conservative ones particularly in Victoria and New South Wales-removed some $700 million over that time from the public hospital system. What is this minister's remedy for that problem? To take out even more than that-a further nearly $800 million, if you add up the cost to states grants and the direct removal of funding. Our public hospital system is straining at the seams. There is no doubt about it. Any state you go to in this country is having a great deal of difficulty meeting the demands upon it, not because of the number of people who have dropped private health insurance but because of the very direct, explicit policy of reducing funding to public hospitals in order to push people into the private health system. That has been the explicit agenda of many of the conservative premiers and health ministers. They have been have open about, indeed. They wanted to put people who, as they say, can afford it into the private health system. But can we as a nation afford it? We simply cannot afford to move in the direction of having an uncontrolled private sector partially funded, as it is already and further funded as it will be, from the taxpayers at the same time as we wind down the cheaper, more effective, more equitable and universal Medicare system. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think this is an ill considered set of policies, one that will do nothing to improve the state of the health of this nation and the delivery of health services. I will certainly be doing my part, along with the shadow minister, in drawing to the attention of the people of Australia precisely what the effects of this government's policy on Medicare are. They are not converts in supporting Medicare; they are going to dismantle it by stealth.",38
14,Mr ANDREN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It has been fascinating listening to this debate over the last couple of days and the wide-ranging expertise offered by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), to whom I listened with great interest last night. I would like to put politics aside for a moment and take a look at these initiatives and ask: will these measures actualpublic's ly help improve Australia's health system, which we all admit is in a state of some crisis? It is fair to say that the answer to that question is yes, but I also believe they will not go far enough in addressing one of the most serious problems facing our health system and that is the mass desertion of people from the private health system. I think overall they are a step in the right direction. I think the general public is well and truly sick of seeing the nation's health system being used as a political football. While elderly people in our community are forced to wait months for basic orthopaedic surgery, such as hip and knee replacements, for many years now we have seen the political leaders take advantage of the problems in our health system and use them as political capital. Quite frankly, the people of Australia have had enough of this pathetic politics that simply goes around in circles and gets us nowhere. In my electorate, for example, waiting lists for non-elective surgery have been reasonably long for the past decade. Governments of various political persuasions have come and gone in that time. Each side has blamed each other, state or federal; each side has promised to do something about it once in government, but nothing has changed and it continues to be that political football. Perhaps it reached the utmost level of absurdity just before the last state election New South Wales when Bob Carr, the Premier, and Andrew Refshauge promised to resign unless hospital waiting lists were halved within 12 months. None of us really expected them to keep that promise, even though the figures were juggled to suggest that the figures had in fact been arrived at. Those of us who have watched the game of health politics for many years knew all along it was a Clayton's promise. The thing is that the public knew, too. They know that their politicians are not about to admit the crisis that is facing the political parties in this country, they realise that it will be used as a football and they want answers. Our health ministers and shadow health ministers have been underestimating the intelligence on this issue for far too long. There are several important factors we need to keep in mind when discussing health in the country. First, we still have one of the best, if not the best, universal health systems in the world. The member for Bradfield alluded last night to his recent visit to the UK where two deaths a day are attributed to waiting lists on which people are waiting for critical, urgent surgery. Two deaths a day is almost the benchmark that has been agreed on as sustainable and politically acceptable. Pray we never get to a state like that in this country. Certainly there are major areas of concern in Australia, such as the poor health standards amongst the Aboriginal population, but overall we have it pretty good-or have had until now. But crunch time is nigh. Secondly, as we all know, it is becoming more and more expensive to maintain this health system, and in some respects it is a bottomless pit, because increased technology and improved life expectancy inevitably mean higher health costs. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) alluded to the fact that, when he was shadow minister a decade ago, the costs of the health budget were $7 billion and that they are now in the order of $19 billion. He suggested a scheme then that perhaps the 18to 50-year-olds might be supporting the rest in some sort of quasiMedicare private health system that sounded in pretty idealistic, even coming from the member for 0' Connor. We could possibly double the health budget again and still be battling waiting lists and battling to pay for new and expensive wonder drugs. I notice the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is in the House. He took a brave decision late last year to allow those Medicare patients suffering MS to access betaferon as a publicly funded drug on the list; otherwise those patients would be paying in the order of $20,000 per annum, for what is a very debilitating and widespread complaint. That cost immediately is transferred to the public health budget, and that is the sort of medical technology cost we have out there at the moment that we are trying to cope with. What impact has the cost of organ transplant surgery had on the delivery or the ability of state governments to deliver adequate health services to the country areas of New South Wales or elsewhere in Australia? It is a huge transfer of cost to the new technology that the major political parties have not been prepared to admit is a realistic expression of why the health budgets are so high. So we have to challenge it; we have got to attack it. It would be nice if we, the political leaders, could put the politics aside and deliver to the Australian people the type of health system they expect, or at least as close to it as we can, with the amount of money we have available. To do that, we have to raise the dollars through a reformed tax system and stop the overservicing and overuse that bleeds the system. The Australian people have shown the one thing they value most is the Medicare system, which is one of the great legacies of the former Labor government. They showed it strongly to the people of Australia in the 1993 election when they rejected John Hewson and the coalition. I believe in Calare that rejection was as much about Medicare and the threat they perceived to that system as it was a fear of the GST-those fears so shamelessly exploited by a desperate Labor Prime Minister. That election demonstrated how much Australians do regard Medicare, and it would be a very brave federal government which ever dared to tamper with Medicare in the future or allowed the free marketeers to take hold of the system where not only the healthy but the wealthy are the ones who survive. So Medicare will continue to grow. More people-indeed, more reasonably well-off people-will continue to say no to taking out private health insurance. We must encourage otherwise. The member for O'Connor last night alluded to the fact that the old will be the only ones who access private health cover if we do not add more incentives to the system. And this is true. He spoke after the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who said that his daughter had been sick as a baby and in an emergency had been flown to Sydney for special treatment; and, of course, Medicare looked after her. At the sickest stage of my life, I was a Medibank patient-the forerunner of Medicare-and I landed in Sydney Hospital. But for the experience and the expertise along Macquarie Street, I would not be here talking today. I had an amoebic abscess on the liver which was quite unusual in those days. It was just fortunate that I was in Sydney Hospital. I had the greatest medical technology available in Sydney and I survived the illness. Medicare picked up that bill. Today I still ensure that I take out private health insurance, unlike our former Prime Minister., because I believe that I have a responsibility to not overburden the public system. That may be naive. It may be far cheaper for me to take the sorts of risks that the healthy take and just rely on the public system, but I choose not to. And so do many others in the community-many people who are of reasonable means and some who are not-and they deserve every incentive we can offer them to access that private hospital and private health insurance system. The crisis was most obvious when the former Prime Minister announced that, while he was on a high income, he saw no need to have private health insurance. Many Australians heard that and thought, 'If it's good enough for Paul Keating, it's good enough for me too.' The problem is that this country's health system simply cannot survive on Medicare alone-that is, of course, unless we want a major hike in the Medicare levy or we claw in more tax receipts. That avenue is there, but the political will is not. As the member for O'Connor pointed out last night, the emerging pattern is that only the elderly and middle aged left with private health insurance will be there, with the young and healthy all relying on Medicare. Really there is nothing evil or wrong with the private health insurance industry. It be remembered that the bulk of health insurand ers in this country are non-profit organisations there to serve their members. The one big exception is National Mutual, the third biggest insurer. Thanks to the previous it is now a private company and, like so many of our successful companies, now in foreign hands. This is perhaps one blight on an industry that is otherwise there very much for the public good and to serve its members. In my own electorate, we have the outstandbeen ing example of the Lithgow based District Health Fund which has its roots in the trade union movement in Lithgow where it originally started serving miners and other workers. Today, Westfund has expanded lem. throughout western New South Wales into the western suburbs of Sydney offering its bers a wide range of services, including changed access to its own optical and dental specialgone ists. This government's cutbacks to dental services funding has caused major problems in other parts of my electorate, particularly those areas where there are no dentists and public transport. Elderly people will lose service that is not a cost to the budget, as government thinks, but a proactive health initiative that would save scarce health dollars by keeping these people healthy. While this cutback has occurred, thankfully, and thanks to this well-run local private health insurer, the people of Lithgow, or at lea,t some of them, still have access to an affordable dental service. But in Lithgow, elsewhere, more and more people, egged on by the former Prime Minister perhaps, have voted with their feet and stopped taking out private health insurance. Many of your time miners in Lithgow can well remember the days, even before Westfund, when their mmor. pay was docked each week and the money would go towards paying a local doctor. Such was the danger of working in the mines that people valued their local doctor that much and their health. It was a different type health insurance but it worked and it did ensure that the people of Lithgow actually had a doctor. In recent years, like so many country towns, must Lithgow has been struggling to keep doctors to replace the ones who retire due to old age, or would have retired years ago but cannot because they cannot find people to replace them. And Lithgow is only a couple government, of hours from Sydney. This is one of many health problems facing rural and regional Australia that needs to be addressed urgently. It is probably peripheral to this particular bill but it is a problem that has been raised for many years now. We have made many promises but we are yet to Western see any real changes. I cannot believe that the linking of Medicare provider numbers with a community is not a feasible way of attacking this probIt is not conscription; it is public service by the medical fraternity. Lithgow is a good memexample of how much our health system has in just a couple of generations. It has from the era of miners being docked to pay for a local doctor who could set broken bones and do somewhat primitive surgery at the local hospital, to today when anyone in seriously injured in the Lithgow district is no flown by a helicopter retrieval team to one of a the major hospitals in Sydney, and at enorthis mous cost to the system. The vast amounts of money involved in funding these retrieval teams could not have been imagined earlier this century but these costs impact on the sort of service that can be delivered to rural and regional areas. As I said earlier, I commend the thrust of these initiatives we are discussing, but I think like we are going to need much bolder measures if we are really going to tackle many of the problems. It will be interesting to see later this year what effect these initiatives do have oldin encouraging people to take out private insurance. I suspect that the impact will be What we are talking about here is a carrot and big stick approach-the carrot in the form of incentives for low income earners and the big stick in the form of a tax penalty for of people earning more than $50,000 a year who do not have private insurance. People are simply going to look at either the incentives or tax penalty and say, 'Will I be better off with private health cover or will I stick with Medicare?' Sadly, I think in most cases they will vote with their feet and decide to stay with Medicare and either forgo the incentive or, in the case of high income earners, pay the extra tax. If we look at a single person, the minimum private health cover is around $800 a year. The incentives being offered for low income earners will go nowhere near paying that amount even now, and they are not indexed to inflation, so they will become even more worthless as time goes on. As for the penalties, you would have to be earning more than $80,000 a year, according to my estimates, to make it worthwhile to take out private cover. I reiterate that I am still talking about basic hospital cover. Even then, many may still decide that they are better off sticking with Medicare alone because they will not be stuck with paying the huge gap between the health fund rebates and specialists' schedule fees. I am sure we can all tell stories we have heard from constituents who have been caught out-trapped in the gap, if you like. In my electorate a privately insured patient from Orange recently had triple bypass surgery. At the end of the day he was a little saddened, bewildered and angered to find he had a bill of $1,000 or thereabouts to pay. His mate from Broken Hill went down for a similar operation at the same time on the Medicare public system. It did not cost him a brass razoo. What incentive is there in that to be privately insured? There has been no incentive to date. Sadly, these incentives will still not be enough. Those I have spoken to in the private health insurance industry say that even if this incentives bill is wildly successful, at best they would estimate the number of people privately insured could go up by about 10 per cent, realistically about three per cent, and they concede this figure could well be far less as publicity continues over the recent increases in fees. The government will have to look at further measures over coming years, such as giving fringe benefits tax exemption. As well, the taxation break for those who take out private cover must be expanded to induce more to take that option, but it must not be funded by cuts to the public hospital system or the public health care system generally. While I make mention of Lithgow, one of the things that people of that city do not want is the closure of their local Medicare office. It is the smallest in New South Wales but it is also a very busy one, serviced by a dedicated staff. They do not want to lose this service but they are very scared they will and uneasy because, I am told, it is on the itinerary of every Labor politician who passes through the central west. Whenever they pass through, they all traipse through the Lithgow Medicare office to try to terrify the staff into thinking that Dr Wooldridge wants to shut them down. It seems that everyone from Kim Beazley down has visited Lithgow Medicare. If visits by ALP luminaries count for anything, Dr Wooldridge would never dare shut it down. It gets more Labor visitors than Ben Chifley's cottage up the road in Bathurst. Jokes aside, the people of Lithgow do value their Medicare office. While the pharmacy agency services, soon to be trialled by the government, are great in small towns where there has been no access to a Medicare claim service, they are certainly no replacement for a fully functioning Medicare office. Mr Lee-You said you had a guarantee.",43
15,Mr ANDREN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will see you about that later. I checked with the pharmacies in Claremont and Dysart in Queensland, which, along with other remote communities of Blackwater, Tieri and Springsure, will begin a trial of fax machine Medicare pharmacy agencies this Friday. This is a welcome new service to these centres, which are two to 2Y2 hours from their nearest major centre and Medicare branch. While I have been critical of the government replacing face-to-face services with 1800 lines for taxation, social security and Austudy services in the bush, I welcome this use of technology in remote areas where ready access to counter service is not available. But it should not be an excuse to rip more jobs out of larger towns which already have a Medicare office. These bills are a step in the right direction. These private health insurance incentives go very little of the way to restoring a sustainable health system. The Productivity Commission says that the grounds for excluding all those who opt to self-insure are 'weak and could be re-examined'. The rebate will not help the health budget one dollar. Savings to Medicare through this narrowly targeted rebate will fall well short of the costs of the rebate. As others have said, private health insurance has dropped from 65 per cent to 33 per cent since 1983. The private health funds are in crisis and facing huge loss. There are accusations of cost shifting both ways-from state to federal and from federal to state-in the increasing number of geriatric patients now housed in nursing home wings of country hospitals. No-one is blameless in the increasing crisis that is the health care system in this country. I note the amendment moved by the member for Dobell, which is more a comment on the government's overall budgetary approach rather than a constructive amendment to this bill. VVhile I deplore the cuts to dental services and cuts to public hospitals on the spurious cross-shift arguments, I will support this bill unamended with the grave reservation outlined in my contribution during this debate.",46
16,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will take only a few minutes to sum up this morning. First of all, I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution to this debate on health insurance. I apologise for not being able to hear them all in full. I also thank the member for Calare (Mr Andren) for his thoughtful contribution. In closing the debate, I want to say how important these bills are for the future of the health care system in Australia. It could not have been summed up better than by the Premier of New South VVales last weekendalthough, it would have been very nice if he had done something in the last couple of years rather than wait till now. He said: The exodus from the private health insurance system was costing New South Wales public hospitals $246 million a year as they struggled to meet the swelling demand. He released New South VVales health department figures to the Sunday Telegraph, which revealed the number of New South VVales residents with private insurance had plummeted by eight per cent in only three years. He also said: As fast as we hurled money at the hospitals, there was a further abandonment of private health cover and a further rise in demands on the public system. That is absolutely spot on. VVhat these bills are about is twofold: first, giving the Australian public choice, which has to be an essential part of any health system; and, second, trying to do something to stem the dropout over the last 10 years from private health insurance. I believe this will do it. I cannot promise a massive turnaround. I can promise though to try to stop the two per cent dropout a year of which Mr Carr is complaining. I suppose I could just put the money into public hospitals, but I am a bit jaded by the experience of the last four years. VVhile the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) talked about what the states took out of public hospitals, she was actually minister for much of that time and was completely powerless to do anything. Right around Australia the Commonwealth's contribution over the life of this Medicare agreement to hospitals has increased steadily. The states' collective contribution to hospitals has decreased. It is okay to whinge, berate and jump up and down, but the net effect of that was zero. Before I would consider putting additional resources into state public hospitals, I would want to have some assurance that the experience was not going to be just that of the last four ye, [s when, before putting extra resources in, the Commonwealth found that the states just took resources out. The other aspect of that is that that is treating the symptom, not treating the problem. The problem is that we have had a mixed stable system of private and public health provision in Australia that is under threat because of the decline over the last decade. If I just keep putting money into the public system I am not treating the cause of the problem. If I can stop the dropout from private health insurance, if I can do no more than retain those people already in private health insurance, it will go a long way to meeting Premier Carr's concerns. This bill has several parts-and there are amendments that we will have the opportunity to talk to in detail. The government does have some amendments. The reason for that is that, since introducing the legislation in December, we have worked fairly hard to refine and shape the mechanisms by which the incentive system will operate. We have consulted with industry, with consumers and with the Health Insurance Commission and, as a result of this process, we have developed a number of amendments which have been circulated. I will formally move those in the consideration in detail stage. The main effect of this, if I may foreshadow it, is that it will enable applicants to make a simple declaration rather than a statutory declaration of their income eligibility for the incentives. This will make the system much easier to operate. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I again thank honourable members for their contributions. This bill, when it is passed, will be the beginning of turning the tide. I cannot say that it is every- Worth, P. M. thing that needs to be done to health for the next 10 years. I can say that it is a step in the Adams, D. G. H. right direction and I can say that it is very long overdue.

17,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"by leave I move opposition amendments Nos 1 to 3: (1) Clause 3-3, page 6, lines 19-28, omit subclause (4), substitute the following subclauses: (4) The maximum amount is: (a) if at all times during the financial year the person covered by the policy is not a dependent child and is not the partner of another person-$35,000 adjusted, as appropriate, by the index number; or $70,000, adjusted as appropriate by + the index number Note: For dependent child, parent For index number, see section 3-6. (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), adjustment mUltiplying the sum specified by the index Note: For index number, see section 3-6. (3) Page 8, after clause 3-5, add the following clause: 3-6 Meaning of index number In section 3-3 or 3-4: (1) index number, in relation to a maximum places, worked out under the following formula: PAIRS (b) if at any time during the financial year the person covered by the policy is not a dependent child and is the partner of another person-$70,000 adjusted, as appropriate, by the index number; or (c) if at any time during the financial year the person covered by the policy is a dependent child-$70,000 adjusted, as appropriate, by the index number. Notes: For dependent child index number, parent and partner, see the Dictionary. For index number, see section 3-6. (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), adjustment of the maximum amount is determined by multiplying the sum specified by the index number (rounding down to the nearest whole dollar). Note: For index number, see section 3-6. (2) Clause 3-4, page 7, lines 21-31, omit subsection (4), substitute the following subsections: (4) The maximum amount is: (a) if the persons covered by the policy do not include 2 or more dependent children at any time during the financial year concemed-$70,000, adjusted as appropriate by the index number; or (b) if, at any time during the financial year, 2 or more dependent children are covered by the policy-the amount worked out as follows: $3,000, adjusted as $76,000, adjusted appropriate by the index as appropriate by number x (3 - 1) the index number and partner, see the Dictionary. of the maximum amount is determined by number (rounding down to the nearest whole dollar). amount, means the number, calculated to 3 decimal average weekly earnings for immediately preceding financial year average weekly earnings for financial year 1996-97. (2) For the purposes of subsection (I) average weekly earnings means the amount: (a) estimated as the average total weekly earnings to date of all employees (all persons) in Australia; and (b) published by the Australian Statistician in relation to a year up to 30 June of that year; (3) Subject to subsection (4), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, the Australian Statistician published or publishes an average total weekly earnings number in respect of a year in substitution for an average total weekly earnings number previously published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that year, the publication of the later number shall be disregarded for the purposes of sections 3-3 and 3-4. (4) If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the average total weekly earnings, then, for the purposes of the application of sections 3-3 and 3-4 after change took place or takes place, regard shall be had only to numbers published in terms of the new reference base. The reason the opposition is moving these amendments is that we want a firmer assurance built into the legislation that these income limits are going to be indexed each year. These amendments simply seek to adjust each year, using the total average weekly earnings index, the income limits that are in the legislation for this private health insurance incentive. We think that is the most appropriate index, given that we are talking about limits on individuals' taxable incomes. The current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has a bit of a chequered history on indexation. I am sure many people will remember that back in the 1970s, when the now Prime Minister was the Treasurer in the Fraser government, there were certain promises to the Australian people to introduce full indexation of the income tax thresholds. At subsequent budgets, the then Fraser-Howard government walked away from those promises to index each year the income tax thresholds. As a result, we know that Liberal government promises about indexing various income thresholds are often not kept. In the likely event that our arguments cannot convince the government to accept our amendments, we will be seeking assurances from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that amendments will be made each year to increase these income limits. We would also be interested to know which indexes the government would use in determining what these limits would be if the government went down the alternate has path of increasing them in subsequent budgets. We certainly believe that if the government is not prepared to accept our amendments to index the thresholds each year then that is a sign that it is not genuinely committed to ensuring that as many Australians as possible do have access to the private health insurance initiatives. I will leave my contribution at that and see whether the minister can surprise us by agreeing to accept our amendments or by providing perhaps some other comfort on how the the government intends to adjust these income levels each year.",49
18,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"We will not be accepting the opposition's amendments. In fact, the income limits that we are proposing in this bill are even more generous than what we promised in the election. I accept that it may be fairly siIIy of us not to have got the full benefit of that during the election, but when we chose to look at how we would physically manage this there was great merit in aligning the income limits with the income limits in the family tax initiative. That is what we have done and that is why there are further income concessions for each additional child. So the income limits were determined on the basis of the family tax initiative, and the family tax initiative is not indexed. The opposition did not seek to make amendments to the family tax initiative to index it, so to have two different income limits would be simply unworkable. I will just make two points in passing. The first is that the income limits are very generous and, off the top of my head, I think they apply to something like 85 per cent of Australian families already. The second point is that in Labor's own health policy, when they were offering rebates for incomes up to $63,766 a year, which is some 10 per cent lower than we are proposing, they themselves were not proposing to make indexation there. It is a pretty tough argument to say that they were not prepared to do it but that we somehow should be prepared to do it.",50
19,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"Given that I have been unable to persuade the minister to accept my amendments, I ask if he is prepared to indicate to the House whether the government is considering increasing these limits at future budgets or whether we can expect that this is a figure that is to be set for the life of this parliament.",51
20,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,The answer to that is it depends on what happens to the family tax initiative. There would be great merit in keeping the two aligned. The family tax initiative is not my responsibility.,51
21,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"VVould the minister confirm that the government does adjust the lower income limits for income thresholds, such as when the Medicare levy cuts in? Given that the government does adjust those income limits, why isn't the government prepared to consider adjusting the income limits for the family tax initiative and the private health insurance measures?",51
22,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"This is the last contribution I want to make unless some other speakers wish to talk. It is helpful to have some back and forth comments, and I think it is a proper use of the parliament, but we could go on forever. It is also a function of Senate estimates and other places that this occurs. You are talking about very different thresholds for the Medicare levy of very low income earners$70,000 for a family income is not very low. It is something that covers the majority of the Australian population-as I said off the top of my head, about 85 per cent of families. VVe are implementing here exactly what we promised in the last election. In fact, it is a little more generous, but undertaking this course of action is no different from what we undertook to the Australian people to do. Amendments negatived.

23,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I might month; speak a bit longer on this occasion and go through a number of issues that I would be grateful if the minister could respond to during this consideration in detail. First of all, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) during his contribution was commenting on the Lithgow Medicare office and. in an interjection across the table, I thought the minister said that he had not given any guarantees to the honourable member for Cal are that Medicare office would remain open. I would be grateful if the minister could confirm whether that is the case--or any other Medicare offices in that member's electorate. It is my understanding that certain claims have been made that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has given assurances to the honourable member adjustfor Calare that is the case. I would hate for the minister to be misquoted-ertainly in the electorate of Calare. If he could clear that up, I would be grateful, because on one other occasion I asked him if any members of parliament or senators had been given assurances that their local Medicare offices would remain open and on that occasion he said no, they hadn't but that people would be consulted before final decisions were made. In particular, I would be grateful if he could clear up the issue as to whether any commitments have been given about Medicare offices in the electorate of Calare. If other commitments have been made to other members or senators, I would be interested in those as well. I also noted in the minister's summing up in the second reading debate that he said that the government cannot promise there will be a massive turnaround in the number of people who take out private health insurance as a result of these measures. He also used words to the effect that this would be the beginning of the turning of the tide. My understanding is that, at the time of the budget last year, a number of documents made public said that it was the government's expectation last August that this Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill would result in a two per cent increase in the number of people with private health insurance and that the Medicare levy would result in a further 1Y2 per cent increase in the number of people with private health insurance. It was expected that it would fall to as low as 32 per cent, but the government's line in the sand as of last August was that by 1 July, when these measures cut in, 35.5 per cent of the population would have private health insurance. I would just like the minister to confirm whether that is still the government's expectation at this time or whether there has been a change in the expectations that were published last August. If the minister is to be judged by 35.5 per cent, I am happy to do that. If it is now a level which is much lower than 35.5 per cent and that has changed since last August, could he please explain to us why he has now adopted a more pessimistic attitude to these issues? The third point I would like to ask is how the minister explains the fact that these measures have been funded by reductions in federal funding for public hospitals, abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program and reductions in funding for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, given that before the last election the minister promised in 'A Healthy Future': The incentive will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States ... Other than the $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio. Minister, given that undertaking before the election, I am wondering if you could perhaps explain to us why you have funded this $1.7 billion tax break for private health insurance by an $800 million cutback in federal funding for public hospitals, a $500 million cutback in funding for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and a $400 million reduction from the forward estimates by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program, which is clearly a breach of that undertaking. Fourthly, before the last election you and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised to retain community rating. As recently as last August, when the Prime Minister established the Productivity Commission inquiry into private health insurance, he instructed the Productivity Commission not to look at the question of community rating, that community rating was sacrosanct and would be retained. That was the Prime Minister's position then. He said the Productivity Commission could not look at that. I am now wondering how you rationalise the pre-election commitment and the direction of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and yourself to the Productivity Commission that they could not look at this issue. (Extension of time granted) How does the minister rationalise today's front page of the Australian, which has him signing off and personally approving a supplementary submission at the very last minute to the Productivity Commission which supports the introduction of so-called lifetime community rating? Do you argue that this version of lifetime community rating is in keeping with the promises you gave before the election? If your department's submission is successful, it will result in older people having to pay more and many people having to wait longer, having to pay premiums to health funds for up to five years, before becoming eligible for rebates and benefits. Isn't this a complete breach of the undertakings that the Liberal and National parties gave before the election, and as recently as last August, to maintain community rating? Fifthly, and finally, would the minister confirm that to be eligible for the private health insurance incentive people will have to complete a IS-page form? Could the minister please explain why it is necessary to provide 15 pages of details before people are eligible for a rebate as basic as this? Do you think this will reduce the burden of paperwork on ordinary Australians? I re-emphasise the point that I made last night: many people have been hit by a number of changes that have taken place in the government's health policy. In the budget last year, the government reduced rebates, which meant that more patients were out of pocket for many operations. Basically, this government's policy is that, if people survive the wrist cramp a IS-page form, they will then be hit with wallet cramp because of the government's reductions in rebates. I would be grateful if the minister could explain to the House why a IS-page form is necessary and how many duplicate copies of each page the government requires to be submitted.",52
24,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"The shadow minister and member for Dobell (Mr Lee) raised a number of points. I suspect Medicare offices are beyond the scope of this bill, but what we are trying to do, for which I make no apologies, is to provide better access to people for Medicare services. The demand for Medicare offices is immense. I cannot conceivably meet the demand for Medicare offices. I am very concerned that a large part of rural and remote Australia has no access whatsoever. They are the people I am trying to assist. The pharmacy agency that we are going to trial first up on Friday and which we hope to have in place by May will, over the next three years, give 400 communities that have no access at all at the moment to Medicare some access. So that will be a plus. As to which Medicare offices are likely to close, no final decision has been made. We will be endeavouring, wherever possible, to not in any way disadvantage rural communities. We have not made a final decision on the number, and we have certainly not made a final decision on the location. I have given people an undertaking that I will consult with local members before the final decision is taken. We have found that we can progress the trials and the offices without having to close any at this stage. There will be some closures, but I am hopeful they will not be some of the wild numbers that have been bandied around. It is nice to know that the Lithgow Medicare office is getting such good attention from Labor members of parliament. I suspect that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) is very happy with that. Looking at the electorate as a whole, I expect that it will be substantially better off because a lot of people who live in small communities in that electorate have no access of filling out at the moment. Mr Lee-Any assurances?",54
25,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"I would have to check. I have no recollection of giving assurances. To be fair, what I have said to people is that there is a lot of speculation around and that I think they will find the end result proves a lot of the speculation wrong. Some people may have taken that to be assurances. The second comment the shadow minister picked up on was that this would not lead to a massive turnaround. In the end, when you calculate the costs of something like this, one has to make judgments. As the shadow minister would know, having been in government, those judgments are not necessarily made by your own department but by departments of finance and treasury. I must say that I have a degree of scepticism about some estimates. Before the election we had these initiatives independently costed by an independent firm of economists. They predicted 40 per cent would be the level of coverage because of these incentives. I never thought that was right. I never used that figure as any sort of public undertaking. Nonetheless, to give the documents credibility, and so it would not suggest that we were fudging the figures, we accepted the figure and cos ted it on that basis. That was very difficult because it ended up costing us more than it might have otherwise. I have always said that we will try to put a floor under the dropout from private health insurance. That will be a hell of a lot better than any minister has done in the last 12 years. My first aim is to stop the dropout and stop the two per cent that is causing Bob Carr, other state premiers and state health ministers so much difficulty. The second part is the one per cent surcharge, which is very important. We can better predict that. That will probably increase the level of insurance by 1Y2 per cent, and that will be a big plus for older people because it will help bolster community rating. The third point the shadow minister raised was whether this was being funded by budget cutsMr Lee-From the public sector.",54
26,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"From the public current sector. The fact is that this stands on its own. There is no hypothecation. Again, as the shadow minister would know from being in government, Treasury is loath to hypothecate anything. This was fully funded prior to the election. VVhat we found after the election was that the undertaking the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) had given that the budget was in surplus was in fact incorrect. very substantial deficit and that had to be met and the government had to live within its means. (Extension of time granted) The last thing I wanted to do was spend the best part of last year trying to find savings in the health portfolio, but that is totally unrelated to these incentives. These incentives were funded prior to the last election. The fourth point the shadow minister raised was on community rating. Community rating is a system whereby people are not discrimiProductivity nated against on the basis of illness or on age. to that. I did see the reports in the Australian newspaper. People should not always believe what they read in newspapers. The department did say in the submission to the Productivity Commission that we would like to look VVe further at lifetime community rating. This something I have said consistently over a period of time. I do not move away from that. I think it is fundamentally unfair that someone who is 65 years of age and has been in private health insurance for 40 years has additional benefit over someone who is years of age and has decided they do not need private health insurance but suddenly out because they might have a need. If the shadow minister wishes to have that debate public I would be very happy because I think it is one in which the public will strongly support the government. That said, no final decision has been made and it is something we are looking at further. It mayor may not eventuate. Again, in trying to look at fairness, I think fairness suggests that those people who have made an effort to look after themselves over a prolonged period should have some benefit. For the Age to say that premiums will go up for older people assumes no change in the membership base, which is not necessarily correct, and also ignores the fact that older people are paying more than they need to now because of just that sort of person. I had someone in my office the other day who is 87 years of age who said, 'I have just taken out private health insurance for the first time. I have not needed it up to now but at 87 I might need it.' That is very nice for him but that is one of the reasons that premiums are There was a so high for everybody else. Similarly, for someone who decides to join a fund just because they want to get pregnant-they only intend to stay in it for a very short period and drop out as soon as they have pulled as much money as possible out of the funds and hence from other contributorsI think is quite wrong. VVe would not be doing our duty to the Australian people if we did not look at that. As I said, no decisions have been made and I have no idea how the Commission is going to respond Again, the shadow minister asked about a five-year wait. I guess I have answered that in a sense because I have no idea what the Productivity Commission will say in the end. put a point of view that it is something is that should be examined further but I would think it would be unlikely, quite frankly; that will happen. Is this is a complete breach? It is absolutely no breach whatsoever. VVe intend to maintain community rating. The only thing no that has undermined community rating in the 65 last decade is the dramatic dropout from private health insurance that the previous take it government presided over. Finally, the shadow minister asked about in the I5-page form. To be honest, I had to take advice on this. I understand that was a very early draft. My department is usually pretty good on these things. Perhaps that was not their greatest day when the I5-page draft came out. I can assure you that the final form will not be 15 pages.",55
27,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I will go through those points in roughly the same order. The opposition is working to try to keep our comments on this legislation to a minimum. I appreciate the answers the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has given, while I might not accept some of the claims and logic behind them. First of all, on the Medicare offices in the electorate of Cal are, the minister said that he would have to check that matter. I would be grateful if he could go one step further and give us an undertaking that he would check that matter and advise us as soon as possible. Minister, the reason I am raising this is in your name, the member for Cal are (Mr Andren) has been claiming that he has an assurance-I do not know whether it is from you or from your office-that there will not be any closures in the electorate of Calare. Knowing that he is a person of good name and a person who in the past I have found to have not made misleading claims, I would be surprised if he would say that without having had some communication with you or your office. I would be surprised if he would make that claim having only spoken to someone in the department. Given that the Labor Party has been beaten up by the member for Calare on this particular issue, if you are not personally aware of any assurance being given, I am a bit intrigued as to what assurances have been given to the honourable member for Calare. I think the people who work at the Medicare offices in that electorate and the many constituents of the honourable member who use the Medicare offices would be grateful to know what the position is. If Cal are is being treated the same as every other electorate and we do not know what the position is and more work has to be done, I will accept that. If an assurance has been given to the honourable member for Calare that there will be no closures in his electorate, I will also accept that, but I would like to know what the real position is. The next point I would briefly like to revisit is the minister's statement that he has always believed that the private health insurance incentive would simply put a floor under the drop-out rate and would stop any further reduction in the number of people with private health insurance. He also used a very King Canutish expression in his summing up of the second reading debate when he said that this legislation was 'the beginning of the turning of the tide'. I am sure the minister hopes that in a year's time he is not King Canute with water up to his knees and approaching his neck if we continue to have people leaving private health insurance. My surprise this afternoon is that I had thought that your own department's documents, released about the time of the budget, that, suggested that by 1 July, as a result of the publicity around the introduction of the $1.7 billion incentive and the introduction of the Medicare levy penalty, you and your department had expected that there would be 35.5 per cent of Australians with private health insurance. Today you are simply saying that you want to stop any further reduction. The most recent figures had us down to 33.2 per cent, so the minister seems to have already moved the line in the sand from 35.5 per cent to 33.2 per cent or lower-a reduction of 2.3 per cent. If the minister has already given up on a further 2.3 per cent of Australians in the period from August to now, then I would like to know the reasons why he is so pessimistic that the centrepiece of the Liberal health policy, which is costing Australians $l. 7 billion, is already suspected of having failed. Minister, if you cannot achieve the target of 35.5 per cent that you set last August, won't you now admit that the Productivity Commission were right when in their interim report they said that we could have reduced hospital waiting lists better if we had spent the money directly on public and private hospitals rather than giving everyone-whether they use the health service system or whether they go to their doctor or hospital-a reduction? I would be grateful if you could address that issue. Finally, on community rating, I would be grateful if the minister, having explained why he believes that his commitment to community rating is not breached by his department's support for the introduction of lifetime community rating, could please point out to me and the House anyone occasion before the last election when he explained that this government was intending to introduce a lifetime community rating system-a system that will mean elderly Australians will have to pay more, a system that will mean they will have to wait longer, and a system that ultimately will undermine our private health care system.

28,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (1.09 p.m.)As to the Lithgow Medicare office, I think it is something that the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) should properly raise with the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren). I do not know what he said. I do not know what undertakings he has given. If there is some difficulty it should be raised with him. Mr Lee-Are you saying that I should raise this with him?",57
29,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,Yes. I do not know what the member for Cal are said. I do not read the local Bathurst newspapers. It is something that should be properly raised with him. Mr Lee-You should visit the office at Lithgow.,57
30,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"If I could get out of Canberra I probably would. Turning to the second point, which I accept is a point of some substance, as to what we expect this to do, my recollection is that the figures were actually related to 1 July 1998 not 1 July 1997 and that we allowed some time for the incentive to take place. I am pretty confident that is correct because the incentives will not have effect on the first day they come in. If the shadow minister is concerned about what the total level will be, clearly he will pass all parts of this bill, including the high income surcharge. If any figure that my department might have predicted is not achieved and the opposition is instrumental in defeating the high income surcharge clearly it will be the opposition's fault that that was not achieved. I have not given up on 2.3 per cent at all, but I have been fairly consistent in trying not to promise something that I may not be able to deliver. I think people are sick of politicians over promising, making overblown promises, and I do not intend to do it. Why am I so pessimistic? I am not pessimistic. It will tum the tide and give us breathing space. I will be very disappointed if the rate of insurance continues to drop from whatever it is on 1 July 1997. I think what we need to do is put a floor under things and that will give us some breathing space. Clearly, there will be more things that need to be done and we are looking forward to the Productivity Commission report to try to help us on that. Why am I so pessimistic? To be honest, I have to say that I am not going to be so silly as to give you something to beat me around the head with every day. I am going to make modest promises and we will see what happens. I have been consistent in doing that since before the last election. If we can't achieve a target? Well, we make predictions on which to fund it, but let us see what happens. It will not be a failure at all if we can give the public health system some breathing space. Bob Carr recognises that. Peter Beattie recognises that. The only people who are not generous enough to realise that are the Labor Party. Why didn't I spend the money directly on public or private hospitals? In the world of pure economists I can understand why the Productivity Commission did that. If the shadow minister wants an honest answer, because we did consider this, it is that we do not trust the opposition. The fact is that we used to have a bed day subsidy and you abolished it. What we are doing here is something that you are going to find very difficult to abolish when you, or should you, become the government in the future. I want to do something that is going to have a longlasting effect on the private health sector and, hence, on the public health sector as well. It will be far too easy for a future Labor government that, on its track record, clearly does not like the private sector to just abolish a bed day subsidy to the private sector in the future as it did in the past. Finally, on the issue of community rating, lifetime community rating is something that I do not think quite honestly detracts at all from the notion that people should not be discriminated against on the basis of illness or age. There are real difficulties in bringing it in; it may not happen. There is a certain degree of sovereign risk if you try to implement something that might have a 40-year time horizon. It would be negligent of us not to look at it. But if we do not look at things like this, in the end community rating dies because if you have young, fit people continuing to drop out, which is the net result of the last 10 years of Labor policies, old people get hit with ever spiralling costs. That is what will destroy community rating. That is what I am trying to fight against.",57
31,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I will be very brief, given the time that the minister has given us this afternoon on this matter. Minister, could you agree to provide the opposition or the House with any occasion in which you foreshadowed your support for lifetime community rating either in speeches or by press release. I am certainly interested in any evidence that the government advised the Australian community that this was on the agenda before the last election because for the life of me I cannot find it. I suspect that before the last election you and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-the then opposition leader-said that you would maintain community rating. All of us thought it was the existing system of community rating. I would be very interested if there is any evidence that you did foreshadow the introduction of this form of lifetime community rating.",58
32,Dr NELSON,PAIRS,"I want to support the amendments put forward by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), in responding to a couple of points that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) had made. We need to remember what the purpose of community rating is. It is to see that high risk people and older people can afford access to the private sector through insurance. The rebates to which this legislation gives effect increase the affordability of private health insurance and thereby assist those people in particular to remain in it, especially as the rebates are targeted at low income people. Another point that needs to be made to the member for Dobell is that, thanks largely to the policies of the previous government in withdrawing its support for the reinsurance pool and bed day subsidy and in forcing the funds to pay a quarter of the Medicare benefit schedule fee, there has been a decline in private health insurance in the last four years, since the time when Graham Richardson, at the time the participation rate was at 39.5 per cent, said that we needed to move fairly urgently. The government and the minister would be irresponsible in not looking at the regulatory environment as well as the cost of the premiums, which are in effect of that regulatory environment. So I think any responsible government and any responsible minister would quite reasonably look at, within the confines of community rating, some initiatives which increase the affordability of private health insurance. The minister has said that no decision has been made on this, but I must say that, if you can offer a package which makes it quite attractive for 20-year-old people to come into private health insurance and remain in it for a lifetime, that clearly helps defray the costs for higher risk individuals who are struggling to maintain it. It also ought to be remembered that under the previous government Medibank Private, for example, was offering its select and save package so that young people could buy packages that did not include coverage for hip replacements, cardiac bypass surgery and even mental illness. That, of course, is very much pushing community rating to the edges. So I think the member for Dobell, if he is sincere, as I am sure he is, in wanting to see that people do maintain their private health insurance and increase coverage, should remember that the government needs to reasonably look at changes in regulation which increase affordability. The minister mentioned, for example, people buying private health insurance because they are pregnant. Today in the Melbourne Herald-Sun is a story of a family who took out private health insurance three months before the lady in question became pregnant because she was intending to become pregnant, and now they have dropped their private health insurance. Whilst they had every right to do that under the present legislation, the people who have suffered from that are the people, as the minister has said, who have been in private health insurance for 40 or even 50 years, who have rarely had any claims at all and who now are in a high risk category. These people are now having to face escalating premiums because of what are known as hit and run contributors. The other point I would like to make to the member for Dobell is that the so-called reductions in public hospital funding over the forward estimates relate largely to cost shifting initiatives. The minister, unlike his predecessor, now on the other side, has had the courage to actually take the cost shifting issue on. All the previous minister wanted to do was to get the AFP and the Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue doctors who were involved in cost shifting. The minister has now removed from public hospital funding what we conservatively estimate will be taken out in the form of cost shifting and has implemented initiatives to recover that money. These things are all very sensible, and I think the opposition ought simply to be supporting this legislation and doing what it reasonably can in the interests of the community to see that we have a private health insurance system that is sustainable, and that is what the minister is doing.",58
33,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"Just picking up on a couple of points the minister made earlier, I am happy to accept in good faith the minister's assurance that the target date for 35.5 per cent was 1 July 1998. I will hold him to that, rather than 1 July 1997. I think it is fair enough, Minister, that we seek to have some measure of the performance of this initiative, given that it is going to cost the taxpayer $1.7 billion. If the whole aim of this incentive is to allegedly take pressure off public hospitals and it is costing the community $1.7 billion, then if the minister cannot achieve the targets he is setting himself it will be pretty clear that this initiative has failed. As not only the Industry Commission but also the AMA and others have said, and I have argued, perhaps the government should have given greater consideration to spending this massive sum of money directly on reducing hospital waiting lists. So, Minister, I am prepared to accept your assurance that it is 1 July 1998. The last question that I would like to put in consideration of this bill is that this morning's Herald-Sun has the minister saying that the government will be retaining this initiative indefinitely into the future. The minister alluded to this in his statement earlier, saying that he wanted to lock this legislation in for future governments. I hope that is not too far away but he said 'for future governments'. I would just like the minister to confirm that the funding for this will appear in forward estimates for the indefinite future, given that the government remains committed to funding this not just for three years, as previously maintained, but for the indefinite future.",59
34,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (1.20 p.m.)I will address the last question first. I had actually always just assumed that it was in the forward estimates. I checked with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) yesterday and he said that yes, it is in the forward estimates. We have never maintained that it just for three years. I can only give you the Minister for Finance's assurances. I must say I was a bit worried, too, when someone put that question to me, so I was pretty quick to check. What is the measure of success of this? The measure of success is that I can do what no other health minister has done for 12 years: stop the dropout. That is a very clear measure of success. Yes, it is a large amount of money but as much as anything it is also a measure of equity. I am deeply concerned that people who have been attempting to look after their own health care and to make some contribution to their own health care have had such a rough time for the last 10 years, and this measure is an equity one. This measure is a measure to help them. This measure is a measure to help some of the 700,000-odd people on incomes of under $20,000 who have private health insurance and who are making great sacrifices to keep it. Yes, it is designed to put a floor under the dropout from private health insurance and it is also designed as a simple equity measure in that this government has different priorities from the previous one. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Motion (by Dr Wooldridge)-by leaveproposed: That the bill be now read a third time.",59
35,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"Just very briefly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition remains disturbed that this $1.7 billion is being funded by cutbacks in the public hospital system, increases in the cost of pharmaceuticals for ordinary Australians and the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. We also have grave reservations about whether we will achieve as good a result by subsidising private health insurance as we would have had if we had spent this money directly. The opposition does not believe that we should punish the members of private health funds because of the government's errors and therefore we will not be seeking to oppose the bill.

(4) If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the average total weekly earnings, then, for the purposes of the application of sections SB, SC, SD, SE, SF and SG after the change took place or takes place, regard shall be had only to numbers published in terms of the new reference base. These amendments seek to index the income thresholds at which the new Medicare levy will be applicable, by using the total average weekly earnings index. We think that is most appropriate, given that we are dealing with income limits. The concern that the opposition continues to have about this particular measure is that the money the government raises from this bill will not be redirected into public hospitals, as we requested. We also remain very suspicious about whether this legislation seeks to impose the additional Medicare levy at an income level of $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for families if people do not have private health insurance. Our concern is that there is no reason in the world why this government will not come back in the coming budget and seek to lower the figures to $40,000 for individuals and $80,000 for families, and in the following budget lower it again to $30,000 for individuals and $60,000 for families. We believe that if the government were to follow such a strategy it would be mirroring the efforts of the government in the Fraser-Howard years, which sought to force people into private health insurance. By indexing these measures we will be doing all we can to keep the government honest on these issues. Amendments negati ved. Bill agreed to.

39,Mr ROCHER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In my speech on the second reading I did address some remarks to this then anticipated amendment and I again express my gratitude to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) for giving me some advance knowledge of it. My interest embraces two particular concerns. The first is that, by raising the threshold from $1,000 to $1,500 before which subsequent expenditure over that threshold may then attract a 20 per cent tax rebate, the government has in fact invoked an increase of some 50 per cent. That of itself is remarkable. But, more importantly, I am concerned for those not so well off in our community who under present arrangements have to spend more than $1,000 after Medicare refunds and even private health insurance refunds in any one year. For someone battling, to have to dig into their pockets to meet expenditure in excess of $1,000 at present, or $1,500 as it is to be, they have really had a bad year, and to be deprived of some small relief by way of the 20 per cent tax rebate for up to $500 is going to make that bad year just a little bit worse. I wonder whether on equity grounds it is fair. I suppose if it were means testedheaven forbid, given the complexity of that it might satisfy my concerns, but there will be people not so well off in the community who will have to meet, without tax relief, expenditure of up to $500 more, and that is to be regretted. The second part of my interest in this proposed amendment concerns matters of fact. In the supplementary explanatory memorandum we are told that the effect of this measure will be to benefit the revenue by some $45 million to $50 million in a full year. My simple arithmetic approach suggests that, given that 20 per cent of $500-the amount of the increase-is $100 and a total take of somewhere between $45 million and $50 million is expected, the cost impact estimate anticipates that there will be some 450,000 to 500,000 Australians affected by this measure. I might have missed some basic fact and there might be some other matters come into play, hence my reason for raising it at this time. If indeed the results of my simple arithmetic are all there is to this matter and the cost impact benefit to revenue is estimated at $45 million to $50 million in a full year, it is an amazing statIstIC. I simply find it very difficult to believe that 450,000 to 500,000 people might be affected. Hence, as I say, my reason for raising the matter. I would welcome any explanation the minister might have at hand. I did foreshadow it in my speech on the second reading and I am sure the advisers have had a chance to check it out.",63
40,Mr LEE,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Just for the record, in the second reading debate, I and a number of my Labor colleagues also raised questions about the unfairness of raising this threshold for people who have to purchase expensive medications and I gave an example of an elderly constituent in my own electorate. This is the government's second attempt to roll this one through but we remain totally opposed to it for the same reasons that were outlined by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher).",64
41,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (1.46 p.m.)In response to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I am advised that the difficulty we have with this is that there is a 30 per cent growth rate in the number of people claiming the expense and there is a 50 per cent growth in the size of claims, although that obviously does not affect the calculations because we are working off a base amount. For the year 1995-96 there have been 260,000 claims so far and not all tax returns have been lodged yet for 1995-96. We have to make an estimate for the first full year, which is 1997-98, which means extrapolating two years forward on 1995-96 figures and I am advised that that is how the revenue estimate of $45 million was achieved. This is like many things and I would have preferred not to have done it. It was something that the government has to consider in light of having to meet a revenue shortfall that we were not expecting. We had been working on the word of the then Minister for Finance given before the last election.",64
42,Mr ROCHER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"If that figure is based on an expectation of 450,000 individual claims-or even as many as 500,000 claims-I think it is extravagant indeed. In my speech on the second reading I did, in the light of the mid-year review of the Commonwealth's fiscal condition, mention my lack of confidence in the estimates that we are getting in explanatory memoranda that accompany legislation in this place. I mentioned the fact that there is no measure of the accuracy of that. In other words, it comes before the House and nothing more is heard of the cost estimates. I think they have been very generous indeed, on the information that the minister has been able to provide, in extending the prospect of 260,000 in the current year to perhaps 300,000-because all the claims are not in-to 450,000 or 500,000 souls in two years time. It demonstrates my concern about the efficacy of cost impact statements that accompany all legislation and in the light of a major blooper by the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury being unable to have included in the budget figures accurate estimates of company tax when the budget was drawn up last year. My concern arises out of a demonstrated mistake of billions of dollars in the budget papers and the fact that the cost estimates in explanatory memoranda are not tested by way of subsequent examination. Therefore, they can be quite meaningless. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Dr Wooldridge)-by leave-read a third time.

43,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996. In doing so I indicate at the outset that at the conclusion of my speech I will move a second reading amendment. This bill is to establish a new agency, an agency that amalgamates the former Department of Social Security network of offices with some-although I might stress only some-of the functions historically carried out by the Commonwealth Employment Service. Labor colleagues who follow me in this debate will deal with various aspects of the proposed agency's operations, including the delivery of child-care services and the implications for the future delivery of Medicare services. I will focus on the effects of the proposed bill on the unemployed and on their prospects for finding work. Let me make it clear at the outset that the Labor Party is not opposed to the concept of a one-stop shop; if anything, it is concerned about the nature of the one-stop shop. There is nothing wrong in principle with combining the resources of current Social Security offices with the resources of the Commonwealth Employment Service offices. That network of CES offices spread around Australia is especially important in areas of high unemployment, both in metropolitan and regional Australia. This is the direction in which the Labor government, I might say, was moving. We were moving that way for one important reason-to make it simpler for the unemployed to obtain both jobsearch assistance and benefit payments at one location. If anything, it was about making it easier for people who were unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, to access decent services at minimal expense, which is in stark contrast to the end result of the current government proposals, both in respect to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill and the employment services bills, which will come on for debate in this session of parliament. Unfortunately, what we intended to do in considering the concept of a one-stop shop is not what is going to happen as a result of the legislation now before the House for consideration. I suggest to the House that the intent this bill is to gut the comprehensive services of the Commonwealth Employment Service. This bill is one of a series of bills whereby vital job services are to be sold off to private sector providers for profit. We are going back to the era of fee charging employment agencies. Under this legislation, the new agency will only provide very basic registration, assessment, referral and self-help services to job seekers. Other essential employment assistance, previously universally or freely available from the CES, will not be provided by the new agency. Instead, it will be limited to particular classes of job seekers. This bill to form the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency may, in itself, seem harmless, but you have to tear the tinsel away and have a look at the actual basis of the bill and its intent. That is what we ought to be considering in this debate. When it is understood as an integral part of a wider legislative program-and this bill should be considered in association with the employment services bills-it is obvious that the intent of the government is to make major cuts in public sector resources for the poorest, most needy and vulnerable in our community. The other parts of the program, the reform of the employment services bills, are now before the Senate and the opposition. We will be pursuing amendments to those bills. The agency is also likely to be inadequately staffed, given the revelations made during last year's Senate estimates hearings of extensive hidden job cuts, and this is despite the fact that the current government gave promises prior to the last election-unfortunately, they were not core promises-not to sack thousands upon thousands of public servants. However, I suppose you have to understand that employment is not a priority of this government. It has clearly been established as a result of the budget process that not only is it not a priority of this government, they do not have practical solutions aimed at getting the long term unemployed back to work or into real jobs. There are plans to have 5,000 fewer staff in the new network of offices. There will be 5,000 fewer staff in the new agency. That of represents a substantial setback on the employment front, especially in regional Australia. That is where the biggest losers are, in non-metropolitan Australia. One should not be surprised because soon after the federal election this government said that it did not have a constitutional responsibility for regional Australia. What follows from that is not only a lack of industry policy aimed at trying to establish a framework for investment in regional Australia to assist in job growth, also a comprehensive program to slash government employment in regional Australia. The problem for the government is that does not understand the multiplier effect resulting from taking government jobs out of regional Australia. The reality is that for every government job you take out of regionobligations. al Australia, you also have an impact on the capacity to provide for private sector jobs regional Australia. No-one should be fooled by the idea that their CES is going to be adequately replaced by this new, so-called Commonwealth Sercitizens vices Delivery Agency. The formation of this agency has been driven not by a desire to improve delivery of services, ment would have the Australian community believe, it has been motivated instead by decision to impose the burden of budget cuts on those whom the Howard government agency regards as politically unimportant, people the community who need assistance, especialin ly the long term unemployed. The long unemployed, as a result of government cuts in the last budget, have been denied valuable labour market assistance. I remind the House that the cuts in labour market expenditure amounted to $1.8 billion over a period of four years. Under pressure, the government's solution now is work for the dole. This government does not have decent labour market programs aimed at establishing a capacity to benefit through getting an opportunity to engage in proper work arrangepublic ments which then bring back the discipline work, and neither does it have decent training programs which ensure that the unemployed are job ready. I know members of the government are concerned about being exposed with respect to these matters. The formation of this agency has been driven by their desire to walk from their responsibility to assist Australia, especially those in the community who need decent assistance with respect to labour market opportunities. There are also concerns from the Labor Party's point of view that agency employees in the future will not have the same condition tions and rights as other public service embut ployees. Not only will they not have a sense of job security in the new agency, they will also be denied the normal wages and condiit tions of employment that apply to Australian government employees. I also suggest in passing that the nature of the legislation could place Australia in breach of its international The bill is currently being looked at by the in Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee which is due to report in mid-March. Already this committee has received numerous submissions from concerned Australian and community organisations, groups that are concerned about the implications of the bill, especially for the needy in the Ausas the governtralian community. Among the issues being considered by the a Senate committee is whether the agency's resources are adequate to meet the need for services. That is a fair question bein cause the government has clearly been shown recent times to make policy on the run. term The work for the dole announcement, an endeavour to cover up political problems for the government, is an example of policy making on the run. Another issue is the arrangement for the transfer of ongoing employment of former CES and Department of Social Security staff. There are also concerns about the fairness and equity of employment conditions for new staff. My second reading amendment expresses concern about the potential erosion of service terms and conditions through of the agency employing staff under terms and conditions that are different to those specified in the Public Service Act.",64

46,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, can you confirm that the government of Papua New Guinea has diverted $30 million from the partial float of Orogen Minerals Ltd to conceal its foreign mercenary expenditure from Australia, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund? What are the implications of this financial subterfuge for PNG's relations with the World Bank, which only last month released a $32 million loan to PNG? What representations have you made to PNG's foreign minister, to the Minister for Finance and to Prime Minister Chan concerning the funding of their so-called 'Bougainville Initiative'? Finally, Minister, do you consider the PNG government has acted honestly and in good faith in respect of this matter; and what further measures will you now take to dissuade Sir Julius Chan from continuing with his outrageous introduction of foreign mercenaries into the South Pacific?",67
47,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As far as the funding issue is concerned, I cannot say anything more to the House than I said the other daythat we are continuing to investigate these stories, and we have no definitive answer to our investigations at this stage. Really, that all I can say on that front. But I wonder whether I could use this opportunity to make a couple of other points, which are certainly relevant to the general tenor of the question. As the House knows, the Prime Minister and I have repeatedly expressed our deep concern over these reports that the Papua New Guinea government is considering renewed military operations on Bougainville, including the possible use of mercenaries. We have made our position, I think, as I said yesterday, crystal clear. During the course of today I have done three things. First, this morning I called into my office the Papua New Guinea High Commissioner to make clear our concerns again and to seek, urgently, clarification from the Papua New Guinea government of the remarks made by Prime Minister Chan yesterday, including the following: the position of the Papua New Guinea government on the potential involvement of foreign personnel in combat; whether the decision to renew a military offensive is consistent with the PNG government's recent decision to renew the mandate of the Bougainville transitional government and develop a comprehensive peace plan; and also the sources of funding for the employment of the mercenaries. I put all of those questions to the Papua New Guinea High Commissioner, and he has undertaken to get me answers after consultation with Port Moresby. The second thing I have done today is instruct my department to contact immediately other concerned governments-including New Zealand, the United States and Britain-to ask them to raise these very same issues with the Papua New Guinea government. I note that the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, has now written to Sir Julius Chan this week expressing his very real concerns about the developments. Thirdly, I reiterate my call of last week to the BRA to cease all military activity on Bougainville, and to release immediately the hostages being held in south Bougainville as a sign of their willingness to work towards a peaceful settlement. We will obviously continue to monitor developments closely, and we will decide on is possible future action in the light of Papua New Guinea's response to these questions. Our actions will take into account the full range of Australia's national interests. Immunisation",67
48,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Could the minister inform the House what the response has been to the government's new immunise Australia strategy released yesterday? What will community support for the strategy mean for an Australian child born from I January 1998 onwards?,67
49,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I am very heartened by the strong support that has come for the Immunise Australia proposal that the government announced yesterday. We have had support broadly across the community and from the medical profession. In fact, the AMA put out a very positive press release. We are not used to getting these sorts of press releases. In fact, my staff rang them up and said, This is a surprise,' and they said, 'Don't worry, you're only going to get one good one this year.' I must say though that there is small ill informed comment that is disappointing to see that I think should be addressed. The head of the Women's Economic Think Tank, Ms Eva Cox, said that this would hurt the poor: People with low literacy rates who are scared of authority, not very good at filling in forms and somewhat scattered and disorganised will miss This is a particularly ill-informed comment that shows, first of all, that Ms Cox does not have any understanding of how the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register works and does not have any understanding of the full proposal. In government you never expect a free kick and you never expect to be free of criticism, but you would hope occasionally that those people who are critical are actually well informed rather than not well informed at all. There is no logical argument that can be sustained whatsoever that a poor child with whooping cough and a maternity allowance is somehow better off than a poor child without whooping cough whose parents are getting a split maternity allowance. The simple fact is that, if you look at vaccine preventable illnesses last year-the 4,000 cases of whooping cough, the 2,500 cases of rubella, the 500 cases of measles-the demographic analysis shows clearly that it is poor families who, by and large, are being overwhelmingly hit with vaccine preventable illnesses. We have a measles epidemic in part of Sydney each year. It is not happening in the eastern suburbs and it is not happening on the North Shore; it is happening in the western suburbs of Sydney. Overwhelmingly, our negligence has led to poor families sharing a disproportionate burden of preventable illness and it is poor families who will overwhelmingly benefit from these initiatives. Further, I should say that forms are not a major problem because we have the capacity to match data between the Australian childhood immunisation register and the Department of Social Security. This is the easiest way to have it done. If that is the case, a cheque will simply be sent in the mail when the Australian Childhood Immunisation register shows that the immunisation milestones have been met. People have the right to opt out of this. If they do so, then it will be up to them. If someone is concerned that they may be disorganised or that there is a low level of literacy, it can be done automatically with no detriment whatsoever if the person is poor. The poorest Australians, those who live in out. remote Aboriginal communities, already have a high rate of immunisation. In Broome there is close to 100 per cent immunisation of Aboriginal children because the Broome Aboriginal Medical Service for some years has been doing largely what this proposal envisages. Poor families sec doctors more frequently than wealthier families. Given that we are trying to make GPs play the central role in this, by using the seven or so occasions on average every year that they see children under six it will be up to the general practitioner to ensure that this works. Far from giving money to general practitioners at the expense of poor people, what we are doing is reallocating existing general practice money so we will reward those GPs who are doing what the community believes they should be doing and penalise those GPs who take no long-term interest in the people they see. Hopefully, that will be a very small proportion. Finally, in calculating the cost of these proposals, we have worked on the basis that everyone will get it. We have not made allowances for savings because even a small percentage of people will opt out. As I said yesterday, there are some savings because of the time factor in moving payments from one year to another. Those savings will be used to try to prevent the measles outbreak that is predicted to come in two years time. NA",68

51,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware of the scathing attack from the Victorian Liberal minister for industry, Mr Birrell, who said the Howard government's cuts to research and development were 'plain destructive' to science, engineering and technology? Minister, is it not a fact that your assault on Australia's high technology manufacturing has now been criticised by all industry groups and by a large number of your state colleagues? In light of this criticism, will the government be reversing its $2 billion job destroying R&D cuts?",69
52,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am surprised once again that the member for Hotham is back on one of his old hobbyhorses. Mr Crean-What! Look at the industry and the industries that you have knocked off.,69
53,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, this is one of the areas where your mates and the rorts were. Mr Crean-Look at what you have done to the industry.",69
54,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are still a bit touchy about it. You did not learn much over Christmas. Mr Crean-You have learnt nothing in 40 years.,69
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham! You have asked your question.,69
56,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has an excellent record in R&D. We offer the 125 per cent tax concession to all profitable companies, which is widely used. On top of that we have kicked off the Start program, which is $520 million over four years to all non-profit companies to participate in. The demand for those grants has been quite enormous and the IR&D Board is looking at assessing those applications now. It is worth noting that the basis of assessment is not the old Labor Party one where the rorts were, the financial schemes. This one is based on the worth of the R&D itself. That is different and, because of that, there is very great support for it. As far as the Victorian minister is concerned, if he wants to add it to, I am only too happy. The federal government right now spends $3.5 billion on research and development. It is not a bad contribution; we are certainly looking after it. If the Victorians want to contribute more to it, I welcome it. Taxation Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen the article on page 11 of today's Daily Telegraph concerning pay-as-you-earn wage earners carrying the tax burden while smart accountants find tax loopholes for their rich clients? Could the Treasurer inform the House of what the government is doing to make the tax system fairer for ordinary Australians, especially the battlers in Lindsay?",69
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for the question. There is probably nobody who better represents the battlers in this parliament than the member for Lindsay. The people of Lindsay elected her not only once but twice last year to represent them in this parliament. As the member for Lindsay points out, if we as a government want to maintain a decent system of social security and a decent system of health, it is necessary for this government to maintain a decent revenue base in order to pay for it. This government is going to make sure that the poor and the needy are looked after through the social security and the health systems. This government is going to make sure that a fair share of tax is paid by both high income earners and low income earners. This has been a government that has been active in ensuring that rorts, which otherwise would have punched large holes in the taxation system, have been attended to. In the most recent budget, I announced measures to cut down on the generosity of luxury car leasing, to cut down on tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore, to cut down on withholding tax avoidance and to cut down on eligible finance shares. This was the government that attacked a widespread avoidance mechanism from sales tax in relation to computer sales. As the minister for industry just said, this was the government that had the courage to tax R&D syndication, which had become one of the great rort mechanisms of high income earners who wanted to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Mr Kelvin Thomson-A $3 billion blowout.",69
58,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We hear the Labor Party interjecting-interjecting in favour of R&D syndicates. Let me ask this question: how many of the electors of Hotham were in R&D syndicates? When they come to see you in your electoral office, what do you do? Do you check them into a syndicate? 'You're the battlers of Oakleigh. Let me put you into a syndicate,' he says to them. 'Let me minimise your taxation.' We had the courage to close it down. Mr Crean-No, you didn't.",70
59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We did not close it down? You were up a moment ago complaining that we did. We had the courage to close it down, and we did. In relation to infrastructure borrowings, I made clear, there were many worthwhile infrastructure projects. In relation to structure projects, smart planning had opened this up as a major tax minimisation scheme. Mr Speaker, you will not hear me say this very often, but I saw Ken Davidson write in the Age in support of the measure we took in relation to infrastructure borrowings. He said that infrastructure borrowings had the potential to be bigger than the bottom of the harbour. Who closed it down? It was the coalition. When we did close it down, we got immediate support-and I welcome it-from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. But it was not a unanimous view. Who do you think was out on the Sunday complaining about infrastructure borrowings? It was the parliamentary voice of the tax rort industry: the member for Hotham. He was out on the Sunday saying what a terrible thing it was to close down infrastructure borrowings. It was very significant that he was out on the Sunday. Do you know why? They have his at-home phone number. They can ring him at home on the weekend and say, 'Simon, it's about time we got you out there on infrastructure borrowings. ' Ken Davidson said that it had the potential to be the biggest hole in the tax system since the bottom of the harbour. This government is determined to ensure that high income earners and low incomes earners pay their fair share of tax. That is designed to help the battlers of Lindsay and to give them a fair go. Research and Development",70
60,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed again to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer him to the Prime Minister's promise that areas cut heavily last year will be quarantined from cuts this year in the budget. Does the minister also stand by his statement, 'Last time, industry made a significant contribution towards the budget deficit,' and, 'This time. I think it is fair to say that cuts ... have gone far enough'? In light as of these comments, Minister, will you guarantee that there will be no further cuts to indusinfra- try assistance in this year's budget?",70
61,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The business community was one of the leaders in calling for the financial consolidation, which took place in the last budget. A contribution was made from the industry department in relation to that. In relation to the next budget, that will not be speculated on. Workplace Relations",70
62,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What action is the government taking to put in place the new Australian workplace agreements? What are the benefits of this new approach compared with the old system?,71
63,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The government is in the process of implementing the structure for the new workplace agreements, known as AWAs. I am pleased to inform the House that we are basically on time, on schedule, in accordance with that timetable which we were working to last year. On 12 March the legislative and regulatory framework for Australian workplace agreements will be in place. There is a lot of activity, as these are new agreements, amongst various organisations to give people good information about them. The department is actively involved in seminars, as is the Employment Advocate. The NFF have got out, or are putting out, 120,000 brochures. The NBA is running an education campaign. In the public sector, one of the unions, APESMA, is looking at AWAs. Steve Harrison from the AWU has said you would have to be an ostrich not to be interested in the service that a union could provide its members through AWAs. Even the office of the member for Perth-and I must say I was very pleased to get a letter from his officewas seeking information about workplace agreements for a constituent. This is, of course, to be welcomed. The Australian workplace agreement is a new form of agreement. It is to be contrasted-and I do-with others who are claiming to have introduced new things into Australia's public life. I do warn honourable members against mistaking mere novelty for actual change. For example, I will contrast the substantially new and different and innovative Australian workplace agreements with the situation of the ACTU branch of the ALP, which has applied to change its name to the 'New Labor Party'. I can understand why it is that they might want to distance themselves from the last 13 years. Whilst it is true that seems to be a change to reflect the change that the Labor Party in the UK made, there is quite an interesting difference. In the UK they changed their name after 17 years in the wilderness, whereas in Australia they seem to be anticipating 17 years in the wilderness and are proposing to change it now. It would be fair enough to then ask: what of this craving for newness in the Labor Party and its impact on members of the ALP? Is it just a case of old wine in new bottles? I am very worried about this attempt to change their spots and what it might mean for the honourable leopards opposite. Do we have a new shadow minister for the environment and the arts? I know it is the same person but, if she is new, does she remember what the old member for Fremantle was like? More to the pointMr Adams- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order goes to relevance. The question was asked in relation to workplace agreements. The answer has nothing to do with workplace agreements. I ask you to bring the minister into line.",71

The reality is that they provide people with a new option within the industrial relations system to take up the opportunities of the new act. They will ultimately give force and effect to our policy commitment, which is to give people the opportunity to strike deals which, through better productivihave ty, give them the opportunity of higher pay.

76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the scathing attack by the West Australian Liberal Attorney-General, Mr Foss, on last night's 7.30 Report concerning the legal aid debacle when he said there was 'a crisis in legal aid' which was-I ask him whether he has heard this quote-'very serious'? He went on to say: In terms of legal aid, it will make a disaster. The whole reason why the Commonwealth needs to be concerned is their responsibilities under the constitution for those people who are on social servicesthe pensioners, the ex-servicemen, the immigrants and the Aboriginals. I want the public to understand that it is going to affect ordinary people on low incomes, and they have got to tell the Prime Minister that it is unfair. Isn't it the case that your handling of the legal aid row is so bad that even your state Liberal Party colleagues, including Mr Foss, Mr Griffin, Mr Humphries and Mrs Wade, have become very critical of your performance?

82,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm press reports that Canada will take action in the World Trade Organisation to challenge But Australia's ban on imports of salmon? What is Australia's response to any such challenge? Can the Deputy Prime Minister advise of progress on other issues in the Australiacanned Canada trade relationship, particularly Canada's recent decision to cut the quota of Australian beef?",73
83,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am advised that Canada is still examining the risk analysis report on salmon released by the Australian government last year-by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. As of yesterday, Canada had not yet decided whether to challenge our decision in the World Trade Organisation. Let me comment, however, that while any such challenge is a matter for Canada and within its prerogative, the government considers that it has acted quite properly in formulating its decision on this matter. Ingallery deed, we are confident that the import risk analysis undertaken by Australia is compreincluding hensive, science based and authoritative. fully consistent with our rights and obligations under the WTO and, in particular, the agreement on the use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. I might add that Australia already imports some $25 million plus cooked salmon product from Canada, a 40 per cent increase year on year. That ought to be taken note of. I can assure the House that, if Canada does nevertheless challenge the decision in the WTO, this government will defend that decision vigorously. In respect of other issues, I can I have made representations to Mr Art Eggleton, Canada's Minister for International Trade, to strongly object to his decision to unilaterally cut the 1997 quota for Australian beef to 35,000 tonnes. This decision was, I said last week, very unexpected, unjustified and particularly regrettable given the long battle we fought to establish the quota. the decision comes well into the marketing year. Our industry has clearly indicated dissatisfaction with the decision, and I am considering all options for future action, including raising the matter in the WTO. I will be working to achieve an outcome which reflects our legitimate interest in this market. these are not the only issues within this trade relationship requiring our attention. Let me just say for our part I am dissatisfied with the treatment received by our exports of fruit to Canada and, indeed, with the way in which the Canada-Australia trade agreement, Canata, over the last few years has become so heavily slanted to Canada's benefit. What I want to stress is that, as unhelpful as the decision on beef is, I am committed to working through all the problems in the trade relationship to protect Australia's interests and restore the bilateral relationship to good health.

I ask: has the minister heard reports suggesting that in recent months Australia has become a less attractive destination for students and tourists from the Asian region? Can the minister advise the House whether there is any truth in these reports?,74
88,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the member for MCPherson for his question. I am aware of reports and suggestions that in the previous six months there may have been a fall in the demand for student and tourist visas, these reports having been encouraged by negative comments, particularly in the media, about Australia that could have discouraged tourists and students from coming here. It is important to have the factual information and I want to put that before the House now. Of the 11 countries surveyed in the period from November last year to January this year visitor visa grants are higher for the same period over the previous year by 9 per cent overall. Nine of the 11 countries had an increase and those included India which was up 18 per cent, Indonesia 25 per cent, Malaysia 48 per cent, the Philippines 38 per cent and the People's Republic of China 46 per cent. Only Japan and Taiwan over the period reported a small decline compared with the same period last year. The range of factors that have led to the slowing of growth in the Japanese market are believed to include the relative cost of airfares to Australia, aggressive marking in Japan by other nations, a strong Australian dollar and the shortage of budget to medium-priced accommodation. The situation in relation to student visas is very similar. The visa grants for students are up by over 10 per cent over the same period for the same countries. Hong Kong was up by 11 per cent, India 10 per cent, Indonesia 20 per cent, Japan 6 per cent, Korea 30 per cent and Malaysia 8 per cent. These numbers highlight that people in the countries of Asia are fully aware of Australia's commitment to a non-discriminatory approach on the basis of race, religion, colour and country of origin. They are very much aware that Australia is a tolerant nation that welcomes visitors and students from all other countries. NA",74
89,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I also advise the House that this afternoon we have in the gallery the Cabinet Secretary of the Victorian Parliament, the Honourable Rosemary Varty. A very warm welcome to you. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Regional Development",74
90,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Does the Deputy Prime Minister recall the Western Australian Deputy Premier, Mr Hendy Cowan, last year in a reference to EMDG and DIFF expressing concerns about the need for the Commonwealth government to rethink some of the programs it had decided to axe? Have you had a conversation with Hendy about that lately and, if so, did it cover his scathing attack on you today about the way in which you have lost direction, your need to get back to bread and butter issues and your failure to support industry in regional Australia?",74
91,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know how difficult it is for the junior shadow minister for trade from that dead hole position on the front bench to get a question, so I congratulate him on getting a question on this occasion. Can I say two things? Bashing the feds is the oldest game in the political lexicon. Secondly, when I think of Hendy Cowan I also think of Hendy Cowan and Richard Court and their legacy is a whole lot better than the legacy left to Western Australian and Australia by former premiers Bourke, Dowding and Lawrence.",74

93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Order! Members on my right and left. The House is increasingly disorderly. The member for Corio and the member for Lyons! Indigenous Sportspeople,74
94,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Can the minister advise the House how many indigenous sports people are currently holders of an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship. In the lead-up to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games can the minister also advise the House as to any initiatives this government has taken to support our talented sports people and ensure the greatest possible representation by talented indigenous people in our Olympic and other national teams?",74
95,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Longman for his question. It is with some pleasure that I can reportMr Crean-VVhat about the netballers and the support they need?,75
96,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member for Hotham wants to ask a question about netball, why does he not get up and ask a question? VVe have not had a question that can be described as in any way decent from him for a long time. I am pleased on behalf of the government to indicate that we have taken initiatives to support indigenous sport. The Australian Institute of Sport currently has 7 indigenous Australians on scholarship in five different sports. They include Patrick Johnson, Nova Peris and Kyle Vander-Kuyp. Mr Crean-Page one!",75
97,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,VVhy doesn't the member for Hotham just listen? You are just a little motormouth.,75
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair.,75
99,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"VVe ought to send you out to the Australian Institute of Sport, stick you on the track and burn off your energy. You would probably run backwards because that is what you are doing now. The government is to provide indigenous athletes with every possible opportunity. VVe established the indigenous sports program a little while ago, which many members would be aware of. The ISP is the result of a task force which I set up late last year with the assistance of the minister for Aboriginal affairs. The task force was chaired by Yvonne Cawley, who would be well known to many of you, and was tasked with the advice to government about how better we might coordinate our indigenous sports programs. The result was that the government accepted the proposals, and all the indigenous sports programs within ATSIC and the Australian Sports Commission have been combined. The programs are now going forward with the assistance of the new ATSIC Commissioner, Mr Jim VVright, and also the ASC. The government, this financial year, have committed $4 million for the development of these programs, which includes the mentoring scheme, the olympic training centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and which is done in conjunction with the Australian Olympic Committee and the Sydney organising committee. I formally launched the program and scholarships today. The olympic training centre provides assistance to 22 indigenous sports people who are rated highly likely to represent Australia at the 2000 Olympic Games. Mr Adams-Just table it, table it!",75
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Lyons!,75
101,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These athletes already compete at elite levels. There is a total of 115 scholarships to a value of $2,000 each to young sports people between the ages of 12 to 21 who are currently competing at national level. Today's launch also saw the presence of two greats in indigenous sport, Lionel Rose and Tony Mundine. These gentlemen are going to act as ambassadors for the indigenous sports program and go right around Australia encouraging young Aboriginals to be involved in developing their sporting talents. Yvonne Cawley was also present today. Their achievements have been outstanding and they serve as an excellent role model to young indigenous Australians. They have certainly, in their efforts, enriched Australia's sporting heritage. It is interesting to reflect on the words of Yvonne Cawley today. I would like to repeat some of those words because I think they are particularly pertinent-despite the interjections from everyone, particularly the member for Hotham. You might reflect on this for half a moment in the spirit of what has been achieved over the last several months in the development of this program. She said today, 'I would like to thank the government for not only helping these young people in fulfilling their dreams through life but also helping them continue their spiritual journey through life.' She reflected on the great assistance that she had received in being involved so prominently in sport in this nation. Small Business",75
102,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Has he seen the comments reported this morning from Dr John Marsden, the economic adviser to the Yellow Pages Small Business Index, that the key finding in the latest survey was that, netting out those for and against, there was a drop in net support for government policies from 36 per cent in May last year to minus two per cent this month and that this represented a 'phenomenal loss of support for the Federal Government's policies and that cannot be denied'? Does the Prime Minister still deny that loss of support? How can he pretend that the Yellow Pages survey is anything else than a massive vote of no confidence from the small business sector that he has repeatedly claimed as his political heartland?",76
103,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Pollyanna Prime Minister!,76
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison!,76
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for that question. It enables me to say a couple of things to and about the small business community of Australia. The first thing that I will say is that there are many reasons why the small business community of Australia is yet to derive some of the favourable benefits of current economic conditions compared with other sectors in the economy. I certainly won't be making the mistake of saying to the small business men and women of Australia things like, 'What are you going on about?' I won't be saying to the small business men and women of Australia, 'I mean, this is as good as it ever gets.' I won't be adopting the truculent out-of-touch, indifferent, arrogant approach to the small business community of Australia that was adopted by my predecessor as Prime Minister of Australia. I understand-and I want to say this to the small business community of Australia-that many of them are still suffering the effects of one of the most prolonged recessions that Australia has ever had-a recession we 'had to have', to borrow the expression of my predecessor for the third time. I understand that the benefits of the falls in interest rates have yet to fully flow through to the small business sector. I would remind the small business sector that the Workplace Relations Act, through the abolition of the unfair dismissal provisions, only came into operation on 1 January. The availability of the Australian workplace agreement will only come into operation on 1 March this year. The revolutionary change to the capital gains tax structure will only come into operation on 1 July in this year. In other words, many of the benefits of our policies are yet to flow through to the small business sector.",76
106,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How much time do you want?,76
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member Denison!,76
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But so far from displaying an arrogant, out-of-touch, indifferent, insensitive attitude to the small business sector of Australia, I offer a sympathetic understanding of the difficult climate in which they have had to operate over the past few years. They have had to operate in a very difficult, indeed often hostile, climate over the last few years. While the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is talking about the most telling finding and the most telling analysis contained in the Yellow Pages survey, I thought one of the more interesting analyses was to compare the net ratings of the former government of minus 61 per cent in February of last year with the still to be improved finding of minus two per cent of us in this time, 12 months later-a big difference of 59 per cent. The last peoplewhether you are new Labor, old Labor, recycled Labor, forelock tugging Labor; whatever you describe yourselves as-the last crowd in Australia that the small business people want back in charge of the affairs of this country are the Labor government that was thrown out of office 12 months ago. Department of Veterans' Affairs",76
109,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer the minister to comments made by officials of the Community and Public Sector Union that the union was 'particularly bitter' about the outsourcing of the Department of Veterans' Affairs' desktop to mainframe computing infrastructure. Was the CPSU given the opportunity to be involved in the outsourcing process? What benefits will the outsourcing deliver to the veteran community and regional industry?,77
110,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. I was surprised at the comments made by the CPSU in a recent media release, in which they claim that the union was 'bitter', to use the words of the press release, about the outsourcing of the department's computing infrastructure. I find it difficult to understand why they would be bitter about a proposal that will deliver $20 million of running cost savings over the next five years while at the same time modernising the infrastructure and improving services to the veteran community. I also fail to see why they would be bitter about the outsourcing arrangements which provide local business opportunities to small and medium enterprises in the Australian computer industry. The 2,500 personal computers which will be provided under the agreement will be built in Wangaratta. The processing will take place in Ballarat. I am not quite sure what the CPSU is bitter about. Is it a boost to regional industry and job"" or is it about better services for veterans? The CPSU were fully involved and they were consulted during the outsourcing process. The in-house costs were independently benchmarked. The CPSU were invited to participate in the benchmarking process but they chose to withdraw because it was part of their baseless campaign of industrial unrest. They preferred to strike rather tha,n to maintain an active involvement in the process. The cost-effectiveness of outsourcing the department's desktop mainframe and com puting infrastructure have been confirmed by independent sources. The CPSU has failed their membership. They have failed those workers. We are committed to ensuring that we modernise the department and we deliver jobs. If the CPSU had any concern about their members, they would have remained involved in the process right through to the conclusion. Mr Kelvin Thomson-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The minister was quoting from a document. Pursuant to standing order 321, I request that he table it in order that we can understand the answer. Mr Bruce Scott-No, it is confidential.",77
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are confidential documents. Public Hospital Funding,77
112,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Will the minister confirm that he has ruled out any increased funding to public hospitals, as reported in today's Herald-Sun?

118,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"described this government's health insurance rebate as 'money down the drain'? Isn't it the case that the government's obsession with cutting back public hospital funding to fund its failed private health initiatives is such bad policy that, in addition to the AMA and the Productivity Commission, even your own Liberal colleagues are now dumping on your policy?",77

124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Perth.,78
125,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am aware of the comments made by the Victorian health minister. I am not aware of the comments made by the Victorian Premier. Mr Sercombe-But he is your constituent.,78
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Maribynong.,78
127,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can't choose your family either! I am aware of the comments made by the Victorian health minister. Perhaps I can explain the context. I am very much aware that public hospitals are under strain right around Australia. My wife works in a public hospital, so I get at first-hand the knowledge of what is going on. The point that I was making is that the Medicare agreement has one year to run. We will fulfil our obligations under the Medicare agreement. People should be aware of a little bit of history. It is not unusual for states to undertake a bit of posturing ahead of Medicare agreements coming up to be signed. I take no offence at that. If you look at what has happened over the years since the last Medicare agreement was signed in 1992-93 and you look at the states collectively, because I think it is unfair to single out Victoria, the fact is that the Commonwealth's funding to state hospitals-not state health, but state hospitals-has increased very substantially in real terms since the last Medicare agreement. Collectively, the states' contribution to hospitals has dropped off, so the net benefit to the hospitals has not been great. Some areas-the ACT, for example-have had a good record in maintaining their resources to hospitals, but it has been very patchy across the states and collectively the states have dropped off. This was a problem the previous minister had. It is a problem I remember the opposition leader talking about during the election. If the Commonwealth is going to put in extra money just to have the states pull it out to fix the budget bottom line, the net effect is that things are no better. Before I would consider going to my colleagues to argue for more resources for state hospitals I would want to be convinced that those resources were going to make a difference. I would want to be convinced that the states were not just going to pull the resources out and use them elsewhere. As for the private hospital rebates, it depends on what you are trying to achieve. We had Bob Carr over the weekend talking about the difficulty of the drop-out from private health insurance to the New South Wales health system. We have had Peter Beattie in the past talking about how the Queensland health system would be better off if we could stop the drop-out from private health insurance. What these rebates will do for the first time is put a floor under the people pulling out of private health insurance. That will help the states very substantially. The final point I want to make-and I make no apologies for this-is that this is as much as anything an issue about equity. The coalition believes that people who have made the effort to make some provision for their own health care and who have held on to private health insurance for a long period actually deserve a reward. A lot of those people are on very low incomes. The best estimates are that up to 700,000 people on incomes under $20,000 a year have held on to their private health insurance. We will be seeking to help them in a way that you have never done.",78
128,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no reward if the premiums are going up.,78
129,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maybe I should not react to interjections, but I cannot help it. Premiums went up 40 per cent in 1986-88. What did you do? Nothing. Premiums went up an average of 12 per cent over 10 years under you. What did you do? Nothing. What are we doing? We are giving families $450 and couples $200. We are working hard with the Productivity Commission to try to make private health insurance as efficient as possible. You are hypocritical in attempting to talk about something that you did nothing for for 10 years. We are in the spot we are in today clearly because of your failure, your prejudice and your hypocrisy. Beef Industry",78
130,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware that in New South Wales the Carr state Labor government has repealed the prompt payments legislation in relation to the beef industry? What are the ramifications for beef producers, particularly those in the Hunter? Why should the beef industry, in relation to sales at auctions, be treated any differently than other sales at auctions where payment or deposit is paid on the fall of the hammer and the balance within 24 hours?",79
131,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In New South Wales I suppose the answer is because you have an anti-rural government that has no understanding or appreciation ofMr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As I understood it, the question was asking of the minister the implications of state legislation, not federal legislation. It would therefore be out of order as it is not under his jurisdiction. That legislation is not his legislation; therefore, the question is out of order.",79
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,79

135,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps he is like the fair trading minister in New South Wales who is very prone to wander around wearing elastic-sided riding boots, whereas Bob is a regular visitor to saleyards in his electorate Maitland, Gloucester and Dungog. I fully understand the outrage that New South Wales producers are feeling. You are talking about the termination of a' prompt payment provision for livestock that has been in place for a long time-as was implied in the question, one which has applied for a long time to products sold at auction. Under it, buyers had 24 hours to pay agents for livestock after a sale unless there was a written agreement on alternative payment terms. Understandably, very real concerns have been expressed by producers right across New South Wales. It has to be said that it is totally unacceptable that this sorely pressed sector experiencing huge difficulties at the moment should be hit in this way. The New South Wales government, it can only be said, is totally and absolutely out of touch with what is happening to its constituents in rural areas. It is no wonder that they are woefully underrepresented in rural areas. It is no wonder that they can look forward to more of the same. It is about time that they got out there and listened.",79

138,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Science and Technology. Minister, I refer to your comments on Channel 7's Face to Face program where you indicated that the government was considering establishing a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Australia. Would this facility be economically viable if it only reprocessed waste from the Lucas Heights reactor or does your proposal rely on Australia importing and reprocessing fuel from overseas? Is it your intention to locate this facility at Lucas Heights? If not, what are your preferred alternative sites?",79
139,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the problems we inhellted from Labor was 1,600 spent fuel elements. The storage facilities at ANSTO, as we know, will be exhausted in the second half at of next year. So we have to take action on the disposition of ANSTO spent fuel. The options available to us are to return it to the United Kingdom or to the United States, which were the countries of origin, under treaty obligations or to reprocess it domestically. The government is considering all the options available to it. No decisions have been made. We will continue to consider the options and we will not be rushed into a decision. Medicare",79
140,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, very definitely without notice, is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, I understand that the first of the new Medicare pharmacy agencies is opening this Friday, actually in the electorate of Capricornia. Can the minister confirm that this very exciting and innovative program plans to have 130 agencies in pharmacies by the end of June and 400 around Australia in the next four years? As the 400 works out at something like 2V2 agencies per federal electorate and I need 12 in Cowper, can the minister give some indication of whether he is prepared to consider enlarging this extraordinarily valuable and people-friendly scheme?",80
141,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Capricornia, I believe, will be opening the first centre on Friday in his electorate. That will be part of a trial of five Medicare claiming offices in pharmacies. We do wish to trial a number of different methods of doing this. This trial should be fairly quick. We hope to open the first offices in May. The honourable member is right: we aim to have 130 offices by the middle of the financial year. We hope to open 400 offices over the following two years. Depending on the public's response, we will make a decision then. I have had very positive feedback from honourable members. The 400, though, does not quite translate to 2V2 per electorate. How we have arrived at an indicative list of where they will go is we have chosen to use the isolated pharmacy allowance. For a pharmacy to be in receipt of the isolated pharmacy allowance it must be 10 kilometres from the next nearest pharmacy. About 402 pharmacies in Australia qualify for the isolated pharmacy allowance. Unfortunately, that rules out Chisholm getting any. No pharmacy qualifies in my electorate or most metropolitan members' electorates, so these will predominantly be in rural areas. There is an indicative list that I would be happy to show the honourable member or",80
142,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the Medicare offices that you shut in my electorate?,80
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Denison. You have been warned repeatedly this day. Remove yourself from the chamber. Opposition members-Happy birthday! Mr Crean-Go out and celebrate over a cup of tea.,80
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If anybody else wants to celebrate the honourable member's birthday, let them chance their arm. The honourable member for Denison thereupon withdrew from the chamber",80
145,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is an indicative list as to where the agencies will go, but of course it depends on acceptance by the pharmacies. They will choose voluntarily whether they will be part of the system. However, we would expect most to choose to be part of it. In relation to the final part of the question whether the system will be expanded, if it is a success I would hope that we may be able to do that in the future. That will of course be done in line with the government's other budget priorities. Television: Anti-Siphoning Rules",80
146,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, both in his own capacity and as representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Does the minister recall the Prime Minister informing the Sunday program on 9 February last that the government intends to close a loophole in the law concerning live to air broadcasts of major sporting events? In light of the Federal Court decision yesterday, does the government still intend to amend the act to ensure all major sporting events will be broadcast live on free to air television? Further, will the minister give a guarantee that all major sporting events will remain on free to air television?",80
147,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My colleague the Minister for Communications and the Arts announced in the Senate earlier this week the resolution regarding the South African direct cricket telecast and the difficulties that emerged between Foxtel and Channel 7. A resolution has been agreed to which will provide for some direct telecasting. Mr Crean-Some.,80
148,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, the situation is far better than what it would have been had the minister and some other ministers not been involved in trying to broker a solution. The point that needs to be made is that, if there are inadequacies in the siphoning rules which the court has been contemplating, they are rules that we inherited from you. It is my understanding that Senator Alston has indicated that, where he is able to take action, he will do so. He will do it in consultation with the industry to ensure that where it is feasible to have direct telecasts will have them and that the spirit of the rules as originally intended will be modified if necessary to give effect to that intention. The other point that I would make in response to the member's question is this: the court made certain orders yesterday, the detail of the orders were not available to me prior to question time and Senator Alston will be considering those. I am sure I, as the minister for sport, will be involved in some of the discussions. Honourable members can be assured that this government will address any inadequacies within the rules, we will do so in consultation and we will try to make sure that the Australian people will get the fullest coverage, live and also through emerging technologies, possible. Second Sydney Airport",81
149,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Can the minister please advise the House whether the time for the preparation of the draft EIS on Sydney's second airport is to be extended in view of the overwhelming community response to the process?,81
150,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. She, of course, has taken a particular interest in this issue of a second airport in Sydney and has made representations to me on a number of occasions in a very adequate and fulsome fashion. As the House would recall, last year the government announced an environmental impact study on two sites for the second airport for Sydney, those two sites being Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. The reason we were in this position was that the previous government, having selected Badgerys Creek in February 1986, had done absolutely and utterly nothing over the next 10 years to develop a second airport for Sydney. They fast-talked about it but they slow-tracked the whole process. As a result, these environmental impact studies are being undertaken. Unlike the former Labor government, we are embarking on a very comprehensive process of community consultation during this EIS. The EIS has been under way now for we several months. There have been over 300,000 newsletters, fact sheets and fliers go out to people in the community with regard to this environmental impact study. There have been over 70 meetings held by those people undertaking the EIS with community groups, councils and so forth. Indeed, the response from the community has been very substantial. As a result of that, and in order to ensure that full community consultation can be carried out in the most comprehensive fashion, the government has decided to extend the period for the EIS by at least two months. So, as a result of the commitment of this government to proper community consultation, the EIS process will be extended by at least two months. I compare this with the process undertaken by the former Labor government when they did an EIS on the third runway for Sydney's Mascot airport. That process hardly involved community consultation. The results of it were a complete con of the community, as we all saw, as the facts developed after the runway had been opened. This government is committed to full and open community consultation and therefore this extension of time has been granted to achieve that. Defence Personnel: Medicare Mr FITZGmBON-My question is directed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, I understand that under the current Medicare system Australian defence families which are not exempt from the Medicare levy pay only half of the levy. I also understand that under the government's proposed Medicare levy surcharge these families will pay all of the surcharge rather than just half. Minister, will you act to ensure that defence families are not penalised by the government's introduction of the Medicare levy surcharge?",81
151,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say very simply this: the average private health insurance for defence force personnel is about double what it is for the rest of the community. At the present time you are quite right in that serving personnel are exempted from the levy. There is a formula that relates to families if they are indeed required to use the Medicare system. Nonetheless, the question of the surcharge is one, as the Treasurer explained, that is across the board. In fact the legislation and the discussions are soon to be in this chamber. The situation will remain that personnel will not be subject to the Medicare levy. The surcharge is a different matter; but I add that private health insurance levy is twice that of the national average and stands at about 59 per cent. Concord Hospital",82
152,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware that the New South Wales Labor government has further downgraded Concord hospital in my electorate-a former repatriation hospital with special responsibiliwith ties towards the veterans' community-by closing the renal transplant unit? Has the New South Wales Labor government held any consultations with the minister about this proposed closure? Is this not a further incident of the New South Wales Labor government acting against the interests of veterans and other members of Sydney's inner west communities without any prior consultation? Further,82

156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will ignore the question pertaining to opinion.,82
157,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lowe for his question and his ongoing interest in the veteran community, the Concord hospital and its future under a New South Wales Labor government. Also, he mentions the workers at Concord hospital who continue to do a great job in caring for the veteran community and other people whom the the Concord hospital serves. I am aware that the New South Wales Labor government is proposing to close the renal transplant unit of Concord hospital in what amounts to yet another example of no consultation with and no concern for the veteran community. Concord hospital is an excellent facility and the veteran community have long had a very strong association with the Concord hospital. They not only have a strong association with the hospital but also feel very comfortable that hospital as a veterans' hospital. That goes back to the days when it was first built as a repatriation hospital. This is the second time in less than a year when changes to services at Concord have been publicly proposed without any courtesy shown to the veteran community, nor has there been any consultation with the federal government. I have written to the New South Wales Minister for Health, Dr Refshauge, expressing my ongoing concern at the way the New South Wales Labor government is treating not only the veteran community but also the staff at Concord hospital. I understand that the New South Wales President of the RSL, Rusty Priest, also has expressed his concerns and I know that he certainly has made his concerns known to the New South Wales government. I support fully Rusty Priest in his efforts to make the New South Wales Labor Minister for Health, Dr Refshauge, understand the concerns of the veteran community. I was not aware that the staff at Concord had been warned by the central health authority of New South Wales. But I must congratulate the staff at Concord for their continuing commitment to serve the veteran community, notwithstanding that threat hanging over their heads. Let me assure the veteran community that-unlike the babbling brooks on that side of the House who show no concern for the veteran community; this is a serious issue with the veteran community of New South Wales-I am going to continue to monitor the situation at Concord and make sure that veterans' concerns are paramount in whatever transpires with the outcome at Concord hospital.",82

160,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. You will be aware of attempts since 1988 by your predecessors to rationalise the operations of the five parliamentary departments. These attempts have aimed at achieving efficiencies whilst at the same time ensuring members and senators can properly perform their duties on behalf of the parliament and their constituents. Can you inform the House of any recent progress in this matter and do you anticipate better success with the Senate in achieving any proposed reforms?",83
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his question. I know that hoth he and the honourable memher for Watson share a most active interest in this very challenging affair. Improvement in both administrative and organisational efficiency is something that challenges us all and is dynamic in the sense that it is continuous. Proceedings under way at this moment in consultation with my fellow Presiding Officer will hopefully lead to the formation of a task force in the very near future which will address very seriously the future organisation of the parliament. I hope that, as that task force is formed, I will be able to appraise the House of the continuing developments in that regard.",83

182,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the member for Banks (Mr Melham) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The concern being raised across the nation following the Howard Government's budget decision to slash legal aid funding by $120 million. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",84
183,Mr MEL HAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The justice system has changed since John Howard was last in full-time practice. He is proud of saying he is a suburban solicitor-and so he should be; it is an honourable professionbut you cannot run a justice system from a suburban solicitor's office in Wollstonecraft. and that is exactly what is happening in our justice system today. It is the vanity of the Prime Minister, it is the Prime Minister not being properly briefed before going on the Laurie Oakes Sunday program a ""ouplc of weeks ago, that has plunged the justice system in this country into cri-i' \V,, have a situmion where the Minister for. lilancc (M, Fahey) earlier this week conced. ' 1 a question tn !nc hat there had been ,,,'.(u-'''\ms between the Department of FinanCe' allJ the Attorney-General's Department in Idation lu the legal aid ,itna;i,m. Today:!:' Prime Minister dismissed out I ;' hand the , 'mplaints by stale Attorneys General hy 'aying. 'What do you expect fwn state Attorneys-General?' The reality is that those state Attorneys-General and the legal aid commissions are those who are suffering at the coalface. While the Prime Minister is living in luxury at the Lodge up the road and at Kirribilli, ordinary Australians are suffering. What was the promise from the conservative parties prior to the election? It was in these terms: A Liberal and National government will maintain current levels of legal aid funding as well as funding to community legal centres. In Government we will: examine ways, in consultation with Legal Aid Commissions, of increasing the extent to which legal aid is granted in civil proceedings, particularly in the family law area; and explore ways of ensuring equity in the allocation of legal assistance and in devising new and innovative ways of ensuring that all Australians are able to access the court system. What do we have from this Prime Minister? His first commitment to access to justice is to keep the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) outside of cabinet. Why? Because he probably thinks he has sufficient legal knowledge, ably aided by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), to run the show without the Attorney-General in cabinet. The reality is that this is a re-run of what the Fraser government did post-1975. The Australian Legal Aid Office was set up by the Whitlam Labor government and the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy. From 1975 to 1983, we had a dismantling of the Australian Legal Aid Office by the then Fraser government. They turned it into a referral factory. What this government have managed to do is unite a coalition of group:. against them in terms of their move hecause it has no merit, it has no policy rationale and it not based on any considered research. h JS not based on the delivery of a fair or equitable system of justice; it is based on the bean counters. It is a budget cut pure and simple. These words are not just from me-I might be considered to be partisan in the matter because of my Labor credentials-but also from the Western Australian Attorney General, Mr Foss. He has released a letter that he has writl(;:l to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. That letter states: You have created a crisis by your unilateral decision and now you are saying that this imposes some duty on us to meet you part way. I would have thought the duty was on you to fix the mess you have caused. In fairness to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance, they were preparing a submission to put on the cabinet notice paper to be considered by cabinet. So what have we got? We have a Prime Minister so vain, so proud, so incompetent when it comes to knowing what is coming before the cabinet that he goes on the Sunday program with Laurie Oakes and says, 'Nothing is being considered in relation to legal aid.' The problem with this Prime Minister is that he is too busy reading the opinion polls and the research from Mr Robb to look at the cabinet notice paper and to understand what his ministers are preparing. The reality is that the cuts in the budget were based on false figures. I quote from a document provided to me by National Legal Aid: . .. the Commonwealth made available some statistical data purportedly used in their calculations. Unfortunately, the data that was used was not correct in some cases (and had not been checked with Commissions.) Further, they used data from 1994/95, rather than 1995/96. The importance of this is that there had been an enormous change in workloads over that twelve month period which was not reflected in the Commonwealth's analysis (particularly in the family law area of separate legal representation for children as ordered by the Family Court). The government for families and family values! What this will lead to is further disruption within families. It will lea 1 10 further crisis in relation to domestlL violcnv,' in this country. Let us make no mistake whel; the blame will lie. It will lie fairly ano squarely with the Prime Minister. The document continues: Also, they only used data pertinent to Victoria am: Western Australia. These two Commissions hal, totally different workloads and figures from the norm. More up-to-date data wa ava:lable at the time to the Commonwealth, but was ;]pf u;ed in their calculations. After Commissions analysed the Commonwealth figures, it became apparent that in manv instance' the opposite argument can be proved-that i"" tl1:l some States and Territories arc in effect \ub-i dising' Commonwealth matters tnHl1 the 1,;ndillF they contribute. Commissions devote more funds to Commonwealth law matters than they do local legal matters. The document further states: For a Government that campaigned on a platform that it would be a Government for families, it is worrying that the Commonwealth is now walking away from a responsibility for legal aid in domestic violence matters. Those less able to put their views to the Court will not be in a position to do so and this will have a particular effect on women and children. The fundamental rule of justice that all persons are equal before the Court will no longer exist. That is what this government has done. Is this from just the defence authorities, the state Attorneys-General and the legal aid commissions? No. There is an inquiry at the moment by a Senate committee which is taking evidence around the countryside on legal aid. Who appears in front of it? The President of the Law Council of Australia. The current Attorney-General would know about that; he was once the President of the Law Council of Australia. What does Mr Short say? This is what he said before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on Wednesday, 29 January: In a nutshell we are saying that, by cutting legal aid, the government has reached a wrong priority. We say that in any civilised society equality before the law is one of the hallmarks of successful government. Equality before the law means that people who are attacked or under threat by a legal system must feel comfortable that society is providing them with an equal opportunity to answer and relieve themselves of that burden. It is a positive obligation of a civilised society to that minimum level of legal assistance. Does it stop there? No, it does not. We have evidence from the current Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Rozenes. What did he say before the Senate references committee on Wednesday 29 January 1997? He said: The Commonwealth DPP-and I imagine that I speak for all Directors of Puhlic Prosecution-has a real interest in ensuring that persons brought before the c()ur1-· are adequately represented. By 'adequately n;prcsented' I do not just mean being provided with l(,mse! hut being provided with counsel who are properly resourced so that they can make a meaning!.il contribution to the trial process early enough to ensure that the valuable resources that we have to bring to bear in the criminal system are not wasted, that early pleas of guilty are identified as early as possible and that the trial proceeds not only fairly but expeditiously without error to ensure that there are no successful appeals, thereby saving further cost. There is every interest for the prosecutor to have well equipped, properly resourced defence counsel opposed to him or her. What does he say further on? It is even more damning. He was asked from the chair: Does your office have a view of when it is appropriate that legal aid be provided in cases? Mr Rozenes-We would start off with the proposition that in all serious and complex cases accused persons should be represented. CHAIR-Do you have a guideline that would determine what is serious and what is not serious? Mr Rozenes-If there is a risk of going to gaol, that is a pretty serious case. What does this Attorney-General and government do? They denigrate the High Court. We now have a campaign where there is an attack on the High Court in relation to a number of enlightened judgments that it has made. The Prime Minister on Monday demonstrated that he would not pass the first year of law school. It is not only the parliament's role to make law in this country; the constitution, of which the Prime Minister is a great defender, also gives a constitutional obligation to the High Court to lay down the common law in Australia. The common .law is judge-made law. It is not a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant view of history, and it is not a black armband view of history. What did the High Court say in Dietrich's case? That was a very important case in provide which the High Court said that the courts have a discretion to prevent a miscarriage of justice, and that a case should not proceed where there is going to be a miscarriage of justice. So, if accused persons come before the courts unrepresented and there is a chance of a miscarriage of justice, the obligation is on the trial judge to intervene. That is what is happening now. We have examples where, at the state level, the state Attorney-General is being asked to provide an ex gratia payment to fund the defence case of an accused. And what does this Attorney-General do? He attacks the Dietrich case and says, 'That decision should justice never have been made; it was wrong.' Legal aid needs to be administered, irrespective of whether or not there is going to be a miscarriage of justice. It is the same principle. Cases should not be brought to court, unless people are properly represented. We have royal commissions going on all around this countryside. There are cases in New South Wales where police officers have now been shown to have perjured themselves. We have a situation now where there is no legal aid in New South Wales for retrials. When I was a public defender I appeared in a number of trials; there were two I specifically remember. The jury was unable to agree and, at the retrial, those accused were acquitted. They were represented. If they were unrepresented at the retrial, it is more likely than not that they would have gone to gaol. We have standards, we have a system of justice, we have a rule of law. The obligation is on the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth does have responsibility when it comes to veterans, when it comes to indigenous Australians-when it comes to a whole range of things. The partnership, the legal aid agreement, is a joint partnership. It was one in which I was involved when I was in the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. It is an efficient system. In New South Wales previously, prior to 1987, you went to one place for an Australian legal aid application, and you went to another place for an application under the New South Wales system. It was inefficient. It was a duplication of services. So an agreement or arrangement with the Commonwealth and the state was entered into. It was a one-stop shop. The Commonwealth undertook to provide 55 per cent funding, with 45 per cent being provided by the New South Wales government. The system has worked well. It has been calculated that, as a result federal government's cuts in the last budget, 33,000 fewer people will be represented. It will mean not only that innocent people are more likely to be convicted but also that judges in this community will not allow trials to go ahead if there is a miscarriage of justice, so people who should be convicted will be set free. Middle Australia, mainstream Australia, when it comes to domestic violence cases and cases involving children, will not have any representation at all. (Time expired)",84
184,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The thesis of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) is that the only thing wrong with the legal aid system in Australia is that the Commonwealth is not putting in money. What he is doing is beating the states' drum, the drum that has been beaten since June last year. There are things wrong with the legal aid system in Australia, and let me tell you what they are. They emanate from what the member for Banks applauded-the joint arrangement. That joint arrangement might have been an improvement on what went before it, but it was entered into 10 years ago. We had an arrangement in place up to the time the Howard government came into office under which there was a common pool administered by state legal aid commissions into which there were fixed contributions made by the Commonwealth and the states. Those contributions ranged on the Commonwealth's part between roughly 55 and 60 per cent. The states, however, in some cases made significant contributions; in others, they made only modest contributions. Some states currently use interest on solicitors' trust accounts as part of the state contribution to the legal aid commissions; most states do not. The legal aid commissions themselves generate funds. They generate those funds by client costs-they seek contributions from the clients and they recover costs against unsuccessful litigants against whom they have funded proceedings. The differences between the efficiencies of the state legal aid commissions in that respect are quite marked. Some states have significant interest income from money that they manage, others have none. of the All in all, the states have a very patchy performance. When we come to look at how that money is used, we see that there are elements of inequity and there are elements of unfairness to go on top of the inefficiency that is built into the system. The priorities for the disposition of legal aid funding are not determined by the Commonwealth government under the system put in place by Labor. They are not even determined by the state governments whose legislation set up the legal aid commissions. They are determined by legal aid commissioners who, acting in good faith I accept, respond to the wind and the waves of the legal landscape. What happens when the High Court decides the Dietrich case? All the money suddenly shifts to criminal law. What happens when the full court of the Family Court in the case of re K decides that children need to be represented in family law proceedings? Some of that money drifts back into family law. When there is another decision of another court that lays down some broad principle about representation in proceedings, no doubt we will have another drift. The result is that the governments that provide the funding are not able to determine the priorities as to the use of the funding. it is those governments that are accountable to taxpayers. If you are an applicant for funding for a separate representation of children in family law proceedings in Victoria, you have got three times the chance of getting that funding than you have in any other place. But the Commonwealth puts in its money just the same. If you go to a particular solicitor in Western Australia for a family law matter, the legal aid commission will pay three times the amount that would be paid in another jurisdiction for performing the same service. We talk about equity and we talk about access. The member for Banks makes a great fuss about it. I think on both sides of the House there is a desire to achieve access to justice. There is no access to justice when 70 per cent of the money devoted by legal aid commissions for private referrals is devoted to 20 per cent of cases. The member for Banks referred to the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission. The New South Wales Legal Aid Commission is a classic in this instance. In New South Wales, 75.4 per cent of funding for referrals goes on 20 per cent of matters. What has happened is that trials have got longer, courts have laid down the rules as to who will be funded and the legal aid commissions have just washed around. They have slopped around in the wind and the waves. This system has been allowed to go on for 10 years by the previous government. What about the accountability? The governments that provide the money are accountable to the taxpayers for the expenditure of the money. But, under the current system, the boards of the legal aid commissions are the ones who make the decisions. The boards of the legal aid commissions usually contain one or two representatives of the Commonwealth and maybe one or two representatives of state governments. The bulk of the representation on those boards-and they comprise 10 or 12 members in many cases--comes from stakeholders. They are volunteers in the main and they do a good job given the circumstances in which they find themselves, but they are not accountable to anyone. In most cases they have a direct conflict of interest. They are But certainly not accountable to the taxpayers whose money is used in the funding. What about the comparisons between the legal aid commissions? We have a system under which each legal aid commission maintains its own records. It maintains records of its funding. It maintains records of the matters that are referred to it and the results. In some cases they are able to compare costs of cases, costs of matters. When it comes to the Commonwealth's money, can you compare what happens in one legal aid commission with what happens in another legal aid commission? No, you cannot. The Commonwealth is unable to get data that will tell us whether its money is being fairly and equitably used across Australia. Such data as is available suggests that in many cases it is quite inequitable. I have mentioned the separate representation of children being three times the rate in other jurisdictions. What did Labor do about these problems? Did they take steps to ensure that the states made even contributions? No, they did nothing. Did the Labor government take any step to ensure that the legal aid commissions in their management of funds sought on similar principles to have client contributions, recovery from unsuccessful opposing litigants and interest on managed funds dealt with on a similar basis? No, they did nothing. Did the Labor government do anything to ensure that the priorities determined by legal aid commissions achieved equity between legal aid clients in different states and territories, different jurisdictions? No, they did nothing. They allowed the lO-year-old agreements to drift on. What did the Howard government do when it came into office? It sat down and said, 'We can't allow this situation to continue.' Pursuant to those agreements, on 26 June last year I gave notice to the different states and territories that we wanted to renegotiate those agreements and we wanted to achieve reforms. Since 26 June we have been endeavouring to negotiate with those jurisdictions an improvement in the legal aid system that will achieve equity and efficiency and will see the best value achieved for the legal aid dollar. All that the member for Banks really talked about was Commonwealth funding of legal aid. We came into office faced with a $10 billion deficit and a commitment to bring the budget back into surplus. There was no way, given the cuts that were necessary in various programs, that legal aid could be immune to the cuts necessary to bring the budget back closer to surplus. We took the figures available for 1994-95, which was the best available data from the states and territories and from the legal aid commissions, and determined of how much money was actually being spent on matters for which the Commonwealth has a responsibility-not on people who have some Commonwealth connection, which was the ruse used by Senator Murphy as Attorney General to get the Commonwealth foothold into the legal aid system. We were looking at how much money was spent by legal aid commissions on matters that arise under Commonwealth law-that being a basis, a principle, upon which the Commonwealth can say to the taxpayers of Australia, 'We are accountable for the provision of legal aid that is necessary in dealing with those sorts of matters.' The calculations we made indicated that on an annual basis, using 1994-95 figures, an amount of about $33 million was being used by legal aid commissions to fund matters arising under state law. We say, and we have been saying for months now, the Commonwealth will accept responsibility for matters arising under Commonwealth law. If we do not provide legal aid, we are accountable to the taxpayers and to the applicants for legal aid. The states should be responsible for matters that arise under state law. States should be responsible to their taxpayers. They should be responsible to legal aid applicants for matters arising under their law. On that principle we have made a commitment, which is in the forward estimates of the current year's budget papers, to maintain in real terms the funding that has been provided in previous years. That represents a significant reduction in the total funding-that is accepted-$33 million. But it is not $33 million in one jurisdiction; it is spread over the lot of them. The states, since then, have engaged in a political campaign designed to put pressure on the Commonwealth to reverse that decision or to reduce the reduction in funding that is contained in the forward estimates. What they have not done is effectively address the reform proposals-reform proposals that will see thousands of people receive more legal aid if it is properly administered. If we can reduce that 70 per cent of referral funding going to 20 per cent of cases, hundreds and thousands of people will get legal aid. There is a case in Victoria, about which I have been told, where a person is on trial on criminal charges. Legal aid has provided $2 million in funding to that accused, and the trial has not started. What is happening is that legal aid is being treated as if there were no end to the funding. The representatives of that particular accused are doing things that, if the accused were not in a legal aid applicant situation but were an ordinary person, would never be done. In other words-and I use these words advisedly; I have used them in the past-the system is providing Rolls Royce justice to a few people. What we really want is to get the legal aid distributed so that a lot more people get it. That means stopping what is really a rort, whereby very large sums of money are spent on individual cases resulting in nothing being spent on a large number of smaller but deserving cases. In the debate that has gone on, the states have used some unseemly tactics in referring to individual cases in saying what will happen if legal aid is denied in this case. Let me make it plain. For the current year, no legal aid funding has been reduced. The Commonwealth has maintained its contribution under the old system. The Commonwealth has said that, from I July this year, it will reduce the funding. The member for Banks made particular reference to some correspondence from the Attorney-General of Western Australia, Mr Foss QC. Mr Foss was replying to a letter. I received the reply on Monday, I think. The letter was written about seven weeks ago. In the interim we have heard nothing. We have heard a lot from other states, and we have heard a lot from stakeholders in the legal aid debate-all designed to raise the spectre that more money is needed and the Commonwealth must reverse its decision. Let us make it plain. The Commonwealth is not going to reverse its decision. The legal aid cake from the Commonwealth was set out in the forward estimates. That is the cake that must be divided. What we want to see is that that cake will be equitably distributed and it will be efficiently used. The states and territories need to sit down and talk to us. Mr Foss's sins are compounded by the fact that Western Australia is effectively the only jurisdiction which has failed to provide data that enables us to compare performances. That suggests to us that the funding provided by the Commonwealth and used on states matters is, in fact, even greater than the estimate that we have made. The legal aid landscape is not confined to the issue of Commonwealth funding to legal aid commissions. There is a lot more to be put into the picture. Community legal centres are a major source of legal assistance in the community. No funding cuts, despite the $10 billion deficiency, were effected on community legal centres. They received $15,152,000 in the current budget, and in the forward estimates it is not projected there will be any cuts whatever. We have funding provided for mediation and counselling in the family law context. That is done outside the court. That needs to be taken into account in any system of access to justice. We have courts addressing the issues of case management so that the big cases can be made into medium-size cases and the medium-size cases can be made into smaller cases. We are currently addressing proposals that will see cases that are conducted in an expensive way in the superior courts conducted in a cheaper way in the intermediate and the lower courts.

185,Ms ELLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Namadgi) (3.56 p.m.)Reference has already been made by our previous speaker, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), to the High Court ruling in the Dietrich case, which I was going to mention today, but there is a another point that has been mentioned that I want to repeat. That is, the decision by this government, by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to break a very definite promise to the Australian community. I would like to repeat these words. It is very important they go on the record. The coalition's 'Law and justice for all of us' policy statement said: A Liberal and National government will maintain current levels of legal aid funding as well as funding to community legal centres. That is very clear to me. We can have pedantic arguments all afternoon about who is paying for what, where and why and how we justify the level of costs, but to me it comes back to that basic argument. It is not just us on this side of the House who happen to be objecting to this particular policy deviation. I would like another quote to go on the record: ' Mr Williams is on notice this cut will devastate a fundamental right of all Australians-that of access to justice, in clear breach of a coalition election commitment.' That was said on 10 February by the ACT Attorney General, who is a political colleague of this federal government. This whole debate seems to centre around two major features, as I see it. One of them is money and this government's obsession with not spending it, no matter what. The other is the question of who-be it the Commonwealth or a state or territory-is responsible for the costs incurred in certain legal aid matters. On the first of these matters, money: the sums used for these cuts were wrong-absolutely wrong. Those miscalculations have, I understand, been acknowledged by the Attorney-General. When we talk about money and the question of whether state or territory governments or the federal government should be paying, let me refer briefly to a statement made, I believe, by the Attorney General. He said: The present debate is not about how much should be available in total. It is simply about which government should pay. Let me remind the Attorney-General of a fairly infamous case. I admit it goes back to the previous federal government, but since this government has been in power it has done nothing to attend to it. I refer to the enormous bill that was drummed up against the ACT government during the EastmanWinchester case. The Eastman-Winchester case, for those who may need to be reminded, was when David Eastman was convicted of the murder of AFP Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester. That occurred whilst the ACT was under Commonwealth control. David Eastman contravened a Commonwealth law and murdered a Commonwealth official. ACT taxpayers paid $1.665 million in legal assistance for his defence. The Commonwealth did not make a contribution to that defence. Nor did it make a contribution to the massive costs involved in the prosecution or the initial coronial inquest. I understand the total bill to the ACT taxpayer was in excess of $8 million. If the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) is true to his principle on this matter, before he even considers cutting funds to the ACT, let alone any other legal aid commission, surely that sort of inequity should be attended to. On the second matter-who is not responsible, who is and for what-I remind the House that for over 20 vears the Commonwealth has assumed responsibility for the provision of legal aid to groups of Australians traditionally acknowledged as requiring special consideration. It is very important that we mention these people. I think at the moment there is a section of the community out there that sees a distance between themselves and this debate. They probably see this debate as being more relevant to what they consider to be the 'criminal element' than to themselves. Let me remind you of the sorts of groups that the Commonwealth historically has considered it fair to apply legal aid to: the Aboriginal community, veterans, social security recipients, migrants, returned service personnel and their families, women, children, accused persons in criminal trials, domestic violence victims, the mentally ill, people suffering from a disability, refugees, and so on. There is absolutely no distance between the community out there-the Prime Minister's mainstream battling people-and the question of what we are going to do in general about legal aid. What we see now, of course, is a pathetic debate about which law falls into whose backyard. This is ridiculous. It is an insult to the community. It is unfair. It is inequitable to those attempting to access the justice process in general. This government keeps telling us that it cares about families. So much of legal aid work is in the area of family law. I understand we are now even having a debate about whether domestic violence is a state or territory issue or a Commonwealth issue. For heaven's sake! Domestic violence is definitely a part of the family law area. There should be no debate at all as to where it fits in. It seems to me very evident that we are looking at a government which said to its minister, 'Minister, we have got to find money. We don't care how you do it, but you do it.' If the legal aid commIssIons around the country are forced to go it alone and set up their own process-as has been threatened in many jurisdictions, including the ACT-the confusion and the inequity wi 11 he massi ve. So many of the matters fall across Commonwealth and state and territorv,-daries tn a legal sense. How on earth \\ U1e client dut there in suburbia know exactiv where they :lfe in that process? How on earth can the government accurately bill different jurisdictions? How are the legal aid pr()(:c\,""s in eaeh of them to run a proper open process with such a crossover? The effects of this decision are far reaching and, frankly, terrible. Over the next three years the legal aid commissions around this country would have expected to help 200,000 people by way of duty lawyer, 15,000 people in civil proceedings, over 200,000 people seeking advice about their legal problems and 20,000 children. But what about the general question? This government is playing around with the legal aid system, yet at the same time it is paying no attention whatsoever, in my observation, to the sorts of costs the legal process generally in this country amounts to. Why doesn't this government, if it is serious, examine those legal costs across the board within the legal system instead of playing around with the disadvantaged and those who rely solely on the legal aid process to access justice when they need to? The Commonwealth proposal jeopardises Australia's position on a range of conventions and treaties. It promises to ensure, amongst other things, fair trials for accused people in all Australian courts, including access to legal assistance; a voice for children whose parents are fighting in the Family Court-children, I might add, of the famous Howard familylawyers for children in the children's courts; access to lawyers for people involuntarily detained because of mental illness; equal legal capacity for women, including access to legal aid; and legal assistance to refugees, amongst others. This Commonwealth action radically shifts the balance of power in our communities. It will potentially lock out of court up 50,000 Australians over the next three years. The Australian legal aid program is acknowledged to be one of the developed world's cheapest, yet also one of the world's best. In closing, I will refute one of the points made by the Attorney-General in his address to the House today. He made mention I think on two occasions of the fact that 70 per cent of the dollars goes to 20 per cent of matters and how in:::quitahle this is. I understand that one of the h'asons for that sort of equation is that in some areas, partiet""arly family law, the l'lcthod of fund:ng for clCl l - is done on a staged basis. In other words. "" fllst stage of the family law matter may receive legal aid to that point. An enormous proportion-60 per cent or more, I believe--of those cases are solved at that point. At stage 2 of the family law issue further funding may be made available, and so on down the line so that the most difficult, the most lengthy and therefore the most costly, which may in fact be the minority, tum out to cost a lot to the system. There is also the issue that the Attorney General himself brought attention to in relation to that expensive case in Victoria. But all I wish to do in the case of the ACT is refer to the Eastman case when we talk about proportion of dollars spent. There is absolutely no doubt this community deserves nothing less than a Rolls Royce service and that Rolls Royce service must be available to every Australian who needs it.",90
186,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The matter of public importance being debated in the chamber today is based on a false premise. The suggestion seems to be that because of the budget decision, which will reduce the Commonwealth contribution by some $33.158 million, there will be a reduction in money available for legal aid funding across the country. This decision is all about forcing the states and territories to disgorge the moneys they should to meet their responsibilities to fund legal aid under their own laws. I must say that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) really ought to go and have a cold shower. He has come in and outlined a number of principles with which everyone in the House would agree. We do to support equality before the law. Who on earth in this chamber would suggest that we ought not to have access to justice? Who would claim we ought not to have equality before the law? The Law Council and Mr Rozenes referred to those matters but it cannot be disputed that we believe in equality before the law . We believe the Commonwealth should make its proper contribution, but the budget decision will prevent the states and territories from misappropriating Commonwealth money to state legal aid matters. There will be access to the law, there will be fairness, there will be decency and there will be an appropriate response if the states are prepared to bear their fair share. I must say that there has been since the budget a very clever campaign to discredit the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and this government and all of the states, regardless of their political colours, have been prepared to participate in this very devious and misleading campaign. Members opposite cite to us our election promises. This government, unlike its predecessor, places a very great store in keeping faith with the Australian people. When we make a promise we want to keep it, but I have to, once again, outline to the chamber the situation that we inherited after we attained government on 2 March. We came into office having been assured by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and by the former Prime Minister Mr Keating that the budget was in surplus. We tried over and over again to find out what the actual figures were but we were assured that the budget was in surplus. There are numerous comments on the public record where the former government told the Australian people, told us, told anyone who would listen that the budget was in surplus. Yet, interestingly enough, just a couple of days after the election we were told that the budget was not in surplus and that we inherited a $1 () billion black hole. Being a responsible government we there10re had to search around to try to make sure we balanced the books. I was interested to listen to the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) when she said that this government has an obsession with not spending money. We make no apology at all for refusing to spend money that is not there. It is important to get to a situation where this country's books are run the same way as one would run one's own h '-Isehold accounts. One cannot go on spendil'C! more than one earns. This governmcill has made very reasonable, Lli, ,_·han '('"" shIeh will e!hure that the budget will be ill surplus in ;1 rmlli:cr of years. Dr Nelson illtcrjectingl\lr SLIP1'ER-Au-tralian pcople, like the honourahle member Jor Bradfield (Dr Nelson), have indeed supported this program. If one looks at every opinion poll published, one will see that the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government have received the full support of the Australian people through this responsible economic management. It is pretty sad when the honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Namadgi bleat about the reduction in the Commonwealth contribution to legal aid funding. The simple fact of the matter is that if the states and territories bear their responsibility there should not be one cent reduction in legal aid funding, not one cent reduction at all. Over the approximately 10 years of the legal aid agreement, the states have continued to allocate moneys given by the Commonwealth to legal aid for the purposes of funding state matters. The states have shifted legal aid funding from family law areas and areas of Commonwealth responsibility into areas of the criminal law. We do not believe that is appropriate. We obviously believe that people ought to have access to legal aid when they are entitled to it but in a federal system of government the government that makes the laws ought to be responsible for ensuring there is adequate provision of legal aid services so that people defending themselves under those laws are in fact able to have access to courts. If one listened to the diatribe by the honourable member for Namadgi, she mentioned a number of people who she deems ought to receive Commonwealth legal aid funding. She included migrants, women and those on social security. If one adds all of the categories that she included in her speech, then basically almost everyone should receive federal legal aid funding. I suspect that even the honourable member for Banks would not want that situation to occur. But we do have a federal system of government whether those people opposite like it or not and in a federal - ystem of government we have a federal parliament that makes laws of national significance pursuant to our powers under the constitution. \\ L' also, :.c ,e state ilnd territory governments that make Jaws under the constitution in accordance with their rights. We are fully supportive of access to justice but we are also supportive of states and territories carrying their fair share. We have also had cited through the media a number of instances where the states and territories have claimed that certain individuals would not be able to receive legal aid. The suggestion is that people could be forced out of court and be unable to defend themselves because the Commonwealth has restricted legal aid. It is obvious that we have not reduced legal aid funding for the calendar year 1996-97. What we have done in accordance with the legal aid agreement is to give more than a full 12 months notice of our intention to vary the legal aid arrangements. In the year after 30 June 1997, we would reduce legal aid funding from the Commonwealth by $33.158 billion. But we do that in the full expectation that the states and territorwealth's ies will meet their proportion, which they have not met until now. Ten years ago it might have been fair enough to say that the Commonwealth was to be responsible for 55 to 60 per cent of legal aid funding, but 10 years is a long time. What the Commonwealth has said is, 'We want to re-examine the system. We want to talk to the states and territories.' There has also been criticism of the way the Commonwealth has calculated the reduction in federal legal aid input, but the simple fact of the matter is that we have had to use the somewhat inadequate data provided to us by state legal aid commissions. If there is something wrong with the figures, the reason is that we have been given the wrong information from the states. The Attorney-General referred to the fact that the Western Australian government has still not provided any figures at all.",92
187,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It's not a $10 billion mistake.,94
188,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That's true. The thing is that the Commonwealth is determined to balance the budget. We are· prepared to meet our responsibilities to fund people needing legal aid in areas of federal responsibility. We would prefer the current system-where we have one legal aid office in charge of allocating legal aid for state and federal matters-to continue but, if the states want to take their bat and ball home and go off and duplicate the present legal aid arrangements, that is a matter for them. The Commonwealth has received the strong support not only of the Australian people but also of major newspaper editorials. In fact, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian have both supported the actions of the government. I think, for once, the newspapers ought to be commended. The scare campaign run by those opposite is absolutely contemptible. It ought to be appreciated that the Commonwealth is continuing to provide some non-means tested funding to war veterans, and we will continue to fund expensive criminal cases under Commonwealth law. In summing up, the states and territories are shameless. They have come out and opposed what the Commonwealth has done; the states and territories have taken the Commonmoney for far too long. Even the Labor Party complained about the way they had allocated Commonwealth funds to state legal matters but the former government did nothing. We have. And now that we are prepared to stand up and be counted and say that this cannot go on any longer, we find people like the honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) coming in here to oppose what the coalition is doing. There is absolutely no intention at all that there should be reduced access to justice. There is no intention at all that there should be any reduction in legal aid funding. What we are saying is that as a government we are prepared to fund Commonwealth legal aid matters but we believe that, in a federation, the states and the territories ought to be totally responsible for funding matters which are the responsibility of state and territory law. (Time expired). Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-The discussion is concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Sharp, and read a first time. Second Reading",94
189,Mr SHARP,AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 amends two acts. The main provisions of this bill amend the Airports Act 1996. Technical amendments are also proposed to the Air Navigation Act 1920 to establish a register of encumbered aircraft as well as to strengthen consumer protection provisions and streamline approval processes for international charter flights. Amendments to the Airports Act Amendments to the Airports Act 1996 will empower required regulations in relation to a number of key environment matters, as well as clarify some technical issues which are unclear. These provisions include: Variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards; Providing new offences for deliberate harm to the environment; Powers to allow pre-existing contamination to be addressed; Prohibiting sub-leasing to trusts; Requiring airport-lessees to seek public comment prior to submitting minor variations of master plans and major development plans to the minister for approval; and A statutory requirement for an airport operator to use an airport site as an airport. Enhanced environment provisions My Department has been developing Airports (Environmental Protection) Regulations, the EP regulations, in consultation with Environment Australia. This process has highlighted a number of areas where improvements can be made to the regime originally envisaged in the act. Under these recently tabled regulations, the environment strategy is the centrepiece of a performance based regulatory regime under which each and every person carrying out an activity on an airport is responsible for the environmental impacts associated with their activity. While the current section 130 requires that an airport-lessee company take all reasonable steps to comply with any final airport environment strategy, it does not require that other persons carrying out activities on an airport site do so. An amendment is proposed to allow for regulations to achieve this. The EP regulations will establish a regime to identify and 'manage' any pollution or sources of pollution at the leased airport sites. Soil pollution is a serious hazard, and there will be provision for remediation of preexisting pollution, as well as for soil pollution that occurs after the regulations come into force. This process is enshrined in the EP regulations but cannot be applied to pre-existing contamination due to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 restriction on regulations with retrospective effect. To overcome this limitation, a proposed amendment will enable the Airport Environment Officer to require remediation of sites identified as polluted. In drafting the EP regulations, we have been constrained in the penalties that can be used for breaches of certain regulations. The amendment proposed to section 132 will enable appropriate variable penalties to be set in these regulations. While the EP regulations avoid a strict liability approach, we want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. Given the seriousness of these offences, they should be addressed in the act rather than the regulations. Having surveyed state environmental legislation, drawing particularly on the South Australian and Queensland regimes, we believe a tiered approach to environmental harm is the best approach. The proposed amendments set out offences in the act to deal with persons intentionally or recklessly causing: serious environmental pollution; material environmental pollution-lesser but nevertheless serious harm; and environmental nuisance. The amendments on environmental matters are consistent with the tougher stance being taken by states to strengthen their environment protection laws. Prohibiting subleasing to trusts I am concerned that trusts may be used to evade the ownership provisions of part 3 of the act. The amendment will prohibit a trust being declared in a sublease or a licence, and also prohibit the separation of the legal and beneficial interests of a sublessee or licensee. The regulation making powers in sections 34 and 35 have also been amended to impose or prohibit certain terms being put in the sublease or licence agreements to ensure that any future developments in this area can be dealt with by making regulations. Amendments to the Air Navigation Act This bill will amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 to allow a national register of encumbered aircraft to be established pursuant to regulations to be made under the act. The register was originally proposed by the aviation industry who will benefit by providing buyers and sellers of aircraft with information on registered security interests held by lenders and creditors over aircraft, including airframes, engines and avionics. However, the register will provide no legal protection on transactions and will not deem a person who has not searched the register to have notice of its contents. It is envisaged that Airservices Australia will be responsible for the development and ongoing administration of the register of security interests over encumbered aircraft. The register is to be established on a national basis and will operate on a fully cost recovered system. All the states and territories have given their in-principle approval for the establishment of the register. The states, with the exception of Victoria, have complementary legislation in the form of their Air Navigation Acts which currently pick up the regulations made under the Commonwealth's Air Navigation Act 1920. Victoria has agreed to adopt similar legislation so that the register can be established as a comprehensive national register. Amendments in relation to charter flights In June 1996 the government took a major step towards a more liberalised and flexible international air charter market in Australia with the release of updated charter guidelines. The government believes that charter operators provide competition for scheduled airlines and their growth will promote efficiency in the air transport industry, with subsequent benefits to users of air transport services and the wider economy. Charter operators also have the potential to further develop new markets and bring tourists directly to major regional centres throughout Australia. The amendments in the bill will streamline approval processes for charter applications and strengthen consumer protection mechanisms. The bill provides that applications to conduct charter flights will only be accepted from the owner of the aircraft or the operator of the aircraft. The government's intention is that persons such as tour package operators should not be allowed to apply for permission to operate charter flights. This ensures that only persons reasonably capable of completing the program of charters will be given permission to operate international non-scheduled flights. A statutory requirement is also being introduced requiring applicants to provide evidence that fare paying passengers will be indemnified for financial loss caused by the failure of the charter operator to fulfil its obligations or complete a program of charters. The charter guidelines released by the government in June 1996 will also be revised to reflect the above amendments. Conclusion The sale of long-term leases on federal airports, starting with Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, will improve airport investment and operations. With the selection of the successful bidders and finalisation of the sale of leases expected soon, successful bidders should commence operation of these airports in the first half of this year. To provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants, and to ensure that the Commonwealth can exercise adequate regulatory control over leased airports, it is essential that this legislation be passed in the current sittings to meet that timetable. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned.

190,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Wakefield) (4.22 p.m.)On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the following reports: Development of facilities for Army Logistics Training Centre and the Bandiana Logistics Group at Bandiana and Bonegilla, Victoria-3rd report for 1997, 60th General Report of the Committee. Ordered that the reports be printed.",97
191,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of the Army Logistics Training Centre and the Bandiana Logistics Bandiana and Bonegilla, Victoria. The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of office accommodation, trade training and structural facilities, weapons storage and repair and upgraded engineering services. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed works is $16.081 million. The has recommended that the work should proceed. The army's facilities at Bandiana and Bonegilla have been developed over the past two decades. Facilities occupied by the Army Logistics Training Centre are a major investfor the training of soldiers. Activities range from initial trade and employment training to non-commissioned officers and officer level courses. The types of courses offered include trade training, integrated logistics training, career and promotional training and equipment training. The committee concluded that there is a need to: upgrade several administrative facilities for the Bandiana Logistics Group; rationalise training facilities to support the creation of the Army Logistics Training Centre; rationalise messing in North Bandiana; and further upgrade engineering services. The scope of the proposed work examined by the committee includes the adaptive re-use of seven existing buildings, the construction of extensions to four buildings and the construction of three new buildings. The committee concluded that the proposed development will rectify a number of deficiencies which have arisen as a result of organisational changes Reports and can be justified because the BandianaBonegilla area will remain as the army's major logistics training establishment. A number of organisations representing community interests strongly support the proposal. All pointed to the army having been a long standing and significant part of the and Albury-Wodonga community and an exemplary corporate citizen. In addition, the army has integrated well within the regional community and has contributed to regional income, employment, skills and infrastructure. I compliment the army and commend these Group at recommendations to the House. The second report I have tabled is the 60th General Report of the Committee. This is for the last calendar year, but it must be remembered that members of the committee were appointed in May and the first reference was not received until June 1996 because of the election. The committee received 10 references during 1996 and reported on five of these. The remaining five references have either been reported on or will be reported on shortly. The cost of projects reported on during the year was $88.526 million. The year in review was marked by a general agreement on public works proposals from organisations and individuals consulted by departments. The committee believes that this is due to departments being more conscious of their obligations to consult early and widely during the development of proposals before they are referred to the committee. I should add that the committee's present status and the awareness of departments of their obligations reflects well on the committee's former chairman, the member for Throsby, Mr Hollis. One positive result has been that public hearings have not been unduly protracted. Another result has been the avoidance of extraneous debate on issues of marginal relevance being introduced into the committee's deliberations. The committee recognises that public works projects often result benefits flowing to local communities in addition to the actual buildings and services provided. This was illustrated in two of the committee's investigations during 1996. As part of the development of facilities in Townsville for the 5th Aviation Regiment and for infrastructure on the Townsville field training area, the Townsville City Council commissioned a study by the Centre for Applied Economic Research at James Cook University which illustrated the economic benefits of each proposal. The study showed that economic benefits flowing from the two Townsville projects amounted to a total of $120 million. The projects were also each predicted to create over 300 full-time and part-time jobs for members of the local community. The fifth Conference of Commonwealth and State Public Works Committees was hosted by a committee of the ACT Legislative Assembly on 5 and 6 August 1996 in Canberra. Representatives of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australian, Tasmanian, ACT and New Zealand legislatures were in attendance. The conference provides a forum for discussion on the operations of public works committees across Australia and New Zealand and compares methods of scrutiny for the funding of public works. Under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, all public works estimated to cost $6 million or more must be referred to the committee. Medium works-those with an estimated cost of between $2 million and $6 million-may also be referred. The committee is aware that some departments may divide a single project costing more than $6 million into two or more components to avoid the need for referral to the committee. To avoid this, the committee requests information from departments on medium works. The plans and sites may be inspected by the committee to determine if further investigation is warranted. The committee did not examine any new overseas works during the year. However, it did agree to a request from the Overseas Property Group to increase funding for the refurbishment of Australia House in London in from $14.25 million to $21.28 million. Consultations are continuing with appropriate ministers to improve the committee's effectiveness, both in Australia and overseas, in its role as a watchdog of public capital expenditure. During the year, the committee discussed the merits of amending the Public Works Committee Act 1969 to reflect current construction prices and to improve the committee's administrative arrangements. Suggestions included: increasing the statutory limit for referrals from $6 million to a figure reflecting the higher cost of construction; requiring that the committee be kept informed of all public works within a certain range and, if considered in the public interest, allowing the committee to conduct formal examination of any such project; inserting a clause in the act to allow the committee to give approval for concurrent documentation; and requiring a central agency to prepare an annual consolidated list of public works proposals for a given financial year. At the end of 1996, the committee was continuing its consideration of these matters, especially amendments to the act and consequential arrangements. During 1996, the House of Representatives Committee Office, which administers the committee secretariat, was restructured. The result of the restructuring was the linking of the secretariat with that of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. Resources are shared and staff allocated according to each committee's workload. So far, I can report, the reorganisation has not affected the operations of the committee. I commend the reports to the House.",97
192,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-May I mention my full support for and thanks to the Public Works Committee, led by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and supported by the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I thank the member for Throsby for his continuing interest, even though it is in a different capacity, in the army establishments at Bandiana and Bonegilla in the electorate of Indi. The report signals and gives the green light to the expenditure of some $16 million on very important new buildings, upgrades and new amenities. More significantly, the works also recognise that the Australian Army has confirmed that Bandiana and Bonegilla will remain as the army's major logistical training establishments in Australia. These very significant establishments have served the nation very well for many years and will now, in their new modernised role. take on even more significance and importance. I should mention also that this year is the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Bonegilla Migrant Centre-an establishment which signalled the beginning of the migration into Australia of some 300,000 migrants from war-tom Europe. There are now more than one million descendants of those people in Australia. The army's mvolvement in those buildings and its new role in Bonegilla-in particular, the relationship between our migrants and the defence forces-are an important page in the history of Australia. Many migrants have joined the defence forces and have served with great distinction, and they continue to do so. I wish the Public Works Committee well in their deliberations. I thank them for their attention. I would also like to acknowledge the very professional presentation to the Public Works Committee by Army and by officers and support staff. Obviously that had a significant effect in influencing the committee to give a favourable report and the goahead for these very significant establishments in Australia.",99
193,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I want to lend my support to the 60th General Report of the Committee, which has just been presented by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I really think members, and indeed the general public, have very little idea about the diversity of the work carried out by the Public Works Committee. We all claim that each committee we are on works very hard, and I have absolutely no doubt that they do, but th,' sheer diversity of projects that come before the Public Works Committee and the amount of reading and research that members have to do, especially the chairman-I, being the former chairman, know this-are really quite phenomenal. There are very few committees that have such a bipartisan approach as this committee. I think that is because people do not hecomc members and certainly do not become chairman of this committee to advance their careers. I speak from personal experience: having been chairman of the committee for eight years, I am still a backbencher. People have used other committees to further tllC'lr careers. They have been chair of a committee for 12 or 18 months and suddenly they have a ministry or are in the shadow ministry. Being Chairman of the Public Works Committee brings its own rewards, so I am quite happy to have remained a backbencher. even though 1 was chair of that committee fo; eight years. The Public Works Committee always acts in a bipartisan way. In the eight to 10 years I have been associated with it there have been only two dissenting reports-and both of those occurred when I was chair and both were written by members of my own party. To rub salt into the wounds, not only were the dissenting reports from my own party but they were from members of my faction within my own party! That gives an indication of the bipartisan nature of the committee's work. The overriding determination of that committee is always to make sure that the taxpayer's dollar is well spent. The parliament charges that committee with the responsibility of investigating and reporting back on projects. Each project. regardless of whether it is worth hundreds of millions uf dollars or on the borderline at $6 million, reCl':ves the degree of scrutiny in determining whether the taxpayer's dollar is well spent. I support what the chairman said about the staff. I am concerned, though, that the workload of not only the Public Works Committee but other committees will place tremendous strain and pressure on the staff, with the sharing of committee work. It is only because of the dedication of the staff that everything is going so smoothly at present. 11 the Public Works Committee ever has a workload like it had a couple of years ago when it brought down about 30 reports in one year, there will be a real problem for staff in trying to adequately service this committee and other committees. At some point that will have to be looked at, but at the moment I compliment the staff and particularly my friend the honourable member for Wakefield for his very good leadership of the Public Works Commlltee. I am proud to be a member of the committee, which serves this parliament so well. NA DELIVERY AGENCY BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",99
194,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"Prior to the adjournment of debate on the consideration of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill, I referred to the fact that one of our concerns relates to the terms and conditions of employment of employees of the agency. I am pleased to say that this matter is one of the issues that have been referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for consideration. Another very important issue is the capacity of the agency to deliver services in rural and remote areas. On 14 February the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, issued a document detailing arrangements for the operation of the new agency. In this document she asserted that 'the agency will improve the services to rural and remote Australia'. Clearly the government is concerned about perceptions, and I think they are real difficulties for same the government at the moment. There is more than a perception; if anything, it is a fact out there in rural and regional Australia that this government is not doing too well in delivering services to rural and remote areas of Australia. This is not surprising, given the government's abolition of Labor's department of regional development, its slashing of funding for regional employment programs and its closure of regional CES and ta\ offices. It is no wonl,Cr that ,0 many headlines are screaming 'Betrayal in the hu-h'. Why wouldn't yuu be concerned in the bush! For example, let us look at the unemployment figures in regional Australia at the moment. In the Richmond, Tweed and midnorth coast area it is interesting to note-and the government talks about serving rural and regional Australia-that unemployment has shot up to 15.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent at the time of the last federal election. But that is just now a consistent pattern in many areas of Australia. If we go to Rockhampton and Mackay we see that it is now 11.6 per cent, up from 9.6 per cent a month ago. In the Cairns region, and this is interesting, there are now 9,500 people looking for work. That is a figure of 8.9 per cent, up from 5.1 per cent a month ago. Finally, ju-t by way of interest to the House, let us look at Townsville and Mount Isa. Unfortunately for those regions there are now more than 4,600 people unemployed. That represents 10.6 per cent of the local work force, up from 7.2 per cent a month ago. I consider that this government has betrayed regional Australia. No wonder National Party figures, including today even the Western Australian Leader of the National Party, are in open revolt against the party's betrayal rural people through its subservience to the unemployment. Liberals' agenda in Canberra. That is what it is about-subservience. There is no real coalition. There is a winner and a loser. Regional Australia is losing as a result of the failure of the National Party to stand up and speak about the need for decent services in rural and regional Australia. But when you look at the detail of the document that Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security, issued for this bill, will see that there is nothing there in which will improve services in these regions. She only says that 'possible options for future service delivery arrangements are now being examined'. You would have thought that they were concrete options, but all she can say that they are now being considered. She goes on to say: In regions where there are currently no social security offices the agency maynot willtake over some offices that are part of the ... Commonwealth Employment Service network. Again, there are no guarantees, no commither ments; there is a big question. It is a con . 'rder to ensure that the coalition locks in National Party representatives and therefore again locks in the subservience of those representatives against the needs and aspirato tions of people in regional Australia. The only thing the minister future advances in communication technology. We all know about them with respect to Medicare offices now. The offices and the jobs disappear from regional Australia, and established what do you get? A fax machine. She goes on to say that, with respect to these matters, communication technology could lead to significant improvements in service delivery. I reject that because the truth is that services are going to get worse, not better, in rural regional Australia. For example, just ask people in Mareeba and in Cairns, who have lost their local CES office, or ask the people in Townsville, who have lost their local tax office. It is really about the withdrawal of services from regional Australia and the loss of job opportunities. And it is going to get worse elsewhere in Australia, especially in areas of of high unemployment and entrenched long-term It is also interesting that the government is setting up its one-stop shop as an agency rather than as a department of government, as the Department of Social Security's network has previously been. It is doing this in part to avoid, I suggest, proper parliamentary scrutiny of its policies in relation to the agency, the board and the employees of the agency. The government has already appointed an interim you chief executive officer for the agency before reality the agency is established in law. We talk about the issue of wage restraint at the moment. We often get lectures from those on the other side of the House about the need is for ordinary working people-such as people then on $400 or $420 per week gross wage in a child-care centre, or driving a truck or cleaning Parliament House-to exercise restraint. What do we find? The new head of this agency is to draw a salary in the order of $350,000 per year. So much for restraint when it comes to the appointment of mates of this government. I am sure that this will keep in touch with the battlers-a $350,000 a in year salary package! That is sure to keep her the in touch with the battlers who have to rely on social security benefits or have to endure long-term unemployment! Whatever happened the stated so-called concern of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about executive salapromises is ries being too high? An interim chairperson has also been appointed to the agency before it is properly in law. It is interesting to note that he used to be the head of Mobil Oil. Is that the right background for the person chosen to head an agency looking after the most needy in our society? I hope that in taking up this position he does not start charging fees for and government services like Mobil and other oil the companies set the price of petrol, as was clearly evidenced over the recent holiday period and exposed by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). The evasion of parliamentary scrutiny in this bill goes even further. This is why I think the House ought to be concerned. People responsible for these matters ought to be directly accountable to this House. Agency operations are now expected to start in effect in April, even before the proper passage of this legislation through parliament. From about that time the agency will be referring job seekers off to private employment agencies and the CES will start to wither on the vine. The physical transfer of all other offices will take place between then and September. A total of 600 offices need to be visited-approximately half CES and half Department of Social Security. We all know that to undertake the physical transfer of all the related infrastructure will a huge task. The government has now admitted that it will cost $37 million in 1996-97 to set the agency up. Is this expense justified when such a minimal part of the CES is being relocated? The reality is that the CES is being dismantled. The government is not talking about putting the collocated CES and DSS offices together any more in the interests of efficiency. Because of the twisted way it has gone about these reforms, the CES offices which become part of the new Public Employment Placement Enterprise must now be distanced from the new agency. This is because they will be in conflict with the agency's functions, as just one of many other bodies to which the new agency might refer unemployed persons. When this government was elected on 2 March 1996. there were 320 CES offices in Australia. There were 298 DSS offices in Australia. On 28 June last year, the government announced the closure-one of their decisions on the run-of 26 of the CES offices. Unfortunately, some of those CES offices, such as in Granville in western Sydney, were closed in areas of exceptionally high unemployment, as was also the case in northern Melbourne. The total number of government offices comprehensively servicing the unemployed and social security beneficiaries will now be reduced even further to less than half its pre-election number-from more than 600 to just 300. So much for core election promises and a requirement to deliver a service to all Australians, irrespective of where they live. But it is worse still for the unemployed. You know, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, because you represent an area of need and high unemployment, that many job seekers frequently go to the CES office without needing to go to the DSS office if they are looking for a particular vacancy rather than going to get their benefit. Unfortunately for those people and their families, there will now be only half as many as places for them to go to for the basic public employment assistance required. While many CES and DSS offices are currently collocated, many are not. I suggest to the House that the reductions be in office numbers will increase transport costs. I know this doesn't worry the wellheeled representatives on the other side of the House because transport costs are not really of concern to them as they drive around in their white limousines. For ordinary working people who are unemployed, the cost of additional transport is a huge issue when you consider the benefits that they receive. Every $2 or $4 represents a huge reduction in the available benefits for unemployed people to assist their families. Other costs are also of concern to working people and many unemployed people. These additional costs eat into the benefits that they have available to look after their families. So will the government's new work for the dole scheme: a scheme introduced on the run to cover up other difficulties the government must now confront. It is ill-thought out, mickey mouse in nature and of no great benefit to Australia at large. The unemployment benefit is supposed to be there to support people while they look for real jobs. The half-baked work for the dole proposal of the Prime Minister will not create real jobs. It is decision making on the run, decision making based on an endeavour to cover up other difficulties of the government at the time of the announcement. It is not a substitute, I suggest to the House, for proper wages, real jobs or properly structured and paid labour market programs that guarantee that people face up to their responsibilities to the community at large and that they receive access to decent accredited labour market programs that also ensure that they accept the discipline of work and, therefore, make themselves job ready. Through work for the dole, the government is trying to use the unemployment benefit as a way to pulI down wages, along with its industrial relations changes. That is what it is about. It is not about real jobs. It is not about looking after ordinary working people. It is about playing to the gallery and failing to deliver on what I regard as a core issue at the moment: the issue of jobs and job security. We alI know that the government does not have the answers to that problem, and that is reflected in the fact that unemployment today is higher than when it was elected on 2 March last year. I refer, for example, to some of the real problems confronting regional Australia at the moment. Regional unemployment is a major issue. That is why today we made a very significant announcement on the question of the automotive industry. In Victoria alone, 30,000 jobs are dependent on the automotive industry. They require a sense of stability and security on the basis of which they can make investment decisions to not only secure those jobs and the future of a very important industry but also tie the industry to export targets and additional jobs. It is about an industry plan, industry policy out there, driven by the government in a partnership with the states and regions and companies and the work force, a partnership to secure Australia's economic future. A partnership accepts that, if the government is prepared to provide a helping hand, we as a community, an automotive industry and a work force are prepared to face up to our responsibilities. Work for the dole, I believe, is aiming to force unemployed people into unacceptably low paid work to create a new class of working poor, as in the United States and New Zealand. This government's responsibility, whether they like it or not, is to create real jobs-not to make it harder for the unemployed to find the few real jobs that are out there because of its heartless economic policies. The second reading amendment that I will move seeks to counter the government's dishonest attempt to evade proper parliamentary scrutiny. That is what it is about. So much for its ministerial code of practice. It is in tatters. Now, through this bill which sets up a new agency, it is seeking to even further ignore and walk away from the requirement of parliamentary scrutiny with respect to what I consider one of the most important issues in Australia at the moment, that is, ensuring that we provide a decent service to all Australians to create opportunities for those who are unemployed to get job ready and back to work. There is also another reason why the government is setting up this new body as an agency rather than a government department. It is doing this as one of the first steps towards its long-term plan to remove government altogether from the delivery of services to the Australian people. We saw another of these steps earlier this week with Dr Kemp's announcement of some new so-called one-stop apprenticeship shops alI run by private companies. I remind the House of what Max MooreWilton-the person John Howard appointed to head his department-said. He has made no secret of his desire to see the Australian Public Service reduced to a minimal policy body with no role in the provision of services. That was at a time when he was not only drawing a very significant salary from the Commonwealth but also relying on some additional alIowances for serving on boards to which he had previously been appointed. So much for his concern as he pontificates about the needs and aspirations of ordinary working people. He also said recently that the Commonwealth Public Service could be cut from the approximately 130,000 who remain there after the savage cuts this government has already made to just 50,000 by the tum of the century. You know who wilI be the loser againregional Australia. Further jobs wilI be reduced from government employment in regional Australia which, in tum, will take private sector jobs out of regional Australia. Another 80,000 public sector jobs are to go, not to mention, as I said, all the private sector jobs that will also hit the wall as a consequence of this government's heartless approach to government services. But who would be surprised at this? Who will pick up the delivery of services under the coalition's plans? Will it be, by any chance, the big private banks who featured so prominently in the list of donors to the Liberal Party in the last election campaign? After all, they have already been paid off with respect to changes to superannuation. This government wants to turn not only the unemployed into a source of profits for its private sector friends but also all Australians who need government assistance into an industry for corporate profits. Unfortunately, this will reward its list of donors at the last federal election. This government is not about improving services for the needy or making these services more efficient; it is about milking the needy to line the pockets of its election fund donors. This bill must be understood as a further step down that path. That is why I will be moving an amendment to this bill this afternoon. That is why the Labor Party will rigorously examine and seek to amend this bill and the even nastier related bills now before the Senate. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses grave concern about: (I) the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of, and public accountability for, the use of the Minister's power to require the Board of the Agency to implement the 'general policies' of the Government in relation to the Agency, the Board or the employees of the Agency: (2) the Board's unfettered power to set the terms and conditions of the Chief Executive Officer; and (3) the erosion of public service terms and conditions through the Agency's ability to employ staff under terms and conditions different to those specified in the Public Service Act"". This amendment goes to the question of scrutiny. We know that the question of parliamentary scrutiny is not just a non-issue for the government but also one which they completely disregard. It is an issue which they completely treat with utter contempt. The amendment also goes to the board's unfettered power to set the terms and conditions of the Chief Executive Officer. Punish the unemployed, attack those in need in the community but look after one's mates. With a $350,000 salary package, I think there ought to be some accountability to this House. If there is a time for restraint, it should be shared by all in the community. Some should not line their pockets while ordinary working people suffer. Finally, the amendment goes to the erosion of Public Service terms and conditions of employment through the agency's ability to employ staff under terms and conditions different to those specified in the Public Service Act. There is no way that terms and conditions of the people employed by the agency will receive anywhere near the consideration that was given to the salary package of the head of the agency. It will be about driving down the terms and conditions of those people. They are already lacking a sense of job security as a means of making savings to ensure that the head of the agency recei ves a package way over what could be ordinarily accepted in the community at large. I ask that the House seriously consider the nature of this bill. I ask that the House seriously consider whether or not we as a nation ought to provide a decent service to all Australians; a service that goes to all regions of Australia; a service that is universal in nature and that says to all Australians in times of need that the role of the Commonwealth government is to offer a helping hand, not to punish those who unfortunately find themselves in difficult circumstances at the moment. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Is the amendment seconded? Ms Macklin-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",100
195,Mrs BAILEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"I support the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996. This bill will establish a new statutory authority to be formally known as the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, which will be responsible for delivering a variety of Commonwealth services. The new agency will bring together services from several different Commonwealth departments so that clients can access all the services they need in the one place. This means that the way the federal government delivers its services to the people of Australia will be vastly improved. They will be more efficient, more effective and more accessible-nothing like what the previous speaker, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), has described. He has used this debate merely for scoring cheap political shots rather than going to the heart of this bill, which is to provide services to the people of Australia such as those in my electorate of MCEwen. The primary focus of the new agency will be to provide excellent customer service, whether that be in person or over the telephone. The agency will initially provide all the income support and related services now provided by the Department of Social Security and farm household support and drought relief payments for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The agency will also provide the registration, assessment and referral services as well as some self-service facilities currently available through the Commonwealth Employment Service. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs student assistance centres and student payments and services will also fall under the agency's responsibilities. From the start of next year the agency will deliver child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate. In future, other Commonwealth government services will be added to the agency, and customers will be able to do more government business in the one place at the one time. The main aim of the new agency is to offer high quality service to its customers. The agency will adopt a customer charter and have guaranteed standards of service. It will have a more streamlined and customer-focused approach to service, targeted to individual and family needs. There will be an improved telephone service as well as a variety of other ways to do business, including face-to-face office interviews by appointment, home visits and computer links. One of the major problems with current Commonwealth service arrangements is the complexity and duplication of dealing with government agencies. If you are a parent needing help with child-care payments, you have to tackle both the Department of Social Security and Medicare. If you are unemployed, you have to first register with the CES, then apply to Social Security for benefits, and then continually zigzag between the two. I know that there are some suburbs and towns which are fortunate enough to have both of these services within close proximity of each other, sometimes even sharing the same building. In suburban areas it may just mean a short bus or train trip, or even a quick drive down the road. But in rural and regional areas, like those in my electorate of MCEwen, having to deal with two or three different agencies in many cases means having to travel to three different towns, hundreds of kilometres apart. Having all these services, benefits and allowances in the one place will take much of the headache and frustration out of many of the aspects of dealing with government agencies and make life much easier for many customers. To illustrate this point, let me give concrete actual examples from my electorate of MCEwen-and the tragedy is that I could choose any area or town in my electorate because in the 14,500 square kilometres that make up MCEwen there is not one DSS office. Therefore, Madam Deputy Speaker, I can tell you that many of the remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Batman, fall on very barren ground in my electorate of MCEwen. As I said, I could pick any area, but for the purpose of this debate today I will take as an example a single father living in Broadford. Let us imagine that the father has recently been retrenched and has to travel 20 kilometres to Seymour to register with the CES. He makes an appointment with Social Security to speak to someone about unemployment benefits. Unfortunately, the nearest DSS office is 165 kilometres away at Wangaratta. He has a daughter who is in year 12 and receives Austudy. She has to make an appointment to speak to someone about her father's change of circumstances in case it affects her payments. This means a 190-kilometre round trip to Bendigo to the student assistance centre. While this example is purely hypothetical, it clearly illustrates the difficulties my constituents face with the current district, Commonwealth service delivery arrangements in the Seymour district. There are very limited and quite expensive public transport options. So, if you do not have a car or access to one, you simply cannot visit these services person. The lack of access to Social Security is a constant cause of concern among my constituents living in the central highlands region, which takes in Kilmore, Wallan, Broadford, Seymour and surrounding areas, including the large army base at Puckapunyal. Also, these conditions apply to the Upper Yarra region in the east of my electorate. Until recently the DSS office in had a regular outreach service which visited Seymour and operated out of the local CES office. This enabled clients from the Seymour region to speak directly to a Social Security officer about any queries or problems they might have. Unfortunately, when the CES had to move to smaller offices, the DSS visiting service was forced to look elsewhere for base. Although there is still an ad hoc visiting service in place, it is largely inadequate to meet the growing demands of customers the area. The Department of Social Security acknowledges the need for a regular service to this area, primarily on the basis of statistics alone. Its figures show that the Seymour, Kilmore, Broadford and WaBan region has a DSS customer base of more than 6,000 people. It is also an area of high population growth. I am informed by the local municipality, the Shire of Mitchell, that between 1986 and 1991 Broadford's population alone grew by 4.8 per cent. This trend is reflected across the entire region, with Seymour's population increasing by one per cent, Kilmore by two per cent, Wallan by 32 per cent, and Wandong and Heathcote Junction by 58 per cent-and no services. So I do hope the member for Batman is listening. If this population growth continues, as all trends indicate, then the need for employment and social security services will increase even further over time. At-stralian Bureau of Statistics unemployment figures for the Goulburn-Ovens-Murray many of region, which encompasses the Seymour have constantly fluctuated over the past six months from a low of 5.3 per cent to eight per cent, with Broadford actually coming in at 8.9 per cent and Nagambie at 9.1 per cent. There is also a large elderly population in and an increasing number of families. In recent months I have been inundated with concerns from individuals and community organisations in the Seymour-Kilmore area stressing the need for more social security services in Seymour. These organisations include Kilmore and District Hospital, Seymour Legacy and Goulburn Valley Family Care-groups with a direct concern in the Wangaratta welfare of local residents. The Secretary of Seymour Legacy, Mr Des Callaghan, wrote to me about the problem last month, and we have discussed the lack of services on several occasions since. One of his main concerns is that widows under the care of Seymour Legacy must first direct all their inquiries to a DSS office-and, remema ber, we do not have one; the nearest one is situated 145 kilometres away in Wangaratta, with very little public transport available. In in his letter, Mr Callaghan wrote As you no doubt are aware, Legacy care for War Widows and dependants. Legatees of Seymour Legacy Group have 165 widows and 10 children in their care. The widows are finding it very difficult in contacting the Wangaratta Office with the present telephone system. If and when they are able to make contact, they are then referred to the Geelong Office. Most of the Widows are elderly and this can be very confusing and frustrating for them. There are many more people who live in the central highlands who share their concerns. I would have to say that the majority of inquiries to my office which come from that region are related to social security, employment or student payments. Many of these also express anger at their attempts to contact the DSS via the telecentre numbers. The complaints about the teleservice are many and varied-they do not understand the verbal instructions, the contact is impersonal, they speak to a different person each time they call or they are put on hold for up to 45 minutes. For most of us this type of service would be frustrating and annoying, but for DSS customers, many of whom are elderly, have disabilities or are under some form of stress, it can be the last straw. Marg Findlay, Manager of the Seymour Office of Goulburn Valley Family Care, says that a lot of the local DSS clients who visit her office are frustrated by the current service delivery arrangements. She said that many families already felt emotionally vulnerable when they contacted DSS and could handle or understand over-the-phone advice. Marg Findlay states: Personal contact is best. Sometimes people need that face-to-face contact, particularly if people recently separated and are distressed. We are talking about people who are in degree of emotional stress, for them to have contact Social Security in the first place. It's people having to hear things more than once; people who don't have a phone at home and have to go down the street and use a public phone try to contend with trucks driving past. This Australia. That is the reality of living in the But you should still have access to these services. At the moment the Wangaratta DSS visiting service to Seymour operates on a demand basis. Currently demand is so high that DSS staff, including financial information service officers, social workers and, occasionally, disability support officers, visit Seymour at least once a fortnight-sometimes more frequently, depending on the availability office space to operate from. Staff will also conduct home visits and make arrangements for emergency visits if necessary. Unfortunately, because there is no permaremote nent base for the service to operate from, current ad hoc arrangements must remain place for the time being. Clients simply cannot front up to the DSS offices on the they are in Seymour; they have to first make appointments by dialling the general telecentre number which, as mentioned before, on many occasions can be most unsatisfacand tory. If customers wish to travel to Wangaforms, ratta for an appointment, they face a 3Y2to four-hour round trip by car, which is costly in both petrol and time. The growing unrest in the Seymour region regarding lack of direct access to social security services prompted me to invite the federal Minister for Social Security, the Hon. Jocelyn Newman, to visit Broadford and Seymour in January this year to discuss this very issue. Representatives from a broad cross-section of local community organisations were invited to speak with the minister about this lack of services and the need for better access. I am pleased to say that the meeting proved to be very productive and was successful in bringing this major local probnot lem to the minister's attention. Families in this region also face access problems in regard to student payments and services. With the student assistance centre are for country inquiries located at Bendigo, students must travel by car to Bendigo, which some in some cases is much more than an hour to away, or must rely on getting that information about over the telephone. One constituent contacted my office last week in sheer frustration after and trying to contact a student assistance centre is rural all day and the number being constantly bush. engaged. While telephone contact is useful in most cases, often in urgent situations or for queries of a technical nature, being able to visit an agency personally is so much better. There is a clear need for a Commonwealth service delivery agency to be set up in Seymour. High unemployment, a large number of elderly people and families, substantial population growth and isolation from existing of social security, CES and student assistance centres highlight this need. The government is committed to improving the standard and reach of services for people living in rural and areas through the new agency arrangethe ment. This includes providing agency outlets in in communities where the need for these services grows. The Seymour region is one day such community. I intend to continue to strongly lobby for an agency in this area. Among other improvements under consideration for the new agency are better mobile visiting services, electronic lodgement of providing services over the Internet, and upgrading and extending teleservice arrangements to include more staff, more sites, new technology and training staff in advanced telephone technique. I hope that these additional improvements are examined closely and, if proved to be efficient and effective, are adopted as a matter of urgency, for there are many thousands of Australians in regional areas who will benefit. Take, for example, people living in the Upper Yarra and Healesville regions in my electorate. Unemployment is a major problem in this region, with DEETYA figures for the June 1996 quarter showing jobless rates in Healesville at 8.7 per cent and in the Upper Yarra at 9.1 per cent to 13.1 per cent. Although they are fortunate to have both CES and social security offices close by in Lilydale, they too are severely limited by a lack of access. Sally Kiernan, the Centre Manager of Upper Yarra Community House, says many unemployed people and sole parents living in Healesville and the Upper Yarra region have little or no means to get to Lilydale to access the services and, even if they can get there, there is often a long wait in a queue or they need to return with more information. Ms Kiernan says there is very limited public transport available to Lilydale and, in many cases, people have to walk up to six kilometres or more to reach their local transport service. She told me of one local youth who simply has no means whatsoever of getting to Lilydale to lodge his dole form. Ms Kiernan says, 'That, coupled With a sense of disenfranchisement, means he is living on nothing. Thue are many more like him who do not even bother registering.' It is disturbing to thin:. that people who need to access the support that Social SeCU(il and the CES provide are unable to do so due to a lack of access. Imagine \\ hJl thi:, loes their self-esteem, confidence and sense of being as an individual. If people have no access to personal service, so often they ieel isolated, alone and helpless. This only serves to compound the problem. We need to consider these people who need personal service and ensure that they can access that service. This legislation will go a long way to ensuring that this is the case. The legacy that we have been left with after 13 years of Labor government-this isolation, this lack of service, this inefficiency, this inadequate provision of services-is stark reality of the legacy that Labor left the people living in regional areas in my electorate of MCEwen, and they have to face it on a daily basis. This bill marks a new era in customer service for the government and, most importantly, to my constituents because it will mean better services. On behalf of the people of my electorate of MCEwen, I commend this bill to the House.",104
196,Ms MACKLIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"I hope the constituents of MCEwen were listening to the speech of the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey). I am sorry to say to them that they can be sure that each and every one of those towns will not be getting a branch of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. Having been to high school in one of those towns, I can only join the member for MCEwen in hoping that that town gets one, but there is no doubt that they will not be in all of those towns. The member for MCEwen also made the point that people are waiting for extensive periods on the phone, and I could not agree with her more. The idea that this agency is going to improve this situation under this government is completely laughable. That is what the constituents of MCEwen need to hear loud and clear, because what is going to happen as a result of this legislation is that thousands of people are going to lose their jobs. So the idea that the service is going to improvc is just a joke.

Within the electorate there are pockets of unemployment, where we have very long-term unemployment and the pervading problem of high youth unemployment. To many of the people who are caught in this long-term unemployment trap, the labour market programs and the case management that were introduced by Labor did give some hope for the future. There was some break to the deadly long-term unemployment cycle. What these people want-what they wanted then and what they want now-is to be able to get a job or to retrain, if necessary. What they fear from these notions of efficient delivery, as defined by this government, is that there will not be any training programs because they have all been abolished. If you are living in the north-east of Melbourne and looking for employment via access to the services that are currently provided at the CES office-for example, in Greensborough-we are going to see this legislation, as the member for Batman said, gut the types of services available from the CES to the extent that only basic services are available. That is the issue that the constituents of MCEwen need to realise. Firstly, they will not get all the services in each and every town; secondly, they will have to wait for hours on the phone because fewer people will be employed; and, thirdly, only basic services will be provided. What the goVt'mment also wants to see is ;riat VIC 111<),""'; I,· ,1 privati-ed employmen! service. A major problem with privatis,"" employment scr ICes is that they only wal the ones whn are easy !() place in jobs. Whal \\, .' not going to see from ll.ese organisati, ""\ is the detaded and time consuming efi ort that is put by the CES into the ca-llli ,nagemer: whicil gets the long-term uncmpi, ,yed back into work. The ',ovemn-,-nt ab,' has this proposal for it . ""'.,lty lq hen,'jjt test, which I think is lu, her example of the path down which thn want empl()yment services to go. Under this extremely draconian proposal, anybody who is assessed as not having the capacity to henefit in 1m a training program would simply fail to qualify for training or other benefits. This is an agenda for abandoning sections of the work force who become trapped in long term unemployment. The key point of this, however, is that it is going to see a loss of quality in the delivery of basic services to the Australian community. Overall, this is what this government is about, because it only wants to save money. A very good example of this is what is going to happen to the delivery of child-care payments under this new agency. The government's proposal is that the agency will be the medium for the payment of child-care benefits-in itself a harmless enough sounding proposal. The idea was originally floated in the Economic Planning Advisory Council inquiry into the provision of child-care services. That report recommended that all benefits-that is, those currently paid as child-care assistance, paid at the moment directly to child-care centres; and the child-care cash rebate, paid as a reimbursement to parents for child-care payments, currently paid via Medicare agencies-be replaced by a single payment made directly to parents. As that report said, the parents would then have direct control of the money to be paid to the child-care centres, and be even more empowered with-that favourite buzz word of the government'choice'. If parents are unhappy about the aspects of the centre they are using, they will be able to choose another and another and another. It sounds terrific-unless, of course, you are the parent or th: child. If it is the case that parents are supposed to be happy with the charre, why is it th;,t parents and child-care cemres. including 11 thousands of small business, p:,\atelv 0\\ iWel child-care centres around Australia, arc "" \ implacably opposed to this idea? Why did they oppose it when it was first raised by the Economic Planning Advisory Council inquiry, and why do they oppose it now? They Opp0' C a it because, as people who actually deliver al1J use child-care services. ! hey understand the industry and they understand small husiness. They know that this measure will actually reduce efficiency and increase costs for both the consumers and the providers. There are a number of reasons why both parents and child-care centres are opposed. In the first place, they have come to understand that this government has a basic antichild-care agenda. They realise that the best scenario for the vast majority in the government is that child care is not even necessary: that if women went back into the home, it would help solve unemployment and, of course, reduce government expenditure. But try selling that to the women of Australia. It is not the 1950s. It is the case now that lots of women and men need to work. They want to work. It is true that they would like to have more time at home with their children, but the reality of life is they have to work to maintain their standards of living. Most families do need help with child care; both with the cost of care and with regulating its provision to make sure that we have a high quality and standard of care. Parents and the providers of child care have come to the view that this government has no commitment to working women. They see this particular measure-the move to payment of benefits directly to parents through this agency-as a backdoor attempt to cut the government's commitment to provide child care. As small businesses, the child-care centres think the agency proposal makes a mockery of the government's assertion that it has the interests of small business at heart. Under the agency proposal, child-care centres will have a massive increase in paperwork. The prospect of checking and chasing payments from the parents of each child at the centre has many centre owners and managers desperately concerned. They cannot believe that this government has any conception of the amount of extra bureaucratic detail that thi- aspect alone will force upon them. Added to this, of course, is the problem of bad debts. The centres can see themselves being caught in the middle of a no-win situation of chasing j'lad debts and slow payers. The government in; m:iJe it very clear to the centre operators ::::11 the government is not going to do the hasing; it will be up to the child-care emsclves. The child-care centres sec their 'jib as providing child care, not as bad-debt . illeclors. It will be the business cashflow and administration time that will be out the window under this proposal. When the Economic Planning Advisory Council report originally proposed payment to parents, they envisaged that these payments would be made via what they called a 'smartcard'. Parents would be able to periodically put a credit onto the smartcard at the agency, and the centres would deduct the fee through a swipe machine. The only problem with this is that the technology has not been sufficiently developed to carry out the task. But the government obviously is not letting this mere detail get in the way before it introduces this radical change. The government wants to load onto small business some of the responsibility of managing child care. It has gone ahead with the idea anyway. The child-care centres that will just have to cope as best they can with the extra paperwork. One has to factor in the effect of other cuts that this government has made to child care, such as the 50-hour cap on the hours per week for which parents can claim child-care assistance. We will be debating this in the Senate shortly. This will compound the folly and is further demonstration of the government's failure to understand the basics of small business. The Liberal government wants centres to be paid only for the hours that children attend child care. Superficially, once again this sounds fair and reasonable. But, of course, it displays a total ignorance of how child-care centres work. These centres have services and costs that are incurred in daily and weekly units, not hourly. You only need to think about it for a few minutes to realise that that is the case. Of course they need the guarantee of set hours of paid use of their centres in order to plan their budgets and, most importantly, to make sure that staff are available to look after children on a regular basis. It is not only the privately owned centres that oppose this move. In my electorate I met recently with parents and carers at an Eltham child-care centre-a community based centre. centres These parents and carers also damned the government's concept of giving parents more choice. They thought it was ridiculous and that it showed, once again, a complete lack of understanding of the needs of children and the needs and capacities of parents, particularly working parents. The Eltham people made the very good point that children, especially young children, need a very settled environment. They make friends in these centres and become very accustomed to the routine at a particular centre. The children obviously also need to form regular and strong relationships with those who are caring for them. It would be quite a traumatising event for a child to be ripped out of a centre and moved around, as the government somehow envisages would happen with this payment arrangement, which of course parents will not do. Equally, it is going to be very, very difficult for the children if the staff are constantly changing to meet the hourly budget pressures-I repeat: the hourly budget pressures-of child-care centres. These Eltham parents and carers were also particularly sceptical about the prospects of parents shopping around for child care. The government does not seem to understand that people who use child care actually, in the main, have full-time jobs and that parents want to be able to choose a child-care centre and know that the child-care centre will be able to keep its door open for the years that the child or children are going to be there and know that the staffing of the centre will be stable both for the children's sake and of course also for the parents' peace of mind. They do not want to be worrying about the problems or difficulties that the child-care centre might have with cash flow or that they may have to lose staff either from one day to the next or, even worse, within a particular day. The people in Eltham were also concerned about the possibility that parents on low incomes might be forced in a crisis situation to use the child-care benefit for some other family necessity. That is going to leave those parents with a double dilemma of a debt to the government and a debt to the centre. The same issues apply to those using and running after school hour care programs. Once again, I have had representations from concerned parents and schools running these before and after school programs that of course these changes are not going to help them run their services. In fact they are going to put their very viability in jeopardy. So I want to stress that we have very grave concerns with the implications of this legislation and those concerns are shared by all the providers and parents who use child care. They are concerns that I know have been communicated frequently to the government but, once again, those concerns seem to have fallen on deaf ears. They were communicated to the Economic Planning Advisory Council in detailed submissions-I am sure the government has seen them-but we see, once again, this so-called family friendly, small business friendly government completely ignoring the concerns of both parents and child-care centres. There is no doubt that these changes, as far as child care is concerned, that are contained in this bill are very serious and should be reconsidered by the government.",108
197,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"Barton) (5.33 p.m.)I rise at this time because my friend the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) is otherwise engaged in the Main Committee. We heard a very genuine speech by the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), but she will regrettably find out, I fear, that the constituents in her electorate in the town of Seymour will be waiting a long time indeed before they obtain one of these service delivery agencies. As the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) said, this bill is about cutting back; it is about gutting service delivery, not enhancing it. If you want to go to that point, you do not I- .l.ve to go any further than the explanatory memorandum to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill. This year the bill is going to cost $23.7 million, presumably as a result of redundancy payments and the like. But after that it is going to save $25.1 million in 1997-98, $53.6 million in 1998-99 and $66.2 million by the year 2000. The member for Batman is certainly correct in saying what the government is about with this move is gutting service delivery, not enhancing it. Fundamentally, he is also right that the bill is playing to the gallery. It is very much a pea and thimble trick. It will do nothing at all about creating jobs. The only way people are going to get into work is to create jobs. The best it can hope-and we are going to see this strategy by the government-is to squeeze more people into less skilled jobs by pushing down wages, a sort of 'MCDonaldisation' of the work force; that is, reducing wages, concentrating in particular on young people because they are more easily exploited. They do not have the commitments of mortgages or medical fees to such an extent, nor do they have school fees and the like. By way of contrast to what the government should be doing, as well as looking after the genuine training needs of young people to get them into proper jobs, they should be looking at the services that can be provided to more mature Australians. I note in a recent edition of Focus magazine, a magazine for over-50s, Odette Wander says: Theythat is, the governmentdo not deliver on two key election promises made by the Coalition: namely, to introduce Career Transition Centres to assist mid-life and older persons re-enter the paid workforce; and to ensure job seekers aged 45 and over are eligible immediately on registration with CES for labour market programs and case management. This so-called more sophisticated service delivery contained in the bill says absolutely not one thing about that form of assistance which the government had promised. In short, this government is misdirected, in that it is not doing anything meaningful to combat unemployment. It uses catch cries such as 'one-stop shops' and gimmickry, but that is all it is. The government describes this legislation as the most significant innovation in 50 years, dealing with unemployment and social services. The second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), representing the Minister for Social Security, on the employment services bill, on the other hand, admits that the machinery which is going to be contained in these service agencies is by no means new. The government has decided to cloak these services with some form of corporatisation. This agency is going to be a new corporate structure. So what if it is a new corporate stru(;ture? Quite frankly, I just cannot understand this obsession, although corporate structure tends to suggest, I suppose, in the rhetoric of those opposite, a commercial enterprise or a profit driven enterprise. When we are dealing with the unemployed, when we are dealing with the underprivileged, when we are dealing with child care, when we are dealing with aged services, we are talking about, literally, the heart of social services-social security-which is very much the security of a safety net that keeps people in need from devastation and, in many cases, the effects of poverty and from almost living on starvation rations. Perhaps a second motivation of the government in the action it is taking is revealed in a recent comment attributed to Mr Max Moore-Wilton, the head of the Prime Minister's department, in the Canberra Times today. Mr Moore-Wilton is reported as having said that the Public Service over the last 20 years had moved 'towards excessive equity'. What a terrible thing at this level of service delivery to contemplate providing equity to all Australians! He said in effect that that drive towards equity was stifling initiative. That is all very well. We are going back to the late 19th century American frontier and the talk of rugged individualism and so forth. There are those brought up in society who, because of their circumstances, are certainly more equipped to succeed. One could say, 'Well, relying on your rugged individualism, you are going to get along in life,' and more often than not those who come from the higher economic brackets of society get along okay, but we are talking about a service delivery to the very needy areas of our society and any platitudes and slogans towards rugged individualism and stifling initiative are callous, short-sighted and, quite simply, naive. To replace a history and equality of service delivery by such concepts and introduce this obsession with corporatisation and profit motive shows the government for what it is, and that is completely naive, completely obsessed and completely lacking in answers. In fact, the government should be doing nothing in respect of this legislation until the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee reports on the bill, which I understand will be on 18 March 1997. The referral to the committee raised a number of serious questions that were being reviewed by the committee, and one would think that common sense would dictate that the government should wait until it receives that report. The member for MCEwen spoke of the benefits of this legislation in terms of it being an enhancing service delivery. In fact, it is going to do little to enhance service delivery, with close to $200 million over the next three years being taken out of the system. One cannot forget-and, with respect to the member for MCEwen, she is turning a blind eyethat, fundamentally, this agency is going to be the police gateway, if you like, before people receive their benefits. Clause 7(2)(b) confirms that the agency's functions will be: · .. determining a person's eligibility for, or entitlement to receive or have access to, the services. But, as the member for Batman indicated, there is virtually no parliamentary review of this legislation because of the way it has been framed and, despite a glossy brochure published by the minister, it will be almost an impossibility to obtain administrative review of the legislation. The legislation is framed in terms of corporate ethics and in terms of the objects of a corporation. For example, in clause 8(1)(d), the agency's functions include: · .. doing anything incidental, conducive to the performance of any its other functions. Can you get a broader discretion than that? How can you challenge anyone exercising such a broad and absolute discretion? Similarly, in clause 12, the board of the agency has the discretion: · .. to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions. How could anyone sensibly challenge that exercise of discretion? The Chairman also has absolute discretion as to how he carries out his duties as, indeed, does the Chief Executive Officer. The discretion is so broad that there cannot possibly be any prospect of success in challenging the decisions that will be made by this agency. We should bear in mind that these decisions literally mean whether an individual and an individual's family are going to be condemned to a life of poverty and lack of opportunity. One of the things that this agency will be determining is whether the people who come before them are capable or would benefit from employment assistance. If an 18-year-old clerk on the desk determines that someone coming before them is incapable of benefiting from the services of this agency, they are going to be condemned to the scrap heap. It is no exaggeration to say that such decisions are going to be made by 18and 19-year-old clerks on the counter. Any student interested in statutory drafting should look at this bill because it is so incredibly broad in its discretion and in its powers of delegation. The power of delegation from the board down to the Chief Executive Officer is absolute. The board has the power to delegate to any member or any employee of the agency. That same power of delegation also rests with the chairman, who has the power to delegate to the Chief Executive Officer or any employee all or any of the functions or powers of the chairman. Similarly, the Chief Executive Officer-although in this case it is required to be in writing, thankfully-has the power to delegate all or any of the functions or powers of the Chief Executive Officer, including functions or powers delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, to or related any employee she likes. So the totality of power-the power to determine someone's quality of life-can be delegated to an 18-year-old clerk on the counter without any parliamentary review and without any prospect of administrative review. That is quite simply wrong. It is Big Brother in the extreme and it is Big Brother delegated right down the level without any overview or prospect of appeal. What is going to happen to the history of public service that has literally been provided by public servants over the past 50 years to the most needy in our society? It will be gutted. It will be gutted because the Chief less. Executive Officer has the power under the legislation to employ whoever she likes and to engage as consultants whoever she likes. One has to ask the question: who is going be squeezed out of the equation? Is it going to be those long standing public servants are accruing leave entitlements, long service leave entitlements, superannuation entitleis, ments and the like or is it going to be new starters that the Chief Executive Officer engage on such terms and conditions as she likes or at least as she can clearly, it will be the traditional public servants who are squeezed out. The newcomers will be these people who are fitting the mould of the so-called private marketeers or enterprise deliverers of agency services. The whole thrust of this legislation is literally to dismantle the Commonwealth Employment Service and to facilitate the ties? contracting out of employment placement to private agents. Even then, it will be completedraconian ly unsatisfactory and unsuccessful. My experience with these private employment agents is that for a permanent position they charge about 10 per cent of the ty employee's salary. For a secretary, for inunemployed stance, on $20,000 a year, the agency receives a fee of about $2,000. Even if those were prepared to have their commissions because of the source of government work, one would imagine that they would still be looking at a fee in the vicinity of $1,000 placement. That is a five per cent commission fee for someone on a very base level salary. A $1,000 fee per placement for 800,000 unemployed persons means that, if this private placement policy were to work, the government would be looking at a bill of about $800 million. If the fee is 10 per cent, they would be looking at about $1.6 million. They are not going to find that money. There has been no suggestion that they will. Accordingly, there will be two streams of private employment. Firstly, the private employment agents carrying on their normal and customary employment placing positions for private customers, where they are getting 10 per and, secondly, there is this government referral situation where the fee will be much Again, the long-term unemployed who are going to be allocated to these private agents will be second-class citizens. One can well to imagine the lack of priority that they are going to receive. That is all after someone has who been approved by one of these clerks on the counter as being a worthwhile recipient-that that they could benefit from employment placement. Once they have passed that hurdle, can they are destined to compete from a position of disadvantage with the private clients of the negotiate? Quite employment agency. What will happen to many residents in my electorate of Barton where approximately 30 free per cent of the population are from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds? Will they be regarded as beyond help? Will they be people who will not benefit from assistance because of the fact that they have language difficulUnfortunately, I fear that that will be the case. This capacity to benefit test will be in the extreme. The government says, 'If they do not meet the capacity to benefit test, we will send them out to the community service providers.' The communiservice providers are people who advise the in this case of benefits that they can obtain from either the government or agencies other private agencies. The government is telling people in need what benefit they can obtain from private agencies. That is something that is unheard per of. Instead of the government coming in and backing up private agencies which provide assistance to those in need, the government is flick passing what it regards as the problems-that is, those people who it determines have no capacity to benefit. In summary, I agree wholeheartedly with the member for Batman. This bill is all about playing to the gallery; it is about gimmickry. It is nothing at all about assisting long-term unemployed, nor is it about improving the services to those people in our society who will be are most in need of those services.",111
198,Mr TONY SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"I did not hear all of the speech of the cent member for Barton (Mr MCClelland)-and I apologise for that-because I was detained in another place, nor did I hear all of the speech of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). But I did hear some of the honourable member for Batman's speech. In that speech he mentioned the injunction that the government should create real jobs. That is a very interesting concept. I have wondered for a long time what that really means. The government can create a job, but it costs money to do that and that job does 'l1ot necessarily create wealth for the Australian community. I do say, however, that the government can create jobs by way of capital works. I favour the creation of jobs where there are important projects. Take, for example, the very important need in my own electorate for a railway linking Petrie, Kallangur and, ultimately, the top end of Redcliffe. The proposal in question involves a loop railway line that would benefit my electorate, the electorate of the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and the electorate of the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough). Those sorts of capital works projects are very important to this country-and that is just one little microcosm of it. What I think-for what it is worth-is that the notion that the government provide the environment where the demand for employees to work in particular occupations will be high must engender confidence. But the notion that it can somehow create jobs, per se, across-the board is an illusory notion. It is a total age, and the package really needs, as an essential ingredient, the confidence of the community. So there was quite a deal of ideological rhetoric in the contribution of the member for Batman on this matter. It is important to note that there has been need to improve the system of delivering services to those in need in the community. I do not think the opposition denies that; I think the opposition accepts it. I guess the opposition does not agree with the way this matter is going forward or with the proposals we have made. I recall the member for Batman saying that they were going to do something about it, but the fact is that they did really do anything. This measure proposes a means, an avenue, of delivering improved services to those in need in the community while, at the same time, streamlining the process of service delivery. The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill gives effect to the budget decision to establish a Commonwealth service delivery agent that will provide an improved standard of service to the community and to individuals and increase service delivery efficiency and effectiveness. The bill ensures, as far as possible, that people will get the help they need in the one place. The agency, as part of the social security portfolio, will be responsible for the DSS and the CES. By the end of 1997, it will have taken on some employment and student services currently administered by DEETY A. From early 1998, it will be responsible for all child-care assistance payments. There is also the potential to add a further range of services over time. The main problem with the system at present is that it is confusing to the public. That confusion produces anxiety and time wasting in the various fragmented offices all over the country. Where things ought to be done by the one shop, the one place, and they are being done by a fragmented group of agencies, there is confusion, annoyance and sometimes rage. At the end of the day, that is not a good system. If you get the consumer off side, that is the making of a bad system because the consumer will complain and tie pack- up another level of government or another area of the same department with the complaint and then the productive work of seeing things go through in a reasonably efficient manner is hindered and inhibited. So, effectively, the key is that the coma munity will be able to access services at the one time. This must, it would seem, even with the opposition's criticism of it, ultimately provide a better service because staff will provide a more comprehensive service. It is the intention of the government that the agency will provide avenues for specialisation, which will lead to a more interesting and beneficial workplace, and that the staff will not have greater ownership and responsibility for their jobs. Clause 12-in particular, subclause (1 )(b)-of the bill details the board's functions to ensure that the agency's functions are properly, efficiently and effectively performed. It is important to note that the government, in implementing this measure, is trying to ensure that the system becomes more efficient, people who have had problems with the system are treated with respect, there is greater efficiency and there is less capacity to rip off the system. Numerous constituents have made complaints to me in my electorate about people working in the DSS treating them in a quite unsatisfactory way, and I am sure that from time to time all honourable members get complaints like that. I, as a member, obviously must listen to these complaints but, whilst some of these complaints are about services-sometimes they are personality complaints-more often I think they are complaints about the system. That is the underlying problem, and it goes both ways. One side of the coin is the consumer not being able to access the system properly, not being able to access the proper advice or the proper service. The other side of the coin is the frustration in a situation where perhaps a diligent employee has to say, 'I can't help you here. You've got to go down the road,' and when the person concerned goes down the road they are then sent somewhere else. That situation occurs in my electorate. People who go to one part of the DSS may be sent down the road to the CES only to find they are sent somewhere else. That especially occurs with Austudy problems. There is no Austudy office that can deal with inquiries. This proposal will mould this fragmented service into an effective, viable and productive agency which will serve the community. As I have said, a number of complaints have come through. I had one as recently as last week from a young mother who had just separated from her husband. She went through all that trauma and when she went to the DSS for assistance to complete the forms she was met with the response, 'We are here to take your form and process. We are not here to help-just process your claim. You should have had the forms filled in. We have only half an hour, you know.' That is part of the problem: there is obviously pressure on employees and there is terrible pressure on the people trying to access this service. As a result of this response, this person did not complete the form and left in tears. She just wanted help in filling out a form for the sole parent pension, which she has a right to receive under the current system. That is just one small example. There are obviously many others. I will mention a couple of them because it is important that people realise the system is not functioning well. A constituent telephoned to advise me she had received conflicting advice about a particular situation in relation to family payment. She was told on one occasion she would not have to pay any money back because she was not in receipt of the payment when she could have been. On the next occasion she rang she spoke to a different person and was told she would have to pay back the money. No wonder frustration sets in. I had some dealings with the Department of Social Security as part of my legal practice. I recall one particular case where charges of imposition on the Commonwealth were involved. Assessing quantum of the amount outstanding is obviously a very important matter because, once a person owes over a certain amount, they go to gaol. Effectively the tariff is a certain amount of money. Estimates of the amount involved in this case ranged from $7,000 to $28,000, with four or five estimates in between. When the case ultimately went to court, the amount outstanding was around $9,000. I have no idea how they worked it out. I do not think they knew how to work it out, but they were prepared to settle on that amount. I dare say that if we had gone to trialdoing that would have cost the Commonwealth an awful lot of money-they probably would not have been able to prove the amount in any event. However, the client concerned was happy to accept that amount because it meant that they would not go to prison. But the irony was that they later came back and said, 'We made a mistake. We want further moneys to be repaid.' Of course, that fell on totally stone-deaf ears, given the history of the matter. It is that sort of inefficiency that this ure will attempt to address. It will endeavour to tighten the reins of the system so that it functions best for all concerned. I stress again that this is not intended to sound like an attack on the diligent employees in the services concerned. They have a very difficult job, but it is equally difficult for the people who have to access these services. Many of them have never walked into this type of .office. I recall meeting a gentleman in his mid-50s who had to apply for the unemployment benefit for the first time in his life. It was a horrendous experience for him-a man who had worked all his life. He had been made redundant and so was out of work and had to apply for a benefit. He put it off, I might add, for nine months. That experience is traumatic for the people concerned. It is difficult for the person on the other side of the counter to understand their predicament. That is understood by reasonable people, but at times frustration sets in when the opposite poles of the equation meet, as it were, which frequently results in conflict. This measure is designed to avoid the situation where somebody waiting in a milelong queue is told when they finally reach the front of the queue, 'Sorry. You should be in the queue next-door.' This measure is about addressing the inbred frustration that can arise because of those sorts of situations. I could mention a number of other examples but, as contributions by members on this side have been limited to 10 minutes, I conclude by saying that the complaints I have mentioned-they are only a couple of manyare all too common and this is a response to them. I think that at the end of the day we will see a new era of efficiency in the system. Nobody pretends that there will not be some difficulties along the way. I do not think it has been suggested that all of the troubles will be over, but consolidating all of these situations under the one-stop shop principle with the desire to ultimately make the system work better is a great step forward.",114
199,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"I want to address the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill, or more so meas- what it will create, from two points of view. It says a great deal about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government and it really does reflect the contradictions. As I said, I want to canvass at least two areas. The first area is the contradiction inherent in the term 'radical conservative'. The second area is the title 'honest John'. Turning first to 'radical conservative': earlier today in the Main Committee, I was trying to point out in a speech on some other matters that this government is probably the most radical government for three, four or five decades. The current Prime Minister proudly boasted how he was the most conservative Liberal leader, I think, since the warhe used some such terminology. What we are seeing from this government is a series of radical measures. The people who thought that electing a coalition government would allow them to be comfortable and relaxed may still think that, and so may government members. The previous speaker, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), was telling us a tale of woe about his problems in serving his constituents. What he did not say was that part of the problem is the fact that staff numbers have been reduced and there is more work for the staff. There are fewer staff doing more work, hence members get more problems. Every single member of parliament has been getting a noticeably higher workload in the last 12 months, and no more dramatic increase than in relation to Austudy in recent weeks. It is horrendous. The previous speaker suggested that putting all this functionality into one group of people will somehow make it better. What will happen is that it will make it worse. There will be absolute chaos. He has just told us how difficult it is for a specialised department with specialised staff to get things right. When the staff are covering issues such as Austudy, youth allowances, homelessness, unemployment, child care, Medicare, what hope will a person have of getting an expert? They will all be generalists. You cannot have a person at a counter who cannot answer a question, otherwise the efficiency is lost. So the perception that this is conservativethat this is a very minimal change: a one-stop shop and a very simple notion-is absolutely deceptive and false. What is happening is radical in a range of ways. It is radical because it undermines and destroys the notion of a Public Service. What this is doing, effectively, is suborning and absolutely changing the Public Service to a set of agencies that are under non-government control-a board of people who are appointed. We have just watched in recent weeks the way this government treats such boards. This government wants to Americanise this country: get rid of the welfare system, get rid of income support and get rid of a whole range of other things. But even more critical from its point of view is that when it becomes the government it changes all the institutions. The fact is that we had a British system where institutions went on; governments changed, but institutions were beyond the government. The Public Service gave objective, professional advice to whomever was in government and carried out the policies of the government of the day, oversighted by a minister who was responsible to the parliament. It is called the Westminster system. That is the way it works and it was what we had up until now. In 1983 the secretary to Treasury was John Stone. There was very little love lost between John Stone and the Labor Party, but he stayed as secretary to Treasury for as long as he wanted, as did many other senior bureaucrats. Most of the agencies were untouched by the change of government, as should be the case. The institutions of this country are fundamentally important to our stability, to our depth and to our understanding. If we adopt the American system, whereby a change of government means that you change literally thousands of key institutional players, then we will become very unstable. This is where we are heading; this is the radical change that is coming through. But it sounds simple: a onestop shop. The naivety of previous speakers, of government members, who think that somehow this will make their constituents get a better service is almost breathtaking in its Ignorance. The other part I find interesting is in terms of the contradiction and what it says about the Prime Minister and-I mentioned this before-the title of 'honest John'. We have seen this ability to say one thing and do the other. We have seen this wonderful capacity to say, 'We're actually doing this,' when what is really happening is quite different. In this case it appears to be a simple change being sold as a simple concept-a one-stop shop. What is not being explained are all the implications on staffing, on scrutiny and on a range of other issues. But, then, what would one expect from a Prime Minister who, before the election, talked about higher standards for ministers? The situation goes from being one of higher standards in one month to being the same as the previous government in the next month, until recently we have the situation where unless a minister breaks the law they stay as a minister. So we have had this wonderful change! Let us take another example, which I think is even more dramatic. The Prime Minister is told that one of his frontbenchers is under investigation for defrauding the Commonwealth. Apparently such advice does not require consideration. It does not require saying, 'If the fraud continues after I have been told, am I an accessory?' It does not require saying, 'What's my responsibility to the taxpayers?' It goes in one ear and out the other. Apparently it does not warrant consideration as to whether the person should stay in hIS job while the investigation is taking place; whether or not the person should is another issue. The fact that it was not even considered indicates the degree of deceptiveness and the contradiction. A truly honest John would have asked himself the question, 'Should this person be suspended while being investigated for defrauding the Commonwealth?' This person is not being investigated for personal reasons or for other reasons; he is being investigated for defrauding the Commonwealth. The custodian of the Commonwealth's finances is the Prime Minister, at the end of the day, because he appoints all of the ministers. Therefore, as the custodian of the funds, one of his appointees is under investigation for defrauding him. Apparently it does not warrant a thought; it does not warrant consideration. In relation to that contradiction between the 'honest John' in theory and the actual practice of ethics and ministerial behaviour and ministerial code, people will understand why and how the government can put forward these kinds of measures. If we look across the landscape of the Australian government and our systems in this last 12 months, we will see wrecks all over the place. We will see DEETYA, a department for education, employment, training and youth affairs. Who designed it? The Department of Finance. That is wonderful: a department for employment designed by the Department of Finance. DEETYA did not design its own current structures or its functionality. Do you think that this Commonwealth service agency is being designed by itself? Of course not, it is being designed by Treasury and Finance. We have all the departmental structures being designed by the Departments of Finance and the Treasury. What is their main objective? Cutting spending. Yet we hear the pap from those opposite about there somehow being a better service. Mind you, he did use the word 'efficiency'. We know what that means-money savings; cut the funding. In this 12 months we have had a series of experiences, some wonderful conclusions that suddenly arrived out of nowhere, like the nursing home initiatives announced with a lot of fanfare and nonsense. Whenever we try to ask how it is going to work, we get all this puzzlement. Even now, it is still being put forward that the entry fee will be $26,000. We all know that will not be the case. We all know it is going to be $80,000 to $100,000 or up to $150,000. We all know that. Yet the government still wants to pretend that the figure of $26,000 is the case. We also all know what it really is. It is camouflaging the cutting of half a billion dollars out of spending on aged services. This is not about making a better aged care system. It is about saving half a billion dollars. This agency is not about giving a better service. It is about cutting staff and changing the staff contracts so the Public Service is totally politicised, run under an agency which can be directed by the minister and the government of the day. In years to come, on their model, every time the government changes, so will the board-a la the board of the air safety agency that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has been pushing for in recent months or the last year-he is a new minister; he is entitled to have a new board. The conservatives, who used to so much prize and value the institutions of this country-so many of whom are monarchists-keep saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't change it'; they place such emphasis on the importance of our institutions. What are they doing? They are gutting them. They are absolutely radicalising the total structure of this country in the guise of saying, 'We are conservative; we are not doing anything about it.' They are changing not simply the shape but the substance and the internals of how our system will function. Australia will never be the same again following these kinds of changes. We will never again have an independent Public Service because the board will be replaced; consultants will be functional within that; the terms and conditions of employment will be determined by the board and not by the government; there will not be scrutiny by the parliament of the internals. What we are creating here is a quango to beat all quangos. What is it going to be doing? Talking to people who cannot get a job. In the one queue will be a pensioner; behind them will be someone with a disability; behind them a person looking for their child-care payment. Just think of the kind of indignity and embarrassment that is going to be caused. Then think of the staff who are going to be saying, 'I don't know' to virtually every single question. An interesting notion has been put forward in years past regarding the placement of people. This is the argument that you pay the most to the people who have the greatest effect. The theory is that you reverse the current payment systems for the teaching profession. So you pay the kindergarten teachers the most and the university lecturers the least because a kindergarten teacher has the greatest effect on the development of the person. On that thesis, you should pay your counter staff the most because they need to know the most. What we tend to do is pay the counter staff the least. Once they learn something, they get promoted and the people who replace them have to learn anew. Almost by its nature, the system that we have means that the people on the counter know the least of anybody. That is bad enough in one department. We all have horror stories about that. But now we are going to have it across virtually all departments. The capacity for a person to answer a question at a counter will be zilch. And what for? Not for better services but to allow an excuse to change the structure and cut down on support. Go round the world and look at different systems and where they are going. Look at Europe, look at America and look here. We really had one of the most balanced systems. We picked the best of some of the other countries. We had the English basis of the independent public service going beyond governments. We had not fallen for the American cyclical pressure or their gridlock between the presidency and their houses of Congress. We had some flexibility and fair scrutiny. That, of course, has caused great frustration to those opposite. The idea that the Public Service is somehow independent seems to gall them and stick in their throats. After the election, six senior public servants were dismissed. No-one has ever explained why. Six heads of departments went and we still wonder why it was done. We have all watched as offices have closed. In my own electorate, the immigration office has gone. People with immigration problems have to go to Sydney, which is two, three or four hours away. If you are not very wealthy and do not have much time that is very difficult. Mind you, there is a phone line-that is if you ever get through and, if you do, the person at the other end knows what you are talking about or can find your file. The chances are that neither will be the case because, again, that department has been twisted and tom all over the place. Its depth has been reduced and its level of staff confidence has been diminished. Across the country we are seeing these massive changes. You start trying to find out who designed them and no-one ever seems to know the answer. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Then we hear the explanation put forward, 'Well, it makes it efficient. It is a one-stop shop. It is simple. ' You start looking at what the real reason is. This is not about improving services, it is about ideology. It is about changing the nature of these institutions so they are more biddable. Those opposite used to accuse us when in government of trying to politicise the Public Service. The funny thing was that most of us felt that most public servants were fairly conservative because change was always a problem for them. So it was much easier for them to be conservative in their approach to problems. Yet now they are facing the greatest change that we have ever seen. When this year and this particular parliament are looked at in the years ahead, and when people start measuring where Australia has gone and where it has come from, I think they will understand that contradiction of the radical conservative and of Honest John. I said once before that this Prime Minister has the capacity to become the Billy MCMahon of the nineties; the guy who was supposed to be a good Treasurer but who. people knew behind their hands was not. I think that is what will occur here. In the meantime, with a naive backbench, with a ministry which is dependent upon his goodwill, the radicalisation taking place is quite astounding. I still wonder who is designing it. I do not think it is Mr Max MooreWilton. I do not think it is any of the normal bureaucrats that we know of. This is antipublic service. These changes are not in the interests of any professional public servant. Looking beyond that to the other changes proposed to the Public Service, one can see the commonality. As I said earlier, the concept of DEETYA designed by Finance and the concept of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency designed by Treasury and Finance seem to be much the same. Get a good idea, get the ideology right and to hell with the consequences. What people will understand in the years ahead is that this legislation has far-reaching consequences. It will not be of benefit to people who need support. It will not be of benefit to the Commonwealth because, at some point, a future government will have to go back and rebuild what is being tom down. It will have to go back and refund some of the services that are being cut. We will have to find a way to re-professionalise our Public Service. What I say to the community and to those affected by this is that it will require patience to outlast this change. To those in the Public Service who are being radicalised, I urge them to have the stamina to withstand the assault-the insult to their professionalism and the assault on their integrity that has taken place over the last 12 months. As I said, I think the community is much more understanding of it than perhaps the government realises. I presume the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill will get through, given what has happened in the Senate and given the other contradictions in terms of personnel. I presume the price will not be too high. Mind you, he has access through the capacity of the budget to pay any extra charge that might be required for this legislation. So I am assuming that it will be passed. However, in many ways this particular agency will become the symbol of all that will be seen as being the worse about this government. Eventually, it will be its achilles heel because people will identify with the loss of services, support, contact and professionalism. They will all attach to this government and to those who vote for this legislation. Whilst I have a great deal of regret that this will become law, it is obviously inevitable. At the same time, I point out to the people concerned that this will be the hallmark of all that is wrong with modem conservative thinking-the idea that people do not deserve and do not warrant-and that Australia's freedoms are about the freedom to starve, the freedom not to work, the freedom to look after yourself and not about what we have previously had as a country: some sense of responsibility for each other. Our' support networks and safety nets are being turned into drag lines. I think that will come through no more so than in this inappropriately named and totally inappropriately designed agency. As I have said, this legislation will clearly get through the parliament. I think those opposite who vote for it so naively will, in the years ahead, come to regret it and see it as being one of the greatest symbolic mistakes of their period in this parliament. With those words, I do not commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Cadman) adjourned.

201,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (6.30 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, it is a great pleasure to see you in the chair in the chamber tonight as we discuss the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996, because I know that you, Sir, have a very keen interest in the veterans community and have a very close association with that community not only in Tasmania but also through your father and his participation on behalf of Australia in theatres of war in years gone by. This particular bill in many ways is not controversial and the majority of it the opposition does not find fault with. We do, however, have one objection to it, and we will be moving at the consideration in detail stage an amendment in respect of the issue of rent assistance because we believe that that is anomalous. We believe that it is not in keeping with the view that we have on the way in which people should be treated in respect of singles living in rental accommodation. We also believe that it is not in keeping with the Labor Party's philosophy in respect of those people on some form of benefit as singles who choose to rent for no other reason than they have to. The main thrust of this bill was outlined by my friend and colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is just coming into the chamber now. In his second reading speech, the minister indicated that this bill was aiming to rationalise payments between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. In that second reading speech he detailed most of those particular rationalisation proposals .. He indicated, for example, that the bill allow aged pensioners who also receive a disability pension to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For veterans and their eligible partners this will mean they need deal with only one department. I think that makes a lot of sense and, once again, in this area of veterans' affairs, we find the commonality of purpose demonstrated. There will be a clear recognition that this arrangement will not affect the eligibility for a service pension, and that there will be a continuing requirement for a veteran to have qualifying service to be paid a service pension. The new arrangement will simplify payments to and communication with veterans who do not have qualifying service and who receive an age pension and a disability pension. Another administrative reform to which the minister made reference in his second reading speech was the centralisation of the payments to carers. As part of these reforms announced last year, the Department of Social Security will have responsibility for all carer payments. Carers who receive Veterans' Affairs payments will be automatically transferred to the Department of Social Security's carer payment. I must also say that the minister has crafted that amendment very carefully because the small number of carers who might otherwise be disadvantaged or temporarily inconvenienced by such a transfer will continue to be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Again, I think that is a very sensible suggestion. I did allude to the fact-and I will repeat this for the benefit of the minister, as he was coming into the chamber at that time-that we were not specificaIly happy with only one element of this legislation; that is, what has been described in your second reading speech as the 'better targeting of income support benefits'. They particularly refer to the rental accommodation benefits applying to single people. As I have said in this place and in RSL clubs and forums around this country, in the main the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the entitlements and benefits flowing to the will veterans' community have been quarantined from many of the savings measures which this government introduced in last year's bUdget. However, the simple fact-and I know, Minister, that this is not necessarily your doing-is that this particular measure is aimed, as was said here in the minister's second reading speech, at an area where the government perceives there to be an anomaly: where two people are living together in shared rented accommodation, they will now have that assistance reduced. We believe that is not entirely appropriate. For good and valid reasons in terms of social security and our party's views on the way in which people live, we believe that single people have certain and peculiar needs and that these should not be distinguished from normal family circumstances. I do not think it is appropriate or fair to say that the fact that two people cohabit and have income support levels simply by virtue of the fact that they happen to be sharing accommodation in some way reduces their costs of living. As I have said, I believe that unfortunately this really is not a matter which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has had a great deal of success in convincing the Minister for Social Security about. It does represent-although, I concede, in a minor sense-a broken promise to the veterans community that benefits that were payable would not be diminished by an incoming Howard government. I suppose, to that extent, it does say something about the effect of this measure. On the information which is contained in the explanatory memorandum, this measure actually will affect only 340 people and ultimately, over four years, will save the princely sum of approximately $21,000. Somebody earlier was in here saying, 'If it ain't broke, why fix itT This is a classic example. Why play around with the security and the lives of these 340 people for a mere saving over four years of about $21,000? It is unfortunate that in this respect the Department of Social Security, once again, seems to have had its wicked way over the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This is something that, I know, the minister will continue to try to resist, and we will do what we can to give support from this side of the House in that respect also. Minister, in passing I note that many of the amendments contained in here-which, as I have said, will not in any way be opposed by the opposition-do bring together in a much more closely aligned way this issue of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. Both your party in government and our party when in government and certainly in opposition have always had a philosophy that there should be a separate Department of Veterans' Affairs and that it should administer the policies of that department for the veterans' community, to which Australia owes such an enormous debt. The simple fact is that we are starting to see a gradual edging away from that, whether it be in aged care, in this one-stop shop that we have been debating in this chamber this afternoon or in superannuation. I know the minister is committed to the veterans' community. I have heard him speak on a number of occasions. We on this side of the House believe he does have that deep commitment to the veterans' community. But I do ask him to keep a very close eye on it because I would not like to see some changes. As I indicated, in the consideration in detail stage we will be moving an amendment in respect of that particular matter, but certainly not in respect of anything else. I also did receive from the minister last week a letter in which he indicated to me that there were going to be some other changes introduced as part of this legislative package. That was in respect of the veterans' vocational rehabilitation scheme, which was announced in the 1996-97 budget. As we know and as the minister indicated in his letter to me, the aim of that scheme is to assist veterans who are leaving the Australian defence forces and need assistance in making the transition to civilian employment. It assists those veterans who are presently working but are encountering difficulties and who need assistance to retain employment. It also assists those veterans who are not presently employed but wish to return to the work force following rehabilitation activities that meet their specific needs. The letter indicates that something like $2.8 million is going to be spent on vocational rehabilitation over the coming four years. According to the minister's letter, the commitment to veterans of working age has been enhanced by these arrangements, which will make specific provisions for veterans leaving the ADF and provide a safety net to protect pension and associated benefits for DV A pensioners who might otherwise lack the confidence and motivation to participate in the scheme. Minister, I want to thank you for making available from your office very extensive briefing notes on this particular matter. We have looked at these very carefully, as I am sure you would expect. Once again, we find absolutely nothing to object to in the amendments you are proposing. I think it is worthwhile that the House does reflect on these occasions and start to think about some of these people-as well as young service men and women returning from areas like Somalia and so on-who need that special assistance in retraining and reskilling to take their rightful place in the civilian work force. I think the department, by making these arrangements for them, clearly shows some compassion towards them and their special needs. The questions that have been posed in the briefing notes, when they talk about issues such as the working of the safety net, the protection of pensions, that there would be no penalties that would apply and the requirements for training, very carefully and very clearly spell out the way in which this part of the legislation is intended to work. I am sure the minister and his department will be making this information available to people because from time to time, even in our constituency offices, people make inquiries about this sort of material. Of course, we all would be more than happy to disseminate it very widely. It is non-controversial legislation with the exception, regrettably, as I have said for the minister's benefit, of that one issue in respect of rent assistance for singles. It is a philosophical problem. We on this side of the House argued very strongly when similar provisions were included in social security legislation. I know the minister can recall that. Accordingly, we will be moving at the consideration in detail stage an amendment in respect of that. We wish the rest of the bill a speedy passage. We can count in this place and we know that the bill will go through unfettered eventually, probably some time this eveningif not tomorrow morning. We look forward to the information contained in here being widely disseminated. We look forward to what the minister and the government have proposed by way of continued assistance to the veterans' community being put in place very quickly.

202,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I might start my remarks on these two hearing services bills by expressing the opposition's deep dissatisfaction with the handling of this particular package of bills. It is not the first time that we have had cause, unfortunately, to express our unhappiness in the House about legislation involving this portfolio. The opposition first learned of the existence of this important legislation, which affects the right of many Australians to have access to hearing services, when it appeared on the Notice Paper on 5 February for introduction that day. Through someone's laziness or mismanagement or both, I believe the parliament has been insulted by this very late provision of the legislation. It is an insult as well to the staff of Australian Hearing Services and the Australian Government Health Service-not to mention the almost 200,000 clients of AHS-to introduce this bill 10 days before the first provisions take effect. This means that discussion, scrutiny and consultation are all compromised by this gross incompetence. That is why the opposition will be seeking to refer these bills to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee to allow for thorough scrutiny to occur. Further delays in debating this legislation mean that it is unlikely the legislation will even be introduced in the Senate before it takes effect in three days time, on Saturday, I March 1997. In the unhappy event that this legislation is passed unamended, we can ask whether the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) intends to retrospectively remove benefits from the young people and the Commonwealth senior health care card holders who have been cut-off from the Australian Hearing Services by this bill. If that is the minister's intention, then need Private. I today remind the House of previous speeches made by Liberal Party and National Party members and senators about the evils of retrospecti ve legislation. They are certainly very much opposed to retrospective legislation that tries to make sure that people pay the correct amounts of tax, but they do not seem to have any difficulties with retrospective legislation that might take away from young Australians and senior health care card holders who have hearing disabilities. They are quite happy to use retrospective legislation against them. I made a few remarks about this particular issue when we were discussing the government's unfair and retrospective legislation on provider numbers last year, which was introduced within four days of taking effect. Of course, this led to greatly reduced scrutiny of that particular piece of legislation and the attempt of exclusion of the AMA from the Senate committee hearings on that legislation. The result was that New South Wales doctors decided on a week-long strike to protest against that retrospective and unfair legislation. So I can only hope that the handling of future bills is better than that track record. I will tum to today's two pieces of legislation. These bills will do four things. First, they will cut off 19to 21-year-olds from access to Australian Hearing Services. Second, they will cut off Commonwealth senior health care card holders from access to AHS. Third, they will introduce a voucher system enabling AHS clients to buy top-up aids. Fourth, they will require a greater budget contribution from the Australian Government Health Service. Basically, these bills cut off certain clients from access to Australian Hearing Services and, in addition, set AHS up for privatisation. This is what the secretary to the department noted at Senate estimates: It is certainly putting AHS ... in a more competitive environment. Whether that would lead at any later stage to other changes is speCUlative. Well may we speculate, because we know there is already speculation that this government plans to privatise Medibank Private. We can expect that, if this legislation is passed, AHS will not be very far behind Medibank This legislation will damage Australian Hearing Services which, in our opinion, is a model Public Service provider. It yet again breaches the coalition's so-called election commitment from Honest John-the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I stand corrected-to preserve all pension benefits by removing the entitlements of Commonwealth senior health care card holders to Australian Hearing Services.",124
203,Mr MELHAM,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,You have to be a mindreader now.,125
204,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"It is very difficult sometimes to know the difference between the core commitments and the disposal commitments, so I can understand the confusion of the member for Banks. Mr Williams-We can understand.",125
205,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I am sure the Attorney-General every now and again has difficulties remembering which promises he might have made to his constituents still apply, given the government's election to power. I would like to remind the parliament of the promise which the Liberal and National parties made before the last election. The coalition's social security policy contained the following sentence: The coalition will maintain all current Commonrebates wealth concessions. Despite that promise, I think there were also statements made by John Howard, the then opposition leader, to an ACOSS conference. The Prime Minister gave his own personal guarantee that no pensioners would lose any of their existing entitlements. Yet we already seen increases in the cost of medicabilling. tion for pensioners. We have seen the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who is sitting at the table, seeking to make dramatic changes to the aged care provisions for Australians. Mrs Moylan-They are very important policy changes.",125
206,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"She describes them as important policy changes. They are certainly changes that are going to mean that many Australians will now have to start paying up-front fees access to nursing homes. I am sure that are all looking forward to the minister debatprovided ing that piece of legislation in the not too distant future. But today we are talking about the government's decision to take away the entitlements of a large number to Australian Hearing Services. We are not going to let the minister wriggle out of the commitments which the Prime that Minister, John Howard, her leader, made during the last election campaign. You will not be able to wriggle out of this one by blaming departmental officials, as was the case with Austudy and other issues. It never the minister. The minister cannot be expected to properly scrutinise what their departments are doing. It is always someone else's fault bar the minister who is meant be in charge. I think we also need to understand that fee paidcost these bills represent another broken promise and another attack on those who most need our support. When in opposiAHS tion, the Prime Minister, John Howard, said average. that he would govern for all of us, but he obviously forgotten about the young and elderly Australians who have hearing difficulties. This broken promise comes on the back of others that I have touched on before. These broken promises include increases in the cost of pharmaceuticals; cuts in Medicare for psychiatric services, knee and eye operations; the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program; decisions that are going to change the contributions that are imposed on elderly Australians for access to nursing homes; and the decision to freeze GP Medicare rebates, which day by day is putting have extra pressure on doctors to cease bulkBefore discussing the government's proposed changes, I would like to briefly place on the record a few facts and figures about Australian Hearing Services. AHS clients include children up to 21 and most pensioners. Through a network of 54 permanent and 80 visiting centres, AHS currently provides full hearing services to around 180,000 clients or 75 per cent of those Australians who need hearings aids. In recent years, around a for quarter of these services have been subconwe tracted to private providers. The services by AHS include hearing loss assessments, the provision and fitting of hearing aids, necessary rehabilitation and adjustment to the use of the devices and maintenance and of Australians battery replacement. AHS provides hearing aids to its clients at an average price which is $400 lower than of private sector providers. This figure was calculated on a full cost basis, using accrual accounting principles, by external consultants. I make that point: a public sector provider, using the power that goes with the is very large number of hearing aids that it purchases each year, is able to provide hearing aids to its clients at $400 less than the private sector providers. A recent review by to the Centre for International Economics made the following comments on this very point: AHS's per new adult client is lower than the for private sector services. in our society It goes on to say: kept prices down ... well below the OECD has The CIE report went on to explain that AHS's ability to provide such an economical service was due to the great economies of scale. The report noted that, due to its buying power, AHS achieved discounts of more than 33 per cent on batteries alone. AHS does even better on hearing aids, saving more than 50 per cent of the normal price-or more than $200-on the majority of its state-of-the-art electronically programmable aids with a remote control option. Despite these massive savings achieved by AHS, Australia achieves still further benefits through AHS' s joint venture to produce these hearing aids in Australia, particularly in Queensland. Rather than importing their hearing aids, this has led to the creation of highly skilled jobs and $200 million in foreign investment and in sales and exports of high quality hearing aids and devices. If the government's legislation succeeds in undermining the position of AHS and its joint venture, the likely result will be a loss of highly skilled jobs in Queensland, a loss of important foreign investment, a loss in export sales and a return to the importing of hearing aids, all of which is bad news for Australia. It is bad news for jobs, especially in Queensland, and bad news for investment and export markets. If some people doubt that is the case, they have to understand that AHS has been able to use that massive buying power to encourage overseas investment, particularly in Queensland. That multinational's head office realises that, if it were to seek to supply the Australian market from offshore, then of course the government would be under pressure to look for an alternative supplier. By facilitating the establishment of the joint venture, a new high-tech industry has been developed in Queensland; one that I think is very important. It is very important that we try to ensure that that remains in Australia. On the subject of quality, the CIE report noted: . . . client outcome surveys . . . indicate similar outcomes for AHS and private contractors services. To give you an example of just how good AHS is, private clients are asking to pay to use the service. In November last year I had a letter from a constituent of mine. I do not think he minds if I quote his name. Mr Malouf and his family were very keen for him to have the right to purchase some of the equipment supplied through AHS because he had lost his entitlement. Mr Malouf wrote to the minister about this. Senator Woods, on behalf of the minister, advised me that it was not possible for Mr Malouf to purchase that equipment from AHS, not even if he paid for the equipment. It says something about the quality of an organisation when someone is prepared to pay AHS, having lost their eligibility to go through AHS, for the good quality service. AHS is a model to be copied and learned from. It is not, in my opinion, a public service model to be dismantled. The current arrangements clearly provide a high quality service and state-of-the-art equipment at extremely low relative costs and with significant benefits for Australian jobs, Australian research and development and Australian exports. The government claims that its reforms seek to improve efficiency, but this is just plain ludicrous. I would like to give you an example, from the minister's second reading speech, of the government's supposed efficiency gains. The government intends to force AHS to adopt 'full commercial practices ... including provision for taxation'. So the government is going to tax itself in the interests of efficiency. You can imagine the extra amount of paperwork that will be required between the tax office and AHS as a result. The minister is asking us to believe that it is efficient to hobble the AHS, which provides its high quality services at a cost well below the OECD average, to allow private providers which are $400 a client more expensive to compete with it. It is quite clear that the government is simply being driven by an ideological obsession with seeking to reduce the extent of the public sector in the Australian economy. I can think of only one reason the government would be considering these reforms, and that is its slavish attachment to the report of the National Commission of Audit. This report is the government's blueprint for privatisation and the introduction of co-payments in the health care area. In the face of blinding evidence to the contrary, we can see that the government is being driven by an entrenched mistrust of everything in the public sector. Some might say that this is completely irrational, even though it is put forward by some of the government's drier economic rationalists. The logic behind the Hearing Services Administration Bill is the same as the logic behind the government floating the idiotic idea last year of abandoning Commonwealth control of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the states. This would have created six different systems in the six states and probably another two in the territories. The cation a person received would have depended on where they lived. I am pleased that the states-a majority of them conservative state governments-would not touch that with a barge pole. The Minister for Health and Family Services was on TV last week or the week before expressing his frustration in being unable to persuade the states to take over the pharmaceutical benefits scheme or Medicare or other areas that are currently funded by the federal government, including aged care, managed by the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine that, if you were the Premier of Tasmania and the minister offered you the existing level of funding for those services and the onerous responsibility to continue to fund future growth of the use of medication and the provision of hospital services, it would be quite clear that the federal government was trying to pass on to you the burdens and responsibilities of providing funding for those services without sufficient revenue to maintain for future growth, especially as the population ages. I would expect you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to be just as reluctant as the current conservative Premier of Tasmania to accept such an offer. We had hoped of course that in backing away from the ridiculous idea of handing over control of the PBS to the states the government might have reconsidered its position on issues such as the measures that are before us at the moment. I would now like to turn to the financial aspects of this proposal. Those listening to this debate today may think, having heard my discussion of the minister's negligence in the late introduction of this legislation or having heard about the idea of the government's plan to tax itself and about the high standards that AHS has achieved in recent years, that they would have already heard about the worse aspects of this particular legislation. But I am afraid there is more to come. Apart from attempting to hobble the Australian Hearing Services, this bill takes away access to AHS' s services for 19to 21-yearolds and for around 30,000 holders of medi- Commonwealth senior health cards who have hearing disabilities. In Senate estimates the opposition questioned the government about the reasons for taking away eligibility for these groups and the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, Senator Newman, replied that the decision was taken for budgetary reasons. The opposition logically then requested a breakdown of the savings that will flow from the implementation of these decisions. The information we got was quite astounding. The government is taking away hearing aids from 19to 21-year-olds with hearing disabilities to save a paltry half a million dollars a year. To save half a million dollars a year the government is going to force deaf young Australians to pay for their hearing aids. Many of the young Australians affected by this measure are studying and some have difficulty in obtaining secure long-term work, and it is not difficult to appreciate the impact that the loss of their eligibility for hearing services may have on their education or employment-all for a measly half a million dollars, compared to the massive size of the Commonwealth budget. The opposition will be seeking to move an amendment when we get to the consideration in detail stage to restore eligibility to young Australi as aged between 19 and 21, to force the Liberal and National Party members opposite to either reverse this decision or have their names recorded as being in favour of taking away access to these hearing services from 19to 21-year-olds with hearing disabilities. This measure is completely inconsistent with other government measures to increase the age of independence for young people the purpose of government benefits. From January 1997 the age of independence for tertiary students has been increased from years to 25 years, while young unemployed people are not deemed to be independent until they are 21 years of age. So there is no pri vatise it. consistency whatsoever. This government is raising the eligibility ages to force parents look after their children when they are doing tertiary studies or if they are out of work, when it comes to deciding who is eligible for hearing services the government is reducing eligibility for those aged from 19 to 21-all to save this paltry half a million dollars. The only thing this measure has in common with the social security and Austudy changes is that they both save money. It is another introduced. example of this government putting dollars before the rights of people with disabilities get a reasonable level of service from government. The figure supplied by the department for the savings to be made by denying access to Australian Hearing Services to Commonwealth senior health card holders was even more astounding. The savings were zero dollars in 1996-97, zero dollars in 1997broad 98, zero dollars in 1998-99 and zero dollars in 1999-2000-no savings whatsoever from ments. denying Commonwealth senior health card holders access to AHS and a paltry half a million in savings for the changes in denying young people with disabilities between the ages of 19 and 21. Yet this government has this bill before the House today. We simply ask the minister-in particular, a minister for aged care, a minister who is supposed to be looking after elderly Australbetween ians-to answer this question when she sums up this debate: why are you taking away from those Commonwealth senior health card holders the right to have access to AHS services if your savings are zero for each the four years, in the figures that have been supplied to the opposition? It will be an interesting answer. If the government does succeed with this atrocious legislation, we can only ask that the minister guarantee a few things. We ask a guarantee that the quality of the hearing aids will remain state of the art. We ask for AHS clients will never be subject to 1 copayments, as recommended by the CIE report and the National Commission of Audit. 21 Finally, we ask for a guarantee that the government will not further sabotage the Australian Hearing Services by attempting to This bill is not fair to senior citizens with to hearing loss. It is not fair to young Australians with hearing loss. It is not fair to the but dedicated staff at the Australian Hearing Services. It is not fair to the innovative and efficient Australian employees who make hearing aids in Australia. It represents yet another of the Prime Minister's broken promises. We condemn this bill and we ask that it be as hastily withdrawn as it was tardily",126
207,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"Boothby) (7.06 p.m.)to Today we are debating the Hearing Services the Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997. The first-the Hearing Services Administration Bill-will reform the delivery of government funding hearing services in Australia. That will be consistent with this government's strategy to allow greater contestability in service provision by government departFrom 1 July this year, pensioners and eligible veterans will receive vouchers for hearing services which will allow these groups to choose their provider, their services and, if appropriate, their hearing aid. More than 200,000 adults will be eligible for this scheme, with an estimated 50,000 new entrants each year. They will be able to choose Australian Hearing Services or an accredited private sector provider. The new system will also introduce managed competition for the provision of government funded hearing services between the private sector of and government. It will allow the best services to emerge naturally and lead others in the provision of the highest possible quality service. The establishment of the Office of Hearing Services will accredit and regulate participatfor ing hearing service providers, which will increase self-regulation and quality standards that within the hearing services industry. The office will initially maintain the current technical standards of the AHS and will use their expertise as well as that of the private sector to review these technical standards over time. Service standards will be those currently operating between the AHS and its contracts with private sector providers and will be helped by the introduction of a professional code of conduct. The office will also provide information impartially to consumers and will investigate and resolve any complaints. One of the problems in the past is that Australian Hearing Services has been the regulator as well as the dominant service provider of the hearing services program. The establishment of the Office of Hearing Services will remove this regulatory function from AHS and provide greater contestability in service provision of government funded hearing services. While competition will be introduced between hearing service practitioners and manufacturers to supply hearing aids, the pricing advantages that Australian Health Services has enjoyed due to its large market power will be retained by using a tender based 'common use contract' which will provide hearing aids for both the AHS and the private sector. Preliminary discussions with manufacturers indicate that this process would provide prices close to those achieved by AHS at present. To remain within the budgetary allocation, AHS has had to ration its services either through client queuing or rationing the referral of clients to private providers. The new system will provide flexibility by allowing people to purchase additional levels of service beyond their free entitlement. That will encourage freedom of choice and allow them to 'add on' to their free entitlement. There will be no new charges for those eligible under this scheme. These bills will allow the scarce resources in Australian Health Services to be used more effectively and for service provision to be streamlined. By providing flexibility to the industry and a greater choice of hearing services for consumers, the consumers will benefit. The Hearing Services and the AGHS Reform Bill 1997 will restructure Australian Hearing Services, change the eligibility for the hearing services program and restructure the Australian Government Health Service. Australian Hearing Services currently provides direct services to 90 per cent of the Australian hearing program's clients. In 1990, the Industry Commission's report entitled Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities proposed introducing contestability within the program. Australian Hearing Services already contracts out a proportion of new clients to accredited private service providers. For example, in 1995-96, 36 per cent of new adult clients were referred to private providers. That was usually after a wait of six to eight weeks. What the vouchers will do will be to return genuine choice to those who are eligibleaged pensioners, disability pensioners and veterans-and they can decide whether to go to AHS or whether to go to a private sector provider. But at least they will have the choice. Rather than hamstringing AHS, this actually provides genuine choice to the consumers. The last government was quite happy for Australian Hearing Services to operate as a monopoly and to let them decide which clients they would farm out to private sector providers. Consumers had no choice about the type of service they received or the provider they saw. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) mentioned the report by the Centre for International Economics. When they reviewed the program in 1995-96, they recommended implementing a voucher system and establishing an independent agency to manage the new system, and that sounds very familiarseparating the service provision role from the regulatory role. I do not see anything wrong with that. Australian Hearing Services will now compete on equal footing with the private sector for voucher holders. Consistent with competitive neutrality principles, it will pay the equivalent-it does not actually pay taxof Commonwealth and state tax and it will also payout dividends. It will still retain the essential role of meeting the government community service obligations such as providing hearing services to those in remote areas, continuing with hearing and noise related research, hearing loss prevention activities and industrial collaboration activities. It is also important to stress that, while AHS will be competing with the private sector for voucher patients, it will not be competing with private sector providers for those who are not specified under the act. The benefits will extend beyond the consumers. Having a more competitive market in hearing services will mean an invigorated commercial environment within the private sector, greater industry cooperation and involvement in self-regulation and standards monitored by the new Office of Hearing Services, greater economic activity within this industry sector, longer term savings to the taxpayer through reduction in the direct cost to government of this program and increased industry development and efficient restructuring. All those in the hearing services field can go ahead and plan for better consumer services and the structures which support those services, and the industry can have more certainty about. investing in research and development services and in training staff to provide those better services. It will also retain its specialist services to children, those with high hearing rehabilitation needs and those in rural and remote areas, especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. These services will remain outside the voucher scheme and will be reviewed in two years time. The government is targeting the hearing concessions to those whose need is greatest. There are two groups who will lose eligibility under the hearing services program-those holding a Commonwealth seniors health card and those aged between 18 and 21. In fact, those people with Commonwealth seniors health cards were only recently made eligible. Removing the eligibility of those with seniors cards, while maintaining that of the pensioners-it is important to stress that aged pensioners and disabled pensioners will still be eligible under the voucher scheme-is consistent with many other government entitlements. Then we come to the 18to 21-year-olds. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) was a bit confused; he kept on referring to 19to 21year-olds and talki.ng .about 21-year-old children. It has been some time since we have had 21-year-old children. The eligibility of 18to 21-year-olds for the Australian hearing program is an historic thing which relates more to an era when 21 was considered the commencement of adulthood. If you look at the pattern of hearing disabilities, you find that most hearing disabilities are picked up before 18 years of age and most of them are fully assessed and fully equipped before they are 18 years of age. To retain the eligibility of 18to 21-year-oIds because it is an historic thing no longer has arationale. It is important to stress that those 18to 21-year-olds who are no longer eligible will still have maintenance provided for their hearing aids for five years after the loss of eligibility. Four to five years is about the average length of life for a hearing aid. The member for Dobell reminds me a bit of all those successive British governments which ignored the fact that they had a man in the English Channel waiting for Napoleon. That post was not abolished until 1948. The ALP seems reluctant to ever remove someone from the government teat, even when the original rationale is no longer there. As I have said before, the impact for 18to 21-year-olds will be minimised by providing maintenance support for their hearing aids five years from the loss of eligibility. The Australian Government Health Service has maintained high fixed costs which have a significant effect on government expenditure since government departments are the major clients for the AGHS. For example, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs provide 70 per cent of its revenue. Corporatising the AGHS will make it more flexible and efficient. The reforms to the AGHS will place it on a commercial footing and make it compete on a level playing field with the private sector for federal government business. A review of the AGHS last year concluded that independent medical assessment and advice were important to control government expenditure. Reforming the AGHS will make its provision of services more cost effective and expose it to competition. The reforms will place the AGHS on a level footing with private sector providers. Consistent with the principle of competitive neutrality, the AGHS will pay to the Commonwealth amounts equivalent to commercial tax. These two bills wilI ultimately reduce the call on government outlays, they will provide a genuine choice for those who are eligible under the voucher scheme-the aged pensioners, the disabled pensioners and veteransthey wilI target hearing services to those who are most in need, they will lead to a more flexible and efficient hearing services sector and they will maintain high standards of hearing service provision through self-regulaquestions, tion and accreditation by the Office of Hearing Services. I commend the bill to the House.",129
208,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I am here tonight to oppose the changes to the Australian Hearing Services that are proposed in these bills. In the first instance, they inequitable and, secondly, they cannot be justified on efficiency grounds, which is the government's rationale for their introduction. At present, the Australian Hearing Services is a statutory authority within the Department of Health and Family Services. As others have said, it provides hearing services to alI eligible Australians free of charge. These include all children and young people up to the age of 21. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott), suggested that people between the age of 18 and 21 are now adults. Have a look at some of the policies of your government, which are insisting that young people to the age of 25 remain dependent on their parents. Get a few things straight! They also include pensioners, veterans, Comcare clients, members of the Defence Force and some Commonwealth employees. It currently assists over 75 per cent of all Australians requiring hearing services. These bills will reduce the numbers of people eligible for assistance through the Australian Hearing Services. If implemented, they will exclude alI young people aged between 18 and 21, whether they are dependent on their parents or not, and alI holders Commonwealth seniors health cards. In this latter group alone it is likely that 30,000 people will be affected. On the government's estimate, minimal savings will accrue from these measures. It expects to save $1.5 million over four years on the cuts to the under-21s alone and nothing on the cuts to the Commonwealth seniors health card holders. Just before the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) leaves the chamber, I wish to ask a couple of questions, because the numbers do not seem to add up to me. Mrs Moylan-Question time has finished.",132
209,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"These are important Minister, and do not deserve the disrespect with which you have just treated my asking them. The figure of $1.5 million in savings that I have just cited does not measure up with the figures in the budget papers, which show savings of $12Y2 milIion over four years. Given the minister has left the chamber, because she obviously does not care are about people who have hearing difficulties, maybe her staff or the members of the department who are still in the chamber could, when she comes back to consider this bilI in detail, answer some questions. Could they explain the discrepancies between these two figures? What has happened to the money which would have been spent on the groups now to be excluded? You cannot exclude 30,000 people and not have a saving. If there are no savings from this measure, why is it being introduced? These bills once again demonstrate this government's willingness to reduce basic services to vulnerable people-and there is no doubt that people with hearing difficulties are vulnerable-to undermine their health and quality of life in order to make minor shortterm savings, on the government's estimates. These changes are both punitive and short sighted since small savings are now likely to be offset by the costs associated with untreated hearing problems. These cuts will fall on people already bearing the brunt of other cuts and charges arising from these budget initiatives. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you have heard considerable debate and discussion about the fact that the impact of alI these of changes falls particularly on older people in our community-and I suggest they will fall considerably on those people who hold Commonwealth seniors health cards. We have seen the increase in the costs of pharmaceuticals-of course, not compensated for in the pension-the complete abolition of the Commonwealth dental health scheme, increased charges for home and community care and the introduction of entry fees for nursing homes. These are just a few things that together are going to make life for people in the older generation of our community much more difficult. It seems to me that this government is anti older people. We have yet another example of it in these bills. The changes to eligibility are supposed to take effect from 1 March, just a few days away. They are not even mentioned in the press release of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) of 5 February. No doubt he does not want the 30,000 card holders to know that they have lost their eligibility for help with hearing aids and other hearing services. Of course it is the case, as my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has said, that the government gave no notice of its intention to introduce this legislation and has allowed minimum time for its discussion. There is obviously no doubt in our minds that the 30,000 people who need support with their hearing are not going to find out about it from this government. It certainly does look like a deliberate ploy designed to minimise opportunity for debate and consideration of a measure that is certainly very unpopular in my electorate. These bills are going to corporatise Australmajor Ian Hearing Services, separating the regulatory and service provision roles. They are going to introduce a voucher system requiring the hearing services to compete with private providers to supply hearing services. This too has become a mantra for the government. These measures are intended 'to provide greater choice of service providers in hearing aids for all clients to foster a more competiti ve hearing services industry' - and that comes from the budget statement-and, one suspects more importantly, 'to reduce costs to government'. This is code for getting the consumer to pay more-as we have seen with home and community care charges, nursing home charges and pharmaceuticals chargeswhether they are deaf or need nursing home care. It does not matter how disabled you might be. One wonders how the government can justify this approach given the department's finding that 'over 90 per cent of clients are satisfied with the level and quality of existing program services' and that 'Australian Hearing Services' costs for a monaural fitting are estimated at $598 while an equivalent fitting for services provided by private sector program contractors is $890'. This makes it really hard to understand why the government is going down this path. That is what competition is going to bring you. If ever there were an example of the government's privatisation ideology driving policy rather than what is in the best interests of the consumer this is it. Those who need hearing aids are going to have to pay more. It is not clear how, in this new competitive environment that the government is so keen on, the government will prevent a few major providers capturing the field or how it will ensure that the cost savings associated with the one major purchaser that we have now, Australian Hearing Services, will be maintained. That is another reason for keeping it public, because it keeps costs down. Once the voucher system is introduced and consumers are offered a choice of providers, they will require information in order to make informed choices on technical issues and to recognise overservicing. This is one of the reasons for health services remaining public. They are very technical issues and none of us, certainly no-one that I know in this chamber, is equipped to judge which is the best service to meet our health needs. Australian Hearing Services has served us well. It has provided high quality services at reasonable cost and has, importantly, relied on predominantly Australian manufactured pr(1)ducts. It has also supported world-class research, so that we are now world leaders in this field. All this is now at risk. Why is that? So the government can further its ideologically driven attack on public services, its support for private provision and its encouragement of 'user pays' for health and community services. Mr Abbott-Don't they rant and rave!",132
210,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"Obviously members opposite think it is a big joke. Those who are having trouble hearing will not be impressed about having to pay $300 more for a hearing aid. That will be the result of this change. you can tell your constituents that. I will certainly be letting them know who has to take the responsibility. It is the case that the legislation is being rushed through the parliament with unseemly haste. I certainly support my colleagues' call for its referral to a Senate committee where we might get the detailed consideration that this issue deserves. Obviously the minister has no idea how the voucher system will work, because once again his media release gives the game away. It talks about all the details coming out over the coming months. The Senate inquiry, no doubt, will expose the flaws in this ill-formulated scheme. Debate interrupted. NA",134
211,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Flood Works Funds",134
212,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"Last night I raised in this House during the adjournment debate some serious questions about this government's standards. Tonight, after receiving nothing close to a genuine answer during the day and only uncovering further cause for concern, I have come into the House to demand that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) comes clean. Through the minister's incompetence and his willingness to work outside the conventions of his portfolio, $750,000 of taxpayers' money has been tucked away, hidden, grossly delayed, and it is now up to the minister to tell us why. Five one-off cheques totalling $2.75 million for flood mitigation projects in New South Wales were approved by the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development some time in late January or early February this year. Against all established practice, against all convention, instead of sending the cheques to the New South Wales state government department which they were made out to, the Department for Land and Water Conservation, the minister handed them over to three Liberal MPs and two Liberal senators. The understanding was that each So Liberal MP would organise their local press and have a nice photograph taken of them handing the cheques over to the local authorities responsible for carrying out the flood work. Never mind that the cheques being handed over were not made out to the local government bodies receiving them. Never mind that the MPs should not even have had them in the first place. So who had the cheques? Well, for starters the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) had one. He had a cheque for $1 million, which he handed over to the Upper Parramatta River Catchment Trust several weeks ago. The trust was very happy to receive the funding, but they did scratch their heads as to why they had been given a cheque made out to the New South Wales state government. We know the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) had a cheque. He presented one for $500,000 to the Deputy Mayor of Gosford City Council on 7 February. She, too, was a little perplexed that she had been given such a sizeable sum of money made out to the New South Wales government. We know that Senator Bill Heffernan had a cheque. The Liberal duty senator for Wollongong was down there on 17 February handing over a cheque for $100,000 to Lord Mayor David Campbell for flood mitigation in that particular city. We know the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) had a cheque-not because he fronted up with the $400,000 to Campbelltown City Council, not at all. We know because either the minister could not find a time which suited him to make his presentation or he just did not need the extra publicity. We know because he sent his cheque to the New South Wales government in one of his own personali sed envelopes, which I found out this morning they received yesterday afternoon. Which brings us to Fairfield. It has already been confirmed for me, most recently by the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), that the cheque approved by the minister for flood mitigation work around Prospect Creek was for the sum of $750,000. That we do know. The work on the project is to be administered by Fairfield City Council. When my office asked the staff member in the parliamentary secretary's office-and I will name him tonight: Mr Stephen Galileewho would be presenting the cheque to Fairfield City Council, he said he had no idea. He had no idea! And yet this afternoon a press release pops up from Senator Helen Coonan saying that the cheque, sent by the parliamentary secretary, was received by her office on Monday this week. Senator Coonan says she will present it to Fairfield City Council on 10 March. So, if Senator Coonan received the cheque on Monday from the member for Ballarat's office, why didn't Fairfield City Council have any idea who had it and when it was going to get it, as I found out when I spoke to its general manager on Tuesday afternoon? Why didn't the senior adviser in the member for Ballarat's office know where the cheque was when my office spoke to him on Tuesday afternoon? Why didn't the Department of Land and Water Conservation know where the cheque was when my office contacted them as late as this afternoon? My guess is: it is obviously not the original cheque. Only two people know the real story: Mr Sharp and the Liberal MP or senator to whom the original cheque was given. Today my office contacted the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party and had a pleasant conversation with a very helpful young man there. When we asked who the duty senator was for the Fairfield area, he had no hesitation in telling us: 'Senator Woods, of course. Senator Bob Woods' Well, I never. Senator Woods! Out of the mouth of babes! If Minister Sharp gave the Liberal duty senator for Wollongong, Senator Bill Heffernan, the cheque to present to their council some three or four weeks ago, surely logic dictates that he gave the duty senator for my area, Senator Bob Woods, the cheque for $750,000 to present to Fairfield City Council. How has the cheque now all of a sudden, after I raised the issue in the House last night, found its way into Senator Coonan's hands? The minister has been too clever by half. He has been playing games with the people of Fairfield city. First he cut our recurrent flood mitigation funding; now he has been playing silly games with the one-off grant he has deigned to hand on. This latest twist in the story is just so transparent: Senator Woods, I believe, was given the original cheque and now, in a panic, the minister has attempted to cover his behind by either cancelling the old one and writing a new one for Senator Coonan or finally retrieving it from Senator Woods's office for Senator Coonan. I believe this ridiculous episode has cast an even greater shadow on this government's ever declining standards. Meanwhile, the people of Fairfield wait for what they are due and they question why it has taken over five weeks for this cheque to come to light when all other areas have received their cheques, the money has been confirmed and the information has been presented. I question again in this House tonight why it has taken so long-nearly five weeks; it will be received on 10 March--for the cheque to be presented to the council? I do not question the amount of money but just where the cheque has been for five weeks. Has it been in Senator Woods's top drawer in his office, or did the fraud squad discover it? Moreton Bay",134
213,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"Bowman) (7.35 p.m.}-On 28 October last year I rose in this chamber to speak about the needs of Moreton Bay and the University of Queensland Research Laboratory. I again rise to speak on this matter to give members of the House a progress report. For those members who may not remember, the research facility at Dunwich on North Stradbroke Island is in urgent need of repair. The laboratory facilities are out of date and the building is in danger of collapsing. However, despite that fact our intrepid researchers continue. They are a hardy bunch. It is also a mark of the significance of their work that these and other researchers from around the world flock to North Stradbroke Island. The work which is being carried out at the station, particularly by Professor Jack Greenwood and Dr Ian Tibbetts, is of vital importance to the future viability of the bay. As I reported last year, the Department of Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs has kicked in $300,000 to upgrade the laboratory facilities. As generous as this offer is, is still only the tip of the iceberg. None of this money can be used for capital works. As members can see, the researchers face a significant dilemma: what use is a $300,000 research laboratory if the building it is housed in falls down around their ears? The School of Marine Science at the University of Queensland, to its credit, is not sitting back waiting for government handouts. Professor Greenwood and Dr Tibbetts have put together a proposal for funding which they are providing to whoever they believe would be willing to support such a project. The group received some welcome news just prior to Christmas when the university administration approved a further $100,000 towards the project. This leaves a shortfall of just $1 million. On a positive note, Dr Tibbetts wrote to me recently to say that he was encouraged by the level of corporate and community support the project had received. In his letter he said that the research station attracted $10,000 towards the purchase of a research vessel through the University of Queensland annual appeal. In fact the funds in support of the research station boat for Dunwich exceeded those given to a number of other worthy causes. I cannot stress strongly enough the need for this research station to go ahead. To this end, I will over the next few months be organising fundraising exercises to draw the attention of the general public and industry to the needs of the Moreton Bay marine station. After all, it is the people of the bay who use the bay both for recreation and for business who will benefit from the ongoing work of the School of Marine Science. The benefits of this station continuing are many. There will be benefits to both the commercial and the recreational fishing industries through the study of fish stocks and how present activity is affecting the bay. The School of Marine Science is already conducting studies into the feeding and breeding habits of local marine life. These studies will help both government and industry officials to ensure better management of the bay's fish stocks. The school is also researching ways of it minimising the impact of man-made structures on shoreline ecology. This will be of benefit to the tourism industry, which is only just beginning to boom on North Stradbroke Island. These are but a few of the benefits which can be gained by the continued research in Moreton Bay. As well as seeking corporate money, I will continue to look at ways in which this government and the state government of Queensland can assist in fulfilling the funding needs of this facility. Moreton Bay is unique. It holds both ecological and economic importance for all of Australia. It is also seen as one of the most important regional and national marine monitoring sites. However, to continue this vital work the station requires over immediate attention and I intend to work with both Professor Greenwood and Dr Tibbetts to ensure the station's future viability. Automotive Industry",135
214,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (7.39 p.m.}-Today in Adelaide the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the shadow minister for industry and regional development, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), announced a plan which, if implemented, gives the automotive industry in Australia real hope for the future. This stands in stark contrast to the lack of support given to the automotive and automotive components industries by the attitudes and posturings of the government so far in its reaction to the Industry Commission's report. The plan announced by the opposition leader calls for a freeze on tariffs on vehicles, original equipment and replacement components at 15 per cent until at least 2005. This can be achieved, the opposition believes, while still maintaining Australia's obligations under APEC. Furthermore, the plan seeks to establish a mechanism whereby the tariff and non-tariff barriers of our trading partners can be monitored. This would allow Australia to make certain that our trading partners were reducing their barriers in the automotive industry. As I have said often in debates here, free trade must also be fair trade. The third component of the plan is a review of the automotive industry in the year 2003 to determine which forms of assistance are most appropriate for the industry after 2005. It is especially pleasing to see that this review would also have to take into account the progress of our trading partners in removing barriers. It would mean the end of the Industry Commission disease of recommending the removal of support for an industry sector without taking into consideration what our trading partners are doing with regard to this. Personally I am very happy to see a commitment from the opposition to support the continuation of the very important and highly successful export facilitation scheme, amended if required to be consistent with Australia's World Trade Organisation obligations. Schemes such as the export facilitation scheme will be important to the 140 employees of Howe Leather at Thomastown in my electorate. Howe Leather was affected late last year when the United States threatened to take Australia to the WTO. Its subsequent treatment by the government was shabby, to say the least. The uncertainty continued from the time of President Clinton's visit until early January. It was hardly an appropriate or considered way for the government to treat an innovative firm which employs many people in the region that I represent. The other aspect of the plan announced by the opposition today calls for a continuation of the duty-free allowance to support domestic market value added and better support for industrial research and development in the automotive industry. This last aspect has become vital since the government's unwarranted and highly damaging attacks on research and development incentives last year. A proper system of support needs to be maintained to ensure that Australian automotive component manufacturers are encouraged to be innovative and at the cutting edge. The government, sadly, has failed to recognise the importance of this when it abolished syndication and cut out the R&D tax concession to 125 per cent last year. This plan demonstrates how important a partnership between government and industry can be. In return for the creation of a supportive environment, a Labor government would work towards commitments for export, investment and employment targets. If implemented, the opposition's plan would help to secure the jobs of about 1,000 people employed in the automotive components industry in the electorate of Scullin. Whether they are among the 425 employees of Goodyear Tyre and Rubber in Thomastown or one of the eight in the branch of Surdex Steel in Epping, this plan gives real hope for the security of their employment. Their jobs will be included not only in the jobs that continue, which were placed under threat by the Industry Commission's report, but also in the up to 10,000 new jobs that can be created through the adoption of this plan, which could lead to the trebling of exports of motor vehicle components to something like $3 billion. The growth in the component sector was even acknowledged in the Industry Commission report. Also, this plan could lead to the doubling of motor vehicle exports to 100,000 units per year. I hope that the government, in its consideration of the Industry Commission report, given the widespread support for the freezing of the tariff levels through to the year 2005, will take on board and seriously consider the opposition's suggestions. It is the hopes and aspirations of the many people employed in the automotive industry and the hopes and aspirations of many small businesses that rely on that industry that need to be taken into account. (Time expired) Judiciary",136
215,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"The recent comments by Mr Borbidge regarding the appointment of judges raise some very important issues about the nature and process of selecting members of the judiciary. Until recently that process had not been seriously questioned at any time, as far I am aware, although from time to time controversies have arisen over the appointment of particular judges. Some years ago in Queensland an impasse occurred over the proposal by the BjelkePetersen government to appoint a relatively junior judge to the position of Chief Justice ahead of a more senior and experienced judge. Ultimately, a compromise occurred resulting in the appointment of another judge to the position. However, the then premier finally got his way in the appointment of the next Chief Justice. I recall at the time that the process divided the Queensland Supreme Court bench and most members of the bar. At a federal level, some controversial appointments have been made, including the appointment of Sir Garfield Barwick, who was a minister in the Menzies government, and the appointment of Lionel Murphy, who was a serving minister in the Whitlam government. But times have changed and so too have personalities. In that respect, an increasing tendency has emerged among some members of the senior judiciary, who hitherto have adhered to the convention of being seen but not heard, to publicly express views. Thus the cult of personality has emerged at the judicial level. This is a regrettable tendency for, in my view, once judges try to become public figures and personalities they call into question community respect and, inevitably, whether they wish to or not, become perceived as being aligned with some cause or other which may ultimately be one upon which they are required to adjudicate. While the law remains shrouded in much mystery, most people understand the basic concept that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done for it underpins the very fabric of society's respect for the rule of law. No matter how keen a judge is to see a right redressed or to carve a niche for himself or herself in judicial and/or contemporary history-and even judges are human enough occasionally to reflect upon their place in history-they must nevertheless be mindful of the fact that their view of justice may not necessarily reflect the community view. Mr Justice Kirby has been an outspoken judge for many years. No-one questions his sincerity. But for the judge to make the reported comments that he has made implies support for some notion of social engineering by way of judicial definition. A judge making extra-curial pronouncements on his views touching sensitive issues opens himself up for potentially greater criticism, which unfortunately can reflect on the public's perception of the court on which he ultimately sits. That gets me back to the question of judicial appointments. Judges must not only not be political; they must never be seen to be political. In this context, and in the history of the appointment of judges, it is time to review the manner and circumstances of such appointments. Judges are presently appointed by the incumbent government. I think this is a very unsatisfactory method of appointment. For a start, the inevitable issues of partiality and political patronage arise. Because of that, it is clear that the way has been opened for the appointment of judges who may not have been appointed to that position on merit and who, had a different method been adopted, may not have been appointed at all. Let me differentiate initially between state judges and federal judges. I think state judges should be appointed by a committee that is drawn from the community and widely representative of it. This would include the appointment of a Chief Justice as well as the appointment of other judges. Such a committee should include the Chief Justice of the court except where his successor was being considered, the Attorney-General, the President of the Bar Association and four other people drawn from the community, only one of whom would be a lawyer. As far as federal judges as concerned, the way is open for each appointment to be considered by a parliamentary committee if we are not going to look at the wider aspect of a committee being appointed along the lines that I have suggested for state judges. A parliamentary committee could examine the proposed appointment of every judge and then report to the government about it. That is one way of doing it. The community committee is another way. Both ways, be it the parliamentary committee or the community way, are far preferable to the present system. VVhile it is also open suggest that a committee may in any event be politically motivated, or at least some elements of it, it is an infinitely more preferable system than the current one. Making the community involvement an integral element of a judicial appointment will ultimately lead to a better respected judiciary, a more accountable one and perhaps one in which the community will have a greater degree of confidence and respect.",137
216,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Barton) (7.49 p.m.)I express grave concern-indeed alarm-on behalf of my constituents and all Australians that the federal government is prepared to allow guilty criminals to walk free. Quite frankly, this government is more than soft on law and order. It is absolutely irresponsible and incompetent as a result of its slashing of the legal aid contribution by some $128 million. A recent example came to light on Monday concerning a Mr Marini, who is facing trial on possession of a trafficable amount of cocaine. Mr Marini is entitled to have his day in court and I don't pretend to pronounce judgment on his case.",139
217,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Barton is edging inexorably closer to sub judice conventions. I would be very careful.,139
218,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes. I am not going to comment on the merits of any allegations whatsoever against the person involved. On Monday, Mr Marini's counsel had prepared a case to apply for a permanent stay on the basis of Mr Marini's being deprived of funding for legal aid. On the Sunday night, a message came through to Mr Marini's counsel that the federal Attorney-General (Mr VVilIiams) was prepared to provide an application for legal aid to Mr Marini. So instead of Mr Marini's counsel applying for a permanent stay on the Monday, counsel applied for an adjournment. VVhat a farcical situation. A trial, which had been known about since September of last year, was organised. The judge was in court; the counsel were ready; the court reporters were ready. All the facilities of the court were ready to hear a case and it had to be adto journed because the federal Attorney-General had not considered the application for legal aid although it had been in since September. It is quite simply an outrage. It is a situation that can not only significantly prejudice a defence but also significantly injure the interests of society. If criminals cannot be brought to justice to face prosecution, there are two situations which will result. Either those people facing criminal charges will be locked in gaol for an unnecessary and lengthy periods of time if Legal Aid they are found to be innocent-in which case the taxpayer will have to pick up a massive bill-or the situation will occur where, following the case of Dietrich, the courts will be forced to release people facing criminal charges without those charges being heard. In other words, there is the probability that, if the government continues down this path, criminals will walk free. If Mr Jeff Shaw, the Attorney-General for New South VVales, whom I know to be an entirely balanced, reasonable and intelligent man, is giving warnings to the community, people should stand up and listen. Mr Shaw said this: What is the Commonwealth afraid of? The fact that their so-called 'savings' will result in criminals walking free? They have quarantined defence from budget cuts-surely safety at home and on the streets is just as important. My word it is. It is something that all Australians have to be very concerned about. This government likes to make sham noises of concerns for law and order, but when it comes to putting their money where their mouth is they are found wanting. They are soft on law and order. The Australian public will forever and a day hold them accountable for their inadequacies. University of South Australia: Whyalla Campus Veterans: Gold Card Entitlement",139
219,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (7.54 p.m.)Tonight I raise in the House a very important issue relating to a headline on page 5 of today's Advertiser entitled 'Whyalla campus may go to save $18 million' under the name of Michelle Dawes. Another headline reads 'A town's anger over a threat to its students' under the name of Chloe Fox. The Why alIa Campus of the University of South Australia is an integral component of my region and my electorate and particularly of the city of Whyalla. For its closure to even be contemplated is beyond belief and beyond acceptance. I have not yet got to the bottom of the story, but I understand that by late today reassurances were given that Whyalla's future is assured. This does not alter the fact that significant distress and uncertainty have been created, and that is very regrettable. I will await tomorrow's Advertiser with interest to see what reassurances the education writer is able to give. Even the quoted Mr John Sloman said that Underdale may be closed and that Why alIa may be severely downsized. To say that Whyalla campus may go to save $18 million when the actual recurrent funding is equivalent to $2.9 million per year is stretching a headline beyond reasonable imagination. It is to be regretted. I know that there is a very positive future for the University of South Australia in Why alIa and for regional South Australia, and I will fight to the end for this university. It is unacceptable that these headlines have even been contemplated. I turn to another headline in today's Advertiser entitled 'Diggers fight for equal health rights'. I speak tonight on behalf of Mr Maurie Horton, a constituent of Tumby Bay, who has long believed that a gold card entitlement should be available to many of those men who returned from World War II. In a comment from the state president, Mr Ian Dunn, he acknowledged that, when the amendment was passed in 1987 to allow women to have the gold card, it was not seen as a precedent. I can understand why many diggers feel that they are being discriminated against at this stage. However, because the initial intention in 1987 was to remedy the disadvantage that women veterans had suffered to that point, it was not seen to be a precedent for the men. Nevertheless, it is timely for me to speak in support of the diggers in my electorate, including Mr Houghton. They recognise that the contribution of that era is too quickly forgotten. Those people who fought for our freedom many decades ago regard with dismay that we are not able to recognise their contribution at a time when we are very generous in many other quarters. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.58 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Cobb to move That this House: (1) recognises the importance of the Kokoda Track campaign in World War II in stopping the overland Japanese advance to Port Moresby, which would have given the enemy a beachhead into Australia; (2) pays tribute to the contribution of the Koiari people known as ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angels"" in carrying items for Australian soldiers in the Kokoda campaign, including carriage of wounded to safety; and (3) in recognition of this contribution, urges the Government to: (a) consider efforts to commemorate the significant battle sites and grave sites along the Track; (b) issue an appropriate medal to the remaining ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angels"" or their surviving families; (c) consider other appropriate initiatives, including making a small ex-gratia payment to each ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angel"" in recognition of their contribution over and above the call of duty; and (d) examine funding for a ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angel"" Health and Education Foundation to upgrade the health and education status of the Koiari people in the isolated villages along the Track.

With the prospect in Fremantle, there is no better illustration is taking us so far as trade and industry There are a number of clear points of contrast in this area. The first point of contrast is in breach of election commitments, we saw in the either to abolish or massively gut In express breach of an election commitment, by $90 million per year and cut EMDG appropriations was an express breach of an election promise appropriations from Austrade and EMDG combined express breach of a personnel commitment Minister gave to the book publishers association substantial way with the export So in the area of export facilitation, in exporters to enhance their export activity, we to the EMDG scheme and a cap of $150 million That $150 million cap includes the cost department to be in the order of up to government is prepared to allocate to assist enhancement under that scheme is effectively This is despite the government's own documentation every dollar spent under the EMDG scheme, between eight to one and 24 or 25 to one, exporter or an exporter that has been exporting export ratio benefit and the government cuts looking at a penny pinching, rationalist bottom line.

So there is a massive off Australia's nose to spite its face by simply in a range of other areas in industry and development and cutting the support by I have referred to. The whole thematic policy trade and export enhancement policies to date has NA Wednesday, 26 February 1997 been to remove or massively reduce the incentives exporters and Australian companies in this area. The second point of contrast in the government's enhancement and the approach of those on this trade outcomes and objectives statement, Minister tabled in the House on 5 February. making about that particular statement. Firstly, the statement contains no reference target, and this stands in stark contrast to the previous government, when the then senator, was Minister for Trade. Labor's last trade to reduce unemployment to five per cent by about jobs in Mr Fischer's document but no targets. The second thing that we find in Mr Fischer's this mantra chanting about jobs, is weasel words in the economy. But when we look at the government's papers of last year and, secondly, the mid-year in the course of this year-we find the government's will make a negative contribution to growth 1997-98 financial year. That is a drop from by net exports in the course of 1995-96. So under the approach of those on this economic growth, enhancing the array of incentives in 1995-96-our effective last full year government's own forecasts are a negative contribution that point in the cycle, we find this massive The next key point we find in the minister's notion of bilateralism. This was the hallmark the last election. Whilst there are some concessions the focus is essentially on bilateral arrangements. it is clear that you need to be able to push multilateral arrangements but not focus exclusively Arising out of that, in the course of the statement about 10 countries listed in his statement as a consistent thread which flows through industries, which the minister's statement draws a focus on bilateralism but also a focus on This is despite the outlook statement's own analysis over the last 15 years and into the future exports. So on the one hand we find the government's coming from trade and export. We find the review talking about, under their policies, We find the government's own analysis in MAIN COMMITTEE 1427 and programs that assist Australian approach to trade, industry and export side of the House is found in the government's which the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime There are a number of points that are worth or mention of any jobs target or any employment the last trade outcomes and outlooks statement of now member for Canberra, Bob MCMullan, outlook statement contained an express commitment the year 2000.

I rise to speak on the additional Committee today and, predictably enough, I wish and regional development sections of the additional be appropriated with respect to the Department the vicinity of $367 million, and all but about privatisation and associated rearrangements It is with some pleasure that I am able to because, unfortunately, we have not as yet had government's plans with respect to Australian proposals that are, in part, dealt with in these our national rail line. The Minister for Transport and Regional November on Channel 9's Sunday program that Australian National either in to to or in bits. criticised the former government-he attacked during a ministerial statement debate on aviation major policy statements but rather making or statements on TV-for this sort of behaviour, He chose not to use the forms of the House is involved with the Australian National announcement on the Sunday program. The minister has made three ministerial statements with respect to the future of the Australian rail the House and justify the position that he is adopting. On 15 April last year, the Chairman of Australian that the proposed deficit for Australian National projected $26 million, would end up being as established the Brew inquiry into the finances It is important to point out that substantial National.

The additional amount to of Transport and Regional Development is in $3 million of that relates to the proposed of Australian National. get up here and speak about Australian Nati6nal an opportunity in this parliament to debate the National. It is opportune today to consider the appropriation bills with respect to the future of Development (Mr Sharp) announced on 24 the government proposed to seek to privatise It is rather ironic that the minister, after having the former Keating government in June last year safety for not coming to the House with major announcements through press conferences then went ahead and did exactly that himself. to make an announcement of the magnitude that privatisation but, rather, sought to make the with respect to aviation safety but none industry. It is long overdue that he come into National wrote to the minister indicating for the 1995-96 year, instead of being a high as $106 million. As a result, the minister and general situation of Australian National. losses or deficits are not uncommon at Australian government under Malcolm Fraser, Australian in today's dollars; and in the preceding the drought-the loss was $72 million or $146 NA 1444 MAIN COMMITTEE million in today's figures. So there have been conservative governments with It is important to remember that community National's obligations. Therefore, some losses on Australian National certain requirements profitable. Labor introduced a range of reforms has pointed out, the number of workers into a little under 3,000 now. But what he fails across all the state systems as massive changes need for labour in the system. The former government also introduced National operator. It was effectively forced by the states order to get the state involvement and the left Australian National with something of Ghan, the Indian Pacific and the Overland; two facilities including Tasrail and Australian National had a bad year in 1992-93, it had its best year for a long time. 1994-95 still much better than 1991-92 and 1992-93. Laurie Brereton, that he was fiddling while going out backwards financially at the time of unfounded. Australian National's finances have deteriorated-there there is debate about the magnitude. We managed report, courtesy of a return to order motion formally tabled the report of the Brew inquiry the Senate inquiry. Mr Brew found that the losses for 1995-96 $148 million and that National Rail's creation National to operate profitably'. He found that million and described Australian National as that the government proceed with the former infrastructure body to own and operate the rail a purely commercial basis, which it was due operations and infrastructure be sold off either potentially in bits. On 12 September, a press release from Australian that it was already in the process of starting went through a rather convoluted explanation actions of the former government, so do not that the former government had done nothing Both of those comments were entirely contradictory. On 26 September it was revealed by the presented his report, had in some way become Southern Railway which was promoted by Macquarie Wednesday, 26 February 1997 substantial losses in the past, including under National Party transport ministers. service obligations are built into Australian will be inevitable, because governments impose that may not necessarily be capable of being into Australia's rail system. As the minister Australian National dropped from 13,000 in 1978 to point out is that the same thing happened in work practices and technology reduced the Rail as a stand-alone interstate rail freight to separate that out of Australian National in state track involvement with National Rail. This a rump with three major passenger operations-the major workshop facilities; and a range of other intrastate freight in South Australia. largely due to the recession, but in 1993-94 was not quite so good but, nonetheless, it was So the criticisms made of the former minister, Rome burned and that Australian National was his administration are simply untrue and totally is no question about that-although to obtain an executive summary of the Brew in the Senate. The minister still has not been in the parliament but it has been provided to would be of the magnitude of $130 million to had 'made it almost impossible for Australian Australian National had a total debt of over $800 overstaffed and overcapitalised. He recommended government's plan to establish a separate track track; that National Rail should be set up on to be anyway; and that Australian National's to state governments or private operators, National came to light, which indicated to sell off SOIL,· of its businesses.

But at the same time he was alleging to stem the flow of financial problems at AN. opposition that Mr Brew, shortly after having entangled with a consortium called the Great Bank. Although it is not clear exactly NA Wednesday, 26 February 1997 what the nature of his relationship was there, in regard to that connection. What is obvious and his analysis, Mr Brew was contemplating associated with a private operator who may recommended the privatisation of AN, and obviously When you actually read the Brew report itself, is essentially an accounting exercise only. involved in operating the rail system that AN has only recently become obvious because we report. But it certainly does not do anything and loss account of all of the individual sections of how they fit together, what purposes As I have indicated, on 24 November the that he would sell AN either in bits or as a single $250 million for 1995-96. This had gone up $135 million and $148 million, and now to billion package to save AN. Both of these figures included a figure of $140 million for one-off related to asset revaluations. Now, a decline in the value of AN's assets is an operating loss which can be expected to continue was for one-off abnormals and $40 million which, in effect, is a community service obligation AN is effectively obliged to continue operating unlikely to become profitable. The actual $14 million higher than the equivalent The situation is not good. Clearly, it exaggerated the problems and grossly exaggerated AN in order to justify selling it off. It is important throughout the world, in most cases directly the main long-haul passenger rail system there, billion a year by the public sector. So that is The $2 billion package was also largely $2 billion consisted of funds already allocated Australia-as it was originally called and then Infrastructure Authority-which is to own actually cut the funding proposed for that budget under the Keating government.

So $140 million was an ongoing Commonwealth subsidy to AN component.

Clearly, a strategy needs to be But it has been grossly exaggerated in order to reasons, to get it off the budget and to get the budget. That is why it is occurring. This phoney it. The best illustration of this is the government's National Rail has reduced the interstate freight the space of four or five years. So, even though rail picture looked at as a whole has improved Rail has done what it intended to do, which operations. That is the evidence given by the Regional Development to a Senate This illustrates the hypocrisy of the government's AN is that its finances are bleeding it. Yet commercial viability, as it was intended to justification. The real reason is to get the community service obligations and government budget obligations. It is also worth noting that the Grants inquiry about the likely consequences of the to the states. Senator Abetz said that Tasmania MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 February 1997 package refers to Australian National's debt. This obligation of the Commonwealth. We are talking the Commonwealth is saying, 'We will assume as the sole owner of Australian National It has simply shifted it from one heading to thing has been done here is ridiculous. where there is an amount of $580 million for over many years is that Australian National fully consolidated revenue, and the super obligations out of consolidated revenue.

252,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITIEE,"Wills) (7.11 Ports (Mr Holding) and other previous speakers Agency Bill, such as the member for Batman Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), have eloquently outlined to canvass much of the territory that they things about one aspect of this legislation, of the Commonwealth Employment Service, the which has served this nation well for the past is part of the Howard government's desire to for cost cutting. The coalition made no mention of plans in the 1996 election campaign. Indeed, in a it promised to support the CES as a public of us with longer memories, an explicit commitment Liberal and National parties' plan to rebuild 1991, on page 218. That plan was rejected by the job placement activities of the CES will here is a bill which is another flagrant example the government having any mandate to do so. There has been a long-term campaign against such as Judith Sloane, ideologically opposed market, and I guess it is likely that Prime comment during his period as shadow industrial the department of employment under the Labor think, that the CES has been absolutely crucial particularly long-term unemployed, since the recession. The fact is that nearly two million Australians another and its employees are dedicated people the unemployed, the job seekers-not just the available vacancies. I think something ought their role. As a member of the federal parliament, Victorian state parliament, I have often had Coburg CES, Glenroy CES, Brunswick CES and and dedication to their task to be first class in my electorate. But what we will have as a result of this bill April as the new Commonwealth Services Delivery up responsibility for the referral of job seekers, formally closed or rebadged as the Public September. What we have, in effect, is the public employment service-something that taxpayers, they and their kids can get assistance Wednesday, 26 February 1997 is that first of all you create a board, then structure, then you privatise-(Time expired) p.m.)-The honourable member for Melbourne on this Commonwealth Services Delivery (Mr Martin Ferguson) and the member for many of its shortcomings and I do not wish have already covered. But I do want to say a few which is the way in which it is part of the gutting CES, that publicly funded employment service 50 years, and the way in which this legislation make the unemployed bear the burden of its drive to abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service letter to the Community and Public Sector Union employment service. It was, however, for those in the extremist Fightback program, the and reward Australia, launched back in November voters at the 1993 election. It said, 'Most of be privatised or contracted out.' So what we have of reintroducing the Fightback agenda without the CES from some right-wing academics, to any public sector involvement in the labour Minister Howard was influenced by that kind of relations minister. But reports prepared by government demonstrated unequivocally, I in cutting the numbers of unemployed, and use the CES each year for one reason or who take on the difficult task of matching up better off ones, the better qualified ones-with to be said in defence of their contribution and and indeed previously as a member of the occasion to make contact with officers of the so on. In each case I found their commitment and of immense benefit to people without jobs is the CES starting to wither on the vine from Agency commences operations and picks although the CES is apparently not to be Employment Placement Enterprise until about disappearance of that 50-year-old comprehensive in my view, have a right to expect that from when it is needed. NA Wednesday, 26 February 1997 I also want to lament-as well as lamenting employment service-the fact that the PEPE indeed, from other legislation coming before scrutinised by the parliament in contradiction government. The Public Employment Placement Enterprise to the unemployed from commercial and other informed us on 10 December last year, the incorporated as a company under the Corporations it has a 'commercial focus' as soon as possible. Employment Placement Enterprise will not be who the new private, profit-driven employment for. The government has correctly pointed out private providers to the traditional dominance cases of one-on-one case management, has worked fails to recognise is that the CES needs to continue employment service to ensure that all Working Nation involved the strengthening competition and it is that balanced combination has got the results in terms of cutting the low. Under this arrangement, under this bill, provider having the resources to adequately competition and freedom of choice for all. The public sector employment enterprise other private employment agencies, and providers will also find it difficult to get through term as employment placement enterprises in such as Drake. There are, indeed, a number of unanswered employment agencies in bringing about these make out of unemployment under the new arrangements. that there is a strong potential for fraud companies which has been involved here is Drake Liberal Party, and no other party, Although the government has formally advertised process until late March, we already see brand areas, presumably in the expectation that they announced in January that finders' fees would agencies from February. We can also go back in August last year that it was Prime Minister at a Cabinet meeting on 9 April last year Another private employment agency which Bensons Hospitality. There have been pretty MAIN COMMITTEE 1481 the passing of that comprehensive public has been excluded from this legislation and, the parliament so that it is not going to be to earlier assurances that we had from the will not operate to fill in the gaps in service providers. Instead, as Senator Vanstone Public Employment Placement Enterprise will be Law and a company structure will ensure In my book that means that the Public able to effectively look after the unemployed placement agencies and enterprises do not cater that Labor first introduced competition from of the CES and that this, and particularly in quite well. But what the new legislation to playa central role in the provision of those who need case management receive it. of the CES as well as the introduction of of public, community and private sector which numbers of long-term unemployed to a five-year we will not have a public employment service compete. Therefore, you will not get true will not be able to compete with Drake and the many of the smaller and more community-based the tender process and survive in the medium comparison with larger commercial enterprises questions about the role of the private changes and the money that they are going to I would suggest to the parliament under the proposed arrangements.

(2) Do taxation law penalties apply to companies claiming the negative gearing deductions referred to in part (1). Mr Costello--The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1)(a) Negative gearing deductions arise for all taxpayers, including companies, in situations where the interest on money borrowed to fund a project is greater than the initial returns of that project. Negative gearing deductions often arise in cases where a rental property has been purchased as the interest cost in the initial years of ownership is high. Generally, negative gearing deductions only apply to income producing property.

(I )(b) A company that has been deregistered by the Australian Securities Commission will cease to be a legal entity for taxation purposes and will, therefore, not be required to lodge income tax returns. (2) A taxpayer, including a company taxpayer, claiming negative gearing deductions is treated, for taxation purposes, no differently from any other taxpayer and the full range of taxation law penalties can be applied where circumstances are appropriate. Taxpayers are sometimes required to substantiate claims for deductions shown in tax returns. Where a company can demonstrate it has a proper entitlement to a claim for negative gearing deductions, no taxation penalties will be imposed.
