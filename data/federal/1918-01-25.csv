1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I should like to refer to a matter, mentioned in the House during the present sitting, regarding the revision of Hansard proofs. I fel t it was necessary for me to take some notice of certain observations and criticisms made in this chamber, and therefore I asked the P r in cipal Parliamentary Reporter to f u r n i sh me with a report in such terms as he thought advisable. The report is as follows: In reply to Mr Speaker's inquiry concerning proof revision by honourable members, and with special reference to an alteration made by the Prime Minister, to which exception has been taken, attention is directed to the following extract from the memorandum, attached to each set of proofs issued to members:Honourable members are respectfully requested to note that emendations which alterthe sense of words used in debate or introduce new matter are not admissible - their speeches. The terms of this memorandum were deter Holder in response to a request by me, dictated by a desire to preserve the fidelity of the cial report, that honourable members in revising the proofs of their speeches might be restricted to the correction of errors. This suggestion was founded upon much reasonable criticism of the extent to which certain honourable members exercised the privilege of revision, and was also put forward in the discharge of what I conceived to be my duty as the officer responsible to Parliament for the production of the reports. In accordance with instructions I then received, all cases in which doubt has existed as to whether the limits laid down in the memorandum have been exceeded have been referred  or rejection of the proposed alteration. In these instances members have sometimes desired to employ verbiage which apparently altered the sense of the words used in debate, and in other cases have sought to introduce new matter. Applying the decision of the Presiding Officers in these instances to the alteration recently made by the Prime Minister, it should certainly be accepted. Although the alteration unquestionably qualified the phrase originally used, it could not, in my judgment, be regarded as an alteration of sense within the definition of the terms laid down by many Presiding Officers' decisions, nor, according to similar decisions could it be designated new matter. If it be considered that my discretion, in this instance, was wrongly exercised, it would be necessary to in future reject a considerable number of emendations which have hitherto been accepted without question as not infringing the rule. Further experience of the latitude allowed to honourable members in proof revision, however, induces me to again suggest that they should strictly confined to the correction of errors in the report. The alterations in phraseology made by some honourable members are frequently so extensive as to render it extremely difficult, in the very limited time available for the purpose,, to determine whether or not the rule has been infringed. In the interests of the trustworthiness of the reports, ' for the purpose of reference, and as embodying an accurate record of debate, I respectfully invite the reconsideration by the Presiding Officers of the existing practice. B: HABBY jPansNn, Principal Parliamentary Reporter. 25th January, 1918. W it h reference to this report I desire to in f o rm the House that, while honourable members generally exercise the privilege of revision only to the extent of correcting errors, and some members not at all , others do so with a considerable amount of freedom, not only in the direction of amplification and qualification, but also in otherwise altering the phraseology of Where this has been done within reasonable limits and without altering the offi- sense of their utterances or introducing new matter-althoug h in some cases it has caused inconvenience and delay in checking and re-setting-suc h emendations have been allowed to pass. f t not infrequently, happens that the effort to crowd a number of subjects and arguments into a time-limited speech, especially when the train of thought is disturbed by interjections or other distracting influences, betrays some honourable members into expressing themselves in terms which, when read in print, are found either to obscure their meaning .or to convey an erroneous impression. And I am not prepared to say that in such circumstances honourable members are not entitled to make corrections necessary to convey the meaning they intended when speaking. i In a publication which circulates so largely among public libraries in various countries, in literary institutes, in universities for the use of students of constitutional history, and in shorthand schools for the purpose of dictation, alterations involving improvement in literary composition, greater elegance of diction, or lucidity of expression should perhaps be encouraged rather than otherwise; but if the general trustworthiness of Hansard is likely, in consequence of emendations, to be seriously affected, its value as a reliable record of our debates will be greatly impaired, and it may be necessary in the future, unless the House otherwise decide, to confine emendations strictly to the correction of obvious errors. HEARING OE CLAIMS : INCREASE.",21
2,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"the upon notice Whether he will give instructions so that all applications for pensions under the War Pensions Act sliould be heard before the Commissioner, or his deputy as in an open Court, and that the applicant may, if he so desires, and at his own expense, be represented at the hearing by his own medical officer?",22
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"for Sir JOH NFORREST ) The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not considered that it would be to the claimant's advantage for applications to be hoard as in an open Court. Under the existing system, every assistance and consideration is given to claimants. There is no objection to an applicant submitting the evidence of his own medical officer at any time if he so desires; such evidence would receive full consideration. Therefore, there would be no advantage derived from the personal attendance of his own medical officer at the hearing. If a soldier is dissatisfied with the rate of pension granted, he has the right of appeal, and, on appeal, is further medically examined by another doctor or a specialist.  upon noticeIs it the intention of the Government to revise the pensions of soldiers at an early date, particularly of those who are totally blind? - Mr HUGHES - The Government is reviewing the whole question of pensions of soldiers, particularly of those who are totally blind. It is hoped that it will be possible to make an early announcement. - -' PEDERAL COAL BOARD: COAL FREIGHTS.",22

At the desire of the Premier of New South Wales, Captain Glossop was appointed chairman of the Board. 3. In regard to the 12 per cent, and 4 per cent, in question, there are no such charges in the sense referred to. The overseas ship-owners and the Inter-State ship-owners have agreed, for the purpose of facilitating rapid despatch of steamers from the port of Sydney, that the whole of the coaling of these vessels should be administered by the Sydney Coal Board; and they have agreed to a flat charge of 28s. 6d. per ton, to cover costs of coal and all incidental charges, such as labour, freight, trimming, &c, provided that, if it is found that in carrying out of the operations in regard to the supply of this coal, the cost of same shall exceed such flat rate, the companies shall pay such excess pro ratd tonnage of coal supplied to the steamers of the respective companies; and, conversely, should it be found that such flat rate shall exceed cost, a refund shall be made to the companies accordingly on the some pro rata basis. 4. These charges varied in accordance with the conditions of work, nature of steamers, and quality of coal, and the prices at which various contractors were prepared to do the work. 5. The rate referred to in answer tion 3. 6. Approximately, 6s. per ton.

Will the Government give instruction that in future applications must be invited from returned soldiers for all such positions-prefer ence to be given (all other things being equal) to applicants who have seen active service in, or near, the fighting line?",23
15,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. The Comptroller of Eepatriation, with approval of the Minister. 2. Major Cunningham was chosen on his merits, ancl by reason of his special qualifications. His selection for the position has already been well justified. 3.

The first consideration in regard to appointments to the Department is efficiency, and none but those best qualified for the work will be selected. Subject to that condition, preference has been, and will be, extended to returned soldiers. No further discrimination is considered desirable. ^ NA IN EUROPE.",24

25,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING TEE NUMBEE OF NAMES ON THE ROLL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Instructions have already been issued that, where possible, soldiers' pay books should be checked prior to embarkation. Jt has been i found impossible for this to be completely carried out owing to insufficient notice of embarkation in a great number of cases. Furthermore, thousands of payments are made to Australian soldiers in British and other hospitals, of which advice is not received until after embarkation. Experience shows that many of these payments are not entered in the paybooks. For these reasons it is impossible to pay soldiers in full on discharge without involving the Department in serious overpayments. The able. balance of active pay as per pay-book is paid to the soldier within two or three days of his return, and 75 per cent, of his paid on discharge. Every effort is being made, both in Australia and abroad, with a view to prompt finalization of soldiers' accounts, and is anticipated that the will shortly be available within a few weeks of discharge.

32,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"The answers to the T honourable member's questions are as follow : 1.' Reports have been received from time to time in regard to the treatment at the Internment Camp9 in Germany. 2, 3, and 4. The camp where Australian civilian prisoners aTe quartered is organized Mith a chairman and a secretary, who communicate with the High Commissioner's office, London, from time to time their needs in the way of clothing, &c, when arrangements are made to meet them through the Central Prisoners of War Committee, London. Six parcels of food are sent monthly to every man, value 13s. to 14s., in"" addition to 64 lbs. of bread per man, and clothing on same scale as British prisoners. The High Commissioner states that the Australian civilian prisoners receive identical ment in matter of food and clothing with British prisoners, but, as a result of correspondence, a special allowance of extra boots and clothing has been sanctioned. He further states that all letters from the camp are promptly answered. The High Commissioner states that the Central Prisoners of War Conunittee now desire to place all overseas civilians under the care of their respective Governments. He suggests, however, that this Government await receipt of his letter of 7th December before taking action in this respect. The Commonwealth Government has no information as to the British Red Cross Society being willing to undertake the work of attending to the Australian civilian prisoners on payment of £2,500 pe* annum.

38,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as folThere are two harvests in process of realization, viz., 1915-16 ancl 1916-17, and it is not repossible at this stage to state the amount due farmers. In the case of the former, there is a considerable quantity still on hand in Victhe toria and South Australia, which, although forming part of the British Government sale, is subject to contingent charges. In addition to this, there is a considerable quantity of the 1916-17 harvest unsold, consequently the net the price realized is not ascertainable.",26
39,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"the Prime M in - ister, upon notice What progress has been made with the erection of silos for the storage of grain authorized by this Parliament last year within the various wheat-growing States ?",26
40,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows : Contracts have recently been let for the of the New South Wales silos, and the work is to commence almost immediately. Tenders for the erection of silos in Victoria be called towards the end of this month.  emthe Prime Minister, upon notice I. Wliether the Prices Commissioner has regulations authorizing the use of second(and hand bags for wheat consigned tb millers? 2. If so, do such regulations still exist, and has the price for such bags been fixed? 3. Will the Government take seriously into consideration the advisability of re-organizing the Wheat Pool conditions, and placing the same on a basis similar to wool, more particularly in reference to payments?",26
41,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are follow:1. No. The Wheat Pool, however, determined that wheat should not be received in second hand sacks which would go into the Pool. The Board had no objection to millers receiving new wheat in second hand' sacks, as this would not in any way endanger the stacks of the Pool. 2. See No. 1. No price has been fixed for second hand bags under the War Precautions (Prices) Regulations. 3. The conditions relating to wheat differ so entirely from those applying to wool, that this request cannot be complied with. The weight of wheat harvested in recent years is ten times as great as that of the wool clip, hence the wool clip can be shipped much more easily than the harvest. Difficulties of wool storage are comparatively few, but in regard to wheat, they are exceedingly great. Wheat is apt to undergo deterioration, to which wool is not subject. Further, the whole of the 1.910-1017 harvest has not yet been sold-ove r 30 por cent, still remaining unsold. Although an advance of 3s. per bushel, estimated at £15,750,000 (exclusive of expenses) has been arranged by this Government for the 1917-1918 harvest, not one bushel has been sold to the Imperial Government, or any other buyer.  the P r i m e Minister , wpon, notice I. On what date was Mr Clement Giles elected to a seat on the Australian Wheat Board as Growers' Representative for the wheat growers of the Commonwealth? 2. How many meetings of the Australian Wheat Board have been held since Mr Giles' appointment? 3. Has Mr Giles, as Growers' Representative, protested against his exclusion from the executive of the Australian Wheat Pool? 4. Haye the representatives of the organized farmers of the"" respective wheat-growing States interested in the Wheat Pools urged that the Growers' Representative should be appointed to the executive of the Board, and that he should be remunerated from the proceeds of the Pool? 5. Do the functions of the executive of the Australian Wheat Board include negotiations for the sale of the wheat under control of the Board, and the agreements connected therewith ? C. Has Mr Giles had practical experience in the sale and marketing of wheat in European markets? 7. Is there any reason why Mr Giles has been denied a position on the executive of the Australian Wheat Board?",27
42,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. 7th August, 1917. as 2. Three. 3. Mr Giles has brought under notice of the Wheat Board representations of various organizations, protesting against the status accorded him by the Board. 4. Yes. 5. The executive of the Wheat Board have at "" no time had functions in which other members of the Wheat Board were not entitled to participate. 6. It is known that Mr Giles represented, in London, the South Australian Farmers' Union for some years. ' 7.

I regret to say that the Wheat Board has been unable to effect the sale of fhis harvest, and, although we shall spare no effort to satisfactorily dispose of it , I think it only right to say that, as far as one can see, there is no immediate prospect of their being able to do so. However, this will not affect the guarantee, which stands on its own basis, and is independent of any sale.",34

I feel sure I am echoing the sentiment of every honourable member when I say that it will be indeed a happy consummation if by the time we meet the first real and earnest ofEer of a peace which will prove acceptable to both sets of belligerents has been made. In meantime, and failing that, the Government will direct its attention wholestood heartedly, and without delay, to the question of securing reinforcements f o our forces abroad, 'and to thati other side, of the same question-the repatriation our returning soldiers. I hope that i both these matters, as well as in all other complex and difficult problems which now confront us, we shall have the assistance of all sections of the House. The question of finance, upon which, to discussed. a certain extent, all other things must rest, is engaging the very earnest attention of the Government. Honourable bers have already been told by the TreaGeneral's surer that it will be necessary to raise Australia the sum of £40,000,000, probably a good deal more, before the end of the year. That is a task which confronts us in any ^circumstances, and it Mr HUGHES is one to which we must seriously address trial matters. ourselves. The policy we shall adopt, and the means by which we hope to achieve our end, it is not my present purany pose to discuss.

I admit that the sitting this afternoon is quite an extraordinary one.",35
97,Mr HUGHES,OF COMMONWEALTH,"There were about fifty questions, I think.",36
98,Mr TUDOR,OF COMMONWEALTH,"There were forty-eight. The Prime Minister has included two that he expected to be asked next week. Until quite recently, honourable members who have sat in this House for the past sixteen years have been accustomed to the practice of Ministers reading replies to questions which were put to them. If we cannot follow the business which is being transacted more intelligently than we could follow the replies given to questions this afternoon",36
99,Mr FOWLER,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The questions are the property of the House, anyhow.",36
100,Mr TUDOR,OF COMMONWEALTH,Exactly . Under the practice which was adopted this afternoon we must await the publication of Hansard in order to ascertain the answers which were given to the questions which appeared on the business-paper.,36

'",36
108,Mr HUGHES,OF COMMONWEALTH,No; I did not say that.,36
109,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"My recollection may be inaccurate in the matter. I am sorry that we are not likely to meet earlier, though I hope that the Government may be able to call us together sooner than the date spoken of. I realise that the extraordinary circumstances connected' with the formation of this Government make it necessary that M in isters should have some time in which to consider what their policy is to be, and I take this opportunity to say a few words on the remarkable political situation in which we find ourselves. I shall shortly refer to what has been called a pledge, and what the Prime M in ister designated as in the nature of a threat, the public declaration of policy contained in the announcement of the Ministry that they could not continue to carry on the government of the country without conscription. I am personally concerned with what has followed, being one of those who backed the Government's bill absolutely. I stated that I would be bound entirely by the pledge that had been given. Three questions will arise in the minds of the public in connection with the ret u r n of Ministers t'o office. The first of these is, Has any change in the circumstances of - the war, or of Australia's participation in it , occurred which affects the declaration made b$ the Prime Minister in November last? I think that the answer which will occur to every one present is "" No . "" The Prime Minister today - indicated that there is some possibility of peace negotiations. That is a very cheering thought to us all, and we sincerely hope that peace may soon come; but in the absence of anything definite, the circumstances of the war and of our participation in it are the same now as they were in November, or certainly not better now than they were then. The second question is, Does' the Government intend to introduce conscription? The answer to that has been practically given by the Prime Minister, who has that at the present time it is impracticable-politically , at all eventsto introduce conscription by Act of Parof liament, and that it would be impracticable to go to the country on the quesprotion, even were a dissolution obtained. This brings me to th© third question, which is of vital interest to the Government and the'party that supports it . If circumstances have not altered, and if conscription is not going to be introduced, although in November last it was declared after full consideration to be vital to our participation in th© war, the people will naturally wish to know if th© Government has any definite or alternative method of obtaining the needed reinforcements. That is the plaiii issue before us, I do not think that the Government have yet, or had when M in isters re-accepted office, any definite native scheme in mind. If it had, that scheme should, have been stated long ago. Therefore, the time that will elapse before we meet again seems to me to be given the Prim© Minister and his colleagues to try to devise an effective substitute for conscription which will procure. 7,000 cruits a month. I do not think it will be possible to get quit© so many as that, and I do not know what suggestions hav© been made, but I say emphatically that a declaration of the kind made by the Prime Minister cannot be lightly put aside. No change of circumstances, no decision of honourable members, can alter a definite engagement of the kind that was given. To my mind, the warrant of Ministers for retaining their seats on the Treasury bench must depend on whether they Can between now and the next meeting bring forward some definite and complete scheme whioh will have a reasonable chanc© of proving an adequate substitute for conscription. If the Government asks us to endorse the continuation, or any variation, of - that wretched system-wretche d in its later development at all events-of hysterical appeals to the sense of shame of persons who have no sense of shame, which for some months, or for some weeks, before conscription was declared to be vital, had resulted in the number of recruits dwindling down to a small stream, consisting almost entirely of schoolboys lately arrived at the age of eighteen years, of soldiers who had been patched up and were ready to return to the Pront, and of family men who, having managed to settle their affairs, found themselves able to volunteer, as they had all along in tended to do-if we enter again on that wretched system, I say now, and I desire to place it on record, that not only shall w© fail in our duty to the Empire, but that Ministers will be in a position of having failed to honour th© pledge which they gave to the people. Whether they will do that or not remains to be seen. During th© conscription campaign I was asked on many platforms whether the Government would keep its pledge, and I repeatedly said that it ' was unthinkable that an engagement of honour, given under such circumstances, would not be maintained in substance as well as in the letter. The only way in which it can be so maintained is by the Government finding some effective alternative to conscription. The Prime Minister has today menaltertioned a large number of very important - matters that will engage the attention of th© Government in the immediate f u t u r e : Eepatriation, finance, industrial legislation, and so on. These matters are of extraordinarily great importance, but, overshadowing them all at the present moment is the absolute and paramount necessity re- of not allowing our divisions at the Pront to be depleted and broken up, and our promise to the Empire to fail. Conscription, as th© Prime Minister has pointed out, is neicessarily put aside for the tim© being-man y honourable members think for all time, though I do not. I have said before that I do not believe that there will be any method whereby we can get anything like the necessary reinforcements unless both parties cordially co-operate' in the attempt to get them, and I had hoped that, before we parted, the Leader of the Opposition would have been in a position to say whether, on this one point of getting recruits, honourable members opposite were willing to co-operate with the Government and the party on this side in any way that might be devised without any breaking of pledges owed by them to their party outside. I cannot get it out of my mind the impression that honourable members opposite are not entirely free in this matter. At any rat©, I understand that alliances or coalitions with any other party are not permissible to them. It is not my desire to stir up conflict, rather do I seek to still it , if possible; but, assuming that I have stated the position of honourable members opposite correctly, I would like to know fro m their leader ""whether, despite all that has been said during the heat of the recent debate, it is not still possible to have-some form of co-operation, short of coalition, for i this purpose 1 I have already suggested a meeting of all members who are anxious to find a way out. The Government are obliged to go into the question of trying to find recruits, and the only bar to honourable members opposite joindoctors ing in the same task is, as one gathers from their own expressions, the fact they cannot co-operate with this Governtheir ment. It is unfortunate that we have had no statement from the Leader of the Opposition that his party will be ready - withi n certain limits-to meet our jparty for the purpose of considering what means may be taken to the end of securing reup for them. inforcements, and for the prevention of humiliating disaster to this country, which seems possible if, through our failure to provide our men with sufficient reinforcewould ments, our divisions have to be broken up. Surely it is not too late for the orable member to give some indication co-operation of a limited kind-whateve it may be-in the future, even to the tent of sharing in a National GovernPederal ment. At any rate, for the present, an announcement from the honourable memsocieties ber that his party will share in the task of attempting to arrive at some effective policy of getting recruits will be most finances. acceptable.",36

I refer the dispute between the British Medical societies.

I have no desire to go into the merits demerits of the case, because I do not wish to prejudice any action that I would like the Federal Government to take. societies The British Medical Association has made a demand on the friendly societies for payment of 6s. per annum in excess of what has been paid in the past under certain agreements - The friendly societies the doctors until the war was over. have agreed to give 50 per cent, of the advance asked, and there the matter rests. The State Government appointed a Judge to consider the matter.",38
111,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,They asked him to preside at a conference between the parties to the dispute.,38
112,Mr MATHEWS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The trouble is that, on the 31st of this month, the whole of the members of friendly societies in toria, with the exception of a few whose are not members of the British Medical Association, will be left without that medical attendance for themselves and families. Of the members of the friendly societies in this State, 19,000 have enlisted. These men are practically made free members of the lodges, but their payments to the doctors are still maintained, and their lodge fees are kept This responsibility has a placed a considerable expense on the societies. At the same time, funeral allowance payments have been greater than otherwise have been the case, and sick payments have also been hongreater than would have been the case if of there had been no war.. I mention theser matters in order to show that this is a exquestion of national importance. The Government should have some degree of. responsibility, because these relieve the Treasury of considerable disbursements which otherwise would have fallen on the Commonwealth",38
113,Mr HUGHES,OF COMMONWEALTH,When will the agree,38
114,Mr MATHEWS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"On the 31st instant, to I am a trustee of two or three of these In one case there are sixty It men at the Front, and many of the men of have left dependants here who will be medical attendance at the end of < this month. Seeing that it is a matter of national importance, could not a regulation be framed under the War PrecauGotions (Moratorium) Regulations deferring the resignations of the doctors for another month so that some arrangement may be or come to between the two parties ? Rut for the war having depleted the number of eligible men available, the friendly of Victoria would not be in their present position, as they would have been able to secure other doctors to take up their work. Let me say that there was a truce declared between the societies and I mention that as another justification for action by the Prime Minister, because it goes to show that the difficulty is one which has arisen out of .the war. A statement appeared in the press that the legal representative of the British Medical Association, Mr Stanton Crouch, asserted that there was no truce; but I have seen a letter from this gentleman, dated some Victime back, charging a certain friendly society with having broken the truce. Such a letter could not have been written if Mr. Crouch had not recognised that there was such a truce as I have referred to. It may seem a somewhat strange request to ask the Prime Minister to compel medical men in Victoria to attend members of friendly societies, and give them professional advice; but I am not asking the right honourable gentleman to say that t l e doctors should continue to render their services to members of friendly societies for the fees they are getting"" now, but' that a definite break between the medical men and the societies should be postponed for another month, to give time for an amicable settlement of the difficulty. The State Government have signally failed to deal with the matter. Perhaps I should not have said that, but there can be no doubt that their efforts in that direction have not been successful. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has been watching the press references to the matter, or has given it, so far, any consideration; but if he will take action to postpone the breach for another month, to give time for a friendly settlement of the difficulty, I can assure him that the whole of the friendly societies of Vietoria will be keenly appreciative of h s : services.",38
115,Mr SAMPSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Wimmera) [3.551- I shall not refer to recent incidents arising from the Federal situation further than to say that my attitude towards the Government in connection with the Bendigo pledge is well known. I regretted very much, indeed, and I think the bulk of the honourable members of this Parliament, and probably the majority of th* people of Australia, equally regret that Ministers should have given such a pledge. I have been pleased to hear the statement made by the Prime Minister tL t during the recess it is the intention. of the Government to consider questions of prime national importance, and that when Parliament meets again, the Government will be in a position to make a declaration as to their policy. I trust that their policy will include satisfactory proposals for providing reinforcements which will relieve the Administration from the serious criticism directed against it in connection with the Bendigo pledge. I hope that the policy will have regard, also, for the promise made at Bendigo prior to the last general election, when the National party was returned with such a large majority. Consideration must be given to the relations between i capital and labour, and every effort must be made to enable Australia to increase its production if we are to get back to normal conditions after the war without delay. I shall not attempt to discuss details of industrial legislation, but I suggest that representatives of the Labour organizations and of capital in Australia might be brought together to consider how far it is possible, not only to introduce a fair system of piece-work, as has been proposed in connection with the shipbuilding scheme, but also to secure cooperation between capital and labour in connection with all primary find secondary production. There is no country in the world in which the conditions are more favourable for the adoption of satisfactory industrial legislation, and the Government led by the Prime Minister will earn the lasting gratitude of the legislators of the world if they are able to bring about industrial harmony in the way I suggest, and so provide for increased production generally, with better conditions for the industrial section of the community. I hope that during the recess action will be taken by the Cabinet to relieve the Prime Minister of some of the duties that he is now called upon to carry out, and particularly that some other Minister will be called upon to relieve him of the work connected with the shipbuilding, scheme. I am glad that the Prime Minister has referred to the question of primary production, because it is so closely associated with transport. I believe there are good possibilities for the extension of trade in the Far Eastern countries and in the TJnited States. By associating the shipbuilding proposal with the matter of primary production, the transport of our products may be provided for in such a way as to enable us to finance our obligation in connection with the war, and to be of great assistance to us when the war is over. I trust that when Parliament re-, assembles the Government will come forward with proposals which will justify us in giving them such combined support as will enable Australia to carry out her part in the great war both at home and abroad. Action should be taken to bring about better terms between the present Ministry and th© Opposition in order that justice may be done in the matter of providing recruits for our Forces; and the stimulation of our industries. I am sorry that Parliament is to be in recess for so long a period. I should have preferred that th© important legislation that has been foreshadowed, and some of which has been already delayed too long, should be undertaken immediately. We are in formed that we are to go into recess for two months, but I trust that it will be possible for Parliament to meet earlier than is at present anticipated in order to deal with the important legislation indicated by the Prime Minister this afternoon.",39
116,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Brisbane) [3.58] The statement made by the Prime Minister this afternoon was one of the most surprising statements ever made in this House. I wish to refer to it in somewhat the same spirit as that adopted by the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will liam Irvine). It is impossible that we should fail to realise the extraordinary seriousness of the present position. must all feel thab the position of our own country and of the Empire demands the most serious attention. Whilst the Prime Minister was speaking, I could not help the recollection of a statement he made in Bendigo in A p r i l of last year, to the effect that the question of conscription having been decided by the people it would not be resurrected or revived. At that time th© Government were consequently faced with the necessity of finding a policy to carry on the war without conscription. Yet at this time of the day, after an interval of nearly ten months, the Prime Minister tells us that the Government are going to consider their policy. It is the most damaging admission of bankruptcy in government that, I think, Australia has ever. been faced with. The Government set out to win the war; they announced themselves as being ready to proceed vigorously with measures for winning the war last A p r i l .",40
117,Mr HEITMANN,OF COMMONWEALTH,And have they not done sot,40
118,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"They have done absolutely nothing to win the war. There is not a single thing to th© credit of the Government in connection with winning the war, but there is much to their discredit, and they have done more to lose the war, so far as Australia is concerned, than any other set of men in the country.",40

136,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The Prime Minister, onfcheface of it , - made whafc appeared to be a most generous offer, namely, that he would stand aside if he were ithe person in the way who prevented the cooperation of al l parties, bufc he qualified that by saying that the Opposition must be willing to adopt a policy acceptable to the National party.",41
137,Mr TUDOR,OF COMMONWEALTH,I could have been in the Ministry in the last eighteen months if I had swallowed my principles.,41
138,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I Prime Minister's offer was in regard to a Recruiting. coalition and National Ministry, and not in regard to minor matters.",41
139,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The National party did their best to defeat us. placed their policy against ours last May, and they won, and, therefore, are entitled to full y and freely carry out their policy. We put forward our war policy, but the country preferred thati of the National .party. From that day to this ing. we have not had the war policy of the Government put before us; there has nothing to indicate on what lines they pose to proceed in winning the war. When the policy of the Government is declared will, I suggest, be the time for the Leader cause they did not enlist. of the Opposition to be called on t whether he is prepared to support i not. He is not now in a position, and is unreasonable to. ask him to propound the conditions under which he is prepared to support the Government. Sir WILLIAM IBVINE party barred the door which the Governin Australia. ment wished to open.",41
140,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,I am inclined to think that the honourable member is aggerating that particular aspect of the barring of the door. I heard clear explicit offers made from this side during the no-confidence debate.,41
141,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"What I mean is that, by negativing conscription, you voluntary effort? barred the door that the Government desired to open.",41
142,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Certainly . conscription is to be in any way a, part the bargain, there is nothing doing.",41
143,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member still misunderstands me; I mean that the great responsibility of getting recruits by the voluntary system rests on you, because you barred the compulsory door.",41
144,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,I entirely dispute that. It is the responsibility of those who voted for conscription to find reinforcements.,41
145,Mr SAMPSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,How can you reason that way?,41
146,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,Those who believe in sending other people to fight should themselves show the example of recruiting. 1,41
147,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"We have been told that the introduction of .conscription did more than anything else to hinder recruiting. Mr FINLAYSON , - We hav© that on think the the authority of the Director-General of 1 Mr TUDOR - And the honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie), who is chairman of the Recruiting Committee of They Victoria, said the same thing.",41
148,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"That is so.

150,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I see no reason why it should. If the Ministry are preI f pared to come forward in the House of openly with a policy in regard to recruiting, I am certain that we on this side will give it the most sympathetic and favourable consideration. We will not criticise it with any hostile, bufc rather with a helpful, desire to do the best we can for Australia.",41
151,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,Why not within the next three months?,42
152,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Thaf c is for honourable members opposite to say. 'We on this side do not desire that the House should adjourn, and see no reason why it should. We are quite prepared to go on with the business.",42
153,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,It is a question of the parties meeting.,42
154,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The parties cannot meet until the Government move. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Wise) has said that there are nine members of the Government party favourably disposed, and I was wondering if we could apply the Scriptural reference, and ask, "" Where are the nine?"" There is only one honourable member opposite who has any concrete proposal. But until a proposal comes from the Government, or from some one with a following behind him amongst honourable members opposite, I do not see that it is worth anything. If the honourable member for Flinders can show that he has a backing on that side we are prepared to listen to him.",42

156,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,Why not in public our own affairs. conference in this House?,42
157,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,You know that would not achieve anything.,42
158,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I now desire to refer to another matter. To-day some questions in regard to the position occupied by Captain Glossop; and I was informed that he is an officer of the Royal Navy lent to the tralian Navy, that he is not on leave, and that he holds the appointment Captain-in-Charge of H.M.A. Naval Establishments, Sydney. Captain sop is reported in the Argus of 22nd December last as having addressed ing at Sydney in the following terms:It is with very mixed feelings that ing part in this ceremony. You all know the great referendum has taken place. What be my feelings on the subject? You have again decided on ""No."" Do you still inforce your men at the Front? By your votes yesterday you decided ""No."" The Government put the proposal before you, and you have turned it down. The feelings of every naval rating and every military rating are the same. They are ashamed that you have turned it down and have said "" No."" I wish to enter my most emphatic protest against the impertinence of Captain Glossop in interfering with the political affairs of Australia in this public manner. I previously protested against General Birdwood being allowed to interfere, and called his conduct an unpardonable impertinence.",42
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OF COMMONWEALTH,Captai n Glossop is a resident and a voter.,42
160,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I understand that he is an Imperial officer, and is only lent to us.",42

Although an Imperial officer, he is a resident.of Australia, and has just I asked married an Australian girl. _ Mr FINLAYSON - The Minister just told me that he was lent here on an engagement for three years. I am offerAusing no objection to that, although we are far too free with our appointments to men of who come from the other side of the water, when we have men in Australia Gloswho could do the work equally well.",42

169,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,"You are an importacan tion, occupying a position that an Ausrefuse to retralian should occupy.",42
170,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The proper parallel would not be aa put by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), but would exist if I interfered as an Australian member of Parliament in the affairs of the British Navy. That would be a stupid thing for me to do, and it is equally stupid, unnecessary, and impertinent for Captain Glossop to interfere in Australian political affairs. There is too much of that among both military and naval officers. The position of . Australian civilian prisoners in camps in Germany has for a considerable time been most unsatisfactory. I have brought the matter repeatedly before the Prime Minister with very unsatisfactory results. I was told by the Government today that it is proposed to defer any action until the High Commissioner's letter of 7th December is received. The Australian civilian prisoners in Germany found their position so intolerable, and the conditions under which they were placed so unpleasant, that they sent a statement to the High Commissioner pleading for his assistance. They received no reply, but I understand that the Government nave been informed by Mr Fisher that the Central Prisonersof-War Committee now desire to place all overseas civilians under the care of their respective Governments. I am informed that the committeb mentioned in London have undertaken to look after the welfare and comfort of the civilian Australian and other prisoners in Germany-wil l honourable members notice the difference between prisoners of war and civilian prisoners?-bu t ask that £2,500 per year should be allotted to them to cover their necessary expenses. That is where the difficiilty seems to have arisen. Mr James O'Connor, a returned Australian, made the following statement to the Sydney Morning Herald of 5th November last:The treatment of the civilians interned wicked. If they depended upon the food Germans supplied, all would have been dead have been done. long ago. The Australians, he says, should be permitted to have the food which their friends supply, and not be forced to rely entirely on the goods Bent by the Prisoners-of-War Association. The Kew Zealanders, who are supplied through the High Commissioner, are faring much better than the forty-eight Australians. Three out of five prisoners at Ruhleben are barefooted. Mr O'Connor says that civilians in Germany are without petrol. The civil population have no wool or linen, and women are wearing paper underclothing; but the organization ol the army is so wonderful that it will take three' years to knock it out. The Germans hate the very name of Australians and Canadians, who* are regarded as phe most doughty fighters in the Allied armies. The Government should give favourable consideration to any proposal, even if it costs £2,500 a year, that will secure comfort, as far as possible, to the civilian prisoners now in Germany. They are suffering severely. . I know one gentleman in Sydney whose son, unfortunately, happens to be there. Through mutual friends in Holland he has been able to send his son a parcel of food regularly every month. I have here the invoice of one lot of goods sent on 3rd June, and amounting in value to £1 3s. 7d. We are all anxious to do the best we can for people so unfortunately situated.",42
171,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,Did that food reach its proper destination ?,43
172,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Yes ; the young man has acknowledged the receipt of the parcel. There are certain restrictions on the sending of parcels, but there is an organization Teady to do the work if the Australian Government will assist it financially. The expenditure proposed would be more than sufficient to accomplish all we desire, giving us at any rate some satisfaction, and giving these unfortunate men and women the care and attention they deserve.",43
173,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Henty) [4.18] - I wish to speak of the situation that developed here .last week, and the attitude that I , with a number of other men, took up. I should not have spoken but for the violent outburst of antipathy on the part of the Argus newspaper against the men who were prepared to move an amendment to the no-confidence motion. We had given a certain definite pledge to the country, and wanted to see that pledge carried into is effect. We only did exactly what the the Argus said on the 22nd December should",43
174,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,Did you do it for the same reason?,43
175,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"We did not do it in the . same manner. The leading article in the Argus of that date saidThe pledge has been given, and it must be honoured as soon as the result of the voting is finally established. Every member of the Ministry will then fall back into the party which is charged with the direction of the affairs of the country, and is restricted only by the votes of the people against compulsion, and by the pledge which shuts Mr Hughes out from leadership. On Saturday last and on Tuesday of this week a number of who were prepared to honour that pledge were charged with having, in common with Germans, an antipathy to Mr Hughes and the Government. Nothing could be further from A great deal of fuss was made as to an alleged conspiracy that was going on; but the statement made to the press by the* honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) , the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Letekie), and myself was an exact and complete recital of the whole facts of the case. It was nob until after I had spoken in the House on Friday morning that we thought of doing anything at all in the matter. A consultation took place between us after luncheon. - Mr SAMPSON - And for the first time.",43
176,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Quite so. When we were sitting in the gardens after lunch on F r i day, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) came along and remarked that he did not wish to intrude. We told him 'at once that there was nothing secret or private going on, and that if he chose he could remain. He did remainwith us, and disagreed with the attitude we had adopted. But he was not in the position that we occupied to participate in the amendment, and we di d not ask for his adhesion to our proposal in any shape or form. All that we desired was to do what we had pledged ourselves to do, - quite irrespective of who might support us or what the effect might be. Mr FowiiEB - But ' you are charged with having intrigued with the Opposition.",44
177,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I shall deal with that point. The very moment the proposed amendment was drafted, I gave the Government W h i p an intimation that we in tended to move it . Yet, forsooth, the press comes out with the statement that "" the plot was discovered."" In the first plaice, there was no plot to discover; the only "" discovery "" made was the intimation made .to the Government W h i p by me, one of the supporters of the Government, t h at we intended to do a certain thing. Not one of the four honourable members concerned had any communication, in any shape or for m, with any member of the Opposition. I make that statement in the presence of my three honourable friends, who' agreed with me as to the submission of the amendment. members Sir WILLIAM IBVINE - The r e was no , communication with any member of the Opposition either before or after.",44

182,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"No r did we ask one member of our own party to support us. No one was asked, except the fou r who had agreed to the proposed amendment being submitted, to do anything, save that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Austin Chapman), who had not spoken during the debate, was requested to move the amendment. Since this refutation was made by the four honourable members concerned, it has been alleged that some other plot was afoot.",44
183,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,It was necessary for them to find some way out of it ,44
184,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Quite so, and in this other plot the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts), it is alleged, were consulted. It is further said that the honourable member for Cook, in some mysterious way, had remarked to an honourable member on this side, that ""fourteen and nineteen would do the t r i c k . """,44
185,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,That is quite untrue.,44
186,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,What is quite untrue-the doing of the trick ?,44

Again, I say that we had no communication about it with any member of the Opposition or any member of our party, save the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), who had not spoken in the debate, and who was asked, therefore, if he would submit the amendment.",44
193,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,Does the honourable member know whether the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had any communication with any member of the Opposition f,45
194,Mr FOWLER,OF COMMONWEALTH,He said he had,45
195,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,He said in a communication to the press that he had not.,45
196,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,And there is no reason to believe that that is not so.,45
197,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"That is so. Speaking for the four honourable members who signed the communication that we made to the press, I desire now to say that we had no hostility to the Government at all . Gur only concern was that we should honour our own pledge. If we had desired to engineer some scheme, then, from what I can hear, it would have been the easiest thing in the world to do.",45
198,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"It was "" all very well to dissemble your love,"" bufc why did yon try to kick the Government downstairs f",45
199,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I expressed my view of the Government at the meeting upstairs. I did not hide my light under a bushel. I never 'do. Ifc may be only a rush-light, but such as it is it flickers. I said on the floor of this House what I had said of the Government upstairs-that the Government, having given a pledge, should honour it , and should not take their old positions again.",45
200,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,Y e t the honourable member says that he has no hostility to the Government.,45
201,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Certainly , we had none, The honourable gentleman surely does not consider that such advice indicated host i l it y to the Government.",45

203,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"If a man backed a bill for you, and you asked him later on to meet it , surely such a request would not be indicative of your hostility towards that man. The man who had to pay the cash might regard it as hostility, but, having put his name' to the bill and assumed the obligation, he would naturally be expected to pay. That was our position. I want only to say that in the action we took we were not animated by any feeling of hostility to the Government. We believed that the vote on the proposed amendment would probably be determined by the great majority of the House against the view we put), but we did not concern ourselves with that point at all . We would have been perfectly satisfied to clear our positions by submitting the amendment we had prepared. not. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE--But if it had been carried we would have accepted the responsibility attaching to it .",45
204,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Certainly ; we could not have done otherwise. Mr J. H. CATTS - Accordin g to the press, the moment you thought it was likely to be carried you dropped it.",45
205,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,That assertion is untrnev,45
206,Mr SAMPSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,It is quite wrong.,45
207,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"What occurred may be stated in a very few words. It was put to me personally and, I think, to some of the others, fchafc, having regard to the stage of the debate which had been reached, and fco the fact that a promise had been given that honourable members should be allowed fco gefc away by 3.30 that afternoon, it would be unfai r fco spring such an amendment on the Government, and, further, that the Government had not had an opportunity to consider their position.",45
208,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,' O r their policy.,45
209,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"O r their policy. That we regarded as the strongest argument advanced as to why we should not go on with the proposed amendment. As declared this afternoon by the honourable member for Flinders, we were prepared, in view of the arguments that were put to us afc that time, to awaiti a declaration of the Government's policy, which would be framed during the recess. We considered that to be reasonable. Let me explain the point at which I find f a u lt with the Government W h ip (Mr . Greene). Knowing the circumstances, so far as we were concerned, he ought not to have kept his mouth shut when the newspapers were making bitter attacks upon us, but should have explained the position of those responsible for the proposed amendment. If he had any knowledge that other members of the party were scheming for the downfall of the Goment, heshould ' have named them straight out. I lay particular emphasis on the fact that we did not at any time have any communication with any person whatsoever, except with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, throughout the whole proceedings, which commenced after lunch and finished at 3.30 o'clock.",45
210,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Cook) [4.31] - It is to be regretted that, since the Govern-, ment have had a week to consider the discussion which took place in this House as to whether some means could be devised to secure co-operation outside of contentious matters, some further effort has not been made in this direction. The Prime Minister threw out a casual offer. It had all the ap- now. pearance of never having been considered, and, since then, it has been covered up with a considerable amount of doubt and suspicion. He said that, if he were in the way of that effective co-operation, so much desired at the present time between members of this Parliament, he would get out. As a result of the discussion that took place in this House last week, it is apparent that a majority of honourable members hold the belief that the Government can be better led than by the present Prime Minister. Surely Parliament is not so bankrupt resource as to be* unable to arrive at a better understanding. If honourable members had great private interests of their own at stake, they would not merely introduce an important matter such as this, and then dismiss it in a casual way, as has been done by the Government in regard to this suggested co-operatio'n. The mere fact that the proposal has not been followed up consistently shows that there is nothing behind it . The Prime Minister, after making this casual offer in an offhand manner in Parliament, went outside, and did not hear a solitary speech from either side of the House during the whole of the debate. We were told by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Watt), by way of interjection, that he would read it in Hansard. Very well, he has since had an opportunity of having the statements as they appear in Hansard dissected.",46
211,Mr SPEAKER,OF COMMONWEALTH," I must ask the honourable member not to traverse the grounds of the recent ""no-confidence"" debate.",46
212,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am not doing so, Mr Speaker.",46
213,Mr SPEAKER,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am afraid the honourable member is approaching the subject in that way. Mr J. Hv CATTS' - The Prime Minister has had an opportunity of examining the several speeches made on the subject, and if he had been in earnest he could have carried the discussion a stage further today. This course would have been adopted by any Government or body of' men in earnest about the matter. Coalition with honourable members on this side of the House is impossible.",46
214,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member said himself that honourable members on his side of the House would not coalesce. Mr JH CATTS,- I am saying that",46
215,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,No ; the honourable member is putting it the other way.,46
216,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,I am saying that coalition is impossible between the parties.,46
217,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Fro m the honourable member's point of view. Mr J. H. CATTS - Coalition is impossible, because the two parties represent fundamentally different principles of political and social economy. Further, could it be supposed for a moment that if any negotiations were possible with the Government, the party on this side of the House would be offered equal representaof tion with the Ministerial party, which haa nearly twice its strength f We know perfectly well we would not, and that there would be in Cabinet a majority dominated by members on the other side of the House, with, the result that the Labour party would be burdened with responsibilities for decisions arrived at by a Government in which the majority was against its representatives. This party could not accept a situation of that kind. A coalition is, therefore, impossible both on the grounds of principle and expediency, i We do not want office unless we can be in a position to carry out our policy. But, whilst we do not want office, we never have, and never will, shirk our responsibilities; and there is no doubt in the world that, had the Governor General accepted the assurance given him by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), and had we been called upon, we would have met this House as a Ministry, and have placed a war-time policy before the country. It would then have been for this House to reject that policy if it were thought to be unsuitable. This party, also,- would have submitted measures, short of any infringement of party principles, which I believe would have secured the co-operation of members on both sides, but, as I said, we did not have that opportunity.",46
218,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,Can the honourable member not put forward part of the party programme now 1,47
219,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I could introduce one or two matters for consideration, but whilst I know the general mind of the party I could not, until specific decisions were reached, lay down its programme in detail. I believe that, outside of a few vitally contentious subjects, we could have obtained the co-operation of all honourable members in conserving Australia's most vital interests at the present time. There are, however, one or two questions which should be out. of the way before there could be any sort of co-operation by honourable members on this side. There must, for instance, be a guarantee(1) That conscription shall be finally and absolutely abandoned for servioe upon foreign battlefields, as well as a guarantee against industrial conscription in Australia. (2) The 'restoration of industrial organizations and trade unions by reestablishing the legal rights and privileges of which they have been deprived since the conscription referendum of 1916. (3 ) The restoration of victimized workmen to their employment. There has been some talk of co-operation in regard to the voluntary system, but it seems to me that we have reached that stage when there would be a constant suspicion, especially in view of the qualified utterances-of Sir William Irvine, and in the absence of any direct statement from the Government. There is a suspicion that manoeuvring will take place to have another shot at introducing conscription. Until conscription is finally and definitely abandoned, and an assurance of sufficient force given to the public that they can believe it , it seems to me that there cannot be close and active cooperation between the parties. Honourable members know quite well that a large number of industrial organizations, have been badly damaged, and some of them smashed altogether, by administrative actions of this Government, which got votes from the soldiers overseas on the pledge that not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed.",47
220,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,How did the Governhave ment overturn the unions?,47
221,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Not through the Courts after investigation in the proper way, not by legislation in Parliament, but by regulations under the War Precautions Act. The Government have, in a number of cases, destroyed preference to unionists, which the unions had legally won in the Courts. . That is the act of the Government who pledged themselves to the trade Unionists overseas that if they would vote for the Prime Minister and those supporting him not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed. There is a suspicion that the power of the Government under the War Precautions Act is to be used to smash organized Labour. The outstanding principles which I enunciated are recognised by a number of honourable members on the Government side. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), in a press interview published in Sydney, stated distinctly that it was necessary that conscription for overseas should be definitely abandoned, and that industrial harmony should be restored in the manner I have indicated this afternoon in order to enable that co-operation ""which is so desirable in dealing with the great problems that confront the country. The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Boyd) stated this afternoon that from his observations it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have displaced the Government last week. That admission supports the statement that I have made that the majority of members in this House are being led by a Prime Minister, if not by a whole Government, in whom this House has no confidence, but the operation of the party machine on the Ministerial side prevents the voice of the dissentient minority of Nationalists being heard. We have read in the press that those honourable members who have gone to the extent of allowing it to be thought for. a moment that there is anything serious in their objectibns to the manner in which the country is being governed today will run the risk of having the party rule run over them, and they must either knuckle down and support the Government or leave the party.",47
222,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,There is no authority in this party that can punish in that way any member of it .,47
223,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"We shall see. I % seen men like the honourable member for Flinders ""(Sir William Irvine), the honourable member for Parkes (Mr . Bruce Smith), and Mr Robert Harper brought to book. I have heard men stand on the floor of the House and say positively that they would take a certain course, but a quarter of an hour later, after the party Whips had followed them outside and warned them that they would be opposed at the next election they returned to the chamber as meek as lambs. And the same thing will happen again. There is a means by which this country can be led in a way acceptable to Parliament and to the great majority of the people outside, and in a way that would give us better opportunities to co-operate on non-contentious matters than is possible under existing circumstances. Some honourable members on the Government side pledged themselves on the hustings to what are known as elective Ministries. Why not let us have an elective Ministry now? The Prime Minister and .the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) have said that they are prepared to go out of office. Let all the Ministers leave office and let us substitute an elective Ministry chosen by every member of Parliament, but confining the portfolios to members of the National party. this side do not seek any office. Let the Government party have all the portfolios, but allow Parliament itself by a majority vote to choose its Ministers. We should certainly get a different Prime Minister, because already the major i ty of the members of Parliament have expressed their opposition to him as the leader of the country.",47
224,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,They have not. Mr J . H . . CATTS - The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) stated this afternoon that from his observations it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have removed the Government last week.,48
225,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,t said that that was my impression from what I heard. I do not know whether that impression is r i g h t ; I made no. inquiries.,48
226,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member spoke of what he had heard from members of his own party, and if he, without making any inquiries, arrived at the conclusion that it would have been an easy thing to have removed the Government last week, how much easier would the .defeat of the Government have seemed if he had made inquiries ? An elective Ministry formed without interfering with the party principle, and gentle- without depriving the Ministerial party of one portfolio, would give us a Government with which there would be some chance of co-operation on all business other than those contentious matters upon which it is impossible for the two parties to reach an agreement. * Furthermore, why not give Parliament an opportunity of considering the proposals which honourable members would like to bring forward. Not since the commencement of the war has there been in this Parliament an untrammelleddiscussion of war-time measures. A Minister comes before Parliament with some proposal, and we are told that we must take that or nothing. Quite the majority of honourable members have no say in formulating the ' legislation. An y suggestions made from this side of the House are treated with ridicule and contempt. On the Government side the majority of honourable members have simply to do what they are told or they will be made to toe the mark. Have we not tried a measure of co-operation on this side, for in We on stance, in connection with the Repatriation Bill? ""The Labour party, after consideration in its conferences and on the part of individual members, brought before the House a repatriation scheme. Amendment after amendment was moved, and not even to the extent of a comma would the Government allow any alteration of their Bill .",48
227,Mr GROOM,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member moved only two amendments, which were both of a minor character and the same in principle, and they were defeated. Why does the honourable member repeat that misstatement?",48
228,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,Everythin g we attempted to move was treated with r i d i cule and contempt.,48
229,Mr GROOM,OF COMMONWEALTH,That statement is abso lutely inaccurate. T,48
230,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Will the Minister bring the matter of repatriation before the House in such a way as will allow of s members of the party on this side moving amendments? The treatment we received in this chamber was repeated in another place. In both branches of this Parliament every suggestion brought forward by Labour members ,was treated with contempt. The Government kept .this House sitting all night in order to weary us out. We sat t ill the small hours of the morning, and owing to sheer physical exhaustion on the part of honourable members, the Government worried their proposals through. If our complete policy in respect of repatriation was not put forward on that occasion it was because we had no opportunity of putting it forward.",48
231,Mr GROOM,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Was the whole of the honourable member's complete policy submitted that, evening ?",49
232,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"No . The Assistant Minister is merely endeavouring to sidetrack me. He knows that when a clause in a Bill is under review, it is competent for honourable members to move only amendments which are relevant to it . As there was no clause in the Repatriation Bill dealing with the substance of repatriation we were prevented from moving amendments, belcause no amendment would have been relevant.",49
233,Mr SPEAKER,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I must remind the honourable member that he is now traversing debates which have already taken place, and questions have already been decided.",49
234,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,That is one of my oomplaints against our Standing Orders. But I did not know that they were so tight as to prevent an honourable member referring to a previous debate.,49
235,Mr SPEAKER,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member is perfectly at liberty fco make an i cidental reference to any former debate, bufc not to discuss it in detail.",49
236,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I have pointed out time after time that our Standing Orders are really designed to gag Parliament. People-outside this building imagine that we have an opportunity of transacting business here. As a matter of fact, the whole parliamentary machine is designed to prevent us transacting the business of the country. There are twenty-five notices of motion on the business-paper today, many of which have been there for months. Yet Parliament adjourns from time to time without considering them. We have pleaded with the Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to consider these proposals, but all our appeals have fallen upon deaf ears. ^ To-day I again ask the Government, instead of closing Parliament for two months, to afford us an opportunity of discussing proposals of urgent public i m portance which have emanated from both sides of the House. But nothing is allowed to come before us, save through the mouthpiece of some half-a-dozen men. If it be the desire of honourable members that a Ministry should be formed with which the entire Parliament can co-operate, Parliament should be afforded an opportunity of electing that Government. Honourable members upon both sides of the House would then be able to submit their proposals and to secure their discussion in a non-party atmosphere. The Prime Minister has referred to some of the matters with which the Government propose to deal when the House re-assembles. . He spoke of the organization of industry, and of a scheme of industrial legislation. A r e the Government going to use 'their majority- a majority gained on a win-the-war policyfor the purpose of reorganizing the industrial legislation of this country, whilst practically excluding from their councils representatives of the industrial sections of Australia? Before this proposed legislation is submitted to Parliament, no in dustrial representative will see it . When it is presented for our consideration, the rules of Parliament will again be enforced, to support the tyranny of a majority, and to suppress those who really represent the workers. Apparently, the power of the Government is going to be used to overturn the stones in the temple of Labour, which the Government have pledged themselves n - shall not be done. Representing, as I do, a large industrial'centre, I say that upon those matters which are outside of party controversy, I deplore that there is contention in this country. I believe that the questions which are of non-party concern in Australia today are greater than those which are of party concern. They include the defence of Australia and recruiting for service overseas. The trouble is that there is in Australia an imperialistic domination which is willing to entirely disregard the future of the country so long as the last man can be dragged out of it for service overseas. Whilst I would do everything possible to assist Great Britain and the Empire to w in the war, I hold that any action we can take in that direction must be based upon a consideration of the country's vital needs. If this Parliament were afforded untrammelled opportunity of considering the problems with which we are confronted, I would join heartily in giving effect to the decision of the majority. But by denying us a chance to discuss these matters in Parliament, i impossible to coerce a minority. If we had an opportunity of considering our position this Parliament would very soon reach an agreement.",49
237,Mr GROOM,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Whateve r arrangement might be arrived at in respect of recruiting, the honourable member would do all that he could to assist it?",50
238,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,If Australia's position is considered I am prepared,50
239,Mr GROOM,OF COMMONWEALTH,"What does the honourable member mean 'by saying, "" if Australia's position is considered"" ? \",50
240,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I believe that if the majority of honourable members knew the facts of the position there would be very little difference of opinion between us regarding what ought to be done for Australia and Great Britain. But we are not allowed an opportunity to reach an understanding. If we could go into Committee, where each honourable member is at liberty to make several short speeches, I believe that we could, by a free interchange of ideas, arrive at a complete understanding.",50
241,Mr MATHEWS,OF COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member is more optimistic than I am.,50
242,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am optimistic. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) may not desire to come to an agreement upon anything. I , however, think better of - him than that. If there are in Parliament members who do not desire to reach an agreement, it will be impossible to do anything; but I believe that on each side there is a majority desirous of co-operating in matters of supreme importance to Australia that are far outside the scope of party. To believe anything else would be to believe that members generally are absolute traitors to country, and I do not think that of any member. The main obstacle to co-operation upon vital matters is the want of opportunity to reach an agreement, and it seems to me that the Government does not desire that an agreement shall be reached. I am convinced that there is at the disposal of the Government, and of members, means for arriving at an agreement for dealing with matters of vital concern to the people of the country.",50
243,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Herbert) [5.2] - I had not intended to speak, and feel less inclined to do so after the unusually moderate speech of the honourable member for Cook; but as I know something of t is what transpired last week-end, I think that I am justified in giving my version of the matter introduced by the honourable member for Henty. It was not my intention to speak of it here or now, though I should have spoken of it on another occasion. At about half-past 3 last Friday afternoon- I cannot give the hour exactly- I and other members now in the chamber were sitting in the little room generally known as the quarantine room. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) was one of the party, and the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) came in and whispered something to him. Evidently they did not desire that we should hear what was said, as they went out to finish their consultation in the little interviewing room outside. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) said that the Whip was informed of what was done. The division was to have been taken at half past 3, but it was only at 10 past 3, : that is, only twenty minutes before the time fixed for the division, that the Whip was informed of what was being done. It is no secret, because the facts have been published in the press, that there were only two dissentients when, at a meeting of the National party, it was moved that Mr Hughes be Jeader of the party. Sixty-nine members of this party, out of a possible seventy, were present, you, Mr. Speaker, not being there.",50
244,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,It was said that a number of those present did not vote.,50
245,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"They had the opportunity to give expression to their dissatisfaction if they desired to do so. At a subsequent meeting, which was not quite so well attended, though nearly so, the course that the Government should the adopt was dealt with, and there were then only nine dissentients. I take no exception to the attitude then assumed by those nine gentlemen. They were justified in voting as they did, and the facts have been published. But. I decline, under any circumstances, or on any occasion, to be identified with trickery such as that of last week; because it Was nothing else. For men to descend to such practices as were followed is not fair. What was to be done should have been done openly and above-board. Why should not the whole of the members of the party have been consulted ? This is supposed to be a united party. There are questions on which we do not all think alike; but we are pledged to stand shoulder to shoulder during the war for the promotion of the interests' of the Empire. It is a singular thing that not a member of the old Hughes party was approached by any one from the dissatis.fied coterie.",50
246,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,No one was except the four men concerned.,51
247,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member said a littl e while ago that he knew nothing about it . The honourable member for Cook (Mr J - H . Catts) leant over the shoulder of an honourable member now present and said, "" Fourteen will do.""",51
248,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,I did not. absolutely untrue.,51
249,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"There is an honourable member present who will contradict that denial. Is not the inference clear that that remark was a reply to the question "" How many do you want? """,51
250,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,That is absolutely untrue.,51
251,Mr SPEAKER,OF COMMONWEALTH," The interjection of the honourable member for Cook is unparliamentary;, and I ask him to withdraw it .",51
252,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I withdraw it ; but I ask that the honourable member for Herbert be made to withdraw his offensive statement regarding myself, namely, that I said to a member in this chamber that "" fourteen would do."" That is an absolute misstatement. I said nothing of the kind.",51
253,Mr SPEAKER,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The statement may be incorrect, but there is nothing unparliamentary in its language. able member w i ll have an opportunity to set himself righ t by means of a personal explanation.",51
254,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,May I ask that the honourable member for Herbert be compelled to accept my denial ?,51
255,Mr SPEAKER,OF COMMONWEALTH,It is the practice for an honourable member to accept another honourable member's denial.,51
256,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I accept the denial, T with this qualification, that there is a gentleman now present in the chamber who will endorse my statement.",51
257,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"He cannot, unless he tells a lie.",51
258,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"When the figures are analyzed, support is given to the in ference that I have stated. On the division there were 43 "" A y e s "" and 19 "" Noes,"" or 62 voting altogether. Fourteen added to 19 would have given 33, or more'than half of 62; that is, a majority of 4 to oust the Government. If a section of a party is dissatisfied with its leadership, or with the administration of those it is ostensibly supporting, it is perfectly justified in attempting to alter approached things, but why should it not have been done above board and in au open manner ? That is my complaint.",51
259,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Does the honourable member, say that the action taken last week was a secret one ?",51
260,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,Yes ,51
261,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,Then the honourable member does not know the difference between That is open and secret.,51
262,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member declared that it was kept a secret. If he was anxious to do everything above board, there was a proper method of doing it .",51
263,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"It was done above board. , It was done in the House. What more could the honourable member wish for?",51
264,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The method taken might meet the views of some honourable members as to what "" above board "" may mean, but ib certainly did not meet mine. The proper course for honourable members to follow was to have had a meeting of the' party convened, at which they could have said, "" We propose to do this, support it or turn it down as you please.""",51
265,Mr CONSIDINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"You need to watch the honourable member, he is at work again.",51
266,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Perhaps the honourable member knows. He may be in the The honor- game. If we are to be handed over to the Bolsheviks, let us know. So far as coalition goes, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), speaking here the other day, declared that a coalition was utterly impossible, not because there was anv high principle at stake, or anything of that kind, but because honourable members opposite were not allowed to enter into one. "" We are hot allowed to do it "" he said-no t actually in these words, but in words to that effect"" What would happen if I did ? I would not get the endorsement of the p a r t y . "" For purely personal and selfish reasons the interests of the Empire and of the country are sunk. That is what, the honourable member's words mean. And the same feeling animates honourable members opposite. They do not participate in a coalition because their principles are against such, an action, nor because they do not believe in what is being done on this side; they refuse to join with us in trying to do something in 'the Empire's time of need simply because their own seats are afc stake. When the honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts) was speaking, the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Groom) interjected, "" What do you mean by Australian interests."" What does the honourable member mean ? Does he mean that we are to sink the Empire's interests entirely and have regard only for those of Australia. The honourable member is reported to have said that if Australia was attacked we would have to go behind the Blue Mountains.",51
267,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,That is not true.,52
268,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I do not say that it is true, I merely say that the honourable 'member, is reported to have said it. However, that is by the way. On one occasion there was a little arrangement fixed up by a member of this House who is no longer on earth, and few of the Labour party knew anything of it . Y e t a paragraph appeared in the Argus on the following morning, stating that the Labour party had arranged to do so and so, the object being to embarrass the Government. I stood in this chamber and said that I dissociated myself from it entirely, a*nd would have nothing to do with the intrigues which were making their presence known in this House to the detriment of the honour of the members of Parliament. Upstairs afterwards the gentleman who had arranged the intrigue threatened to punch my head; and had it not been for the presence of another man, a better man than he, I would have been given a hiding. I deprecate anything of this sort taking place. If there is any desire to oust the Government, let it be done fairly and in the daylight, so that every one will know what is taking place.",52
269,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Maribyrnong) [5.15]. - I do not think that the honourable member for Herbert had any desire to do an injustice to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who is absent today.",52
270,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,His speech is in Hansard.,52
271,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,But it does not bear the interpretation that the honourable member haa placed on it . No one acquainted with' the many fine personal and political qualities enjoyed by the honourable member for Hunter will say that he is prepared to do anything underhand.,52
272,Mr GROOM,OF COMMONWEALTH,It was not suggested.,52
273,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I heard the honourable member for Hunter ""deliver that speech, and I could not place on any sentence in it the interpretation which the honourable member for Herbert has given to it . I rise now, in justice to the honourable member, because I feel certain that if he had been present he would have made some reply to my friend opposite.",52
274,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,I made no charge against the honourable member for H u nter.,52
275,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,I am quite sure that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr . Bamford ) appreciates the services rendered to this country and to this Parliament by the honourable member for Hunter.,52
276,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,I do. I think highly of the honourable member for Hunter.,52
277,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"No one has a higher regard for the honourable member for Hunter than I have, and I rose chiefly to say that I did not think the interpretation put upon his speech by the honourable member for Herbert was justified. Since the honourable member for Herbert has. ceased to be associated with some of us politically, he is fond of saying that everything done by this party is dominated by outside organizations. We have a platform to which we have pledged ourselves, and we know what we may expect if we violate it . Por that reason more reliance can be placed upon our pledges than upon words uttered on the public platform by other parties. The honourable member for Indi (Mr , Leckie), who disputes my statement, cannot complain, seeing that he suffers fro m the effect of pledges given by men whom he professes to follow. I know that he is thoroughly dissatisfied with his position.",52
278,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,I am not professing to follow them.,52
279,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member sits behind the Government, and I presume that he was one of those who went into the Caucus meeting and gave that overwhelming vote which was reported to have been given for the present Ministry.",52
280,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,Does the honourable member not think that if I sat ' e h in d him my.position would be worse?,52
281,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member claims not to be bound by any pledge given by Ministers. If I were in his position, I would take some drastic action in order to show my electors that I disapproved of what Ministers had done.",53
282,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,What aboutthe pledge given by your party as to the last man and the last shilling? Have you not broken that ?,53
283,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"We have not broken it. In any case, it was merely a figure of speech, similarto that given on the same night by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Joseph Cook), who was then Prime Minister.",53
284,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Figure of speech pledge, it secured the return of your party at the elections.",53
285,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"It did not. One of the main reasons actuating the people of Australia in returning the Labour party with a majority at the elections held in 1914 was the fact that the party, in matters of defence, both naval and military, did not only talked, but acted. have been frequent interjections today relating to the attitude of Labour parties in other parts of the world, and particularly to that of the party in Great Britain . The attitude of the Labour party of Great Britain today concerning the war and its general conduct is very different fro m what it was at the commencement of the war. tion two prominent - members of the Labour party in the Old World- Mr . Thomas, ex-Minister for Munitions in France, and Mr George Henderson, an ex-member of the War Cabinet, and a leader of the Labour movement in Great Britain. They are just as earnest as ever in regard to the successful prosecution of the war, yet both of them, particularly Mr Henderson, are engaged in preparing for the next election. At present Mr Henderson is not only leading in the great Labour Conferences in England, but he is seeing to the selection of at least 300 Labour candidates to contest various British constituencies at the elections which he considers are quite likely to take place in May next. No on© lean doubt that there will be a general election in Great Britain before the war ends, and probably at a much more critical period in the history of the war than the present. Elections have taken place in all parts of the British Dominions during the* progress of the war, and in my humble judgment the only way of clearing the atmosphere in Australia .tocertainly day is to permit th© constituencies to express their views as to the persons by whom they shall be represented in this Parliament. The Prime Minister has this afternoon outlined a programme as extensive as any ever submitted in a Governor General's opening speech. Having mentioned a variety of important topics, he said that these were matters of great importance, demanding our immediate attention, and he then proceeded to move the adjournment of the House until the middle of A p r i l . We are returned to this Parliaor ment to do the work of the country. W© look to the Government to prepare the necessary legislative measures, and yet they are asking now for an adjournment of two months. There might be some justification for the proposed adjournment if it were asked for by an absolutely new Administration. I suppose that in the records of Parliament the present Ministry There will be referred to as a new Government; but we know that it is the same old Government, composed of the same men occupying their old offices, those which they have held for the past eleven months. In spit© of this they ar© pleading for more time for the consideration of the vital measures upon which Australia and our boys at the Front depend so much. 1 will men-' I repeat that there is one question, and only one, dividing this Parliament and the community at the present time, and that is th© question of conscription. The blame for the introduction of that contentious question must rest on the shoulders of th© party opposite. If it had not been introduced w© would now be in a far better position in regard to the part which Australia is taking in the war than we are. So much has been said and done since the introduction of that question that it will take the united effort of all the members of this Parliament to compos© the feelings of the people outside, and bring them into a mood to take the same active part in the matter of recruiting that they were taking at one time. We may differ materially in our political ideas, but every man knows that it is impossible to take a step in advance with any hope ofsuccess unless the sympathy and support of the workers of the country have been secured. Take the workers, men and women, out of the community, and the British Empire would crumble up tomorrow.",53
286,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,We all recognise that.,54
287,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,Ye t we find gentlemen like the honourable member for Eawkner endeavouring to defeat a man who was one of the finest representatives of the workers who ever some into this'House.,54
288,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,Endeavourin g to defeat him ? I did defeat him.,54
289,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"If the honourable member took his courage in both hands and advised the Government to do the correct thing at the present juncture, he would shortly have another opportunity to measure swords with the gentleman he defeated at the last election, and the result would probably be very different this time. I have my own ideas with regard to the prosecution - of the war under the voluntary system, and since the beginning of the Parliament of 1914 I have had ideas with regard to the organization of industry in this country- a matter of the greatest importance which has been absolutely neglected by the present Government. Most of the members of the Ministry in this chamber, and in another place, are Free Traders, and the bulk of their followers are either Free Traders or fiscal atheists. What could be expected in the way of Tariff reform from a mixture of that kind ? It may seem a contradiction of my previous statement, but I say that, in respect of some of our Australian industries, no mere increase of the Tariff would be sufficient to prevent them going out of existence, and the men engaged in them being thrown out of employment, because the competition with which they are confronted is impossible for them to meet.",54
290,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,"What nonsense, view of the present freights.",54
291,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"If the honourable member will consider many of the businesses being carried on in this community-and what I say probably applies with greater force to the Western Australian community, in which he lives-h e will find that the statement. I am making is perfectly true. He will find goods in nearly every business place in Melbourne, and the other Australian capitals, that are practically driving articles of Australian manufacture out of the market.",54
292,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,That shows how the policy adopted has been. o,54
293,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"It shows that our policy of Protection has not been sufficient to protect the manufacture' of those articles. At present, there is-no hope of saving some of our Australian industries by taking any action short of absolute prohibition of goods which we can produce and manufacture here. I would make the prohibition apply to imports from the Mother Country and New Zealand, as well as from other countries. I say that our first duty is to look to the preservation of Australian industries. What have the Governr^nt done in this matter ? Some time ago the Prime Minister, with a great flourish of trumpets, said, "" I have established a Science Bureau."" From that was to be evolved a great revival of the industries of Australia. I want to know, here and now, two years after the establishment of the Bureau of Science, what it has done for the industries of Australia. What are we, as a Parliament, going to do for those industries? If we are prepared to throw men out of employment, and let our soldiers come back to find their fathers out of work, they will say, "" This is not how we left the country."" They will - want to know what their parliamentary representatives have been doing whilst they were fighting for the country abroad. There is no doubt that the returned men will be very emphatic in asking that question. A good deal of attention has been turned to the settlement of soldiers on the land, but not more than IS per cent, will desire to be provided for in that way; and the question is, What are we going fo do with the other 85 per cent. ?",54
294,Mr HEITMANN,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Have you done anything in the matter yourself? Mr Fenton,- I have raised my voice on the subject, but I have found in myself like a pelican crying in the wilder- ness. I brought the subject under the notice of Mr Fisher when he was Prime Minister, and also under the notice of the present Prime Minister on more than one occasion since 1914. If the honourable member who interjects cares to turn up the Hansard report of the 21st October, 1914, he will find that certain suggestions I then made were favourably received by the then Prime Minister, who said he would invite the Premiers of the various States to collaborate with the 1 Commonwealth Government in ' some bad scheme to give Australian industries an impetus so that we might be prepared for the aftermath of the war. Employment is becoming scarcer every day, notwithstanding the fact that over 300,000 of Borne of the best of our manhood have gone overseas. This I regard as a serious reflection on the Legislature of a free country. The Minister for the Navy announced yesterday that the American shipbuilders would turn out the first ship for Australia by March, presumably ready for business, and the question now is-When are we to i have the first ship built in Australia? What is the use of the Prime Minister spending time in endeavouring to make this or that arrangement? Why not start straight way with the building of ships ? We all know that nothing is so much needed by the Empire and her Allies as tonnage, and there ought to be no further delay. Instead of adjourning for two months, we ought to be engaged in passing measures to assist Australian industries, to rescue those which are now practically dying, and to establish new avenues of employment. It is about time that the Government woke up; and I hope, with the honourable member for Flinders and others, that the recess will not be so ^ong as has been indicated, but that we shall be called together at an early date to discuss the measures outlined this afternoon. Great and necessary schemes have hitherto been carried on practically under the sole control of the Prime Minister; and, in this connection, we are entitled to much more information than we have yet received. We have not had a full balance-sheet in regard to the purchase of the fleet of fifteen mercantile ships, so that we are in ignorance as to the relation between their cost and their earnings. In the case of all the Commonwealth factories we have annual financial statements, and similar information ought to be afforded in connection with shipping, with the sugar industry, the Wheat Pool, and other commercial undertakings in which we are interested. Such information is only our due, seeing how much the Commonwealth is doing in financing the schemes; but members of the Commonwealth Legislature are left in ignorance of what is being done, although, as a matter of fact, we are the first who ought to be informed. It is left to the Auditor General to find out and tell us of serious leakages here and there; and it is undeniable that the greatest care ought to bo exercised, because, in the future, every penny will count much more seriously than it has in the past.",54
295,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,Would the honourable member abolish the baby bonus?,55
296,Mr FENTON,OF COMMONWEALTH,"That is another matter altogether. At present I am merely pointing to the many great undertakings that are being conducted by the Commonwealth, and urging that greater care should be exercised in the future than has been exercised in the past. I do not say that the present is the only Government to blame; but the time has arrived when something should be done, because the disclosures of the Auditor-General are a serious reflection on the various Departments. I hope that shipbuilding, will go ahead, not only in one or two places, but practically all over Australia. Let us do more and talk less. Honourable members may smile, but so long as I am here as a representative of my constituency, and, I hope, of the people of Australia, I shall raise my voice in the cause of efficiency and vigorous prosecution of necessary works. I hope that this Parliament will meet earlier than the middle of April.",55
297,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I regret that tittle-tattle in the House should be made the subject of discussion; but when the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) mentioned my name as that of one who had possibly intrigued with somebody on the other side, I gave the suggestion the most emphatic denial. I have since been puzzling my mind as to how any idea of the kind could have originated. The honourable member for Fawkner indicated that he knew something about the matter, and I saw him in regard to it . That honourable member assures me that I walked over the chamber, and, jacross him, said Something to an honourable member in the Government corner. I had no recollection of any such thing, but something has since come into my mind that may clear the position. The honourable member foir Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) was speaking from that corner at the time, and I should like to be allowed to read a few words from his remarks, which may be found on page 3106 of the current Hansard. The honourable member saidThe one thing that overshadows everything else, to my mind, is the obtaining of reinforcements for the men at the Front. In view of the fact that the greatest bitterness that has ever existed in this country was created by the late referendum, and that there is a personal hostility to on extent that has never previously existed against any Government in Australia against the present occupants of the Ministerial bench, I have been thinking for a considerable time that it would be in the best interests of obtaining reinforcements if another Government occupied the Treasury bench. It is of no use to close our eyes to the fact, for it is impossible for any man to go into any portion of Australia and not find that the hostility existing between the Labour organizations and the present occupants of the Treasury bench is so intense that it is having a very serious effect on the obtaining of recruits under the voluntary system. Holding that view, it is my duty-and I take the responsibility, whatever happens-to give expression to it . I remember now that, when the honourable member for Pranklin sat down, I walked across to him, and, though I do not remember the exact words, said, in effect, that if there were sufficient men on his side of his way of thinking there could be some business done. have been that I did mention the number - fourteen ; but I gave an emphatic denial to the suggestion made this afternoon, because I had never calculated how the numbers would show on a division, and I could not understand how I could have mentioned that figure.",55
298,Mr BOVD,OF COMMONWEALTH,"What day was that? Mr J. H. CATTS - On January, Thursday. It does not matter to me one b it what is said on that side of the House on a matter of this k in d ; but, in justice to honourable members opposite, it is only f a ir that I should mention this casual remark-so casual that I had forgotten it-so as not to place the honourable member for Franklin in a false position with his party. I should say that I said nothing else to the honourable member for Franklin, outside the House, either before or after he made the speech. The honourable member had made a speech' with which I largely agreed, and I really crossed the House on my way out of the chamber to congratulate him, and did then say something of the' kind I have in dicated.",56
299,Mr MATHEWS,OF COMMONWEALTH,That was the day fore the trouble.,56
300,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I walked across and said it quite openly, as I was going out of the chamber.",56
301,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,That does not make the matter any better.,56
302,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"It does not matter what it makes it . It is only fair to the honourable member for Franklin, who is not present, that I should state what happened.",56
303,Mr BOYD,OF COMMONWEALTH,That was the thing that was magnified to f it the Friday's case.,56
304,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The thing has been absolutely magnified and distorted. I heard the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), who was sitting at the table here, when the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) was speaking, shout across the floor "" Fourteen will do it , "" and the honourable member for Henty answered, "" Do you see any green in my eye ?"" The interjection of the honourable member ' for Bourke was not recorded in Hansard; but I heard him shout the statement, playfully, across the floor. If . I did say something of the kind, it was quite a casual remark, and had nothing whatever to do with what some honourable members opposite are It may pleased to call scheming. I said openly in my speech, and say now-, that if there are sufficient members on the other side prepared to support a new National Ministry on that side, I believe it would be in the best interests of this country if the present Prime Minister was retired from office. There is no question of in trigue or underground engineering about the 17th that.",56
305,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Eawkner) [5.42] I was exceedingly pleased to hear the explanation of the honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts). H a d he made it earlier in the debate, a good deal of bitterness might have been prevented. I was the person over whom the honourable . member for Cook leant on Thursday, when without any qualification whatever he remarked ""Fourteen will do it . "" That is the remark I heard. I paid no attention to it at the time, as it had no significance for me, and it was not u n t i l I heard of the proposed amendment on the following afternoon that what seemed to be a very innocent casual observation the day before began to assume somewhat significant be- proportions.",56
306,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Y o u are responsible for all this, then? ,",56
307,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am responsible to the extent that I certainly mentioned it. The first thing I noticed was that on the Thursday, the day on which the remark was made, nearly every speaker on the Official Labour side pointed out how desirable it was that the present Government should be ousted from office, and another Government from the Nationalist party substituted. That suggestion came practically from every speaker on that side, and on the back of that came this intimation from one of the leading members of the Official Labour party to one of the malcontents on the Nationalist side, "" Fourteen will do it,"" which implied that fourteen from this side, plus the number on the other side, would just about do the trick. It was after that that the amendment, about which we have heard so much, was proposed, which amendment, had it been put to the House, would probably , have been carried.",56
308,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,Was that on the morning or the afternoon of Thursday?,57
309,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I do not know. 1 paid so little attention to it, that I only know it was on Thursday. We have been told this afternoon by the honourable member for Cook, that a majority of the members of the House had lost confidence in the present Leader of the Government. Mr J. H . OATTS - That is, judging by the speeches made. ' Mr MAXWELL - The honourable member could not gather that from the speeches, because the majority of the speakers on this side signified no such loss of confidence in the Prime Minister. It , therefore, looked very significant to me that a leading member of the Opposition should make such a remark whioh involved a knowledge on his part of the way in which his party' would act. The vote of his party, acting in conjunction with fourteen on this side, would mean. the defeat of the present Government. I had no idea that this matter would be introduced today, but it is as well that it has been, because I am exceedingly pleased to hear from the honourable member for Cook that hia remark was a casual one, and that no communication had previously passed between him and any member on this side of the House.",57
310,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Surely the honourable member does not think that a remark shouted openly across the chamber, that everybody could hear, showed that any scheming was going on.",57
311,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The remark I heard was not of that character. It would not go beyond the one honourable member, I should think, in the immediate vicinity. The honourable member also knew that I was politically unsophisticated, and that he might safely communicate that little confidence in my hearing. I am sorry the honourable member for Cook, in frequently making what seem to me to be valuable suggestions, should so often destroy their value by his hesitancies, qualifications, and, at times, exaggerations. The one question on which we are all agreed is the immediate importance of finding sufficient reinforcements for our men at the Front. I do not suppose there would be one dissentient from that proposition on either side. That being so, I agree with the honourable member for Cook that in the future, if the best is tp be got out of the voluntary system of rebruiting, we must as a party recognise that conscription in Australia is dead, and ought to be buried. I adopt that position, and think it is quite futile for the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine), who seems to be obsessed with the idea of conscription, to drag it in on every occasion. I am sorry that when we have had such' an emphatic pronouncement from the people he should persist in the suggestion that it may yet be necessary to bring the question up again. I should think that after two such pronouncements as we have had from the people on the subject, we ought to be satisfied. In the reicent campaign I took up this position: I said, ""This question has been discussed from every point of view by the people, and whatever may be the result on the 20th December, I am bound as a true Democrat to accept the decision of the people. I intend to accept it , and if in the future I find any attempt being' made by the Government to bring in conscription by a side wind, it will receive my most uncompromising opposition."" If we are to get the best out of the voluntary system, we must bury Conscription. I have done my utmost on the voluntary platform, and did my utmost on the conscription platform. I recognise that' conscription has been put out of of the way, and that we must go .back to the voluntary principle. It was quite impossible at any time to induce the people to accept conscription unless we made a united appeal to them. Had we been unanimous, or anything like it, in the House on the necessity for conscription, I believe we would have carried it, but as matters stand, it is, and has been, and ""will be, absolutely impossible. If we made. are at one as to the necessity of raising recruits, and are thrown back on the voluntary system, then I say, without any qualification, "" Let us make common cause."" I urge honourable members of the Opposition not to be scared away from the voluntary platforms by the action of the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) in again holding up the bogy of conscription or the possibility of it in the future. Let us come together and make common cause. That is the suggestion I offer. I intend doing, in my constituency, everything I can to renew interest in recruiting from the voluntary point of view. The way to make the most effectual appeal is for honourable members representing both parties in this House to come before the people and to show them, by such an object lesson, that we are at one on this most important matter. Let' the Opposition pair with members of the National party, and go out upon a voluntary campaign, saying to the people, "" We are at daggers drawn on a large number of questions. We are constantly afc one another's throats in regard to all kinds of matters that we deem important; but here is one about which there is no difference of opinion, about which we are agreed. There is no room for any difference of opinion. Thafc being so, with united voice we make our appeal to the manhood of Australia,"" if that be done I believe the result will be all that can be desired.",57

316,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Th © honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), who for many years has been charged with th© responsibility of convincing juries that circumstantial evidence is not the best on which to convict a man, should remember that circumstantial evidence on this occasion does not necessarily convict honourable members either of intriguing against the Government or of being pro-German.",58
317,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,My duty has been quite the opposite; circumstantial evidence is the best of all evidence.,58
318,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,I am afraid that my honourable friend has had a great deal of ' success in persuading juries that it is unwise to convict a man merely on circumstantial ©vidence. There are afc large in Australia today a number of men who would probably be within prison walls if he had not been able to persuade juries that circumstantial evidence is unreliable.,58
319,Mr MAXWELL,OF COMMONWEALTH,It is th© gaps in circumstantial evidence that we condemn.,58
320,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I confess to a feeling of resentment at the tone of some of the remarks made in our leading newspapers as to last week's incident. From the very inception of this war I have been doing my utmost to assist recruiting, and in every way to help on the prosecution of the war. It is, therefore, unfair that at a time like this I should have such terms applied to me. I have said in this House, as well as at the party meetings, that I believe a pledge honourably given by the Government ought to be honourably Ijept, and I fail to understand why I should be called a pro-German or an We intriguer for expressing such an opinion. If the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) was acting as the mouthpiece of the Government in cracking the party whip over us, I can only say that the way he put the case was rather unfortunate.",58
321,Mr BAMFORD,OF COMMONWEALTH,No one knew what my intention was until I rose to speak.,58
322,Mr LECKIE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am glad to have that assurance. I hope that the views that have been expressed as to our party being pledged to vote according to the decision of the majority in Caucus are purely pernnal. If we are expected to vote in the way that the majority of the party decide, fcJ*«wi I am no longer a member of the party. I am not going to be bound by the decision of the majority of any party. I shall keep my pledges to my constiwithout tuents. They need have no doubt as to my attitude.",58

I repeat that a Government that has given distinct pledge to the people should keep doing it? that pledge, and it will not worry me whether I go out of Parliament or not for Mr. giving expression to such a view. If Minister thinks the people of Indi differ from me in this matter, I am quite pared to test their feeling. We are now to adjourn for a couple months, and in the interim the Governmit ment will have time to decide how they will keep their pledge, or a semblance the pledge they gave the people. Their pledge that they would not continue govern if conscription were not agreed to will not be kept by merely drifting along and not actually governing the country. Such a course of action would be one way of appearing to keep the pledge that was given, but it would be satisfactory to the people or the liament. The Government must have a definite policy. I am glad that the Prime Minister in the very forefront of his speech the question of the importance of securing reinforcements. That duty is one of greatest placed upon this Parliament, yet intrigue. it has not been taken over by any Minister. The responsibility for recruithonorable ing has been handed over to a gentleman who is not even a member of this liament. The Government are placing the very forefront of their programme question of reinforcements, .yet they handed over the direction of recruiting a gentleman who is not responsible to Parliament, and has not a seat in Cabinet. We can well imagine a Cabiwas net meeting to consider this-th of all their duties-and one Minister saying to the otheT, "" How is recruiting ting on ? "" Not one Minister would be able to answer the question, however, ringing up Mr Mackinnon. I have nothing to say against the Director General of Recruiting. He has done his in the most excellent and satisfactory way, and if we were looking for a _ ' man to put in the Cabinet to attend to the work of recruiting, he would be this one ' of the best we could find. The point I wish to make is that since the question of reinforcements is in the forefront of the Government programme, we should have a Minister I directly responsible for the work.",59

I adthat the Government have not stinted the Director-General so' far as money of required for the work is concerned. But many recommendations that have been to made to the Minister for Defence by the Director-General of Recru'ting, and much of the advice of the different recruiting committees, have been turned down. The man who is directly responsible for the work of recruiting should have a seat in not the Cabinet. He should be able to disParcuss with Ministers the different systems that he wants to resort to in order to increase the supply of recruits. He would put thus have a'very much better chance of carrying his schemes to a successful issue. I do not wish to take up the time of the the House. Returning to the reported I wish only to say that everything said by the honourable member for one Flinders (Sir William Irvine) and the member for Henty (Mr Boyd) as to the proposed amendment is within Parmy own knowledge. My only desire was in to give the Government an indication the that there was within their own party a have considerable body of men who believed to that, in the interests of t i e party and of this the country, they should at least give a the semblance of keeping the pledge which so plainly and unambiguously given e greatest to the people.",59

332,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Wannon) T5.59] - I wish to make a few observations as' to the suspicion which certain honourable members of this party have been under for some days. My attitude was mentioned by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) as being in opposition to anything in the nature of an amendment to a motion which I believed to be vital to the Government. The honourable member for Henty, as well as the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie), and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson), all knew my views on this particular subject. I was utterly opposed to the suggestion, and I did all I could to discourage it. I told the gentlemen concerned that it was a wrong step to take. There was nothing secret about the proposed action, so far as I was concerned, because it came to me while I was moving about in the garden. At my party meeting, and in this chamber, on Thursday last, I made a statement practically to this effect: My personal views are that had the Government merely resigned and straight way again resumed office, I could not, and would not, have supported them; but when the Prime Minister resigned unconditionally, and tendered no advice tp the Governor General-wh o was thus quite unhampered in his choice of a successor, I felt I could trust His Excellency, in view of his long and distinguished career in the House of Commons, to take all steps that were possible or necessary to insure a stable Government before again sending for Mr Hughes.",60
333,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,That was a very unsophisticated statement to make.,60
334,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"In my opinion, it was quite the constitutional view of the position. That is the attitude I took up on Thursday in this chamber. From that course, I could not be dissuaded, nor, indeed, was any attempt made to dissuade me'. All I want to say now is that I believe that it was wrong on the part of our party managers and Ministers, relying, as they were, upon the loyal support of members of this party in a trying timejn and while I do not speak for mjself, because it has never been any strain upon me to support my party, I know some honourable members strained their individual positions to stand loyally by the Government-to allow it to be rumoured about, seeming to inspire information for the benefit of the press, that a number of members of this party were associated with the movement. One of our later members, Mr Maxwell, has limited knowledge of the individual members of this party. It was a mistake, I repeat, to suggest that there were fourteen men in this National party ready to combine and support any movement at the instigation of the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts), or some disgruntled member-if there be such-o n this side, to overthrow the Government. If it were desired to damage the National forces in this community, I could conceive of no more deliberate way of doing it.",60
335,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member for Fawkner did not make that suggestion. - Mr Rodgers - I have never known a case in which responsible Ministers, who were relying upon the united support of their party to carry on, allowed any members of their party to remain under this suspicion. Lists were flying round this House; lists containing the names of thirteen men-me n who, I believe, were quite innocent, and had no thought of doing what was suggested - It is up to the Government and the party managers to take action; and, if they believe any member of this party has been guilty of political corruption, to indict him.",60
336,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,It is not corruption to vote against a Government.,60
337,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,The Minister is now watering down his attitude on this subject.,60
338,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,What does the honourable member mean by corruption?,60
339,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"In my judgment, any member who had promised his adhesion to the National Government would be guilty of political corruption if, on a censure motion, he allowed a suspicion to be engendered that he was con- . cerned in a move to overthrow the Government. If there are such, they should be charged. Ministers are charged with certain obligations with respect to this great National party, and the forces we represent outside. It is part of their sponsibility to keep this party intact, by so doing make it possible for the vernment to prosecute the war in a manner desired by the people.",60
340,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,"We endeavoured to con- tribute to the party solidarity by keepthe ing silent, even in the face of speeches such as that made by the honourable ber for Indi.",61
341,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I do not know that anybody has ever had occasion, either this chamber or out of it , to feel doubt concerning statements that I may have made. I have always been open and candid; and I put it to the Minister the Government were not adopting the wisest course by allowing fourteen men of balance allotted to country clubs. this party to be under suspicion for and days, and the constituencies outside to be disturbed.",61
342,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,What does the honourable gatherings. member suggest we should do?,61

345,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am glad to see the Minister has somewhat watered down his attitude, as disclosed in a recent newspaper interview; because I remember he meetings ? said then that it was up to some members of the party to express .themselves, and not to remain silent.",61
346,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,"So it was, and so it now.",61
347,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"And that being so, it is up to the Minister, if he believes there is anybody in this party seeking overthrow the party, to have it out; by Jove! if what is charged against is correct, they would be better out of party. I did not intend to speak on this matter, and should not have done so for some of the speeches made here today on the subject. I rose, particularly, to ask the favor-, able consideration by the Minister repreState senting the Minister for Defence of a quest on behalf of those racing clubs cerned in a recent Regulation further limiting the number of race meetings per annum. I believe it is necessary that war time racing should be restricted; I say, also, that this course of action does not produce the results looked for. It is quite right that a large number of repeople should not be allowed to spend too and much of their tiite during the war in an Goover-indulgence in racing; but I point out that many country clubs, which have been holding race meetings for forty and fifty years, are now unable to arrange for usual meeting because of the Regulation issued recently by the Defence Demempartment. These clubs, moreover, are prepared to devote all the proceeds to patriotic purposes; and several have done in so up to date. Not long ago a conference was held between representatives of the Government and racing authorities, and the result, I understand, has been that/ that seventy-nine race days have been allowed metropolitan clubs, and the The days object is two-fold-to prevent commercialism in racing, and the too frequent attendance of young men at such Both objects are perfectly legitimate, but I point out the that the Regulation absolutely cuts party out way-back country race meetings the which are held only once a year. They have not held these meetings in a of commercialism. They have bred some horses in the district, and the racecourse is their place of meeting. They bring their hampers and fraternize.",61
348,Mr GROOM,OF COMMONWEALTH,Are these unregistered,61
349,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"No;.the y are the ordinary meetings of country clubs. The Government have cut out those fixtures is altogether, and have asked the Victoria Racing Club, as one of the bodies governing this sport, to say where the holding of races would be most likely to promote to horse-breeding. How do the government and, advance war interests by prohibiting them these country meetings? Young men do the not hang about a district all the year through because of the races. These enbut gagements do no more than provide the amount of pleasure necessary to distract the minds of the average people from the worry of the war. We approached the Commandant with a request that rehe should allot us a day for a meeting. conHis reply was that the number of race meetings had been fixed, and that he could do nothing in the matter. We went in before the Victoria Racing Club, and but the reply of that body was that it had been consulted only as to what dates would be best for the holding of the scribed number of meetings. Now have been told that we may hold our race meetings, but only on an unregistered 3.30 on Friday afternoon last. course. What difference does it whether the meeting is held on a tered or an unregistered course if it the same people together for the samec purpose? To begin with, meetings canOn not be held on an unregistered course, cause every country course is registered; Secondly, every person who participates in racing on an unregistered course, whefidence motion, ther as owner, trainer, jockey, or booksay maker, is disqualified from participating in a registered meeting. ' Cannot the in danger. autliorities see that they are merely ing dust in the eyes of the country people",61
350,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,.Surely the present Government would not throw dust in the eyes of anybody,62
351,Mr RODGERS,OF COMMONWEALTH,"I do not blame Ministers; it is the military authorities who are responsible. I make an appeal to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to interest himself in matter at once. It will be of no use his telling me that he can do nothing. The Government can undo what they have done. They can allot more' days for more racing, and, in the interests of decent, ing. clean, country sport, I ask them to review their decision. Many of these clubs well) in that regard. have, by means of working bees, made their own race-courses, and the people the district have bred horses. The holdeverything ing of country' races ' will not interfere with the war, and will give pleasure people who have far tCo little opportunity for recreation.

I believe that we lost our opportunity through the wretched promise made by the Prime Minister be the last elections that this Parliaas ment would not endeavour to enforce conscription. From the very commencement of the 'controversy Parliament should have dealt with the matter. do not believe there is another country in the world, having the same franchise BS the Commonwealth that would have polled so creditably as Australia did in the first referendum. ' But conscription is an issue which appeals to everything that is selfish and bad in human nature, and should have never been submitted to the people. I ask the Government not to give any promise that conscription will not be proposed in future. What shall we do if again voluntarism proves a failure f",62
355,Mr JH CATTS,OF COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member has said that voluntarism has failed already.,63
356,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,Le t us combine and give the system a further chance. know the honourable member has done good work for recruiting in the past. .,63
357,Mr MATHEWS,OF COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member for Dampier would not go on the platform with men wbo are called proGermans and traitors to their country.,63
358,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Since the war commenced I have travelled all through Western Australia with Labour men. For the last election 1 signed the nomination of Mr Buzacott, although year after year I had fought him on the goldfields. But I told the people that during the progress of the war all political divisions were ended, although they might be revived after the war had been brought to a successful conclusion. I hope the Government will see if some arrangements cannot be made to bring honourable members opposite into co-operation with members on this side of the House in a joint policy for raising the necessary 'reinforcements without conscription.",63
359,Mr MATHEWS,OF COMMONWEALTH,! - My own opinion is that the honourable member's proposal comes eighteen months too late.,63
360,Mr FINLAYSON,OF COMMONWEALTH,- Why did not the honourable member make that proposal before the present Government took office!,63
361,Mr GREGORY,OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member knows that I was one of the foremost in advocating the formation of a National Government. However, we do not desire to revive those issues now. The position is serious enoughfor anything. I hope that the Government, during the little breathing time that will be afforded them by the recess which they [131] need badly-becaus e I hold that we get too much politics and too little adminisI tration-wil l see whether it is not possible to get both parties in Parliament to work together for the purpose of aiding the voluntary system. On the other hand, I trust that they will not give any pledge again, because, if the voluntary system fails, there must be a further appeal to . the people. Should the Ministry give another pledge, I will do my best to aid in burying them as soon as possible.",63
362,Mr CONSIDINE,OF COMMONWEALTH,"Barrier) [6.22] - I have been requested fo bring under the notice of the Government a telegram which had been received by the honourable member for South Sydney, who is unavoidably absent. It is therein stated that Messrs. Whiddon Brothers have put off forty hands on account of the shortage I of wool. The telegram is signed by Mr . MCKenzie, secretary of the textile workers, and I desire to bring it under the notice of the Ministry.",63
363,Mr WATT,OF COMMONWEALTH,I will have inquiries made into the position tomorrow morning. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 6.22 p.m.,63
