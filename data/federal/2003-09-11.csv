One of person who would never have thought of voting herself strongly with the other side of NA this House, died because of her alcohol addiction. he died from cancer related to his nicotine addiction. These are enormous problems in our community, focus of this committee's report has been on community but ignored that bigger picture. I for any form of drugs it is not referring to zero hol. I think that, to some extent, the committee that it has brought down. As I said, when I was involved in this committee discussion paper titled ‘Where to next?' I felt the community: we had linked to alcohol and from Indigenous communities-there was a wide 40th Parliament seems to have changed direction. know how the members of that committee missed committee. I would like to now turn to the issue of been brought down by this committee. I do not from harm minimisation. I do not see prevention see that prevention is being just tough on drugs; that. When you are looking at prevention you tually think that the problems that we have very strongly to the type of society we live in. think we are failing there. There are so many these days. If a person is finding it difficult some type of problem, quite often it is turned embracing them and trying to help them through problems that they have.

And then you see a report like My father had his voice box removed and and I really think that to a large extent the illicit drugs and the impact that they have in the suspect that with its statements of zero tolerance tolerance of tobacco or zero tolerance for alcohas really missed the point in the final report in the 39th Parliament we put together a that we were then linking to the real issues in cigarettes, and we had also spoken with people range of people. But the committee in the I do not know what happened. I do not the all-important things that we saw in that illicit drugs and the recommendations that have see how you can actually separate prevention as having police on every corner, I do not I see prevention as being a lot different from have got to look at our society as a whole.

Rather than us as community the problem, we are blaming them for the of drug abuse-the dislocation, the unemployment, do not think anything will change. I is also the fact that feeding people's addicis very profitable-be it for the tobacco company, of the alcohol or the Mr Bigs out there on the are making enormous profits out of the hurt and of addiction or another.

We found in this report place for naltrexone, as there is a place for House and those sorts of groups that do such out of their lives. Here I am talking about the debate over heroin, and, I suspect, why the member for Fowler was saying the other day, there are so many other cause it does not fit with your particular piece This parliament deserves better from the people good, hard work.

I know that not all members of the ALP idea of manufacturing a secret agenda by the of dogma that will undermine their particular is nothing. That is just peripheral stuff. Focus is the main game. Let us just focus For example, take the tobacco issue. I personally ommendation that said we would look at the price way of getting people to stop smoking-to take increase you can introduce that results in people to be held to account. When I say the drug industry drugs-for example, the people, whether adminelse, who think: ‘I have a little bit of dogma continue. This is about me and my living, not them.' Of course they will tell us, ‘We are or my naltrexone-is so good that everything that what is required is a mix.

The members of this committee could see report hit the deck, we have had this absolutely the good work in here. I think that everybody be looking for problems in this. I do not think right-and there may be things that you can is good stuff. Those people who are affected by are people who care, and they need to know some response from this government and from focus on this issue and to make sure that what we What I have seen from over there is a lot of have that kind of confection in their minds. The Howard government to come up with some sort piece of dogma-what a pile of nonsense! That on the main game.

I suspect there are a hell NA of a lot of Treasury officials-not just in this Australia who spend their time trying to figure tobacco so people will not stop smoking, because come. What I am talking about is: what is tobacco, anyway-that will actually turn To go back to the main game that I am talking real angst in this debate, there has been good question of prisons. This is a limbo land at everything that is going on, but there is a real location within which an illicit drug culture opened up a debate here. I am not one who argues be absolutely sacrosanct; I am one who says overwhelmingly, we are correct. What we are focus on so the government can say, ‘Hey, look the state people who administer the prisons can at themselves and the way they are managing these prisons. In the report we have got some pretty basic, that personnel working in prisons should tests. That is one good way of ensuring that working in the prisons that is antidrugs and that tion of this particular area is entirely honest looking at what is best practice in the nation of people who are subjected to drugs and making their release do not result in them immediately come out of that. The real core of this is in recommendation units within prisons, having voluntary admission of the people who are in those units and using volved in those units. There is also the idea immediately the drug status of every single really got me is that we have always had this not put the newcomers in with the hardened drug culture that relates to that. I do not perimented with drugs in with people who have their approach to drugs and committed to a life learn to give people support in ending their situation rather than put them in an environment itself. People unfortunately do not recognise the to this problem over time. People return again think the authorities have tended to overlook in relation to drugs. They have just said, ‘We've do not have to care for them necessarily when be properly administered.' There have been some government but in state governments-all over out just how much you can raise the price of that is what gives you the best revenue out the increase in excise or whatever-the price of people off? That is a worthwhile thing. about here, which I think is the source of the work done by the committee in looking at the the moment. In prisons there is some thought in lack of effective focusing on the prisons as a is driven on and on in perpetuity. I think we have that everything in this entire report should that we have perhaps made some mistakes but, really doing is starting a debate that people can what they've said about all these prisons,' and look at that and start taking a good, hard look straightforward proposals. There is the idea be subject to mandatory random blood and urine we have got an environment among the people is focused on making sure that the administraand correct.

The thing that idea that when you establish a prison you should criminals. There is also, I think, an element of think you should put people who have perhaps exbeen hard drug users and who are seasoned in with drugs. I think it is important that prisons use of drugs and in focusing on advancing their where the use of drugs could turn back in on fact that the prisons themselves are contributing and again, and it reinforces the behaviour. I and not focus on the needs of people in prisons got them locked up-that is the sentence.
