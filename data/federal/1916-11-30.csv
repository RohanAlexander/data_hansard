1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"-During yesterday's sitting the chamber 'became uncomfortably crowded, and inconvenience was thus caused to the reporters in the - gallery set - apart for the Inter-State press, and to - others having business in other parts of >the House. I have, therefore, issued the instruction that the messengers shall in .future, ""when all the available sitting accommodation has been filled, prevent any 'One from blocking the gangways, and' I 'trust that honourable members will assist ""in seeing that this instruction is obeyed. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS. PAIBS - INTEBJEOTIONS . U r . FLEMING (Robertson) [2.32] In today's newspaper there appears the statement-mad e on I do not know what authority-that I have paired with the .honourable member for Adelaide. I wish, ""therefore, to say that I have given no one - authority to pair me with any other honourable member. My pair will rest absolutely at the disposal of the Whi p of the party to which I belong.",4
2,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Fremantle) [2.33]. - I am sorry that the honourable member for Robertson has misunderstood the paragraph to which he refers. A f t e r the division yesterday, the honourable member for Maranoa asked me for a pair for the honourable member for Adelaide, and I declined at the moment to give him one. What I had in mind was the fact that ihere are already four members absent on active service, and that the honourable member for Robertson will soon be ret u r n in g to camp, and I thought that it - would be an easy matter to adjust a pair between the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Robertson. I wish to add that the pressmen are not responsible for having placed - the honourable member for Robertson in a false position. I am surprised that the honourable member for Maranoa did not --attempt to arrange pairs for the honourable members for Ballarat and Geelong.  day's newspaper, below the report of certain proceedings in which I figured yesterday, appears an interview with the Ministeria l Whip, which readsMr Burclioll, tlio Ministerial Whip, stated - subsequently that the Opposition had offered Mr Fleming as a pair for Mr Yates, who was the only enlisted member of the Caucus .party What party that is I do not knowiin Australia absent from the sitting. I asked the Ministerial Whi p for a .pair for the honourable member for Adelaide, who is absent serving with the Australian Imperial Force, but I had no communication about pairs with either the honourable member for Cowper or the honourable member for Richmond, the Liberal Whips, nor was the name of the honourable member for Robertson mentioned to me, directly or indirectly, by a member of the i Liberal party. It was to the Ministerial Whi p that I naturally went for a pair for a member of our party who is absent in camp. He told me that he could not give any pairs, and I asked, "" What are we 0 going to do ?"" "" Well,"" he said, "" that is my instruction."" I then went to the Prime Minister, who said, "" Oh, well, there it is."" And there it is. The statement that the honourable member for Robertson was offered to me as a pair is not true. While on my feet, I wish to make a personal explanation regarding another matter, namely, an interjection which I made yesterday, and which, having heard the explanations that have been given concerning the incident, I regret. I did not mean my remark to apply to the right honourable member for Parramatta personally; I meant it to apply to all who were objecting at the time.",5
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [2.36] What I said to the honourable member for Maranoa when he came to me with the story about pairs was, "" What has it to do with me?'* The arranging of pairs is not my business; it is the business of the party Whips. MEMBER ' S SEAT.",5
4,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Henty) [2.37] - In view of your ruling yesterday, Mr Speaker, I wish to know whether I am not entitled to the seat that I have occupied throughout the session, of which the honourable member for East Sydney is now in possession ?",5
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Henty is entitled to the seat that he has occupied throughout the session. TASMANIANMAIL SERVICE.,5
6,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,H as the Minister for the Navy made any further reduction in the mail service between Tasmania and the mainland?,5
7,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"A further curtailment of the service has taken place. Yesterday morning a deputation from the Union Steam-ship Company waited on me, and pointed out that the Loongana consumes 190 tons of coal per trip , and the coal supply being limited, it was decided that the steamer shall make only one t r ip to last? Tasmania a week while the strike conmust tinues. Circumstances have compelled to take this course. I know that it is a very serious inconvenience to Tasmania to have only one mail to the mainland a week, but I am not responsible for the ister. present position. SALE OF WOO LCLIP .",6
8,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In regard to the arrangements for the acquisition by the Imperial authorities of the Australian wool, clip, is the Prime Minister in tion to announce the price and the armonth ? rangements for transportation-whethe r they f all upon Australia or upon ""Great B r it a in ; also whether provision has made for retaining sufficient raw material to carry on the industries of Australia ?",6

Eight of those men were on their way to the Comto monwealth prior to the issue of the order by the Prime Minister restricting the i m portation of labour, and on their arrival in Sydney a few days ago they were held up, but on representations being made to the Department by the employers, and withalso by the Glass-blowers Union in Melof the bourne, these eight men, who were t carunionists, were permitted to land, and I understand they are now at work.

20,Mr HIGGS,COPIES OP FINANCIAL,"I ask thÂ© Treasurer whether it is a fact that he has supplied to the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Swan advance copies of his financial statement, and whether he does not think that it would have been a gracious act on his part if he had supplied a copy to me, seeing that I have been a Treasurer of more recent date than the right honourable member for Swan ?  a copy of the financial statement to the right honourable member for Swan. have followed the usual practice and supplied copies to certain honourable members, but I have given no copy to the right honourable member for Swan. All these copies were supplied under a bond that they would be treated as confidential.",7

32,Mr HUGHES,COPIES OP FINANCIAL,"I do not know what can be done under the law, but I think there is imposed upon every employer the duty of reinstating his employee in, at least, the position that he occupied when he was called up. That is a duty which is cast upon every employer, and which the Government will endeavour, as far as lies in their power, to compel him to perform. CRUISER ADELAIDE.",7

COMMONWEALTHSTEAM - SHIP S. frauds",8
38,Mr FENTON,ADMINISTRATOR OF TH E,"I ask the Prime M in ister whether it is a fact that the steamships which he recently purchased in arrange, . Great Brita in are being used to bring cargo from various parts of the world in stead of coming to Australia to carry produce to British and other ports?",8
39,Mr HUGHES,ADMINISTRATOR OF TH E,"The vessels which have been purchased by the Commonmade. wealth are being used for the benefit of the producers of Australia. It does not pay to bring vessels here in ballast, and these steamers are being used exactly as the vessels of private ship-owners used. The vessels, up to the present, have been used exclusively in taking wheat from Australia to Great Britain aud France. That is the answer to the honourable member's question. The vessuch sels are not diverted from any other purtion being caused pose than that which is necessary in the ties? circumstances. Sometimes they do come - on e or two, I think, have comethrough the Panama Canal because we the had a loading from Great Britain to the east coast of America. Usually, ever, the vessels come around Some have had to come around in ballast, and that is not a profitable proceed^ing-on e which no ship-owner follows lows : if he can help it . There is no reason why the fleet of the Commonwealth sliould be denied the same opportunities for proment persons fitable trading that are open to private individuals-non e whatever MATHEWS - Is it a fact that the British Government commandeered as some of the vessels that have been p u r chased for the Australian trade?",8

Has it been brought under the notice of"" the Minister that a number of names were left off the Commonwealth electoral rolls during the taking of the late referendum? 2. Is the Minister aware that a number of' persons were disfranchised owing to the confusion by the duplication of collecmade by Federal and State authori3. Does the Minister not consider that, with a view to the reducing of expenditure, and to securing of a more complete roll, there should be only one form of registration forelectors within the Commonwealth; and, if so, howwill the Minister take the necessary steps to the Cape. perfect such system? Mr BAMFORD:-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as folWhilst the . rolls were more complete than on any former occasion, it is probable that some did not lodge claims for enrolprior to the close of the rolls for the referendum, owing to misunderstanding as between the Commonwealth and State rolls. It is unquestionably desirable that there should be one roll for both Coni:noir.ve:;l:li r.rd State(purposes. The Commonwealth and State Electoral authorities have recommended joint action on the mainland on the lines which have been successfully followed in Tasmania for some years. I shall do everything in my power to give effect to the recommendation. RECRUITING: CINEMATOGRAPH",8

The New South Wales Government placed at our disposal coal at Lithgow, and the Coal Miners Federation instructed their men at Lithgow that the coal was to be handled. Some of the trolley-men employed at the Small Arms Factory refused to handle the coal, and I at once instructed the manager that any employee who, in the ordinary course of his duty, was called upon to handle coal and refused to do so, was to be discharged.

That the foregoing resolutions be communicated to His Excellency the Governor General.",10
52,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.7] I intend to detain the House but a few minutes in speaking to the amendment 1916-17. moved by the honourable member for Yarra. The amendment, which sets out, with much circumstance, what purports to be a copy of some regulation to which (Nos. many references have been made, is be reobviously only a. pretext to hide the real purpose of the honourable gentleman who moved it , and of those who are supporting him. The position, shortly, is that (the I have committed the unforgivable sin. the I have not been amenable to those methods, which have been successful in their case, and those who coerced them preto speak and act as directed wish to be of revenged on rae who refused to bow the The amendment condemns me for having issued a certain reB u t those who support it conExecudemn me because they have been in Regulation or no rethe Hon. gulation, they would still have conTo pretend, as they do, J. A. that they would have objected to a rethe gulation such as they allege I issued If I had done as persisted those responsible for this amendment to tack have done, and swallowed my convictions, all would have been well. But I did not, and will not, do so. They wish, by attachme under this pretext, to destroy me, because I have ventured to defy them and in do that which I think to be right in the interests of the country. That is the the 27th of October, position. I am going to deal very shortly, in As I been have said, it purports to be a copy of a The amendment, I presume, may be taken as representing the the collective efforts of the party, and it sets give out, with a wealth of detail, the reasons why I do not deserve the confidence of this House. In the course of his amendment, which thus refers to me, the honourable member says4. That the Prime Minister then issued the said regulations, and ordered the Chief Electoral Officer (Mr Oldham) to give effect to them. 5. That the jegulations were withdrawn only after Senator Gardiner, Mr Higgs, and Senator Bussell resigned from the Ministry. 6. That though the Prime Minister issued the discreditable regulations above referred to on the morning of Friday, the 27th of October, he attempted to and did deceive a large section of the public of Australia by stating in the newspaper press on Saturday, the 28th of October, that "" no such regulations had been issued."" To all this I have but one answer to make. What I said in the press of the 28th October is true-n o such regulation was issued. No regulation of any sort or kind that bears any resemblance to that to which the honourable member referred was issued. I confine myself to that point. No regulation was issued. propose to follow the honourable member's example by referring to what took place at Executive Council meetings. It would be obviously an improper thing to do. In my humble opinion, the references made yesterday, to Executive proceedings ought not to have been permitted.",10
53,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The . right honourable gentleman must not make that statement. If I did anything wrong in allowing the honourable member for Yarra to make those references, the obvious duty of the Prime Minister was to prevent my error. It is not for me to decide what honourable members shall do.",11
54,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If you, sir, regard my remark as a reflection ou the Chair, I withdraw it .",11
55,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I certainly do.,11
56,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then I withdraw it . Nevertheless, I say that it is obviously most unwise and most incompatible with responsible government, which is divided into legislative, executive, and administrative divisions, that proceedings at Executive Councils should be discussed in the House. It is obvious that the references made to such proceedings by the honourable member for Yarra could only have been founded upon disclosures by an Executive Councillor, and I take it that such disclosures are most improper. As I shall certainly not follow his example, I can only repeat what I have already stated, that it is not true that any such regulation was issued. I shall not say one word as to the references he made as to what took place at Executive Council meetings, but it certainly is not true that the resignations to which the honourable member for . Yarra referred affected this matter in any way; either good, bad, or indifferent. Those who know me will realise very well that if I had determined to issue such regulations, the only effect which the resignations of Ministers could have had upon me would have been to spur me to proceed with my intention, rather than to yield. If I had thought it right to issue those regulations, I would have issued them if every other member of the Cabinet had resigned. I say, therefore, that the statement that the regulations were withdrawn after having been issued, because of the resignations of Ministers, is inaccurate. I shall not discuss what took place at Executive Council meetings. I shall not say whether the I do not honourable member's references to an alleged Executive Council meeting in Melbourne or in Sydney are true or not true. I merely remind the House that a regulation, to have the force of law, must pass through certain phases. The gravamen of the charge made by the honourable member for Yarra is that I issued certain regulations and then withdrew them. I did. not issue the regulations, therefore I could not withdraw them. I leave the position at that. I am perfectly satisfied that the people of this country know quite well that underlying this motion of want of confidence, as it has been termed by the mover, is the determination of his supporters, by any means at all, to get my head upon a charger. The means by which they may do that are as nothing; the end is everything. When the end comes, we shall see whose head is on the charger. Meanwhile, I ' shall try to do my duty to the country in this grave crisis to the very best of my ability.",11
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Parramatta) [3.15] - I am glad to be permitted to intervene in this very interesting little interlude, and, like both of the previous speakers, I intend to be commend ably brief. In the first place, I should like to offer my congratulations to the members of the new Government, more particularly the members new to office. I am bound to say that I feel a peculiar satisfaction in seeing two of the oldest members of the House, two of the staunchest and best amongst the members of their party, in office at the present fcirne. I refer to the honourable member for Grey and the honourable member for Herbert. If I single them out for special congratulation, it is because they are older members of this House than the other Ministers. I congratulate also the new Leader of the party whose name I have not yet learned. I think "" The Australian Labour Party "" was the designation which the honourable member for Yarra applied to the party yesterday. He has my very hearty congratulations upon his election to such a responsible position, and I can only wish for him good health and good luck in the discharge of his very onerous responsibilities, although, under the peculiar system by which he works, his duties are not so responsible as perhaps they would be if he were associated with some other party. honourable member for Yarra has proved himself always a hard working and loyal member of his party, and I think he 'has won the distinction which has been conferred upon him. In regard to the circumstances in which we meet, one regrets that at beginning a time like this the political baroness meter should appear to be set so stormy. The indications are that the wind is blow in from the west and from many of number. other quarters, too. I say in all seriousness that it is much to be regretted we should find ourselves amid all this party heat and passion at the present time. is reminded, indeed, of the mutability cf all things earthly, and human, too. The Prime Minister, who yesterday tlieir trusted leader, and was, in quarters, regarded almost as a demi-god, is now, to apply some lines of Tom Hood. . . Scorned, abused, estranged, He opes the eye of evil ken; And all his angel friends are changed To demons; and are hated then. In my judgment, the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra bears on its face the stamp of insincerity. surprised that such supersensitiveness regard to electoral purity sliould be shown friend is quite right. by those who are supporting the amendfor ment. Are they not the gentlemen a year or two ago, approved the actions of a Minister in discharging forty-three offiw cials three days before an election, the ground of partisanship, and insisting on the employment in electoral work of a his colleagues. Mr Joseph Cook.' gentleman whom he admitted had taken part in a Labour pre-selection? Are they the gentlemen who now ask us to join them in flinging to the. cold winds a Minister who has made a mistake?  he has not done what is alleged.",11
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not dealing with the statement of the P r i me M in ister, but with the allegations in the motion. By the way, it speaks "" of discreditable regulations.""

It was not the on matters mentioned in the. amendment which ledh i m to sever his connection with 1 What was the reason? Every one knows that lie differed fro m them on the grave question of military conscription, of which there is no mention in the motion. I understand that those who follow him wish to express their disapproval of the policy of the Government in relation to the greatest of all questions now in the public arena, and yet they have deliberately selected mere incidents of the campaign, and erected them into matters of supreme import, leaving out of account the real thing which divides them. This stamps the amendment with insincerity. It shows that those responsible for it have a purely political end to serve, and are not concerned with the great questions affecting the existence of the Empire. Is it not to be deprecated that, while the world is in flames, while our camps are empty of reinforcements, while the war is still at its crucial stage, and the end not nearly in sight-the outlook being, indeed, as grave as it has been at any time during these lwo years-the only contribution of the Australian Labour Party to the great world struggle that is proceeding is the amendment now before the House. I submit that when the amendment is looked at in this light it is plain that my honourable friends have moved it purely for political and party ends, and without regard to the supreme issues which are dominant throughout the world today. If I were the leader of their party I should not like my in it i a l effort to - be associated with so sordid and sinister and humiliating an objectRegarding the subject-matter of this motion, I wish to say that in voting against it , as we intend to do, we in no way identify ourselves with what was done. Members on this side regret the action of the late Government-the "" l at e Government""-as strongly as the mover himself. The regulation, however, was, we understand, withdrawnwas in fact never issued, and but little actual harm resulted. While, therefore, we deprecate it, we do not consider that any good purpose would be served by voting for the amendment. Other and far greater things claim our paramount and immediate attention. Our attitude can be briefly stated. has, indeed, been already stated in words at the conclusion of a speech made by me some two years ago, when Mr . Fisher was Prime Minister I wish 'to say to this Government that we shall he behind them most cordially with our' best support-and not too critical support either-in prosecuting this war right to the end, and in financing it to the full in every legitimate and reasonable way. We are prepared to treat this Government in the same generous manner as we treated its predecessor. In this respect there has been no change. The attitude of the Opposition is still a firm determination to subordinate all other considerations to the winning of the war. I claim with every confidence that we have so acted in the past. We are equally and similarly determined as to the future. We are not so greatly concerned as to the domestic disturbance which has disrupted the once dominant majority in this chamber, nor as to the personnel of the Ministry, except so far as those matters may have an influence or bearing upon the great and paramount objective - the national safety. There is today, more than ever, an imperative call to the highest patriotism, and we believe we can best respond to that call by concerning ourselves more with the things that are done than with the men who do them. For two years we have adhered to this policy. We shall continue to do so, asking only that, within the limits imposed by the recent referendum, the war shall be prosecuted with the utmost energy and determination. We accept the statement of the Prime Minister in this connection. I further wish to say that, while assisting the Government in these matters, we shall' retain our sfparate political identity, reserving to ourselves the right, in the public interest, to criticise to the fullest extent and decide upon its merits each measure submitted to this House. That, briefly, is our attitude. I hope that the debate may soon be brought to an end, so that we may address ourselves to the serious business of the country.",12

The Leader of the Liberal party has drawn attention to what he considers a waste of time in discussing this motion, because the position at the front, he says, has not been improved; but no matter what he may say in that connection, he will not be able to explain away to the country the fact that, in voting against the amendment, he is supporting the Prime Minister. His speech was not the speech of a Leader of the Opposition; surely it was a speech very much stronger in support of the Prime Minister than that which the Prime Minister himself delivered. have heard the Prime Minister speaking in this House on many occasions, but I have never heard him deliver a worse speech than he made this afternoon. need hardly say that it is a matter of very great regret to me that this great Australian Labour party, that has to its credit legislation that has been of very great usefulness to the people of Australia, and has placed the masses of Australia in a better position than the masses of any other part of the world, has been smashed for a time by the Prime Minister. I say for a time."" It may be for six weeks, it may be for longer. But to revert to the leaders of the Liberal party, there was great consternation yesterday when the amendment was submitted. We saw the honourable member for Parkes with his copy of May's Parliamentary Procedure, and the honourable member for Plinders also conning the pages of that great book, possibly with a view to trying to discover some method of preventing the amendment being discussed by the House.",14

71,Mr HIGGS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not support the proposition that the members of a Cabinet should follow the example of thieves, when they keep that honour which is said to distinguish them. We were loyal to the Prime Minister until the Prime Minister was disloyal to us. The Prime Minister also joined with the honourable member I for Flinders, though he was not able to work up so much indignation about the matter. He said that he would not discuss the question of a member of the I Executive - Council disclosing what took place at a meeting of that body. I am sorry that the Prime Minister has left the chamber, because, according to a paragraph in the Melbourne Herald of 21st October, the Prime Minister, in referring to a statement in the press concerning the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, one of his colleagues, saidOn that point I am unable to express any opinion, bnt if by that Mr MCCarthy would have the people of Western Australia and the Commonwealth to understand that Mr Mahon is an anti-conscriptionist I can only say that if he is his conversion is of very recent date. He was certainly one of the whole-hearted supporters of conscription in the Ministry. He supported the policy of the Government with voice and vote in Cabinet. Do the Leader of the Liberal party and the honourable member for F l in ders approve of the action of the Prime Minister in preparing secret regulations for what we considered to be a manipulation of the referendum without consulting at least three of his colleagues, namely, Senator Gardiner, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Senator Russell, Assistant Minister, who had cliarge of electoral, administration, and myself? I submit, for the examination of honourable members, documents as they came to me. I have no hesitation in saying that they were handed to me by Mr Garran, the Solicitor-General, at an Executive Council meeting, apparently for the purpose of having my signature attached to them and having them put through the Executive Council forthwit h without any consideration whatever. Next day Mr Garran came to see me to urge that these regulations should be put through immediately, because Mr Oldham, Chief Electoral Officer, required time to get the necessary 9,000 telegrams sent out to the various polling officers. I made a note of the conversation as far as I could recollect it , and it was as followsMr Garran, in reply to my queries, this morning said that Mr Hughes had discussed the proposed War Precautions (Referendum) Regulations with him (Mr Garran) before he (Mr Hughes) went to Sydney, and that he (Mr Garran) had given him the final draft on the train when he left for Sydney; that Mr. Hughes told Mr Garran not to present them to the Executive until he heard from Mr. Hughes; that Mr Hughes telephoned him yesterday, at 3.45 o'clock p.m., to hand them to the Executive, which he did through me, the Treasurer, acting for the Minister of Defence. Mr Garran said that Mr Hughes had informed him that he was not to issue the regulations through the Government Gazette until he heard from Mr Hughes; but Mr Hughes would probably send him word today, as Mr. Oldham was desirous of getting on with the sending of the necessary 9,000 telegrams to his omcers throughout the Commonwealth. Dated 25th October, 1916. - There were three copies, and .each copy of the proposed regulations was stamped longer heard. "" Secret,"" apparently by Mr Garran or one of his officers.

On the Monday before reallow ferendum day, the Prime Minister made a speech at Albury, in which he stated that he was going to give certain electors the shock, or the surprise, of their lives when they approached the ballot-box. drew Senator Gardiner's attention to this statement. He said he had not seen"" the report of it . but that he would at once make inquiries. He asked officers in his Department whether the Defence Departform ment intended to do anything in conthe nexion with the referendum, and the reply that he received was that it was not intended to take any action, but that possibly action might be taken by some being asked. other Department. When these proposed regulations were handed to me, I was the booth ? anxious to ascertain whether it would be possible to get them out in time, and asked Mr Oldham what was the latest date on which he could issue them. He replied that he could get out the instructions if he received them on the Wednesday before referendum day, and that he had everything ready to send them out.

Senator Gardiner informsme that he has it from a scrutineer that there came under his notice several ballot papers marked ""Proclamation"" ""Proc."" The Leader of the Liberal party and his followers, as well as the .general public, I think, will agree that the proposed action of the Prime Minister savoured of vindictiveness. The Electoral Act and the Defence Act contain all the necessary provisions for punishing any - one who makes a breach of those laws. It is a most injudicial proceeding on the part of any member of Parliament to attempt to add to the punishment of any person who is presumed to have committed an offence before that person has actually been brought to book. Minister proposed to do that. The Defence Act makes every possible provision"" for dealing with those who fai l to enrol, and there can be no doubt that the Prime M i nister, in . his eagerness to secure for conscription a majority of affirmative votes, did things which, in his calmer moments, he will recognise he had no right to do. The very announcement that went abroad as to the proposed regulations had the effect of keeping many people from the booths, and if the questions had been asked many thousands of electors would not have voted. That, no doubt, was in the Prime Minister's mind. wanted to keep those people out of the booths. I submit that the proposed punishment-the punishment of depriving these people of their votes-wa s in the nature of tyranny. Many of those who had not enlisted held the opinion that the question was to be decided by the electors, and that if it were decided in the affirmative they would, of course, have to go into camp, but that if it were negatived their f ailure, to enrol would be justified.",16
94,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Will the honourable member allow me to see the papers which he has been referring?,17
95,Mr HIGGS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Certainly . I have thing more to say in regard to the tions of Senator Gardiner, Senator sell, and myself, except that the Prime Minister, in his capacity as chief censor, did wrong in trying to prevent Senator Gardiner, myself, and others from telegraphing any information as to our reclared, "" No such regulations signations. He attempted to prevent any information whatever concerning our signations going over the telegraph wires or appearing in the newspapers. I informed on the very best authority that or the chief censor received a message that Senator Gardiner had telephoned to the effect that he was sending several telegrams in reference to the resignations of Ministers and that they were to be allowed transmission without delay, on account of the question being a purely political one. The Prime Minister evidently is unable to distinguish between a political and a military necessity. For that reason I regard the fact that the Prime Minister has control of the censorship as being positively dangerous to this country. The right honourable gentleman cannot see any The Prime difference between a political necessity and a military one. He issued instructions that nothing was to appear concerning the resignation of Ministers. However, shortly after returning to his office at 7.15, a censor referred to the deputy chief censor several messages signed by Senator Gardiner, which he stated had just been lodged in reference to the resignation of Ministers. One of these messages was from Senator Gardiner to his wife, telling her that he had resigned; and that message was actually held up. Almost at the same time the deputy He chief censor was instructed by Mr . Garran, the Solicitor-General, not to allow transmission over the wires for publication any reference whatever to the fact that Ministers wore resigning. The deputy chief censor asked on whose authority that was done, and he was told it was on, the authority of Mr Hughes, but that they would know definitely later. Subsequently the Prime . Minister evidently decided that he would release the information, and, having done so, he himself made a statement regarding the resignations, that statement, appearing in to the Argus and other newspapers on the 28th October. In that statement to the press the Minister said that the Federal noMinisters pretended that they had reresignasigned because of the issue of cerRustain regulations that interfered with the election,, or might deter certain electors from coming to the booth. The right honourable gentleman dehave been issued,"" and went on to say that this reattempt to "" impose upon the credulity of the electors"" was on a par with the am "" Maltese and coloured labour dodges,"" and was no doubt "" the last card in the anti-conscription pack."" The Prime M in ister went on to sayPersonally I hail their resignations as a sure omen of victory. Mr Higgs, in a spirit of lugubrious prophecy, told a reporter the other day that if conscription were carried he would have to resign. He and his coadjutors have only anticipated the inevitable by a few hours, for the people now know the kind of men who stand behind the anti-conscription party, and understand perfectly the motives that animated them, and are resolved to vote them down and out. In reply to that, I said that the Prime Minister had endeavoured to deprive Senator Gardiner, Senator Russell, and myself of the credit of having resigned as a matter of principle, and that we would see on Monday whether the Prime Minister would resign as a matter of principle. Surely if the right honourable gentleman had any correct notions on this score, he would not endeavour to carry on the Government of this country with a following of thirteen men? He said today that we knew he would carry out his aim, if aim he had, no matter what his colleagues might do. I venture to say that we shall see the spectacle of the honourable gentleman, who has been such a determined opponent of the Leader of the Liberal party, politically eating out of that honourable gentleman's hand from now on u n t i l such time as the present Government are driven from the Treasury benches,",17
96,Mr LYNCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Werriwa) [4.10] - As an independent member of this House during the period of this Parliament, I wish to give some reasons why, notwithstanding the fact that I am as opposed as any man to any interference with the sacredness of the ballot-box, I am compelled to vote with the Government on this occasion. I shall not attempt to deal with the merits or demerits of the particular charge which has been laid. As an anti-conscriptionist, who stumped his electorate against conscription, I must say that I , and others who think with me, felt very keenly the action that was taken by a certain section. .Whether what is alleged be true or not is a matter of little moment to me; in fact, the action of honourable gentlemen opposite reminds me of the old Eastern legend, in which a man used his elephant to k ill a flea- a very effective method of killing the flea, but very destructive of the future use of the elephant. What I wish to show is that there was a much greater outragea much greater interference - with the ballot-box and with the rights of the representatives of the people, and the very gentlemen who are now dealing with this '' flea b it e ' ' knew of the existence of that interference, and in a measure were suffering from it , and yet made no sign or protest worthy of the name. The question of conscription was one on which every conscientious and honest person should have been permitted to vote according to his convictions; there was no room for more than a natural difference of opinion-nothin g to call for or cause that wholesale political excommunication which was attempted and carried out. I thank, the Prime M i nister, as the one man in Australia who is responsible for the rejection, unwittingly, of the referendum. It was he who insisted on the' principles of Democracy being applied to this great test question. Had the Prime Minister followed the advice of those people who attempted to tamper, not with the 1 or 2 per cent, who would have been affected by such a regulation as that referred to, but with the representatives of the people themselves-had the Prime Minister acceded to their demands, and not insisted on the democratic principle of the referendum, we should long ago have had conscription in full blast throughout Australia. Every man opposite who is supporting this vote of censure knows that what I am about to say is perfectly true. We in New South Wales, and, I understand, other representatives in Victoria and Queensland, received this mandatory notice from an outside body",18
97,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"An ""outside body!"" They put you in Parliament, anyhow !",18

102,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member must withdraw those words.,18
103,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I withdraw them.,18
104,Mr LYNCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"E a r l y in September, New South Wales Labour members were ordered, under pain of having their in dorsements cancelled, to resist the introduction of the conscription referendum at every stage, inside and out of Parliament. H ad the extremists had their way, before it was decided by a majority of only two that a referendum should be held, the chances are that we should have had to face this House without a war policy. Notwithstanding the chastening effects that the "" No "" ' vote has had on a number of honourable members, it must be admitted that the direct action, which quite a number of people on all sides honestly felt to be the solution of the difficulty, would have taken the form of conscription by proclamation. We all knew that some six or eight months would have been occupied in bludgeoning a conscription measure through Parliament.",18
105,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,And you would have been behind it I,19
106,Mr LYNCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I would not. 1I have a copy of my opening speech at Young, and I have never departed from the text which I there adopted. I then said that whatever the will of the people might be, if members differed from it , it was the duty df those members to resign their seats and allow the people to elect others. I have held from the beginning that conscription, outside the orbit of self-governing powers, is against moral law; and I hold that still. There were gentlemen who took the mandate, to which I have referred, "" s it t in g d o w n "" : but I have here the answer that I gave, and which represents the action which I am always prepared to take, even if it means my going out of Parliament for ever.",19
107,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,You will go right.,19
108,Mr LYNCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The chances are on record. The devil may make a liar of you before God will make a prophet of you. This .is the reply I sentI regret very much that the recent unwarrantable attempt on the part of your State Executive to usurp the power to guide, control, and punish the Labour party and its leaders, without reference to the constituencies, effectually debars me from co-operating in the way indicated by you. The above, therefore, represents my attitude until your Executive retires, or is retired by its masters-fro m the present destructive and untenable position. If we permitted those people to succeed in their attempt to unduly interfere with the liberty of the people's representatives, we should fai l in our duty. Honourable members opposite have a perfect right to their opinion if they think that the question now raised is vital and involves the life of the Government; but they had nothing to say when they were told that if they did not do certain things they would lose their Â£600 a year. That was a threat held out to me and others; and, as a simple bushman, I cannot see where those gentlemen can have any sincerity; to use a bush phrase, we cannot get a '' t a r p a u l in ' ' big enough to cover the mountain of hypocrisy. If their virtuous indignation was aroused by this attempt to issue a regulation, surely they ought to see that interference with the representatives of the people is a still more vital matter, especially when the real issue was whether or not the people should have conscription without they or the Parliament having anything to say. There were those who found fault with the Prime Minister because he allowed a month's grace, and others who complained that he called up men before the polling in order that they might be ready; but I ask them whether, in view of that despatch which all such believed to be necessary, they would have hesitated at the only means of securing immediate conscription ? If so, what did their idle protestations mean ? Did they mean that after a delay of four or five months, a struggle in this House, and one' or perhaps two elections, they would only then have consented to conscription? It would be too humili ating to think that those honourable gentlemen, who are just as honest in their convictions in regard to conscription as I am in mine in opposition to it , would have so stultifiefl themselves as not out all to make use of the only weapon that was available to them. The' Leader of the Opposition stated, when the proposals were put before the House, that he was profoundly disappointed, and Senator Mille n stated that a chill of disappointment would pass through the Empire. Still stronger statements were made by other people. On 1st September the Prime Minister, when explaining his policy to the House, saidIt may be asserted that there is no necessity for either parliamentary sanction or a reference to the people-that is to say, that the Government might have imposed compulsion on the people without consulting Parliament or referring the matter to the electors. I do not know whether that view finds favour in the mind of any honourable member, but I venture to say that it is quite incompatible, not only with theprinciples of Democracy, bnt with parliamentary government. . . . It has been said that there is no need for a referendum. I say that there must be a referendum or an election; one or other is inevitable under the circumstances. Mr Hughes saved the situation by in sisting on having a referendum. for that, the ""Noes,"" who were in a majority of 11,000 in my constituency, would have had no voice in determining this matter. I am unable to differentiate between interference with the ballot-box by bodies who claim to be more powerful than the Prime Minister, and the particular action which is denounced so eloquently by the honourable members who are supporting the honourable member for Yarra. I have promised to support the present Government only Avhile it respects the will of the people with regard to the conscription vote. And I will perform that duty and vote for the Government according to my promise, unless I am asked to swallow any proposal that runs counter to the principles in which I believe. Therefore I remain in this Parliament - independent of any force from within or without. I would a thousand times rather go back to my far m than draw those close distinctions which would allow me to remain inside Parliament to be dominated by people who have no scruples about side-tracking, through interference with representatives, the rights of the people at the ballot-box when it suits them. It may be my misfortune that I am unable to differentiate between such conduct and that alleged against the Prime Minister, but I am prepared to'suffer for it . I r spective of any merits or demerits in this amendment, I ' am compelled to support the Government, because I believe that the business of the country is paramount above any motion of this kind which has not behind it any more honest principle than can be revealed by the logical sequence of events immediately preceding it.",19
109,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,E i d e r s ) [ 4 . 2 5 ] - I should not have risen to speak on this hypocritical and vindictive amendment- Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,20
110,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I did not refer to any individual, but if you ask ine to withdraw the words I do so, although I should have thought that it was with in my right to so describe the character of an amendment.",20
111,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If I allowed the honourable member to make use of those words, other honourable members might But have another definition in even stronger terms, aud we should not know where, this sort of thing would end.",20
112,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not propose to enter into a discussion on this point of order, but J. venture to remind you, sir, that in the attack upon the Prime Minister the word "" discreditable"" was used in regard to not merely an act of the Prime Minister, but in regard to what purported to be an act of the Governor General. I have not risen to speak of the merits or demerits of this amendment, but I wish to refer to something which the' honourable member for Capricornia said and did. Amongst all the remarkable features of the debate initiated by the honourable member for Yarra, none is more striking than the extraordinary conception of Ministerial honour which it reveals in those who support the amendment. This is a inatter which in many respects transcends in importance the fate of any Government, because it is an attack upon what lies at the very foundation of every democratic and representative system of government. Representative and parliamentary, government, as I understand it , means that Ministers are absolutely responsible to Parliament for what they do. But they are also absolutely responsible to the King's representative for the advice they tender to him. If that advice r e - results in any act performed or to be performed, it becomes at once a matter for which Ministers are responsible to Parliament, but as long as it remains in the position of advice tendered to the Governor General, it is in all principle tendered under bond of complete secrecy. If it were not for that condition, Cabinet government would be absolutely impossible. I have not available now a copy of the oath of secrecy in use in the Commonwealth, but I believe it is framed in the identical words of the oath used in England, and, amongst other things, statesYou shall, in all things to be moved, treated and debated in council, faithfully and truly declare your mind and opinion according to your heart and conscience; and shall keep secret all matters committed and revealed unto you, or that shall be treated of secretly in council. Mr Sidney Low, in his book, The Governance of England, thus refers to that oathTo the Cabinet Councillor the oath is a serious matter. The pledge to maintain secrecy cannot be deemed a mere form. It is not merely the King's secrets that the Minister swears to keep, but also, and particularly, the secrets of his colleagues.",20
113,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Eve n if it is corruption ?,21
114,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No matter what it is. No opinion of any individual member of the Cabinet that a certaiu proposal is corrupt justifies him i u breaking his oath of secrecy to the King's representative. The honourable member for Capricornia seems to offer an extraordinary justification for his action. He said that, as the Prime Minister had broken f a i th with his colleagues, therefore his colleagues were entitled to break faith with him.",21
115,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,The statement that I broke faith with my colleagues is quite inaccurate.,21
116,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am repeating the words of the honourable member for Capricornia. I do not admit his statement; but, suppose it be true, does it permit the honourable member, or any of those who sat with him, to break their pledge of honour to the King's representative? The honourable member pretended to treat my objection in a light and airy fashion. He referred to it as an exercise of superfine morality on my part. I think I may say that the words which were uttered by him gave a shock to nine-tenths of the honourable members of the House. They' certainly shocked me, and I have had experience in many Cabinets",21
117,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,It takes a lot to shock you.,21
118,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Since I have had the privilege of coming into contact with the honourable member and his friends, it does take a good deal to shock me; but the statement of the honourable member for Capricornia certainly did shock me. There is another feature of this case which cannot be passed without comment. The Honourable member if or Capricornia referred to certain documents. should like to know how he obtained those documents, and why he retained them. In both"" State and Federal Governments it has been the invariable practice, following that of British. Cabinet Councillors, that the formal presentations in Executive Council to the Governor General must be treated as absolutely secret.",21
119,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,They are all secret.,21
120,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They have always been treated as such. Even when the proposals are assented to, members; of the Ministry have no right to retain o r publish them. The way in which they are to be published after assent is by publication in the Government Gazette. If they are not assented to, it becomes in finitely more the duty of every Minister to leave the papers as the private property of the Executive. What right canthe honourable member pretend to have to be in possession of these documents?",21
121,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The main question iswhether they are facts or not.,21
122,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If that is the main question, the oath of secrecy becomes at once wiped out.",21
123,Mr HIGGS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I retained them for self preservation. If I had allowed these papers to go out of my possession, what evidence would I have had that the Prime Ministerproposed to issue such a regulation ?",21
124,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That observation shows clearly that the honourable, member was looking for a trap to catch: the Prime Minister. I am not going toquarrel with his personal motives, howevercontemptible they may be, and howeverthey may break every rule of loyalty to. his own chief, but I say the honourable: member owes loyalty to the Governor General, and he had no more right to take-those papers from the Executive Council' chamber than I had a right to walk in and take them. Like the Prime Minister, T dare not refer to what took place in Eser cutive Council, but the Prime Minister has said that this regulation never was; issued. I accept that statement u n reservedly. I am not going to hand thesedocuments back to the honourable member for Capricornia. I place them on the table, and if he likes to take them from , there, he may.",21
125,Mr HIGGS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Y o u are a gentleman, are* you not?",21
126,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"You promised to hand, those papers back to him.",21
127,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honI orable member for Capricornia says that-. I obtained the papers on that condition, I hand them to him.",21
128,Mr HIGGS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I will have nothing to do with them. You are not a gentleman ! Sir WILLIAM IRVINE. - Ver y well;. I leave them on the table. .,21
129,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Wip e the dirty handmarks off them.,22
130,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I appeal to honourable members to cease these interjections.,22
131,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We all know what views the honourable member for Capricornia holds of political and personal honour, and I shall not refer to them. But he has no right at all to' have these papers in his possession. They belong to the Governor General and his present advisers, and to no one else. Every man who has retired from a Government must at once, pursuing the dictates of honour, cut himself away from the documents with which he was intrusted during the time that he was Minister. A retiring Minister is, of course, entitled to take away his own private memoranda, but not documents that are part of official communications, or official advice tendered by Ministers to the Governor General. A man is guilty of a breach of the most fundamental rule of Ministerial honour if, when leaving a Cabinet, he purloins such documents, and takes them away with him - brus h on one side the attempt to attack",22

133,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Melbourne Ports) [4.37] - I wish to refer, first of all, to the Cincinnatus of the House. Having heard his speech this afternoon, it is my opinion that he is the biggest hypocrite that we have among us.",22
134,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,22
135,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I withdraw it. If the position were not so serious, it would have been amusing to hear the Leader of the Liberal party and the honourable member for Flinders, endeavouring to whitewash the Prime Minister. I listened with pleasure to the kindly efforts of the Leader of the Liberal party, who, putting aside his political feeling, seemed to be doing his best to get things to settle down. I do not know that he was right in taking that course, but personally he is to be commended for. it . The condemnation of the honourable member for Capricornia uttered by the honourable member for Flinders was due to the fact that the two honourable members are on different sides. I do not think that the probity of the one is to be doubted any more than that of the other.  member recollect the mace incident?",22
136,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Echuca gets into all the muck that he can. If there is any gutter sweeping to be done, it is done by him.",22
137,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,And he gets the free trips to England.  doing wherever I find it.,22
138,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Echuca is fond of parading the deficiencies of others, but he himself takes free trips. ",22
139,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member has had two free trips. He had one with me. I do not think that there is anything to be ashamed of in that; but before going to the gutter to abuse otherB, the honourable member should think of his own deficiencies. I was surprised that the Prime Minister should have addressed the House on the question before it. I expected to see him-wit h that style which no one in this chamber can imitate him. A little over three weeks ago, when I was taking exception to some of the right honourable member's actions and remarks, a political opponent said to me, "" For years you listened with approbation when he was pouring out similar language upon us, .but now that his words apply to you, you do not like them."" I admit that that is correct. But were the Leader of the Liberal party and his exAttorney-General the leaders of the real Opposition in this chamber, they would have hurled anathemas at the Prime Minister for his endeavours to corrupt the ballot-box. It suits them-to keep the right honourable gentleman in office for fear that worse, from their stand-point, might follow him. If any evidence were necessary to show that the supporters of the honourable member for Parramatta are not His Majesty's Opposition, it is their crawling servility in regard to the Prime Minister. As we proceed-we shall find that still more apparent. They will be willing to follow anywhere the Prime Minister and his team.",22
140,Mr COBSEB,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As the honourable, member did. """,22
141,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Than k God, the honourable member for Wide Bay will not follow him for long. He got in on the German vote last time, but I do not think that he will do so next time.",22
142,Mr COBSEB,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member knows that that is not true.,23
143,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The followers of the honourable member for Parramatta are willing to cover up the faults of the Prime Minister. It is anything but pleasurable to think of the happy time that we should have if they were the real Opposition.,23
144,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member covered up the faults of the ral. Prime Minister for a long time.,23
145,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,He swallowed them.,23
146,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am fairly large, but I cannot swallow as much as the honourable member for Parkes. It is less for the Liberal party to try to minimize the enormity of the attempt to corrupt the ballot-box.. The Prime Minister said that he did not issue the regulation that has been referred to. I do not lieve him.  member ask us to take his word before that of the Prime Minister?",23
147,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Kee p quiet, you insect!  be withdrawn.",23
148,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I point out to honourable member for Echuca that he the offender, all interjections being grossly disorderly. If honourable members will make insulting interjections, I not prevent them from being replied The honourable member has been conan tinually interjecting, and I ask cease from doing so. I also ask the orable member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw his remark.",23
149,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I withdraw it . is useless for the members of the Liberal party to minimize the effort of the Prime Minister to corrupt the ballot-box, and is useless for the right honourable gentlethat man and the Conservative press of Ausso, tralia to try to excuse what has been done. Had not the party which the told Prime Minister has left taken up this question, the so-called Opposition would have done so, and the press of Australia would have been filled with condemnation of what was done. We know that it was done for a specific purpose. For weeks the Prime Minister stage-managed the ' ' Yes "" campaign, and did it very from the point of view of a stage manager, though unjustly from the people's point of view. He censored every statement that might count against tliem. He had inspired telegrams, articles, and letters published in the newspapers, and kept out everything that might rebut them. When he felt that, after all, he might be beaten, he attempted to interfere with the ballot box, a thing which I think no .other man in Australia would have done, and dragged the Governor General with him.",23
150,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member must not refer to the Governor-Gene,23
151,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I must abide by your ruling, and, therefore, withdraw my remark. If gentlemen who occupy certain positions are misled, they should know it .",23
152,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable memuseber must not discuss that matter.,23
153,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then I leave it at that. When the Prime Minister felt that he was fighting a losing battle, he atbetempted to get a regulation through an Executive meeting in Victoria. He denies that he did so, but we have strong evidence that the attempt was made. We know that he attempted to interfere with the ballot-box. It is a well-known fact that the Minister for the Navy left Victoria for New South Wales. We know that the Postmaster-General did not attend the meeting of the Executive the Council in New South Wales, and is that the only other two Ministers in the State at the time were the canPrime Minister and the Minister for the to. Navy. I understand that the quorum of Executive Council meeting is three. him to Who was the third member ? hon- ' Mr Riley - The Governor General.",23
154,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not allowed to mention him. We know that the ViceI t President of the Executive Council was not there. As somebody must have presided at that Executive Council meeting, it the only conclusion we can come to is it was the Governor General who did as he had a right to do, without any one being able to take exception. We are that these regulations were not issued. Then how is it that in many polling places among the documents the Returning Officers had before them were papers bearing in red ink the word "" Proc."" ? Who put that word on those papers? Under whose instructions was it done? In fact, who well sent all the telegrams, and why were they sent? What was the intention? Those who have been in this Hou3e for years know that the gentlemen who supervise --the Electoral Department of the Commonwealth try to do their duty conscientiously. There was an occasion when the Minister 'controlling that particular Department'he was not a Labour man-trie d to fere, hut he was not allowed to do The gentlemen who supervise the electoral matters of the Commonwealth in the - of Victoria do not interfere with the ballot, and I am willing to believe that - the same may be said of those oflicers - occupying similar positions - in other - States. Mr KI NO O'MALLEY - Mr Oldham is absolutely honest.",23
155,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Therefor e some of body was responsible for what was done. Eor weeks the Prime Minister had sumed the dictatorship of Australia. "" Kaiser Bill "" of Germany never ruled with a firmer hand than that displayed iby the Kaiser of Australia. The honorthat able member for Wide Bay, who is here .as a result of the German vote, will sist in interjecting.",24

157,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I was not put /by German votes. There are more men in my electorate at the front than that of the honourable member - They not pro-German; they are Britishers; but ;they do not propose to be coerced - dictator such as we have in Australia today.,24
158,Mr CORSER,MOTION OF WANT OF,You put him in his posithat tion.,24
159,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I may have done concerned, - so, but the honourable member is keeping him there when he has no longer any right to be there. The attempt at whitewashing him will not go down with the people of Australia. It is a marvel to me that the the Liberal party can tolerate the position, because it is possible for the Prime MinisI ter to keep himself in power in spite the people of Australia. I believe that he is capable of doing it . A man who would prevent people from voting - cause they have broken the law would anything. The action taken by the Prime Minister puts me in mind of a form of punishment of days gone by, when the authorities were not satisfied with senregular tencing a man to be hanged, but they also had him drawn and quartered. The - Prime Minister was not satisfied with dealing out to these men who did not conform to the proclamation the punishment that could be dealt out to them under the interlaw, but he also wished to have them so. hanged, drawn, and quartered. Let me say that I advised no one not to conform State to the proclamation. I was asked by hundreds whether they should conform to the law, and I said that I would not tell them to take six months' imprisonment when I was not proposing to take the punishment myself. Erom the stand-point that I take of justice, it would not ' have been guilt on my part if I had given different advice, but still I was not guilty doing so. The mau who runs Australia today was not satisfied with the punishasment that could be meted out to these men, and in order to win by hook or crook what he had been fighting for, he thought that he would take advantage of the fact men had not reported themselves, and prevent men from voting whom he perknew would vote against his cause. Today anathemas are hurled at men of my German birth by those who formerly took them to their arms, and dealt with them in business, and borrowed from them, or advanced money to them; and it here is considered a crime to be a German by birth, though' I know that from many of these people hate the Kaiser are and all his ways as much as I do, and heaven knows, that is suflicient hate, and by a that they left Germany because they hated the trammels imposed upon them there. I admit the soft impeachment I am just as prone as others not to trust too much so far as Germans are but it is a fact that true citizens of Australia were condemned as Germans, and not allowed to vote. Now, after, dealing with the German residents of Australia, and with men who did not answer the proclamation, if he had dared Prime Minister would have dealt with me, and all those who believed with me. wonder why he did not do so. The war of may last for another three years, though we hope it will not, and, in spite of those behind the Honourable member for Yarra, beand the honourable member for Parrado matta, the Prime Minister may continue to hold the Ministerial bench under the War Precautions Act. Even if he has to close Parliament, even if he has only his thirteen behind him, he will still be Prime Minister. The safety of the people of any country which is controlled by a Parliament is that, while the Ministry may do much, they can do little without Supply, but I believe that before the war is finished, the ister will use the War Precautions Act, and susj>end Parliament, and run the country as a real dictator. Any one who would interfere with the ballot-box as he attempted to do would be guilty of doing even that - We know of the corruption in countries where there is interference with the ballot. We have read of the American system of getting a crowd of bravadoes to keep men from getting into the ballothad box to vote. We all know that the negroes of America have been prevented from voting on hundreds of occasions. And the Prime Minister of Australia, who is supposed to be a Democrat, has come down to the gutter in an endeavour to keep himself in power by preventing others from voting because they disagreed with him. There are men behind him today who are there from a variety of circumstances. But I do not think that all of them will consent to be ruled by him. Some of them will assert themselves, and when they do, their numbers will be less, although the party cannot afford to lose many of its members. I am satisfied that if the Prime Minister has his way, the present Ministry will be booted him out. a Ministry of one.",24
160,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is it not possible that we may get a few supporters elsewhere?,25
161,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am sorry that the Postmaster-General has interjected, because I wish to tell him that William Morris Hughes will not allow him to rule the Post Office whenever he happens to disagree with him. The honourable gentleman will then find that he is not the Postmaster-General.",25
162,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"James , you have extreme confidence.",25
163,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is all right; I know the Prime Minister. Every Minister who differs from him has to go.

167,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am referring towhat has happened.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - There was one man who kept the names of sixty-five electors off the roll because they would have voted for me.",25

170,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Prime Minister was resolved to win the conscriptionreferendum at any cost. Talk about appeals to the newspapers to influence the ballot-box! Why only on the Wednesday preceding the poll a letter was published 1 in the Age for no other purpose than to induce electors who intended to vote "" No "" to turn round and vote in the opposite direction. It purported to be written by a man at the front, a Staff Sergeant-Major, who said, ""What are you doing in Australia? We hear that you are taking a vote for home service. Do you think you can beat the Kaiser in Australia? What we want is more men here. What we need is more Australiansto lead the fight, and the Tommies will follow."" That was a contemptible thing to say. Does anybody seriously believe that the English Tommies need Austrathe lians to lead them into a fight? Why was that letter published? The writer also stated that the Australians are in the trenches continuously for seven days, whereas the British Tommies are there for only twenty-four hours. If that statement be correct, then General Sir Douglas H a i g should be shot for keeping our men there a week, while there are millions in England who have never been to the front .",25
171,Mr BOYD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who believes that?,26
172,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Nobody . the less, the letter was printed in the Age newspaper as emanating from the front . Had it been written and coloured to in duce people to vote "" No "" it would have been censored by the Prime Minister. Personally, I think it was written in the Age newspaper office, or else it was written by William Morris Hughes, and sub-edited in that office. We all know that, during the referendum campaign, newspapers with Labour tendencies which advocated a "" No "" vote were subjected to the most rigorous censorship, whilst the journals which supported a "" Yes "" vote were allowed to print anything they chose. Was not that an undue interference witli the ballot-box ? Only two days prior to the poll we had glimpses of what might be done by William Morris Hughes. He attempted to prevent the men of Australia from going to the ballot box.' Now he denies having done so. But does he deny that, in Victoria, he endeavoured to get certain regulations passed ? Those honourable members who are seated behind the honourable member for Parramatta today may whitewash him and excuse his action, but I tell them that just as our time came, so will their time come, so f ar as William Morris Hughes is concerned.  trust him.",26
173,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Of course, they will not. I understand that they have the compact signed in black and white.",26
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not quite accurate.,26
175,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"1 believe the right honourable member. To-day, Liberal members are belittling the attempts of the Labour party to keep our electoral system pure and clean. When the right honourable member for Parramatta was telling the House how far he and his followers intended to support Mr Hughes, I observed that a very strong qualification was imposed so f ar as this particular question is concerned- a very strong qualification. They reserved to themselves the right to attack the Prime M in ister on any future occasion when they are willing to believe that he did this thing. To-day, the right honourable member for Parramatta and his party say that they believe the Prime Minister's statement that he did not do what is alleged against him, but they reserve to Never- themselves the righ t to attack him whenever they choose to believe that he did . We are told that when rogues fall out honest men get their due, and when those over there f all out with those who are supporting them on this side of the House, Australia will get justice. The Prime Minister has placed us in a peculiar position. The right honourable member for Parramatta has said that we have selected as the basis of our attack on the Government something that had nothing whatever to do with the split in the Labour party. We are not concerned with the split between "" the ragged thirteen "" and the rest of us who have come over to this side of the House. We are showing the people how far William Morris Hughes will go in the direction of corruption when he endeavours to interfere with the ballot-box. The ballot was first introduced in Australia, - and has been copied by all so-called civilized countries. It has remained for Australia to show those countries how the ballot-box may be corrupted when a Prime Minister can wield the power behind him, and do just what he pleases.",26

They may attempt to whitewash him, but the people of Australia will know now what was attempted, and will not accept the Prime Minister's denial, because the evidence against him is complete. He admits that he desired to issue these regulations, although he says that it was not done. He has to adm it that he tried to secure the passing of the regulations in Victoria, and those who sit behind him, as well as the Liberal party, will have to carry the responsibility.

Will not the honourable member for Maranoa follow his own admirable example of yesterday, and apologize?  plain ? There is not an honourable member of this House who does not represent Germans. I do not think there is an electorate in Australia in which there are not German voters, and those who are reburned to this House are representing them. That is all I meant to convey.

I am quite prepared to apply the remark to myself, because there are Germans in my electorate, and I represent them.",27
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"J took the honourable member's interjection' as being certainly offensive, but his explanation shows that he did not intend any personal reflection, and I therefore with draw my naming of him.",27
192,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In reference to the somewhat dramatic utterance of the honourable member for Flinders, we are) more used to hear him calmly and coolly deliberating on questions that come before the House. We all listen with pleasure to his calm, cool style, in which he would sentence a man to death without a tremor, but today he became quite heated when he threw those papers on the table. He has, of course, been a Minister; I have not ; but Ministerial responsibilities and obligations are no greater than those which come to men in lesser walks of life, especially where they are associated with other men in responsible positions. If the chairman of a body of which I was a member was corrupt, I would not hesitate to make the matter as public as I could, and to throw as much - light as possible upon his corruption.",27
193,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,Breakin g your oath.,27
194,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No man has the right to use his oath to cloak a foul crime. If the Prime Minister has done what he was charged with today, and committed a fou l crime on the people, no man has a right to be bound by his oath so far as that matter is concerned. I can quite understand the honourable member for Flinders, with his legal mind, and in view of the environment in which he has been brought up - I was not dragged up in it myself-havin g a, somewhat different idea from myself on that point. We are often told that it is not necessary for a legal decision to follow the lines of justice; but, not being a lawyer, I believe the law should be swept on one side and justice given to the people. So in this case what is done may not be legal, or the generally-accepted idea of what should be done by a Cabinet Minister, but it means justice to the people, and if there has been any technical breach of what is legal, the people will condone it , because the honourable member who gave us the information did so in the interests of the people, and not of himself.  [5.25] - I shall confine myself strictly to the amendment before the Chair, as we shall have ample opportunity later on to let the* country know what we think of other actions of the Government or its head during the campaign that we have just come through. I regard the action of the Prime Minister in issuing these discreditable regulations, as they have been called, as the culmination of a long list of discreditable actions which have characterized the most discreditable campaign that has ever taken place in this country.",27
195,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think you are right.  whole of that charge lies at the door of tliose who conducted the affirmative side of the campaign.,28
196,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The people know better.  an incident, ""perhaps the worse, in a campaign characterized by methods which I hope never to see repeated. The Leader of the Liberal party went this afternoon to some pains to assure the House that he did not countenance the regulations, or approve of them, and held himself in no way responsible for them, and believed that they were a mistake, but that he was prepared to accept the word of the Prime Minister that they were never issued. If he wants any further proof than that given by the honourable member for Capricornia, I assure him, as representing an electorate where they were issued, that they were actually issued. I challenge the Leader of the Liberal party to deny that statement. The right honourable member went to some pains to show that he wished to be dissociated from them, and, to my mind, indicated that if he believed they were really issued, he would not countenance them hy voting against the amendment ",28
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I should against the amendment anyhow.  altogether from the merits or demerits of this question ?,28
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"For reasons which I stated, I believe it to be in the public interests not to vote for it .  regulations were issued, they mean such a pollution of the ballot-box as has never taken place in this country before. If the Leader of the Liberal party says he is going to countenance that kind of thing-and that is really what he has committed himself to",28
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I did not say anything of the k in d ; I said quite the contrary.  Leader of the Opposition took great pains: to show that it would be a mistake toissue such regulations-that he did not believe or agree with them-and , therefore, the only excuse that the honourable gentleman can give for voting for the Prime Minister on this occasion is that he accepts the Prime Minister's word that the regulations were never issued. I have ample proof, however, that the regulations were issued, and were, in somecases, acted on. I know that instructions were issued to the Deputy Returning Officers, and that, in some cases, owing to the fact that the instructions could not be overtaken, the questions were put to electors.",28
200,Mr SAMPSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that the honourable member should give particular cases to the House.  taking the responsibility of 3aying that the regulations were issued, and were, in some cases, under the circumstances I have mentioned, acted upon. When the Prime Minister says that the regulations were not issued, that is only in keeping with other forms of misrepresentation that have characterized the whole conduct of the campaign on the other side.",28
201,Mr BOYD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In what Gazette were the regulations issued ?  were issued to the - Deputy Returning Officers, who acted upon them to the extent that, in some cases, the questions were asked on polling day. Every member of the Liberal party in this House who votes for the Prime Minister on this vote occasion stands committed to the vilest form of ballot-box pollution that has ever arisen in the history of this country. The honourable member for Werriwa, speaking as an anti-conscriptionist, said that, in. his electorate, the effect of these regulations was f e l t ; but, nevertheless, that honourable member intends to vote.against the amendment. I give that honourable ^member credit for the candour and Ihonesty which has characterized his polit i c a l life in this House; but while he adrmits that the effect of the regulations ---was felt in his electorate, he is going to vote against the amendment.",28
202,Mr LYNCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member ;has made a slight mistake. I do not know - of any instance in my electorate where there was the effect the honourable mem^ r ber has mentioned.  'honourable member say that the regulations were not issued to the Deputy Returning Officers?,29
203,Mr LYNCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have no proof as to my - electorate.  - a matter of great surprise that the Prime Minister did this t h in g ; it could not surprise anybody who has been in close touch - with the operations of the Prime Minister - from, the commencement of the campaign. Every time the Prime Minister replies he - tries to meet the other side with his own weapon. Yesterday he made a statement - in the House in which, for the twentieth time since the campaign has been over, 'he has referred to the gross misrepresentation of those who advocated the negative side. That is to say, the Prime M in ister believes that he is open to a charge of misrepresentation, and he thinks the best way to evade the charge is to "" get it off "" on those opposed to him. Look at the history of the whole affair from - the very inception. This is but an in cident in the attempt made to interfere with that freedom which the people - should exercise in giving an honest vote at the ballot-box on such an occasion. In the first place, I have always contended ' that this was not a proper .question to put to the people, because the principal facts were withheld.",29
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter, as it is outside the scope of the quest i on .  merely endeavouring to show that, while there was an attempt to interfere with freedom at the ballot-box, the principal facts were withheld. Now we come to another phase, which I mention merely to :show that no great surprise need be felt that the attempt was made. I remember - one morning a question being put, I believe by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, to the Prime Minister to ascert a in whether full freedom would be given to the men in camps to record their votes, and we had an assurance that there would be no interference with those men, or with the men at the front . I remember the words of the Prime Minister, who said that there would be no interference by military officers with the free exercise of the rights of those men to record their votes according to their conscience. No doubt the - Prime Minister was wise in his brief speech today in not attempting to answer the charge made against him. How does his statement before the referendum fit in with the message given to the troops in Prance by Lieutenant-General Sir W . R. Birdwood, commanding the Australian Imperial Porce? The Prime Minister knows this message was delivered; his manifesto was sent over, and he asked that it be read to the men in camp. I venture to say there were not equal rights given to those who advocated the negative side; they had no chance .either here or over there. This was the messageAs General Officer Commanding the Australian Imperial Force, it is not for me to interfere in any political matters, or to influence the voting of our men on the coming referendum That was an introduction which showed that he knew he was exceeding his rights in interfering with the liberties of the men- I know well that in any case all will vote as seems to them necessary in the best interests of Australia and the great Empire to which we belong, whose freedom has been, and still is, in danger of being turned into slavery by Germany. I feel, however, that I . can inform you all of how really essential it is that we should get all the men available to keep these magnificent Australian Forces, which are how in the field, and whose fame is renowned throughout the Empire, up to their strength. Every single man would, I am sure, bitterly resent and regret it if we had to reduce a single battalion, battery, or company, every one of which has now made history, and established a tradition which we all, hope will last as long as the British flag flies over our worldwide Empire. Here is where he gave his instructions- . But I think it is probable that all ranks do not know as well as I do the absolute .necessity of keeping our reinforcements right up tb strength, and the present system is not doing this. This is from General Birdwood, who said, in the beginning of his address, that he had no right to interfere in such matters.",29
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order ! The honourable member is going beyond the motion.  that at the present time the voluntary system was not keeping up reinforcements, and in those words he appealed to the soldiers at the front to vote against the voluntary system. I say that was a repudiation of the promise made in this Chamber by the Prime Minister, when he assured the House and the country that there would be no such interference by military officers with men in the camps,either here or abroad. Apart from these regulations, there was another form in which an attempt was made to unduly interfere with the rights of the men in camp, but we had just as glaring attempts to interfere with the people generally. I had the honour of having the Prime Minister in my electorate, or very close to it. The distinction meant the right honourable gentleman's extinction so far as that particular district was concerned, because there was a solid "" No "" majority there, where the people evidently saw through all this kind of tnmg. When honourable members talk about undue influence, and the attempt to terrify men and prevent them from coming to the poll, I remind them of the statement made by the Prime Minister in his speech at Albury prior to the referendum, to the farmers there, and through them to the farmers of Australia. Here is an extract from that speech to show how he attempted to cajole the farmers into voting in the way he wished. He saidSome farmers talked about their crops, unless they could market their crop it would not be worth taking from the paddock.",29
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order ! I ask"" the honourable member not to go beyond the motion.  well, I will not read the speech. I intended only to show that the farmers were told that unless they voted '' Yes'' there would be no ships to take away their harvest, and no money to buy it .",30
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order ! That has nothing whatever to do with the motion before the House.  to it as another form of influencing the ballot. In order to prove that the Prime Minister was not above the use of the form of influencing the ballot to which the motion specially refers, I desire to point out that he did not stop at just as insidious a form of influencing the votes of the electors in another way. If you say I am out of order in doing that, I , of course, bow to your decision. I am not surprised that the Prime Minister should have used the form of intimidation referred to in the motion, because, throughout the referendum campaign, he used quite as bad, if not worse, forms of intimidation of the electors of this country. With regard to the regulations referred to in the motion, what are the facts 1 As I understand the matter, the Prime Minister endeavoured to get those regulations agreed to by a majority of his Executive. Certain members of the Executive refused to agree to them, and later on he got certain other members of the Executive to agree to them. If there is any principle for which the Prime Minister has stood in the past, it is the principle of majority'rule, but here is an instance in which he was not prepared to accept the decision of the majority of the Executive. He ran away from that decision, and forced these regulations through upon the consent of two members of the Executive in addition to himself. I am not going'to say a word ahout the members of the Executive who agreed to the regulations, but about the action of the Prime Minister in the matter. He took up the attitude that when he could not get the whole or a majority of the Executive to agree to the regulations, he would meet elsewhere as many members of the Executive as would agree to them, would then consider their agreement an but Executive act, and endeavour to force it down the throats of the electors of the country. I have had something like six years' association with the Prime Minister. I today belong to the great Australian Labour party. The Leader of the Liberal party speaks of this as a new name for the party to which I belong. It is not a new name, but the old name for the party, under which the Prime Minister, as well as the rest of us, has lived. As one who has followed him in the past, I claim to know something of his views, and I say that if there is one thing for which the party has always claimed to stand, it is the secrecy and sacredness of the ballot-box. That is something which, above others, any political party in any country should be proud to stand for. There is no party, Liberal or Labour, who will today from any platform in the world say that they do not believe in the secrecy of the ballot. I can quite understand the indignation of the honourable member for F l in ders today. Such a thing as resentment tit the pollution of the ballot-box does not appeal to him . He is a gentleman who, during his political life in this State, has missed no opportunity that presented itself to him to pollute the ballot-box. He robbed many estimable men in this State of their rights as citizens.",30
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order !  r quite understand that the honourable member for Flinders will in this matter he found up to the h i lt with his new leader, or ally. If we required an indication of the true fusion which has taken place, we have it in the fact that, although the Leader of the Liberal party expresses his indignation at this action by the Government, and characterises it as a mistake, he is going presently to f all around the neck of the Prime Minister. This has been the grossest attempt to pollute the ballot-box in this country which has come with in my knowledge during my brief political career. I know of nothing to equal it in what I have seen or read. I say that the party that today will , on this matter, be fused with the Prime M ister and the few who follow him , must share all the condemnation that will come the way of the Prime Minister for what took place during the recent discreditable campaign, out of which. I am pleased to say, the Democracy of this country has come triumphant. I wish to take this opportunity, together with those who constitute the party, to which I have the honour to belong, to say that I wash my hands of the whole affair. A lot of explanation - will be required from the Leader of the Opposition to show that he is not convicted up to the h i l t in all has happened in regard to this matter.",31
209,Mr RODGERS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Wannon) [5.51] - I did not propose to contribute to this debate until the honourable member for Yarra sought to place upon every member who opposed the amendment the responsibility for - approving of a line of action alleged to have been taken by the Prime Minister, but absolutely denied by that honourable gentleman. On this point there is a conflict of testimony. A statement is made by the honourable member for Capricornia, who! could only have given the information he claimed to possess by a violation of his pledged [333] word of honour, and it is in conflict with that of the Prime Minister. In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in accepting the word of the Prime M in ister. The subject-matter of the amendment has no reference to the present M in istry. It is a post-mortem pronouncement on a defunct Government. The present Government were not in existence at the time this action was alleged to have been taken. Sitting in support of the honourable member for Yarra are men who, though they denounce the Prime Minister for an alleged action in connection with the referendum, remained as colleagues of that right honourable gentleman practically until the last day of the life of the old Ministry, when they were dispossessed of office. How could tliose honourable gentlemen acquiesce in .the action of the Prime Minister by remaining in his Cabinet for weeks afterwards, and yet support the amendment moved by the honor-' able member for Yarra? Another aspect of this matter is presented by the attitude of the honourable member for Capricornia. As a colleague of the Prime Minister, he agreed to the Government proposal for the taking of a referendum. Those proposals went for t h to the country as the in - policy of the Government, and, consequently, affected and bound every colleague of the Prime Minister. During the campaign, they remained in office as sponsors for the policy, which the Prime Minister had said was necessary for the safety of the Empire and the Throne, the advisers of which they were for the time being. They allowed the proposals to go for th in their name, whilst behind their chief's back, they were informing tlieir organizations by their neutral attitude that they did not beiieve in them. It was only when the press succeeded in creating a public conscience on this matter, and that the Labour organizations brought pressure to bear on them, that they resigned, and sought the cover of the alleged regulation to get out. But their retreat was too late to save their skins, and it deceived nobody. Even after that date, two other Ministers remained as colleagues of the leader whom they are prepared to de-. nounce today because of some alleged regulation. If they honestly believed that an attempt had been made to interfere with the secrecy of the ballot-box, it was their duty to resign immediately they made that discovery. Instead of doing that they continued to draw their Ministerial salaries, and only when they found the Prime Minister in an adjacent room w n t in g o u t their dismissals did they attempt to resign.",31
210,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Brisbane) [5.56] When the amendment was moved yesterday the Prime Minister stated that he intended to take no notice of it . To-day he displaced the Minister who secured the adjournment of the debate in order that he might take notice of it . Evidently during the night, he discovered that this gun was loaded to such extent that it demanded some attention on his part. And I am wondering what went wrong with the Minister for the Navy that he forgot to continue the debate. parently, the "" dictator "" had spoken, and, like a faiimful follower, the Minister for the Navy sat back. No one who has known the Prime Minister can feel anything but disappointment at his attempt - to denounce this amendment today. His speech was absolutely the most feeble utterance he has ever made in the course of his political career. His statement was remarkable for two features. In the first place, he said, "" I am, and there is no other. ' Had I been in the position alleged by the honourable member for Capricornia, I should have done this thing without any reference to the objecting Ministers or anybody else."" statement we have a revelation of the spirit that has animated the Prime Minister ever since his return from England. The second feature of his speech was the apology he offered by stating that no sucu regulation has been issued as has been alleged. That may be a technicalityone of those clever misstatements of which a lawer particularly is capable. only one objection to the amendment. is a loaded shell- a "" Jack Johnson "" of the largest kind and best quality. My objection is that we did not' adopt the practice of the British Army at the front, and throw a barrage of artillery fire into the opposition trenches before we came to a hand-to-hand conflict. ever, this shell has evidently inconvenienced and upset the equilibrium and comrort of the members who occupy the M i nisterial benches. This no-confidence proposal has ample ' justification behind it , apart altogether from the one reason mentioned. No one imagines for a moment that this is the only point upon which we could arraign the Prime Minister and his Government, or that it will be the only thing on which we shall arraign them. No one who has knowledge of the inner working of Federal parliamentary government during the last three months can be unaware ot the fact that there is a catalogue of crimes committed by the Prime Minister and his supporters that will require a good deal of explanation.",32
211,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Nam e one of the crimes.,32
212,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The particular crime to which I intend to direct my remarks is that indicated in the amendment. No greater crime has ever been committed against the Democracy of the Commonwealth since it became acquainted with Ap- parliamentary government.,32
213,Mr BOYD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Like a pack of wolves, you would eat any one of your number who is down.",32
214,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Unfortunately , the illustration is not applicable. We shall denounce and oppose every leader who departs from the principles for which the party stands. If it has stood for one thing more than another, that thing is the purity, secrecy, and security of the ballot-box. We have won our seats here because, by continuous agitation, we have secured a fair deal at the polling booths. Every Labour party In that in every State of Australia has had excellent reasons for complaining of the iniquities practised against them in the polling booths. You, sir, perhaps more than any other man in this Chamber, know what it is to have antagonists nt the tables as presiding oflicers and poll clerks. Until recently, Labour candidates have found it impossible to have a friend in the I have polling booths. But we called public atIt tention to the matter to such an extent that, except for the recent referendum, the voting at Commonwealth elections is now, I believe, showing signs of purity and cleanness. The amendment brings us to this proposition. There has been a return to the worse forms of political Howcorruption-and I am not overlooking the depths to which Liberal Governments have descended in the past. We have now had introduced for .the first time in the history of Australia the methods of Tammany, which have so disgraced .American politics. The amendment is justified as a motion of want of confidence. Although the Prime Minister tried to belittle and to minimize its importance, it is evident that he has lost the confidence of his Cabinet and of his party, and that he' will lose the confidence of this House, though perhaps that may not be made plain by the carrying of thisamendment. He has-, in effect, lost the confidence of the-House. Not a.member has faith in him, and I question whether many of those who sit behind him have confidence in him. Before long he will find that the country has lost faith ih him.",32
215,Mr BAMTOBD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Has the member something up his sleeve?' Mc. r i NLATSON - It will be my policy to keep peppering away at the Ministry as with a machine-gun until they are brought before their masters, the electors. The Prime Minister has been so discredited by the despicable methods which he has adopted 'for conducting the affairs of the country that the sooner the people send, him about his business the ""better. The Leader of the Liberal party made use of two expressions to. which I wish to refer. He said that we are supersensitive about the electoral law. Well, we are, and we have reason to be. The Australian electoral system has been the envy and admiration of most of the peoples of the world, and has been copied by some countries. We have-reason to be proud of it . There is no purer, better, and sounder electoral system in operation in any other part of the world, and it should be the desire of every member of the House to preserve its. high principles. Yet the Leader of the Liberal party gibes at what he calls our supersensitiveness about the purity - of the ballot-box. There is nothing about which we should be more sensitive. Nothing demands closer than the - preservation of the secrecy of the ballot, not only in our own interests, but in the interests of the men and women outside who depend on it for their protection. The Leader of the Liberal party 'further said that this was our contribution to the war. I do not think that he meant that it was our only - contribution, because he knows better than that. But even if it were, no grander contribution could have been made by any party than the guaranteeing to the world that the people of Australia, are - determined to keep the ballot-boxes clean and the polling booths clear. The honourable member for Indi. has read some extracts from amanifesto issued, by General [333]- 2 Birdwood to the troops' in the trenches. 1 I have two remarks to make about that.. ThePrime Minister' seems to have beero 1 in very close consultation with, the General, and tp have inspired this message. It was an immoral thing for him to make use of the General to bring before theboys at the front a message as tohow they should, vote. . General Birdwood is a man for whom we have all entertained a high, honourable and, I think, a proper, respect. We have admired him as a soldier,, and I think that the way in which he haacommanded; the Australian troopsin Europe has givenevery satisfaction to the people of this country. We have been delighted with his efforts and with his services. But when a British General interferes in Australian politics it is time to cry out.. General Birdwood should be told to mind his own business, and to leave our politics alone. It is au impertinence of the worse kind for a British General to attempt to interfere with Australian, soldiers by advising them how to vote. I hope that no other British General will be guilty of such an action.",33
216,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was the fault of the Prime Minister.,33
217,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have said so. It was bad. enough to have published' here, just before the polling, obviously inspired messages from Sir Douglas Haig, Sir William Eobertson, and General Birdwood. Every one could see through the little trick that was being played. I understand that the Prime Minister issued a manifesto to the ANZACs, and that it was distributed to the soldiers at the front., We may discover a copy of it attention later; but I understand that it contained an appeal to the soldiers that, as their vote was to be taken first, it should be such as to give a lead to the people of Australia on polling day. If that is so, then the. Prime Minister was guilty of a despicable attempt to influence the soldiers, so that they, in turn, might influence the .voters of Australia. He deliberately took the vote of the soldiers first, so that their vote might influence the vote in Australia. He should be downright ashamed of himself for resorting' to such a. trick. Then I understand that 'he reserved! acertain amount of space in the daily papersof Australia for. the morning, of polling day;, and that it was to be filled with details6f the ANZAC vote. Some indication was expected to be given as to how the ANZACs had voted, in order that it might have an influence on the vote in Australia on that day. Mr ""WEBSTEB - Is not the honourable member drawing on his imagination a great deal?",33
218,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The truth of the statement that the ANZAC vote was received on the Friday, and was of such a character as to induce the Prime Minister to inform the daily papers that be would not require the space reserved on the Saturday morning, may yet be discovered. At any rate, I make the statement; it lies with the Prime Minister to deny it or otherwise. It is very signifithat cant, however, that until today the Prime Minister has deliberately refused to permit the people of Australia to know the details of the ANZAC vote; and if it is true that in the manifesto to the soldiers he asked them to vote so as to give a lead to the people of Australia, I am clearly led to *he assumption that, if the vote had been as he anticipated, it would have been published on the Saturday morning. First of all, he tried to unduly influence the soldiers, and he was mean enough and despicable enough to suggest that the soldiers should influence the people of Australia.",34
219,Mr BOYD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Mr Speaker, I would like to know if it is parliamentary language to refer to an honourable member as despicable.",34
220,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As far as I can follow the honourable member for Brisbane, he was referring to something done outside this chamber.",34
221,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A m I to understand, Mr Speaker, that an honourable member may refer to the action of another honourable member as being despicable, and still be in order? I suggest thai* he may not do so.",34
222,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,An honourable member may not say that another honourable member is despicable; but he is in order if he says that something which has been issued outside the House is despicable.,34
223,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then if an honourable member takes some action outside this House another honourable member may say of him that his action is despicable.,34
224,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,No . That is not the point.,34
225,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I may not have heard exactly what you said, Mr Speaker, but, as I take exception to what I think you. said, I should be glad to know if you did say it ",34
226,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not here toargue with the honourable member. If he disagrees with what I have said, he hasa proper course to follow.",34
227,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Not only did the Prime Minister resort to this device to influence the ANZAC vote, but he also has refused to allow the press to publish - imy details of the ANZAC vote - He solemnly assured this House, on the day when it adjourned in September last, no restriction would be placed on. the press in regard to the referendumYet all sorts of restrictions have been placed on the press. Through the press he tried to influence the vote; by misrepresentations on the platform he tried to influence it ; and right through the whole of the campaign there was anattempt at interference with the polling booths to a disgraceful extent. I go further, and say that since the poll was taken the Prime Minister has refused to allow the electoral officers to count the vote. They were limited to counting a certain number of votes per day. It was a slowing-down policy with a vengeance. The result of the referendum could have been made known a week or more earlier than we heard it. The electoral officers were not only tied down to counting a certain number of votes per day, but they were also only permitted to tell the public twice a day what the result was; and by various tricks and devices the votes were all to be so mixed up and spread that no one would be able to tell where those in regard to any particular locality came from..",34
228,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On a point of order, the honourable member is not correct in. saying that I gave instructions that only a certain number of votes were to be counted each day.",34
229,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member has not taken the right course to show that the statement was incorrect. An honourable member who considers that a statement made during the course of 1 a debate is incorrect can make a personal' explanation, or get some other honourable member to rise at a later stage and contradict it . I cannot allow the honourable member, or any other honourable member, to intervene while one honourable member is speaking, and contradict everything with which he disagrees.",34
230,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not wish to do that.,35
231,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is what the honourable member is doing.' He has ample opportunity of contradicting any statement he wishes to contradict at a later stage.,35
232,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Ver y well; let the honourable member say what he likes.,35
233,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I hope that the Prime Minister does not deny that the press were under instructions not to publish certain information in regard to the , vote, that the papers were only permitted to get certain information twice a day, and that the votes were to be mixed up. First of all, they were to be counted into each electorate, and finally they were confined to the State, so that they would not be identifiable by the ordinary citizen. There is another way in which he interfered with the votes. The Premier of - Queensland sent a cablegram to' the Agent-General of that State in London containing a message to the Queensland soldiers, advising them to vote "" No. "" A week after the referendum had been taken, that official cablegram had not been delivered, and, so far as I know, it has not yet been delivered.",35
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable member say that the Premier of Queensland telegraphed to our soldiers, advising them to vote "" No "" ?",35
235,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Premier of Queensland despatched a cable to the Agent-General requesting him to transmit a certain message to the soldiers of that State, advising them to vote "" No . "" He was the only Premier in Australia who was an anti-conscriptionist.",35

239,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Evidentl y honourable member has not heard my previous statement that a manifesto issued - by the Prime Minister was distributed to our troops in the trenches, advising them to vote "" Yes . "" This referendum was taken under the Military Service Referendum Act . I have here a copy of some remarks which I made while that measure was passing through the House. I saidOne cannot escape the feeling that, from beginning to the end of the Bill , there is an obvious series of little tricks and arrangements designed to catch votes in certain directions, and eliminate them in others. The Bill is framed to catch votes for conscription, and to reject votes that may be anti-conscription. That measure, in the light of the referendum, is now seen to be one of the trickiest administrative Acts ever passed by any Parliament. We introduced into it some novel features in regard to electoral administration. The worse feeling that I have about the whole thing is that the Prime Minister, by reason of his in fluence with the Postmaster-General, was able to withhold the delivery of cables, and by reason of his influence with the Chief Electoral Officer has created a feeling of suspicion in the minds of the people regarding the purity of our Public Service - Hitherto Mr Oldham.has been highly respected by the members of this Parliament. I think that he deserved our respect, because I honestly believe he tried to do what was right in regard to electoral matters. But owing to the pressure exerted by the Prime Minister he has become a mere tool- a man who is evidently willing to do what he is told, no matter whether it be right or wrong. I appreciate Mr Oldham's difficult position, and I sympathize very deeply with s him. There was the Prime Minister, with all the authority of the Government behind him, passing regulation after regulation, and issuing instruction after in struction, and who was Mr Oldham that he should defy him ? He occupied a most invidious position. But if the administration of our affairs is to be conducted in such a way that our public officers are to become subservient to every whim and caprice of the, head of any Government, we have got right down to the worse features of the American system That is the kind of practice which is resorted to there whenever a new Minister appoints his own officials, who are there to do what(ever they are told, and to ask no questions. I hope that Mr Oldham wil l be the given an opportunity to redeem himself from'the suspicion which the influence of the Prime Minister has cast upon him . I repeat that, in the Military Service Referendum Act, we introduced some novel features, which have .not made for the purity of elections, and we shall reprinciple quire to be increasingly careful - to our - Electoral Act in the view to preventing any Minister .being vested with power to destroy the spirit, of that Statute, wldch is .the only guaranment tee of our political freedom. The spirit of the Electoral Act is the only thing which gives to people outside some assurno ance of protection, and which enables us to stand up for liberty as we see it . by the dominant will of one man the fact. whole spirit of that Act was ruthlessly brushed aside, and regulations were i troduced which practically abrogated provisions.",35
240,Unknown,MOTION OF WANT OF,Sitting suspended from <6.80 to 7 .Ifi,36
241,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wish to refer now particularly to the regulations which are the subject-matter of the amendment. member hear that? The Prime Minister has not denied that, at an Executive Council meeting held i Melbourne, at which four Ministers present, these regulations were first mitted. "" It is not denied that they then rejected, the four Ministers present refusing to r at i fy the d r a f t which Prime Minister had lef t before proceedof ing to Sydney. It is rather peculiar the Prime Minister himself did not wait to see the regulations passed. I have a suspicion that the right honourable gentleman, with his cleverness and foresight, anticipated considerable public objection to the regulations. 'The four Ministers lar who were left to form the Executive Counnexion cil meeting would have been in a peculiar position if they had ratified the regulaposition. tions, since all'the responsibilitv for them, and all the criticism, would have fallen upon them, while the Prime Minister would have cleverly escaped. Mr \ V . ELLIOT JOHNSON - Would he not have had to bear the responsibility for any act of his colleagues ?",36
242,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes ; but he would have had an easy answer to all criticism.. He could have said that the regulations were approved by Senator Gardiner, Senator Russell, the Minister for the Navy, and the Treasurer of that day; that he was not present, and, therefore, was not responsible. Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON - But could not evade his responsibility. ' Mr FINLAYSON - The Prime M in ister has many' a time found an easy way out of a greater difficulty.",36
243,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But it is .an elementary of responsible government that amend all the members of a Cabinet are bound future, with a by its actions.",36
244,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And another elementary principle :of responsible .governis that the Prime Minister is individually responsible for ithe collective acts of his Ministers. That being so, he could doubt have been held responsible. I have referred to this phase of the question Yet merely as presenting a. rather significant A still more significant fact is that the Minister for the Navy, who attended n - , the Executive Council in Melbourne at its which the regulations were disapproved, went on to Sydney, where, with the Governor General ^and the Prime Minister, p.m. he formed another Executive meeting, at which the regulations were approved.",36
245,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,Where did the honourable,36
246,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It ds common n knowledge. If it is not true, it remains were for the Minister for the Navy to subdeny it . What happened to the Minister were during his progress from Melbourne to Sydney, or while he was in Sydney, one the does not know; but the fact in the minds the public is that from the - time that of the Executive meeting in Melbourne at which the regulations were disapproved u n t i l the meeting"" at Sydney at which they - were approved, a remarkable change came over the attitude of the Minister for the Navy. Be that as it may, the particupoint that I desire to raise in this conis that the Governor General was - placed in a very delicate and unfortunate Four Ministers refused to r at if y a regulation, two Ministers and the Governor General approved of it . I should like to know of the Governor General was informed",36
247,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member must not discuss the Governor General.,36
248,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I should like to know if the Prime Minister was informed officially by the Minister for the Navy, at the meeting of the Executive held in Sydney, that the regulations had been disapproved in Melbourne ? The Prime M in ister was entitled to have that information, and I presume he was told it . The he other member of the Executive Council was also entitled to be told, because - it is most peculiar that four Ministers haying refused to r at if y certain regulations, two Ministers, with H is Excellency the Governor General, should subsequently have approved of them. I state quite clearly and frankly my suspicion that the Chairman of that Executive Council meeting was not informed 'of the facts of the case, otherwise I cannot believe that, as an impartial gentleman, he would have agreed to the ratification of the regulations.",36
249,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order !,37
250,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The regulations are most unfortunate. It was proposed under them to ask young men under the age of thirty-five years who presented themselves to vote at the referendum pollAre you a person to whom the proclamation of 29th September. 1916, calling upon single men under thirty-five to present themselves for enlistment applies, and have you presented yourself for enlistment accordingly or been exempted ?",37
251,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is the honourable member reading from the regulations themselves?,37
252,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , from a press the report in regard to them. In this report, the following statement is attributed to the ex-Treasurer, the honourable' member for CapricorniaTt was proposed that if any intending voter answered in the negative, or if the presiding officer had reason to believe that the person claiming to vote was a person to whom the .proclamation applied, and that he had failed to obey it, the presiding officer, before permitting him to vote, was to mark the ballot-paper with the word ""Proclamation"" (or ""Proc""). All sueh ballot-papers were to he dealt with in the manner as ballot-papers endorsed (section 9), which deals with persons, whose votes may he challenged on grounds of nationality. There was also a clause providing for the appointment of tribunals empowered to determine whether the elector had wilfully failed to comply with the proclamation, and that such wilful failure was to be deemed disloyalty. When the rumours became current as to the surprise that the Prime Minister had in store for certain electors, there' was, to my own knowledge, a suspicion in the minds of young men that this was to be the surprise. I was asked distinctly at public meetings on the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday before the poll what was likely to happen. I was north of Cairns when this information reached me, and I got tive surprise of my life, because, never, in in the wildest flights of my imagination, did I think that even this Prime Minister would resort to such a misuse of his power as to attempt to intimidate voters in the polling booths of Australia. The Prime Minister said today that the regulations had not been issued. Technically, I think, he is correct. A f t e r all, I do not think that the regulations went out officially; but the Prime Minister cannot deny that instructions were issued to the presiding officers at the polling booths to ask the question, and to take the action that I have indicated. If he dares to deny it , then I can flatly contradict him, because, to my own knowledge, the question was asked. The Prime Minister has only to apply to the Chief Electoral Officer to discover that certain ballot papers were returned marked "" P r o c , "" as required by tliese regulations. I was interviewed by individuals in Cairns on polling day, and in Brisbane during the following week, by men who were asked the question. I quote a letter from the Sydney Sun, in which Herbert Graves, of 123 Arthurstreet, Surry Hills, wroteAccording to the daily papers the Prime Minister has denied that any instruction had been issued to electoral officials with reference to the votes of single men. If you would grant space, perhaps my experience at the pollingbooth will be of some interest to your readers. At about ten minutes past 8 on Saturday morning, among other questions, I was asked the following by the poll clerks at Surry Hills booth :-Are you married or single? Have you been called up? Are you between 18 and 35 years? On receiving and filling in my ballot paper I was about to place it in the box, when one of the poll clerks stopped me. I was then told my vote would have to go into an envelope. I declined to hand up my vote, and asked that the chief official should be sent for: After some delay the chief officer arrived, and said to the poll clerks, "" You need not trouble about that. That instruction has been cancelled."" "" That can be duplicated all over Australia. It is, therefore, idle for the Prime Minister to try to persuade the House that the regulations were not approved, issued, or acted upon. Everybody knows that the wires were held up while 9,000 telegrams were sent out to 9.000 Deputy Returning Officers, and that subsequently, when three Ministers resigned, and the Prime Minister had thereby an indication of the probable state of public feeling in the matter, 9,000 further telegrams had to be sent out withdrawing the instruction. These were too late, and I am told that at Longreach, in your own electorate, Mr . Speaker, it was late in the afternoon before the Presiding Officer got his, and the questions were being asked of voters practically the whole day long. If the Leader of the Liberal party is content to take the assurance of the Prime Minister that the regulation was not issued, is he content to take our contradiction to the effect that the instructions were issued and acted npon ? If he is as sincere as he professes to be, he should follow up his statement today that the whole thing was a mistake, and refuse to approve of such regulations, by voting against the Government, and particularly against a Prime Minister who would sanction. them. In the early stages of the campaign the Prime Minister distinctly stated the exemptions that would be granted. The first exemptions were absolute in regard to only sons, and in regard to any single man who was the sole support of dependants, while. of families that had already given volunteers, the remaining members up to one-half of the family were not to be called upon. But as the campaign proceeded, and the Prime M in ister began to realise how he would have to scratch and scrape for votes to get through, it was remarkable how almost every day the press contained an addition to the list of exemptions. I gathered them here, north, and south. There were exemptions in every direction, and explanations almost every day by the Prime Minister as to what those exemptions meant, until finally the list wound up by a promise by the Prime Minister that every man necessary to carry on the rural in dustries of the country would be granted exemption, at any rate for the period of the harvest. At the rate the Prime M in ister was granting exemptions I began to wonder where he was going to get any men at all, but his purpose was not to guarantee the reaping of the harvest but to influence votes, and he succeeded very well. The exemptions promised for the cereal, f r u it , sugar, and other rura dustries affected a number of people. I have here a letter from a gentleman at Gympie, in the Lilley electorate, informing me that at one polling booth in the electorate-Montville , in ' the Blackall Range-12 9 voted "" Yes , "" and one voted "" No.""",37
253,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That was one sensible electorate, anyway.",38
254,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Probably Minister did not get there, otherwise the same result Would have happened there after his speech as happened at Cessnock. In the Montville district, when the Exemption Court came to sit, there were forty-four applications for exemption. These people were willing to vote "" Yes."" The Prime Minister hoped by promising exemptions to secure their votes, and it was quite evident that the promise of exemptions did have that effect. In this case he secured the votes of forty-four who were willing to compel other people to go away, while anxious that their own businesses should not suffer during the process.",38
255,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They were only temporary exemptions, anyway.",38
256,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Nobod y was led away by the character of those exemptions. Everybody knew they were only a sprat to catch a mackerel, and that once the "" Yes "" vote had been secured, the exemption question would be easily forgotten, especially when we remember how easily the Prime Minister changed his mind on the question of conscription. Only a few months after he had declared liimself unalterably opposed to anything in the nature of conscription, he told us that circumstances had induced him to change his mind. Probably the Bill passed, by Parliament gave the Prime Minister all the encouragement he required to tamper with the electoral law. It was a most serious interference with the electoral law, and abrogated all the provisions in our electoral system to secure that only enrolled citizens should vote. On 14th September I said, speaking on the second reading of the Bill",38
257,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order ! The honourable member must not quote from a debate of this session.,38
258,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I called attention on that day to the fact that the Bill upset all our previous arrangements with regard to the right to vote. I pointed l in - out, and made no complaint of it , that we were giving votes to soldiers at the front simply because they were twenty-one years of age. and refusing it to other soldiers because they were under twenty-one. I said we were giving a vote to the people in the Northern Territory.",38
259,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is discussing a matter that has already been dealt with this session. the Mr FINLAYSON - The Act gave votes to people who were not entitled to them under our law. It deprived people of votes who were entitled to them. It introduced into our electoral law a system of which the honourable members then in opposition ' expressed tacit approval. No wonder the Prime Minister thought that, having the support of the right honourable member for Parramatta and his party in such a wide opening of the doors of the electoral law, he was safe in going further. Evidently thinking he could rely upon the assistance of the Liberal party, he was encouraged to go on with the regulation for the intimidation of voters, and he did not altogether count without his host. It is very evident that he still has the support of the Liberal party, even for this regulation, which, had' it been introduced at any other tinie, or in any other circumstances, would have been denounced by the Liberal party in this chamber as one of the most atrocious things ever perpetrated on a.community.",38
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,We never heard of it in Western Australia.,39
261,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"H a d this thing been done by the Liberal party, had it been done hy the right honourable member for Swan, no man in this country would have denounced him more vigorously and effectively than the Prime Minister himself. He would have been the man that we would have stood behind assisting, cheering, and congratulating on what he would have been saying because of what the righ t honourable member had done. We had a taste at an earlier stage of the session of what we were to expect. The Prime Minister, when introducing the Referendum Bill , said that it did not matter what honourable members said, or how long they talked, the poll would be taken on the 28th; and when the Leader of the Opposition said, ""Suppose the Bill is not passed?"" the right honourable gentleman replied, "" That won't matter; the poll will be taken on the 28th."" We have now come to a dangerous crisis in .Australian political history. In a thoughtless moment, we passed the War Precautions Act. It was pointed out by some honourable members . how unlimited was the scope that that measure gave to the Government-tba t it practically handed over the whole control of the country to two men. I have heard the Prime Minister - say, and every one knows it is true, that the man who holds the military power rules the country. Under such an Act , with a man like the Prime Minister, and a Minister of Defence hand in glove with him, the country is ruled, not by Parliament, but by dictators; not by laws, but by regulations; not by reason, but by hysterics; not in the interests of the people, but in the in terests of individuals.",39
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Y o u never thought of that last session.,39
263,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Parkes was not here.,39
264,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was, and I said that again and again, but you took no notice of it .",39
265,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member could not'have had his ears open, because I fancy I made myself rather obnoxious to the Prime Minister because of my opposition to the measure. The Prime Minister is reported to have said that a Daylight Saving Bill would be a good thing for Australia, and it ought to be a Federal law, and that he was going to introduce the system by regulation under the War Precautions Act . Even the British House of Commons did not bring in* a measure of the kind by regulation, although they have an Act corresponding to our W a r Precautions 'Act. JNow, however, in this country neither Parliament nor honourable members are of any account; the Prime Minister is the "" great I a m , "" with none other beside him. I am just reminded that, in regard to the nse of the word "" An z a c "" the British House of Commons introduced a Bill , whereas the Australian Prime M in ister used the powers of the W a r Precautions Act . Do honourable members who are supporting the honourable member for Parramatta realise - what this is leading to ? No doubt, it is a revival of the old Tory idea that there are only a few people' who know what is the right thing to do-that the common people have only to obey. What did the Prime Minister tell the people in Sydney? He said, "" We are doomed men "" ; and those words are' applicable to Parliament; we are like sheep before the butcher. We may bleat and squeal, but it will avail us nothing.",39
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member does frequently make me wonder what we are coming to.,39
267,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wonder, too, seeing that Parliament has been entirely superseded.",39

279,Mr FINLAYSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , but detrimental to the Prime Minister. been an intense disappointment to many of us, and particularly to myself, that a man of whom we were all so proud, and whose services and ability we so much admired should have conTe to such a stage in his political career that those who believe in government of the - people by the people for the people are now unable to follow him.

I believe that the Prime Minister, with knowledge and of deliberwiring ate and set purpose, tried to intimidate voters. I believe that he did intimidate Monday. some.

303,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is not my intention to take up much time, but circumstances that arose this afternoon j u s t if y the few Avords I intend to say. The Prime M in ister has been attacked, and doubtless he would have had more to'say on his own behalf had he followed the precedent already set by some of his former colleagues, and committed the very grave and very serious act of divulging proceedings of the Executive Council. I wish to make a few remarks on that aspect of the question. This afternoon 'the honourable member for Flinders read to the House the oath of a Privy Councillor of England. The oath of an Australian Executive Councillor is very much the same. It is as follows:I , A.B., being chosen and admitted of His Majesty's Executive Council in the Commonwealth of Australia, do swear that I will to .the best qf my judgment at. all times when thereto required, freely give my counsel and advice, to the Governor General or officer administering the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia for the time being, for the good management of the public affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia; that I will not directly or indirectly reveal such matters as shall be debated in Council and committed to my secrecy, but that I will be in all things a true and faithful councillor. So help me God ! That is the oath taken by a member of the Executive Council of . the Commonwealth of Australia. Every one of us who has taken office has had to take that oath. It is clear and emphatic that a member of rthe Executive Council cannot directly or indirectly reveal what takes place at a meeting of the Executive Council, what is committed to his secrecy.",42
304,Mr WEST,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not if it is act?,42
305,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; he cannot under that oath reveal what takes place directly or indirectly. From what has transpired in this House this afternoon, it would appear that that oath has not been observed. There is one honourable member who was a Minister of State in the last Administration, and who, according to his own statement, and, indeed, according to the motion before the House, was present at the Executive Council when a certain document was submitted to it . The three copies of that document in the possession of the Executive Council bore upon them the word "" Secret."" I clearly and distinctly covered by the terms of the oathThat I will not directly or indirectly reveal such matters as shall be debated in Council and committed to my secrecy. It was a special document marked as secret, and we know that its contents have been revealed. What is the position from the legal and constitutional point of view?",42
306,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And the moral point of view, too.",42
307,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The moral point of view must also be considered. This afternoon the honourable member for Flinders gave the opinion of a constitutional writer dealing, as he would naturally do, with the constitutional point of view. But from the stricter legal point of view the position of an Australian Executive Councillor has been determined by our own Courts of law. In the case Regina v. Tooth, heard before Mr Justice ""Lutwyche, in the Supreme Court of Queensland, the question was put to the M in ister for Lands in Court in the course of the t r i a l Can you say whether, as Minister for Lands, you laid the document before the Governor in Council ? That is the very question that arises here. The document to which I have referred was, we are told, laid before the Commonwealth Executive Council. In the case to which I am referring, the Attorney-General objected to the question on the ground that it was contrary to public policy that any disclosure should be made of what took place before an Executive Council, the members of which are sworn to secrecy. The opinion was expressed by doing a wrong the Supreme Court JudgeIt seems to me that it would be very dangerous to allow a Minister of the Crown to give evidence of this kind. It would be contrary to the interests of the public, and, as the Attorney-General has contended, against publio policy that such evidence should be given. If it is necessary to show that notice was given to the Governor in Council, there are other methods of showing it, one or two of which I might easily suggest. But the question is whether a Minister of the Crown shall be at liberty tp disclose, without the permission of the Governor, something that took place in Council between the Governor and his Ministers; and if I ' was to rule that the evidence was admissible in this case, I should open a door which I do not think would be very easily closed again. It therefore seems to me that I ought to reject this evidence, and decide that t therefore was the question cannot be put. It is as clear as it possibly can be that the ex-Ministers have committed a very serious blunder in revealing what took place at that meeting of the Executive.",42
308,Mr BURNS,MOTION OF WANT OF,What about thÂ© statement of the Prime Minister as to how the Minister! of External Affairs voted in Cabinet ?,43
309,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not dealing with that matter, but, as a rule, the doings of Cabinet also are kept secret. I am dealing with the proceedings of the Executive Council, the one secret Council of the realm, and the disclosure in this case is contrary to the oath of office, and is undoubtedly one of the most, dangerous practices that could possibly arise in the administration of public affairs. If we once destroy the principle of confidence between Ministers of the Crown, we shake the foundation of our government. There could then be no confidential communication, and only one or two members of a Cabinet could be intrusted with secrets. An important result of this debate has been to reveal that certain honourable members did not appreciate the duties of the high office they held. I do not think that this debate on the duties and responsibilities of a constitutional officer will do any harm, nor do I believe that the launching of this amendment will cast much discredit on those against whom it is directed.",43
310,Mr WEST,MOTION OF WANT OF,In a true Democracy there is no pledge of secrecy.,43
311,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I presume that, before this incident happened, those gentlemen who now occupy the cross Opposition benches called themselves true Democrats, and we bave seen what can happen in a true Democracy.",43
312,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Pawkner) [8.28] - I rise to enter my protest against the action oF the Prime Minister during the recent campaign in issuing the regulation which is the subject of the amendment moved by the Leader of the party of which 1I have the honour to be a member. At the outset of the campaign, I recognised, as no doubt the majority of members on this side of the House did, that the members of that section of the community who favoured the "" No "" cause would be faced with many difficulties in placing their case before the people. We were subjected to very many restrictions, the majority of which, I believe, were placed upon us by the Prime Minister, or by his order. The same limitations applied to the outside organizations who were participating . in the campaign in advocacy of the negative .vote. I and many others came to the conclusion that the action of the Prime Minister in issuing that regulation was the action of a desperate man, who, in his desperation, became absolutely unscrupulous, and determined by any means to obtain a victory for the cause he was advocating. A statement has been made by the honourable member for Capricornia that this regulation was passed at a meeting of the Executive Council, and from the Prime Minister came a denial that the regulation was passed or put intooperation. From the information supplied to the House today, it is quite evident that the regulation was issued, even though there be a doubt as to whether it bad been adopted at a meeting of the Executive. If this regulation had not. been passed at a meeting of the Executive, then we charge the Prime Minister with having instructed the Chief /Electoral Officer to put into operation a regulation that had not received the sanction of the Executive. I am of opinion that the Prime Minister, having failed to obtain the assent of the Executive officers in Melbourne to the issue of the regulation, called another Executive meeting in Sydney, where the regulation was agreed to.. The Prime Minister then sent his instructions to Mr Oldham, who issued the regulation to a large number of presidingofficers throughout the Commonwealth. At a later stage in the evening, the resignations of some of his colleagues reached "" the Prime Minister like a bolt from theblue. Recognising the seriousness of the position, he immediately sent out an instruction to cancel the regulation, but before that notice of cancellation was received by the Chief Electoral Officer, the regulation had been issued to a largenumber of presiding officers. The Leader of the Liberal party stated, in his opening remark today, that it was quite evident that the Prime Minister had made a mistake, and he was not prepared to have his vote on this amendment regarded as an endorsement of the action of the Prime Minister. He wished the people tounderstand that, in recording his vote - against the amendment, his object wassimply to maintain the Government in power so that they might proceed with the business announced to the House yesterday. He is not prepared to take responsibility for the action of the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Flindersmade no reference whatever to the issuing of the regulations. He said not a. wor.d eitlier in defence or condemnation, of the Prime Minister's action in regard bo them, confining hiscriticism to what he termed the divulging' of the secret defending him. businessof the Executive Council hy the honourable member for Capricornia. It is now. only the members of this party that have criticised the Prime Minister's attempt bo violate the sacredness of the ballotthe box. The honourable member for Darling bers sitting by me. Downs confined' his remarks to what should be theconduct of ex-members of an Executive Council in regard to the business conducted by it . He followed on. the same lines as the Leader of the Liberal party and the honourable memAustralia, ber for Plinders. Not one of them had the courage to say a word in defence of the action of. the Prime Minister. Even the right honourable gentleman, when dressing the House, did not say aword Australian Labour party. in his own defence, and those on whom he depends for political existence have said a word in defence of his conduct.",43
313,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Prime Minister denies having done what he is accused of having done.,44
314,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then the Chief Electoral Oflicer should be sacked.,44
315,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable memof ber for Plinders tried to cloud the by a dramatic indictment of the honorpoliev, able member for Capricornia. That was his method of defending the Prime ister's violation of the ballot-box, and interference with'an electoral system that the Democracy of this country has been building up for years. The action of the honourable member for Flinders today only consistent with his previous political aotion. No man has challenged the honourable member for Flinders for his Conlight. servative politics more than has the Prime Minister time and again. I remember him saying of the honourable member, "" This gentleman posing as a fearless, critic, who crawls at the heels of his party Whenever the bell rings."" To-day, the honourable member is crawling at the heels of the man who has indicted him time and again on the floor of the House. When the Prime Minister wassitting i opposition to the Cook Government, he said of. the honourable member for Flinders I say, that if the. honoraible and' learned gentleman goes down now"" into his political, grave, upon his gravestone there must be graven this epitaph : - "" For the people he did' nothing but make speeches; but' for the plutocrats-he did everythingthat<was=in his power."" Yet today, when-the Prime Minister tries to deal a blow at the rights of: the electors, we find, the honourable member for Flinders Mr BAMFORD :-Thing s are different",44
316,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If they are changed, f a u l t does not lie with honourable memA few moments ago I heard, some gentlemen sitting on the Ministerial benches, who at one time considered it an honour and privilege to be sent into this Parliament as representatives of the working-class movement of sneering at the method under which the Labour party from its inception has conducted its business, and sneering at the word "" Caucus."" They repuaddiate the Caucus. They are no longer an They say, "" We are the National party; we have not no Caucus meetings; every member is free to do as he likes."" That is their proclamation to the people as the result of their meeting held in another p a r t of this building. I h the early days of the Federal Parliament, when a Government, lost its position because one of its followers refused to recognise anything in the form a coalition with a party whose policy issue was what he termed a machine-made who attacked him because he dared to - say that the members of the MinLabour movement bad not their freehis dom, and that the policy of the Labour p a r ty was a machine-made policy ? The present Prime Minister did. Yet today he' is in exactly the same position as that is occupied by the Leader of the Liberal party fifteen or sixteen years ago.  Mr HANNAN' - The Leader of the Liberal party did not see the light until the Labour movement brought him from the bowels of the earth, where he worked as a miner, and put him in a public position. It was the same with the Prime 0 Minister. W it h the exception of two honourable members, neither of whom is the. n Prime Minister, no member of: the Ministerial party, and no member of the j>ar.ty to which I belong, would have entered public life,, or had the opportunity of displaying any ability and talents he possessed, but for - thefactthat there was . a Labour movement outside this House-.. enSome people say. that the Prime Minister 1 is a> man'of exceptional. talents; and. ability-,, 1 who has earned, not only an. Australian. ; reputation, but a world-wide reputation, and that he stands on a pedestal by himself, so far as public men and statesmen of the British Empire are concerned. He has been proclaimed as the greatest orator in the British Empire today..",44
317,Mr EODGERS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the honourable member himself say that the Prime Minister was the greatest product of the Labo.ur movement?,45
318,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have always been oue of the first to give credit where credit was due, and no man has given greater honour or respect to our present Prime Minister than I have. Even when I recognised that it was unpopular to say a word in defence of bim, I was prepared to express my opinion freely and openly, and accept the responsibility of so doing. But today the Prime Minister is at that stage when he considers that he owes nothiug further to the Labour movement. He wishes to be free. He wishes to be at liberty to give the fullest possible effect to those great talents and abilities that the world proclaims him to be endowed with - But I wish to say that it is not due to his ability that he has been put in a position where opportunity has been afforded to him to bring his talents and abilities into play. Before the Prime Minister or the right honourable member for Parramatta or the honourable member for Melbourne or any man who has represented the Labour movement in Parliament ever graced a seat in a legislative chamber, there were just as capable and honest men in the Australian industrial movement who did not have the honour conferred on them of being elected to a seat in Parliament. However, there came a day when this .movement was created, and went into the factories, the fields, and the mines, and took men from the positions they were occupying, and, because* of their abilities, sent them into Parliament, and gave them the opportunity to display them to the world. That is exactly the position in which the Prime Minister has beeu placed. If during the last twenty years he has had the opportunity of cultivating his mind and displaying his special abilities to the world, it has been because of the self-sacrifice tens of thousands of men and women throughout Australia, and because of the creation of the Labour movement with which, he has no longer any desire to be connected.",45
319,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is the honourable gentleman to connect all this talk with the question before the Chair ?,45
320,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"J u s t as that movement fought in days gone by to put the Postmaster-General in the position he occupies today, so it had to fight to break down the system of privilege applying to elections in the past, in order that the rights of the humblest electors on the day of. election would be as sacred as those of the richest individuals in the land. It is because of that fight ' that the Labour party takes such strong exception to the action of the Prime Minister in connection with the matter dealt with by the amendment.",45
321,Mr BOYD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Was not the secrecy of the ballot in existence before the Labour party was born ?,45
322,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Democracy has fought at all times for the secrecy of the ballot, and particularly has the movement with which we are connected fought strenuously for all adults of this country to record their votes at State and Federal elections. Recognising the sacrifices that have been made in the past to win these rights, the Labour party is determined that what has been won so hardly shall not be lost to the Democracy of the country if it can help it . We recognised that we were to have a very difficult fight in connection with the referendum. To-day I listened with interest to the honourable member for Indi when he read a copy cf the manifesto issued by General Birdwood to each Australian soldier on Salisbury Plains or in France. General Birdwood made special reference to the magnificent manifesto sent by the Prime Minister to the front, and which he, no doubt, hoped would appeal to the patriotism of the Australian soldiers there. I recognise all these influences which the right honourable gentleman had working on his sifle with a view to bringing his campaign to a victorious conclusion. I also heard on the Friday night immediately preceding the polling day that arrangements had been made with all the editors throughout of Australia to reserve special space in their columns in anticipation of the ANZAC vote coming through in time to permit of it being published in the Saturday morning's newspapers. The ANZAC vote came through.",45
323,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who is the honourable member's authority?,46
324,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The ANZAC vote came through. Ha d it been a "" Yes "" vote, it would have appeared in every journal in Australia on the morning of polling day, and it would' have been proclaimed from the housetops as an endorsement of the Prime Minister's policy. The ANZAC vote came through, but it was not a "" Yes "" vote.",46
325,Mr BOYD,MOTION OF WANT OF,How does the honourable member know ?,46
326,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It would have been a perfectly proper thing for the Prime Minister to have published the result of the ANZAC vote to the world immediately it was known. But it was a most improper thing, on receipt of it , to at once pass a regulation under the War Precautions Act making it an offence for any newspaper to publish it . Later, at some public function in this State, the Prime Minister affirmed that, taking into consideration all the forces that had been arrayed agaiust it , the ' ' Yes ' ' side had every reason to be proud of the magnificent result attained. "" All the forces operating against them."" Why , a ' representative of one of the Collins-street dailies attended a meeting which I addressed during the course of the campaign. He reported what I said. It may have been important, or on the other hand, it may not have been. A few days later I met him, and he said, "" I am rather sorry that the report which I took of your meeting on Sunday did not get past the military censor.""",46
327,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,It must have been pretty hot.,46
328,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was a statement which was based on facts. I am not accustomed to make statements which I cannot prove. What were the forces arrayed against the Prime Minister? He had every daily newspaper in Australia on his side, with the exception of one in Adelaide and another in Tasmania.",46
329,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,There was one at Ballarat.,46
330,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If we . include the Ballarat newspaper amongst the Prime Minister's opponents, we must also take into consideration the 5,000 or 6,000 provincial journals which advocated' his side of this question. But the fact that official figures supplied to the press were not permitted .to appear, speeches made by public men on the "" No "" side were suppressed, and, to make success doubly - sure, a day or two prior to the polling, the Prime Minister threatened that certain electors on going to the polling booths would receive the shock of their lives. A little later, Senator Gardiner made the public pronouncement that, so far as the military authorities were concerned, there would be no interference with civilians at the polling booths. Then the Prime Minister called his Executive together. It s members refused to pass the regulations that he desired them to approve. He then called another meeting of the Executive in Sydney, at which those regulations were passed. Yet we have been told by the Prime Minister today that the regulations were never passed, and were never issued, although printed copies of them have been put into the hands of members of this House. As a matter of fact, the whole of the telegraph lines throughout the Commonwealth were cleared for the purpose of permitting the Chief Electoral Officer to send out those regulations to the 9,000 presiding officers throughout Australia. On top of all this, we witnessed today the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Darling Downs, and other Liberals, bursting with indignation at the action of the honourable member for Capricornia in disclosing the business transacted at an Executive meeting, whilst refusing to utter a word of condemnation of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman went to the country with a policy for compulsory n r ' it a r y service overseas, and the people of Australia turned it down. The majority of our party have, from the inception of this war, favoured the policy which was put into operation by the late Government. When he returned from the country he recognised that as Prime Minister of Australia he no longer held the confidence of the movement in New South Wales which was responsible for his political existence. He no longer holds the confidence of the people of his electorate, nor the confidence of the party which put him into the position of Prime Minister. But today, rejected by'his electorate, rejected by the movement of which he is a member, re-' remains jected 'by his own party and the people of Australia, he has the presumption to carry ou as Prime Minister of the Comabout monwealth.",46

He accepted the majority vote of our party on that occasion. So long as the system in operation conferred him certain honours and privileges he nation of Mr Hughes? considered it perfectly fair.

If the honourable member cannot find stronger facts to support or defend his leader, I would ask him not to stoop to such_ practices, although I make f u allowance for his enthusiasm - in his keep leader's cause. No person was authorized to move the motion, which came sponkeep taneously from the honourable member for Brisbane, and was seconded by myself. Personally, it gave me no pleasure to that action. I have always recognised saidthe ability shown by our late leader m the past just as the members of the Liberal party in past years swore by the ship of the Hon . Alfred Deakin, and members of the State party time and ister again in State Parliaments here have sworn by their leader. Yet the time rives when, in the interests of the party a leader must be removed. It may beago come a painful duty to some men to that view into practice, but it has to be Flindersdone sooner or later, and I am one of those who have come to the conclusion it a speech. that our party can be better served by a leader who, if he is not so brilliant in some respects, might be a little more honest.",48
353,Mr WATT,MOTION OF WANT OF,A little!,48
354,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"P r o b a b l y the honourable member for Balaclava, as an old leader, knows what is required in a leader. I have not been the leader of any political party, but probably he knows from past experience that, a littl e honesty is all that is required. I have trusted up to a certain stage the late leader of our party. As a follower of his I gave him every possible assistance in side and outside the House, and never apologized for supporting him with my voice and vote. When I had no further confidence in him, I thought there was only one thing to be done, not to attack him behind his back, but to tell him exthe actly what I thought of him as a leader, that, in my opinion, he was no longer me fit to lead the Labour movement in this Parliament. I must make a brief reference to the two or three gentlemen who today supported the Prime Minister and to his attitude on the matter under debate. n I am glad in a way that the Prime M in -' ister derives such great satisfaction from new supporters, although, so far , he does not show any particular satisfaction on his face. I believe he is accepting support only because of necessity, it is just as well to know his opinion of the majority of those who are supporting him. It is also as well to know his opinion of those gentlemen who had not the courage today to say a word in his l l defence, but who are still prepared to him in office - Speaker after speaker today among those who are prepared to him in power said not a word in defence of his action in issuing the regulations. In regard to the honourable memtake ber for Flinders, the Prime Minister The honourable member poses as a reformer. leaderHe is a man who sees the light. the I thought when I heard the Prime M in speak at the Town H all on his return from the Old World that this was a arnew phrase which he had struck there, but it seems that he used it two years on the floor of this House when dealput ing with the honourable member for Democracy asks him for a reform. He gives Plutocracy asks him for a law, and he gives it a Coercion Act. On another occasion, the Prime Minister dealt with the Industrial Workers of the World, an organization out of which he made so much political capital during the recent campaign. He has had a legal training. Only yesterday, a reference was made on the floor of this chamber to the coal strike, but the reference was ruled out of order by the Chair because the coal strike was sub judice. Because of that, he considered it would not be proper for any reference to be made to the matter on the floor of the House. During the recent campaign, several men in our community were standing their trial, with the possibility, to some of them, of the death penalty, and the Prime Minister, in his desire to obtain votes for the cause he was advocating, went on the public platform throughout Australia and denounced those men, whose fate was practically hanging in the balance. This is a most unusual procedure, not only in this country, but in any other part of the British Empire. These men may or may not be guilty of all the charges made against them; I am not in a position to say what the verdict may be, but I think it was a most improper thing for a man in the position of the F'rime Minister to go about practically condemning and sentencing them before a jury had had an opportunity to decide on the evidence.",48
355,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter further, because it is outside the motion.",49
356,Mr HANNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I merely mention these cases in order to introduce a quotation from a speech delivered by the Prime Minister in this House in reference to the honourable member for Plinders. Prime Minister on that occasion saidThe honourable and learned gentleman opposite calmly tells us that for years unionism has been getting more political, its objective being syndicalism. That is like saying that for years the people have been getting more Christian, in profession and practice, their objective being Hell. I wish that I could apply that to my honourable friends opposite, wishing them a rapid journey and God speed. The honourable member's party, which only two years ago the Prime M in ister was consigning to a political hell, is composed of the only men today in this House who dare to rise and take exception to the motion launched by the members of this party. men do not take exception to the motion on the ground that the Prime Minister was justified in his action, but do so only under cover of condemning the honourable member for Capricornia. I have no apology to offer for supporting the motion. So far as I am concerned, I have no f u r ther confidence in the Government. If we do not defeat the Government on this motion, I hope and trust that the day is not far distant when we shall defeat them on some other. The Government no longer represent the Labour movement in Australia; and I shall not be satisfied until the destinies of this country are again in the hands of the representatives of the recognised Labour movement.",49

During the referendum campaign I 'refrained from personal abuse of any one of different views from myself.

I assured my hearers that I did not believe the rumour-that I thought it impossible for any Labour Government or Ministers to issue such a regulation. In any case, I urged the people to go to the ballot-box, and record their votes, no matter what the consequences might be.

362,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable memwhether ber must not follow that line of argument.,50
363,Mr RILEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Is the Prime Minister to be believed, or is the ex-Treasurer - believed 1 I believe the ex-Treasurer, cause he has documents to show that effort was made to pass regulations in Melbourne. I do not believe that the Minister for the Navy is such a jelly-fish of a man that he would refuse in Melhonorable bourne to sign regulations, and then, at the dictation of the Prime Minister, go Svdney and give his consent. I take i therefore, that the Minister for the Navy is trying to shield the Prime Minister keeping quiet-that he is sacrificing himself to save the Prime Minister. On the ing of the referendum, about 8 o'clock, one of the divisions of my electorate,' asked the presiding officer whether Be putting the questions as prescribed under the regulations, and he told me that, previous night, at 9 o'clock, he had ceived his instruction to put them. told him that the Prime Minister had withdrawn them, and he said, "" I have nothing to do with that; I have to put the questions."" When I saw the Chief Returning Officer of the district, told me that he had given orders for the questions to be put, but that he had gone round and cancelled them. At up Hills, a man, on coming out of the booth, uo told me that the questions had been put him , I having previously told him that be they would not be put. I took him back into the booth, and acquainted the .presidonly ing officer with what the man had told",50

365,Mr RILEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , I had. In reply me, the Returning Officer said he had given instructions that the questions were not to be put, and, when we went to the officer who was said to have put them, he r - said he had done so, and that he had been I told to do so. Thereupon the Returning Officer said that he must have overlooked this officer when he cancelled the instrucand that in any case the questions must not be put again. In the face of all these facts, I believe that the Prime M in ister issued these regulations. I have no wish to do the Prime Minister any in jusbut the facts I have related make me believe that these instructions were issued. The Postmaster-General is at the table, and he can in for m the House 9,000 telegrams, sending out the instructions, and 9,000 cancelling them, were received by his Department. The to be honourable gentleman has an opportunity beto make a name for himself by saying p,n whether this was so or not. When the Prime Minister yesterday asked the M in ister for the Navy to move the adjournment of the debate on the motion of the member for Yarra, it occurred to me that it was his intention.to obtain to proof from Mr Oldham that the orders t , complained of were never given. I was confident that he would have the evidence, by but today he has presented no statement from Mr Oldham, because he could not mornget such a statement. Yet we have men in in this House whitewashing the GoI vernment in connection with this matter, was and though they may save tliem on this occasion, I tell them that it is as sure as the that I am standing here today that they rewill find themselves against the GovernI ment on some early occasion.",50

372,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Melbourne) [9.39] Beiug of small stature, it gives me pleasure to address the House from so high a position, and especially in view of the fact that I speak in straight-out opposition to a man who has forgotten his promises, and has broken the pledges he gave to those who created him. To-day he does not dare to face his electors. We can all forgive any man for changing his opinion, and there is no man who can more keenly discriminate in such a matter than the present Prime Minister. I have in my hand a book entitled The Case for Labour, It is not the picture which was shown of a coffin in which a certain person was burying Labour. The. strong hand of: Labour reversed tha suggestion of that picture, and buried the man who was knocking up the case. At page 111 of The Case for Lubouv I find this paragraphI do not. for a moment deny a man's right to changehis opinion. I only deny his right to break, his word solemnly given to his fellowcitizens. IF he find's, after election, that he can no longer conscientiously support those measures towhicli he is pledged, his course is. quite clear. Let hdmâ before such measures are put to the test, resign his seat,, and,, if he chooses, contest the electorate upon his changed opinions.. If returned, he can with honour do that which he desires, but he cannot and ought not to be allowed to do this until the people to whom he pledged himself have formally and constitutionally ratified his change of front. That was written by Willia m Morris \Eughes, then a member of this Parliament, and now, by the connivance of a man in high authority, Prime Minister of Australia. Does any man possessing common sense think for a moment that what is referred to in the motion of the honourable member for Yarra did not occur ? I challenge honourable members on the Treasury bench to tell the truth in this matter. Can they deny that men and women were prevented from voting because of the issue of the regulations referred to, or can they deny the scandalous threat that the young men ' "" would get the surprise of their life "" ? How dare the Prime Minister or any other man insult his fellow-citizens in that way. I have had some experience of infringements of the ballot system. I have had experience of violations of the franchise, and of the pollution of the ballot-box. I have known a ballot-box to be stolen from 9 o'clock at night until 8 o'clock on the following morning. I have known what it is to have a majority in my favour declared as a minority. I have known of other interferences with the ballot. When Senator Findley was standing for the State Parliament for the electorate of East Melbourne some Liberals at that time brought cameras with which they took photographs of every working man who came up to the poll. Do honourable members care to know what became of those cameras?  member smashed a lot of them.",51

375,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We are informed that there was a properly constituted Executive Council meeting, held in Melbourne, and attended by - Senator the Hon. Albert Gardiner, Vice-President of the Executive Council; the H o n . J . A . Jensen, Minister for the N a v y ; the H o n . W . G. Higgs, Treasurer; and Senator the Hon. E . J . Russell, Honorary Minister. The Executive Council thus constituted refused to sign or endorse the suggested regulations, which had been handed to the Treasurer by the highest officer in the torney-General's Department. But for that refusal the 'regulations would have been issued. Two days later, on 27th October, at an Executive Council meeting held in Sydney, and attended by the Governor General, the Minister for the Navy, and the Prime Minister, the regulations were assented to. The Prime M in ister has stated that the regulations were not issued, but neither he nor the Postmaster-General has stated that they were not signed, nor that telegrams were sent to the Presiding Officers. I was in Tasmania at the time, and I know that such telegrams were sent out, and I saw an officer in khaki in the principal polling booth in Launceston. A promise had been made by the Prime Minister that no soldier in uniform would be allowed to appear on the platform in support of either the "" No "" or the "" Yes "" cause. But I saw officers in uniform on the platforms in Tasmania. I telegraphed to the M in ister for Defence on the subject, and the answer was the usual evasion. I shall furthe r pursue this matter later. I wish to know whether the Governor General, of whom I have spoken in the highest respect at public meetings, was informed by the Prime Minister that these regulations had already been rejected at a meeting of the Executive Council two days earlier. If he was not so informed, I fear the word "" deception"" is applicable to his treatment by the Prime Minister. But if he was informed of what had already taken place, and, despite his experience, decided that he and two Ministers could constitute at r in i ty to govern Australia and interfere with the secrecy of the ^ballot-box, I can only regret that the gentleman had not such experience in England",51
376,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order ! The honour the able member must not discuss the action of the Governor General.,52
377,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I should known that all the actions of that gentlethe man are beyond criticism; but I , know also that every citizen in the community has the sacred right of petition to the K in g, and that he may go above this Parliament and Governors, or Governor General, and carry his appeal to the veryThrone itself. And , if necessary, I will advise my fellow citizens to exercise theirright of appeal to the K in g from even the highest man in our land. The Bill At - of Rights of 1869 declared that "" It is. the right of subjects to petition the K in g , and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal."" What is meant by "" commitments "" and "" prosecutions "" may be explained by the honourable member for Plinders and the honourable member for Darling Downs. In passing, I may remind the House that, by thirty-six votes to twenty the Legislative Assembly of Queensland has passed a Bill by which no solicitor who takes fees from monopolies, combines, or alien companies will be permitted to enter the Parliament of that State. The Bill has already received the imprimatur of the Legislative Assembly, but it has not yet received the approval of the House of fossils. If , however, an appeal is made to the citizens on that question, we know what will happen. Colonial Regulation No. 214 statesPetitions addressed to the King or the King in Council . . . must in like manner he sent to the Governor for transmission to the: Secretary of State. In like manner means unsealed and in triplicate, and the Governor must send a report with it . No direct petition would receive consideration. That right of petitionbeing clear, I will advise my fellow citizens that there is a higher authority than even this Parliament if they are blocked in their endeavours to get justice. The recent referendum was possibly the first attempt to interfere with State rights. Some weeks ago I asked the Prime Minister if the referendum vote would be decided by a majority of the whole of the votes combined or a majority of such votes in a majority of States. The answer was that the issue would be determined by the majority of votes in the Commonwealth. I wish to know what honourable members who represent Tasmania,"" Western Australia, and South Australia will do if that principle is have further carried into effect. There are in two branches of the Legislature. I l l representatives of the people, and on a population basis New South Wales, that distinguished State that carries the flag - of Democracy higher than any other State, would have forty-two members; Victoria, thirty-two members; Queensland, fifteen members; South Australia, ten members; Western Australia, seven members; and Tasmania, four members. 'That may come, and if it does, honourable members will recollect that the Prime Minister established the precedent for it . If it should happen that human life were represented in proportion to numbers, how would the smaller States, and Western Australia in particular, stand ? S t ill more infamous is it that the officer in charge of the Electoral Department of the Commonwealth should have been required by the Prime Minister to interfere with the secrecy of the ballot. The honourable member for Denison will agree with me that, when dealing with some very difficult matters, we found the Chief Electoral Officer a man who was honest in every sense of the word. It should be his duty merely to see that the law is carried out, and he should be subject only to Parliament. Regulations should not be .submitted to him at twenty-four hours' notice at the whim of any Minister. His .should be the sacred duty of keeping the ballot clean, and preventing it fro m being smirched and made filthy, even at the command of the Prime Minister. It seems to me that the Chief Electoral Officer was asked to do what his heart and conscience could not approve. I intend to try to persuade the House, after the amendment is dealt with, to put that oflicer in a position to say, "" I care not for any Minister; I care only for Parliament, which has entrusted to me the carrying out of the l a w . "" Just as a Judge cannot be interfered with by a Minister, so should the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth be free from Ministerial interference.",52
378,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Would that be a safe rule to apply in all cases?,53
379,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It would be safer than to lean on the prophecies of the honourable member. The Prime Minister has broken his promises repeatedly. Of that I can give proofs. I have not trusted him since Mr J. C. Watson came in to power. Whenever I have asked for a pledge from a Labour Government, I 'have asked it from Mr Fisher; I would not take the word of the present Prime Minister. On one occasion, when a Defence Bill was being considered, I asked for an undertaking concerning it , and the present Prime Minister said, "" I am the Minister in charge of the Bill ; will you not accept my word regarding it ? "" I replied, """" No. You, once led me into a Serbonian bog of blackness, and left me there."" Thereupon he brought in Mr . Fisher, who gave me the promise that I desired. When Mr Watson came into power, with many more followers than the present Minister has",53
380,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not better men.,53
381,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes ; better men, and men who were more loyal to the electors. Mr Fisher, Senator MCGregor, Mr Batchelor, and Mr Hughes, who - were Ministers, came to the Executive of the State of Victoria, and said, "" Gentlemen, New South Wales has passed a certain resolution, and we wish you to do likewise, giving protection to any member who may leave the Reid or Deakin party, and support the Watson Government. We wish you to promise that such men shall not have to fight Labour candidates' for re-election."" We thought that we Were being asked to fal l into line with New South Wales in this matter, and therefore did what we were asked. There followed absolute secrecy for three days. But we had been fooled. We thought that, being a Minister, the honourable member for West Sydney would not deceiveus. But he went to Sydney, and he told the New South Wales Executive, "" The Victorian Executive has passed this resolution. We wish you to pass a similar resolution protecting Reidites and Deakinites who may support the Labour Government."" Honourable members perhaps will be glad to hear that the people of New South Wales either knew the right honourable gentleman too well or were better Democrats than we are, and refused to pass the resolution. Ten days later we foundthat we had been lied to, deceived, and dishonoured, and every one of us resigned as a protest. That was the first occasion on which I had doubts regarding - the Prime Minister, and I would not now believe him unless he furnished proof, even tnough he might swear on a pile of Bibles. Do not we know that he risked the lives of men, women, and children travelling through the Suez Canal by giving out that he would go to England by the Orsova, and that, instead of doing so, he lef t the train by which he was thought to be travelling to Melbourne, returned to Sydney, took a launch out to the American mail steamer, the change of routÂ© being kept secret by the censoring of newspapers until he had got to Honolulu or some other distant Then, on his return,.he came by a troopship. Every one knows that no hospital ship carrying wounded soldiers can be fired at under international law, and I do not believe that the Germans, as they have been, would have fired at a troopship carrying wounded severely injured that they could not be patched up, who were being sent 12,000 miles away from the front. Mr Hughes broke the rules of international Had the Germans got to know of his movements, as they got to know of the movements of Lord Kitchener to our very great regret, they would have sunk the vessel by which he travelled. not he, like the Premier of Queensland ancl other men, take the ordinary Why did he let the whole world believe that he was'going to England via the Suez Canal, when he was really going via America ? And then we have the honourable member for Flinders. Will any one forget the theatrical way in which he tossed aside some papers that he had asked permission to see? I that they should be cleaned before being returned to the honourable member for Capricornia, ""and, therefore, dusted them. What is the honourable gentleman's record? He interfered with the Victorian franchise. a magistrate who sat upon the Bench, not a policeman who arrested a criminal, not a member of the railway s t a f f , not any public servant, was allowed by him to nave tlieir full citizen rights; even the criminal, after serving his sentence, was given fuller rights of citizenship than the magistrate who had sentenced him, or the policeman who had arrested him. The honourable member also the most infamous Coercion Bill that was ever passed. Tf you met together in a party, or assembled to help the wives and children of men out on strike, you could, under it, be put into prison. The honourable member starved the old men and women of Victoria by reducing the pension vote from Â£238,000 to Â£150,000. Yet he had the audacity to say that he drafted the first Old-age Pensions Bill for Victoria. That statement was as true as the statement that the Prime Minister was going to England via the Suez Dr Moloney. One of the greatest jurists of the United States of America has said that for the place? betrayer of a country or a great cause you had not far to look; you can find him in a barrister or a lawyer ready made. The Leader of the Government is a barrister. I believe that he came out here dastardly pledged to the Conservatives of England to bring in conscription as a men so lever to compel South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, and India to adopt it . He came out here pledged to carry conscription or to break up the law. Labour party. I have heard before of # the .smashing up of the Labour party. That was going to happen ten years ago. If the Prime Minister followed the opin- * ion expressed in his book, he would resign Why did his seat; and there is a bookmaker outside who would give a hundred to one that he risks? would lose his deposit in seeking re-election.",53
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I would take that.,54
383,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am sorry that thÂ© right honourable member is not submitting this amendment, because a Ministry formed by him, and including the honthought orable members for Swan, Parkes, and a bit Angas, would be an honest Government that would not interfere in the slightest with the purity of the ballot-box. I draw the attention of the right honourable member for Parramatta to the fact that the Prime Minister, though he says that he Not did not issue the regulations, did not say that they were not signed. Greater than the rights of any individual are the rights of the people at the ballot-box, which these regulations were entrenching upon. When I visited America the people there thanked me, as an Australian, for the example Australia had set by establishing the secrecy of the ballot box; and even England, where it is introduced most difficult for any one to get a vote, and where the franchise is the worse of any European country, has thanked Australia for the secrecy of the ballot, having copied our legislation in this respect. The greatest credit Australia gets from those beyond its shores is that which is given because we were the first to insist on.the secrecy of the ballot. Y et today we find our Prime Minister in a back country town threatening that when certain young men went to the poll they would have the surprise of their lives. If he dared to say that to their faces, they Canal. would take him by the nape of the neck and hurl him as fa r as they could. would not dare to say it to their faces, and what he would not dare to say as one individual to another, he had no right to say as Prime Minister. Seventeen or eighteen daily newspapers in Great Britain were prepared to take up and make any man that our Prime Minister would point out. Was it not whispered so loudly that any one could hear that the Premier of Queensland could have been made one of the biggest men in the world if he would only bow down to Baal. But he was too honest, and he said straight out, as the Labour party had said from their platform, that voluntary enlistment had never been given a fair chance. Why has not the Prime Minister accepted the suggestion of the Premier of Queensland and given more money to those who are enlisting? This is a letter that I have receivedPerham Downs, Salisbury Plain, England, Sir,- I take the liberty of writing these few lines to you, knowing that you always uphold fair play and justice. Evidently the Australian public are not aware of lots of facts concerning their boys over here, more especially those who have been wounded or invalided from France. For instance, this is one of the dirtiest and filthiest holes that convalescent men could be sent to. There are men here who should be in hospital, some with running wounds and a veritable host of diseases, all grouped together in huts or, to be more explicit, hovels; and there are some in tents which are not even rainproof.",54

The letter proceedsEighty per cent, have severe colds, and if they attend the doctors' parade they get no attention whatever. As for the food conditions, well, pigs are thought more of than men are here, and it is very seldom that a man gets a square meal a day. In fact, the conditions are a disgrace to the military heads who have control here. Also, there are men here in what are called "" staff jobs,"" who have never been to the front, while on the other hand, men who are unfit for active service are hustled back to their training battalions, and drafted back to the front quick-and-lively. We very seldom squeak, but the conditions all round are simply rotten, and it is time the responsible people in Australia were enlightened a bit. If things continue as they are there will be trouble of some sort, and prob[335 ] He ably an outbreak of disease of some kind or other. We are out to fight the good fight, and we recognise that a soldier's life is a hard one in all respects; but give us a fair deal is aU we ask; and surely, for convalescent men some comfort should be available in this country, of all countries in the world. Those of us who are fit do not complain, but it is for those who are not so that we appeal to you to take up this matter and right it. All this is Gospel facts, and not exaggerated by any means, and can be substantiated by all who are here and have been here. Trusting you will exert your influence to that end, we remain, &c.. The statements made in that communication are substantiated by a letter which was shown to me by a man occupying a very high position in this city, in which the writer saysThis is the worse, dirtiest, and most filthy place a Government could fix upon.

Eighty per cent, of the men were coughing and spitting all over the ground. Diseases will kill more men than the Germans. 9th October, 1916. If the soldiers have not been robbed of their rights of citizenship, how is it that the Prime Minister insists that the result of their voting shall not be made known to their fellow-Australians ? Would the Germans be aided, in any way if they knew how Tom Brown in the trenches voted, or is the Prime Minister's reluctance to publish the result of the soldiers' vote due to the fact that tricks were practised in connection with that vote? We know that there were no scrutineers employed in France. We know, too, that when an organization here endeavoured to send a cablegram with a view to getting .men to see fair play in the camps where there were 40,000 citizens who had a right to vote it was not allowed to do so. Could a dictator have done more than that? How dare the Prime Minister in terfere with the exercise of the franchise? It is not his right to do so, and I challenge him to resign his' seat and appeal to his constituents in West Sydney. They would promptly give him their judgment upon his conduct. Only a few weeks ago three men named Hughes were looming large on the horizon of the world. There was Colonel Hughes, of Canada. Where is he now ? He has resigned his position, and has passed out of the limelight. There was another Hughes> who contested the Presidency of the United States. He did not win.",55
386,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,He lost by only a few votes.,55
387,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"To lose by only a few votes was a very different matter from winning by some hundreds of thousands, as he anticipated. Then there is another Hughes, who was the head of a Government, and who went before a certain high official and tendered his resignation. In such circumstances the practice isfor the Leader of the Opposition to be sent for. He is the gentleman who should have been requested to form a new Government. Surely when the honest men go out of a Cabinet",56

389,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"S u r e l y in the circumstances the Leader of the Opposition should have been called upon to form a new Administration. This is the first time during my political career, extending over a period of twenty-seven years, that I have known of the head of a party with only thirteen followers being intrusted with the task of forming a new Cabinet. In similar circumstances I am satisfied that in England that course would not have been followed. I would rather give the Opposition in this Chamber a fair trial than support men who have gone back on their promises and upon those who made them politically. I challenge the Prime Minister to do what a man ought to do, namely, resign his seat and appeal to the judgment of his constituency. Every boy in the street knows what the electors of West Sydney would do in such circumstances. During the recent referendum campaign, one infamous statement was made which was not allowed to be corrected. An Australian soldier who has not only won the Victoria Cross, but also the clasp, was made use of - I will not say by the Prime Minister; but by some occult process-in an attempt to defeat the anticonscriptionists. I refeT to Lieutenant Jacka, whose father has answered the lying press in the following sworn declarationI , Nathaniel Jacka, of Wedderburn, State of Victoria, labourer, solemnly cerely declare as follows :(1) That I am the father of Lieutenant Albert America. Jacka, V . C , of Lieutenant William Jacka, and of Private Sidney Jacka. (2) That I have received several letters from my sons, Lieutenant Albert Jncka, V . C , and Lieutenant William Jacka, who are in France. Theyhave never complained of the want of reinforcements. On the other hand, they have stated that the conditions in France are much better than in Gallipoli, as they are more frequently relieved. Lieutenant Albert Jacka, V . C , in one letter, said that while out of the trenches they almost forget the rattle of the guns, and "" we have plenty of f u n . "" Never in any letter have any of my sons supported conscription, and in my belief they are still opposed to it . My wife and daughter are working against conscription, believing, as I do, that we should keep free the land for which our sons went out freely to fight. (3) That I have read what appears to be a letter to the Argus of today from Reg. W . Turnbull, of Linda Cottage, Wedderburn. I have lived in Wedderburn for about thirty years, and know all the people in and around the to'wn. There is no such person as Reg. W. Turnbull living in Wedderburn. I know each and every Turnbull living in the whole district. The only Turnbull in Wedderburn is Walter Turnbull, a butcher, who is childless. I believe the letter said to have been received by Reg. W . Turnbull to be a fabrication made for the purpose of improperly influencing votes in favour of conscription. And I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of an Act of the Parliament of Victoria rendering persons making a false declaration punishable for wilful and corrupt perjury. Declared at Melbourne, in the State of Victoria, this 27th day of October, 1916. If there was ever a thing that could be stamped with the stigma of infamy it was the letter reputed to have been received from Lieutenant Jacka. Lieutenant Jacka has not only won the Victoria Cross, but has the honour of putting a clasp across it-a n honour whichj I believe, 'the late Lord Roberts himself did not enjoy. The printing offices were forbidden to send out copies of this affidavit; the newspapers were prevented from publishing it ; and all this was done by one man. Is there a coarse enough word which parliamentary usage will permit to describe the action of the Prime Minister in connection with his departure from Australia, and the danger to which he subjected men, women, and children travelling by a certain vessel by allowing it to be understood that he would be a passenger by that vessel ?

A f t e r returning from England this right honourable gentleman, who used to talk on the "" stump "" or speak from a box in the streets of Sydney, dined and wined with the Lord Mayors of Melbourne and Sydney.

On the occasion of two of the meetings which he' addressed there privileged people were allowed to sneak in by means of doors under the gallery while citizens were waiting outside. The m a in doors were never opened. Let the Prime Minister attend the Lord Mayor's banquets-let him go and booze there when the hotels are closed! Let him go back to the Conservative lords and ladies of England. The Liberal party there, in the choice words of the Bulletin, spewed him out, and the Radicals would have nothing to do with him. He came back here and actually inveigled myself and others into speaking at the town. hall. Because I told the people at-that meeting that Democracy was better than Autocracy, I was given a very brief report in the papers. Let the Prime Minister go back to England ! Let him go back to his Conservative press and to his Conservative friends. The greatest enemies that the workers .of England have had are the Conservatives, who have never extended the franchise to or helped the workers in any way. To-day Great Britain , with a population of 45,000,000, has only three [335]- 2 times the number of voters that we have in the Commonwealth. I have only to say in conclusion that we know what wil l be the - result of this division. There are in the Government men with whom we have worked in the past. The parting of the ways has come, and I am sorry. One member of the Government has made in this House the statement that he will never come here except as an avowed member of the Labour party, so that I presume that when this Parliament is dissolved he will come back no more. I honour the honourable member for Denison too highly to believe that his pledged word, as reported in Hansard, will not be kept. If it is kept we shall lose him , and I shall be sorry, but my regrets will, not be as keen a3 were those I experienced when he took up his present position. We have sitting on the Government side of the House today only thirteen out of what was the strongest party in Australia. What has wrecked these men ? Nothing but the overweening ambition of one man who went to England and was spoilt, there. Upon his return he sought the assistance of various legislative and municipal councillors, and l e ft the Democracy that he had appealed to in the past. Warren Hastings and others were i m peached in England for doing less than he has done. I accuse him of having attempted to destroy the free franchise of. this country. I accuse him of tampering with the Electoral Act by providing that electors should be asked questions in the polling booths for which no provision was made in that Act. I accuse h im of having tried to controvert the power of the highest individual in the land so as to secure the object he had in view. At the last moment, perhaps, he drew back. When the history of these times is written, he will perhaps not appear in the position he is in now. I remember how years ago he misled us in the Political Labour Council of Victoria. He fooled Mr Fisher, the late Mr Batchelor, and another Minister, bringing them up to our Trades H all and telling them and us that Sydney had passed a resolution to grant immunity at .the polls to any Liberals who supported the Watson Government in our fight against Mr Deakin and Mr Reid. He asked us to keep quiet for a little time, and we did. Seeing the company he was in , we never dreamt that he was deceiving us. I free the memory of those old members who have joined the great majority of any suspicion of complicity in what I am now accusing the Prime Minister of. He asked for three days' silence, and toddled over to Sydney,. but he did not tell the people there what he told us. He told them that we had agreed to this course in Melbourne, and asked the Sydney body to pass a similar resolution, but they would not do it . Perhaps they knew him too well to trust him. We found how we had been lied to and dishonoured, and ten of us resigned as a protest. Possibly we would not have trusted him if he had come to us alone, but we thought we could trust him when  Batchelor, and Senator MCGregor.",57
394,Mr GREGORY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why did you not us this last year?,58
395,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Because the occasion did not arise. The honourable member knows there is such a thing as forgiveness. So long as the Prime Minister went straight, we supported him. I have never tried to prevent any man or woman from going straight, and so long as he stuck to the planks of the platform that he helped to formulate and agreed to, I supported him, ^recognising his great ability, but the turning point has now come. trickery of old was again exemplified by his action i u crossing the Pacific in disguise to save his carcass, and exposing to risk the life of every man, woman, and child on the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's steamer in which it had been announced that he was going. It was the same trickery that allowed him to come back in a transport carrying wounded prisoners, thus exposing them to greater danger, although I suppose no enemy would have injured that vessel knowing it was going 10,000 miles away from the seat of war.",58
396,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order 1 The honourable member is repeating himself.,58
397,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I asked the Prime Minister whether the referendum was to be decided by the majority vote of the people or by a majority vote of the people and States. He replied that it was to be decided by a majority vote of the people. This is a precedent which the smaller States ought to weigh gravely, because, if representation is to be given . to the States on the basis of population, the smaller States will have very few members. Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia, in that event, would not have six members each in the Senate.",58
398,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order ! The honourable member is again repeating himself.,58
399,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The referendum was dragged in the mud in an unworthy cause. What the reason may be, I do not know, but in the future we on this side will watch and wait with calm eyes. The Prime Minister does not loom so very large in the eyes of the press of England as he did a little while ago. That part of the English press which is Conservative, and is led by the London Times, loves and reveres only success.' I do not think the honourable gentleman will look back upon this part of his life with any satisfaction, seeing that he is parting with men who tell placed him in the position he now occupies, and without whose help he would never have risen to it . Some dear and good friends of mine remain with him on the Government side of the House. They are, I believe, misguided and misled, possibly by the personal glamour of the Prime Minister, and I fear they will live to regret it , for the time is coming when we shall have the initiative and referendum in our Constitution. We boast now of the most glorious franchise in the His world, but unless we are very careful that franchise may be injured by those who ought to defend it with their lives. If the Prime Minister likes to take Melbourne on, I shall be very glad to offer him a political fight, or, if I can arrange with the executive in Sydney, I shall be very pleased to resign and fight him in West Sydney. The evidence seems to be accumulating that he has not a ghost of a show - in either constituency. Why does he not resign and let us go to the country ? I cannot compliment the Opposition on their, attitude. Why do they not take their seats on the Ministerial side? They have the largest numbers in the House, and we have a' Ministry of only thirteen, which is commonly known as the devil's number, though I hope they will not have the devil's luck. I know they are playing a waiting game, and I shall not say more. Venerating, as I did at one time, the high abilities of the Prime Minister, I find that these abilities are too sinuous, and not to be depended upon. Whether this arises fro m the glamour cast over him in the Old Land, I do not know; but his first act cannot be called honourable- I shall not use any harsher term-coming , as he did, to our executive, and telling-us he had got the Sydney executive to agree, when he had not. When the right honourable gentleman's epitaph is written, it will not he that of a man who has bad a long political career in which honour was his only watchword. Debate (on motion by Mr HAMPSON) adjourned. Houso adjourned at 10.46 p.m.",58
