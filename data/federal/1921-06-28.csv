1,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Is the Acting Prime Minister yet able to state the date on which the next payment of Is. 3d. per bushel, in respect of last Bon's wheat, will be made)",19
2,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"I am not able to state the precise date. Authority has gone out from the Treasury to make the payment, and the moment the accounts can be presented the money will be paid. There should now be a date in sight. I will make inquiries and advise the honourable member. SUGAR FOR JAM MANUFACTURERS.",19
3,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether it is a fact that the Government intend to grant a rebate of £20 per ton on all sugar purchased by jam manufacturers from Australian stocks. If so will the difference between the price so paid and the price paid by householders have to be made up by the general body of consumers?,19
4,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The facts are not as stated in the honourable member's question. An agreement has been made that the jam manufacturers in respect of jam for export purposes only shall be allowed to import their own sugar for which they, of course, will'pay whatever happens.to be the world's market price at the time. Owing to the fact that the manufacturers have on hand large stocks of pulp, and that it would take some time to make the necessary financial arrangements, as well aB to get the sugar here, it bas been agreed that the .Government shall lend to them for the time being certain stocks of sugar, and that they shall pay for that sugar the full market price. On their exporting the jam i u which this sugar is used, however, they will be given a rebate of £20 per. ton. When they get their imported sugar they are to replace ton forton and quality for quality, whatever sugar we lend them in that' way. CUSTOMS TARIFF LEGISLATION.",19
5,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Will the Minister M. for Trade and Customs endeavour to arrange - that the proposed Bill to amend the Customs Aot shall' be introduced as speedily as possible, and carried to the second-reading stage, so' that we may have his explanation of the principles of the measure a few days before the consideration of the Tariff is concluded is Comseamittee. That would enable us to give the measure, closer examination.'. than would be possible if ihe Bill were not introduced until we had completed the consideration of the Tariff ?",19
6,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I think the honourable member refers to the Bills to whioh I have made reference more than once in the course of the Tariff debate.,19
7,Mr GBKOOBT,Unknown,That is so.,19
8,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"There will not be a Bill to amend the Custom^ .Act - When the consideration of the Tariff schedule has been concluded by - the Committee it will be necessary to introduce a Bill to which that Tariff schedule will be attached. I have takenout of that Bill everything except the machinery clauses foi the operation of the intermediate.and preferential Tariffs. We shall have also to deal with two other distinot measuresone providing - for the . creation of a Tariff Board, and the other dealing with anti-dumping, which will.include the ordinary anti-dumping legislation and special legislation in regard to the exchange position. I hope to be able to introduce these two Bills at the beginning of next week. If the House would give me permission on Tuesday next, presuming' I am ready, as I believe . I shall be, to take those two Bills up to the second-reading stage and make my explanatory speech at that stage Mr FjtiTTow - And circulate the Bills.",19
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"And have the Bills circulated, I shall be very happy to meet honourable members in that way. NA ADVANCES TO STATES.",20
10,Mr MARRS,SOLDIE RSETTLEMENT AND,"I desire to ask the Assistant Minister for Repatriation whether his attention has been' drawn to a statement in the press by Mr Lang, a member of the New South Wales Parliament, that soldier settlement, in that State has practically been closed down owing to toe want of funds from the Commonwealth. There are a number of press statementB to that effect, and I , therefore, ask the Minister to state definitely whether the Commonwealth has played the game with tha States on this question.",20
11,Mr RODGERS,SOLDIE RSETTLEMENT AND,"Question s on this very point have already been asked and answered in this House, bnt not one of them. Beems to have properly cleared the air. I therefore desire to. make to the orablo member the definite statement that die Commonwealth' is not in default to any State under the arrangement, for soldier settlement: - The Conference terms upon which the agreement was founded provided for the recoupment, by the Commonwealth, of expenditure incurred by the various States in respect of land resumption, public works, and advances to st)idiers. In addition to that, the Commonwealth has from time to time made advances to the various States to enable - diem to carry out this programme in anticipation of recoupment. ' The New South Wales Government, during the present, financial year, - has been advanced for these purposes over £2,000,000.. There is not in the Commonwealth - Treasury a certified claim from any of the States (that is unpaid. The terms of the agreement.necessitate that these claims for recoupment shall have been certified to as correct .by the responsible Minister of the Stateconcerned and by his Auditor General. All operations by the States are subject, to these conditions; and, if there be claims, in the State Treasury of New South Wales in respect, of purchases, or if then! be any .settlement not made as between the State and vendors, the responsibility does not lie with the Commonwealth until certified claims reach the Commonwealth Treasurer.

14,Mr GREGORY,SOLDIE RSETTLEMENT AND,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he haa seen in today'B Age a letter in which the following passage occurs: We ask you to give publicity to the - injustice the Government imposes on Australians by permitting foreigners to trade unrestrictedly to dyee, whilst forbidding Australians to do any business whatsoever. Is - there .a restriction upon the importahontion of dyes, and, if so, for what purpose?",20
15,Mr MASSYGREENE,SOLDIE RSETTLEMENT AND,"I think it would be well for the honourable member to. give noticeof his question, so that' I may make a full and complete statement to the House. The matter is related to a resolution of the Imperial Conference in respect of the manufacture of dyee in the Old Country, and it is a rather long story. NA GAUGES.",20
16,Mr RHEY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"Some months ago a Royal Commission, consisting of an expert from America, another from England, and a Mr Garvan, of .Sydney, wasappointed to inquire into the question of the break of railway gauge. Does the Acting Prime Minister know whether the Commission has nearly completed its work, or whether a progress report has yet been furnished? Sir JOfiEFH COOK- I have not received a progress report. I understand, the Commission is busily engaged on the inquiry, and will report in due course. When that will be I am unable to say, but I shall mate inquiries as to what is being done.

18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,I am awaiting the return to Melbourne of the Minister  who has been to Darwin to investigate - local conditions. As soon as I shall confer with him in order to ascertain exactly what is taking place up there.,21

20,Mr BLAKELEY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,They are not citizens of this country while they have.no representation in this Parliament.,21
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"They may not be - citizens in the same sense as we in Southern Australia are, but they are citizens none the less. I should like the honourable member to recollect that to keep these citizens going, and for other purposes connected with the development of the Territory, a very much larger amount per head is being spent upon them by us than upon a like number of citizens down here. On that ground alone, they ought to be prepared to pay* their taxes.",21
22,Mr GREGORY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"I - have received a lengthy ""telegram from Darwin, in which it is stated that an Ordinance, which has not been gazetted, is being enforced; will the Acting Prime Minister lay upon the table two 'telegrams sent by the Darwin ; Town Council in regard to the representation of that body?",21

26,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"The answers to - the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Section 19 of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911 provides that ""the affairs of the Bank shall be subject to inspection and audit by the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth."" 8. The Governor of the Bank. I am not aware of - the methods he adopts in making his selection. 3. The Governor of the Bank. 4.

28,Mr BURCHELL,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether the Commonwealth Government pays any sum to the State Government as ' sustenan'oe for old-age"" pensioners resident in the Old Men's Home at Claremont, Western Australia? 2. If so, what amount is' paid on behalfof each pensioner? 3. What amount of the pension"" is paid to the pensioners resident in such institutions?. *. Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Government is saving money out of the old-age pensioners who are residing in State institutions (Cs compared with the amount which' would the paid df pensioners were living privately? 5. Will the Government take action to insure the pensioners receiving the ful l amount to make up ISs. per week, after allowing for the amount paid to the State Government? ",22
29,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. .The amount of.pension; but not exceeding 10». Cd. per week. 3. The pension is cancelled, and a special pension of 2s. per week is granted t'o the inmate under section 31 (2) of the Invalid and Old age Pensions Aet. 4. The Commonwealth is not "" saving money "" out of pensioners who become inmates of asylums, because there is no statutory autho- - rity for the payment to the asylum for the pensioner's maintenance. The law provides that a pensioner becoming an inmate of an asylum shall receive a pension of 2s. per week; but there is no provision for payment to the institution for his maintenance. This payment is made solely as an act of grace. 5. This matter is under consideration. Any change which may be decided upon, however, is more likely to be in the direction of increasing the amount paid tq the institutions than to the pensioner. NAURU AND OCEAN ISLAND '' --- - .

32,Mr MAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Whether the services of Mr David Lahey, of Laheys Limited, have been retained at Canungra by the Commonwealth authorities; if so, in what capacity and at what remuneration? 2. Is Mr David Lahey still engaged in the 'service df the Commonwealth authorities; if so, what is the term of his engagement? 3. Is Mr David Lahey not a member of the private milling firm known as Brisbane Timbers Limited? 4. What steps were taken by the Commonwealth ^authorities, prior to the purchases, to prove the amount of timber alleged to be - standing on the properties purchased from J. F. Brett, at Blackbutt? 5. Are many logs intended for the Canungra mill now lying at skids in the bush deteriorating as the result of weather, borers, &c. ? 6. Will a considerable area of freehold land at Canungra upon which the Commonwealth has purchased timber rights revert to the former owners after a given period; if so, what is the period, and if the period expires before all the timber is removed, what compensation will be made to the Commonwealth for the timber still standing?",22
33,Mr RODGERS,ROYAL COMMISSION ON RAILWA Y,"The answers to the : honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. and 2. Yes, as manager of the Canungra mill and. adjoining property pending arrangements for the permanent working of the mills. In this latter regard public tenders were recently called, but these proved unsuitable to the Commission. As further provision had, in consequence, to' be made for the temporary working of the mills until definite and satisfactory arrangements were' completed for their permanent working, the services of Mr Lahey were retained at a remuneration of £50 a month. The period of engagement expires on 30th June, 1921. . It should also be mentioned that an officer of"" the War Service Homes Commission is also resident at the Canungra mill. ' 3. Yes 4. Estimates and valuations of the timber available were made - prior to purchase.. The attention of the honourable member is also invited to the further report on the purchase df timber mills and areas in Queensland presented by the Parliamentary (Joint) Committee of Public Accounts after full inquiry into the matter. 5. Since milling operations ceased at Canungra logs felled in the bush have been delivered at skids along, the tram line.. These logs can suffer no further depreciation at skids than in the mill yards, and will be immediately available when operations are resumed without the expense of further haulage having in the meantime been incurred. 0. Laheys Limited have the option of purchase of 10,407 acres of freehold lands. The option may be exercised not earlier than shown below:-4,01 1 acres 2 roods 13 perches, 1st November, 1924; 4,012 acres 0 roods 30 perches, 1st November, 1928; 2,383 acres 2 roods 26 perches, 1st November, 1934. Total, 10,407 acres 1 rood 29 perches. The periods in which the Commission have power to rwnove the timber from the respective areas is considered more than sufficient for the purpose. A copy of the basis of the agreement _ with Messrs. Laheys Limited was recently laid on the table of the House, from which will be readily ascertainable full particulars as to the purehase. NA",22

35,Mr BAMFORD,PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES,"the Postmaster General, jupon noticeIn view of the fact that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has, through the Taxation Department, collected a tax upon all prizes in what; are known as Tattersall'sConsultations, and, further, has appointed the management of what is known as Tattersall's as agent-for the collection of the said tax, thus apparently stultifying section 57 .of the Post and Telegraph Act in its aim to minimize what. has been described as the gambling instinct ef the people, - and as it appears by the continued popularity of the said consultations that the section is to all intents and purposes a dead letter, will the Postmaster-General' take such action as may be necessary to amend the section, and thus remove the restrictions now imposed under the said section, thereby considerably increasing the revenues of the Postal Department ? « Mr Wise - No .

37,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter) [ 3 ^ 2 ] On Thursday we agreed to increase the duty on undressed timber in sizes of 12 inches x 6 inches from Is. to 4s., but the Minister (Mr Greene) now proposes to increase the duty on undressed timber in sizes of 7 inches x 2J inches and upwards, and less than 12 inches x 6 inches only from 3s. to 4s. 6d., whereas if the proportion were maintained in accordance with the previous increase the duty would be 12s. f have received telegrams from those who are engaged in the timber industry and secretaries of labour leagues and other bodies, pointing out that three-fourths of the mills in my electorate are idle, and that there is very little hope of their working until they are given a satisfactory Tariff.",25
38,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,The mills are merely closed for the winter months.,25
39,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We all know the reasons for the closing of these mills. I am simply pointing out whab has .occurred, and I want to know, whether the Minister considers that the increase he proposes on this smaller size of timber is in fair proportion to the increase agreed upon by the Committee last week.",25
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"(Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.24] - Thes e are fixed and not ad valorem duties, and the difference between them bears relation to the various stages of manufacture. Presuming the base is right, all we require to do is to raise the duty as we pass along from one stage of manufacture to another. When we looked into this matter we found that the difference between Is. and 3s. under the old Tariff represented rather more in the way of protection than was required for the partis oular progressive stage of manufacture. Therefore, in suggesting this increase, we have fixed upon 6d. less than the difference shown. That is to say, instead for Trade and Customs) [3.32] of making the increase 2s. we are making it Is. 6d. The proposed duty is slightly higher than the present rate, but is portionately lower than the increase agreed to on the rougher timber last week.",25
41,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dampier) [3.27] There is not the slightest doubt that this increase will add considerably to the cost of building homes and do a great deal of in j u ry to the country. I cannot conceive how it can be argued that oregon can come into competition with our hardwoods. The person who wants hardwoods will use them. If oregon or other softwood timber is required, it will be used. These increased duties on timber will press very heavily on the Broken Hill mines. Apparently the only object the Government have in view is to secure additional revenue. The increase cannot be justified on any other ground.",25
42,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"South Sydney) [3.2S] As there is a go=d deal of waste in cutting up a log, I would like to know if sufficient allowance has been made to the millers to balance that less? 1",25
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,The protection given is ample for this stage of manufacture.,25
44,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I would like to know if the Minister. (Mr Greene) has consulted expert millers about the matter? They have assured me that there is a big difference between the capacity of a log and the output of the m ill. I want to see as much local labour used as possible. Seeing that there is so much waste in logs, perhaps it would be as well for us to allow them tp come in free of duty.",25
45,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wakefield) [3.30] - I trust that the Minister (Mr . Greene) can tell us why so much timber is sawn in bond in New South Wales? This practice has some distinct advantages, and it is not a new one, for it has been in operation for many years. I wish to know why it does not apply in all the States. Will the Minister also tell us something about the enormous combines which are controlling the Australian timber trade to the detriment of the public ? I have heard a good deal about this matter since we adjourned last week, and from what I gather, they are the most injurious combines, from a publio point of view, in any of the industries in Australia. - Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister - There is no reason why the practice alluded to by the honourable member is not followed in proevery State, except, I presume, that the sawmillers have not taken the necessary action or asked - for the necessary arrangements to be made.",25
46,Mr RICHAHD FOSTEE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"And , presumably it does not pay them, or they would.",26
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We may presume so. There is nothing to prevent exactly the same arrangements being carried out in all the States, and duty paid on the sawn or dressed timber actually sent out, plus a certain percentage- I think 30 per cent. I speak from recollection, and subject to correction, for I have not had an opportunity to consult my officers.",26
48,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,I am told that there is no percentage.,26
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not quite clear on the point, for just at the moment there is no departmental officer here. Later on, however, I shall tell the Committee exactly what the position is. As to the second matter referred to, my feeling is that, taking the sawmillers by and large, throughout the country, there are no combines, but when the timber gets into the hands of the city merchants",26
50,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The combines operate before that. . Mr MASSYGREENE - I am inclined to think that then there may be combines. I have no certain information on either point; but comparing, as I have had the opportunity of doing, the list of prices at the mills at which the timber is sold to the distributers in the city with the prices charged tb the public, I am inclined to think that the balance is with the distributers in the city, and not the other way.",26
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,The prices for* distribution to the people are in many cases arranged before the timber leaves the mills.,26
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not know whether that is' so or not ; but I do know there is a big disparity, and to me an inexplicable disparity, between the prices at which the miller in the country sells to the city merchant, and the price at which the city merchant sells to the public. There may be good reason for that disparity, but it is a very remarkable one.",26
53,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does the Minister know that it costs as much to actually deliver bread as j t does to grow the wheat and produce the bread ?,26
54,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am willing to admit that one of the greatest economic problems is the cost of distribution. If any man could devise a scheme acceptable to the community, under which that cost could be reduced by one-half, the world would proclaim him a statesman.",26
55,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Kalgoorlie). [ 3 . 3 6 ] - I should like a word of explanation on one or two points. When we were considering the previous sub-item we were in favour of imr&ediate protection, but not in favour of the duties proposed in the amendment of the Minister (Mr Greene). Since then I have had an opportunity to consider the amendment now proposed, and I think - that a compromise could have been ' effected on the previous item with a duty ""of 3s. in each column, which would have shown a fair comparison. In regard to the dressing of timber in bond, has the Minister's advisers informed him as to what is the percentage allowed for waste? The Minister spoke of 30 per cent., and I think there is something wrong, about --that.",26
56,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 3 . 3 8 ] - I was wrong in regard to that percentage. I have since had an opportunity to consult my officers,, and I find that importers are allowed to take the timber into bond, there saw it , and then pay duty on the actual amount of sawn and dressed tim ber sent out. But the difference between the amount which they take into bond and the amount which they clear must not be less than a certain percentage of the amount which they take in . Suppose, for example, that 1,000 feet of timber be taken into bond, and in the sawing or dressing of that there is a loss of 25 per cent - I do not know the actual percentage-then , presuming the percentage which the Department allows for waste to be 20 per cent., and that the importers send out 75 per cent, or 750 feet of the 1,000 feet, they will be charged duty on 800 feet, and not on 750 feet.",26
57,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Is the duty paid that which is applicable to timber in the log, or that applicable to sawn timber? - Mr MASSYGREENE - I thought I had made the matter quite clear. They pay the duty on the particular class of timber that has been imported.",26
58,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is it not a fact that if they sawed Australian timber they would lose nothing?,26
59,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Suppos e that timber is brought in undressed n.e.i., i h sizes .12 inches by 6 inches, or it3 equivalent.",26
60,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If it comes in as a log, utilization the duty is 5 per cent, or 10 per cent., as our the case may be.",27
61,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then , say that is a quantity of 20,000 feet.",27
62,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Would they be square or round? If they are round, the waste for is very much greater.",27
63,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Log s are usually We round.,27
64,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"But the Committee is irregular, dealing with square timber at this many moment.",27
65,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The case has been present put to me, "" Suppose the timber consists portion position of logs."" The round logs are brought and the duty is 5 per cent. If the importers saw those logs in bond, duty is isWestern paid on the resulting timber at the rate tities which rules for logs of the class of timber concerned. But the amount of timber on supplies which the duty is paid' must not be lesshaving regard to the total superficial greater measurement of the log--tha n the perGovernment centage allowed by the Department for out sawing.",27
66,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,The person who saws pipes his timber in bond gets a concession upon that timber in regard to the waste. that not the position?,27
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes . The man who. does his sawing in bond is, so far as can see, "" on a better wicket"" than man who does not. However, the same opportunities are open to every individual who imports timber.",27
68,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,He may have a bond at his own mill.,27
69,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Yes ; we declare a miller's yard a bond.,27
70,Mr STORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Boothby) [3.45] - The duty having been raised upon large sized oregon, there must be a proportionate crease in regard to the smaller sizes. The proposal of the Minister (Mr: Greene) is very fair. I desire quote a statement in support of a contention previously advanced by self, namely, that, even where it has found that Australian timber could be used instead of oregon, supplies of local product could not be-or , at rate, have not been-delivered . The lowing is from the manager of the Austhat tralian Wood Pipe Company, Melwas bourne, and is addressed to myself:In your speech during the debate on on imported timbers, mention was made of Oregon for the manufacture of products. Mention was also made of the difficulties experienced by purchasers of Australian hardwood in obtaining deliveries of there timber under contract. You may be interested to learn that after careful research and experimental work we adopted certain Western Australian hardwood the manufacture of certain of our products in 1918, and contracts were placed for very cbnsiderable quantities of timber in that State. are sorry to say, however, that deliveries of timber under these contracts have been so and quantities sent from time to time so far below our requirements, that on occasions our factories, both in New South Wales and in this State, have been closed down through lack of supplies. Our is. that, except for a very small of our output, we have had to resume in, the use of oregon timber for our work. We might add that, while oregon generally of greater utility for our work than the Australian timber, much larger quanof the latter could .have been used by this company had we been able to obtain regular of adequate quantity. You will appreciate, therefore, that further increases of duty on imported Oregon entail considerably cost for pipes, and-consequently greater expenditure in connection with the various important waterworks being carried by the various Governments and municipalities in this country, and for which wood stave are to a very great extent, utilized. At the same time, we are also labouring under the disabilities mentioned in endeavouring to Is use Western Australian hardwood. My purpose in making the quotation is, if possible, to induce Australian sawI millers to make greater efforts to meet the the local demand for local timbers.",27
71,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) [3.48] - It is amusing to listen to the honourable member for' Boothby (Mr. Story) and to note .the facts underlying his quotation. In 1918, certain parties in this State went to Western Australia Ifor their timber requirements; but the Western Australian saw-millers couldi not fulfil their contracts. I point out, in the infirst place, that the men who required the timber approached the Western Austrato lian millers, not ""because they patriotically preferred .the Australian wood, but my- - because they could not get imported been timber. It was war time, and shipping was not available, either to bring timber the from the West or from overseas. The any honourable member for Boothby regards folthe Minister's offer as fair. I contend it is useless - Australian hardwood used 'by Australians-during the war, not to encourage Australian industry, but duties because no other timber was available. of the Now that the war has ended, imported timber can be secured again, and tbese same .people bave no use for t i e local product. Australian mills are being closed down. I desire also to make a quotation. It is from the A of the Pacific Coast Lumbeiman. From British Columbia alone, in 1919, we i m ported 8,515,600 super, feet; but in 1920 we imported from British Columbia no less than 32,218,155 super, feet; or nearly four times more than was brought in here in the previous years. means that the mills brought into operation here in 1919 must close down if we are to continue to use imported timber. MT . RICHAHD FOSTER - They will have to go out if they do not reduce their prioes.",27
72,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They will be forced Out if we use imported timber. If Australian timber was good enough for us in 1919, it should be good enough for us in 1921. We know what we axe doing in asking for higher duties. My object is to compel builders to use Australian instead of imported timber, and every man who is Australian at heart should take up the same attitude. I marvel at the plausible arguments used by some in opposition to our Australian hardwoods. I ask the. Minister (Mr Greene) to increase the duty which he has offered; he should be able to obtain a majority in support of a higher duty. I expected to hear the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams), and a few more representatives of the fruit-growing districts howling for lower duties in respect of this item. H a d they done so, I should have had something to sayi in regard to the price at which the fruit-growers get their sugar supplies. It is strange that some honourable members are prepared to accept with-open arms everything that will help the interests of the electorates they represent, while they oppose every attempt made to assist other sections of the community. The Minister, to my mind, has taken up a. very weak stand on this question. I admit that he has offeied something approaching what we ought to have in . respect of this sub-item, but I intend to move that the duties be in creased to 7s. 6d. per 100 super, feet in respect of the British and intermediate Tariffs, and 10s. per 100 super, feet under the general Tariff. That should be the irreducible minimum.",28
73,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Why not make statement it 17s. 6d. per 100 super, feet?",28
74,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,I would move to that effect if I thought I had a chance of cajrying such a duty.,28
75,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,And let the p r i l issue workers live in tents.,28
76,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,O r bark humpys.,28
77,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am pleased that even at this late stage, some honourable members seem, to have been converted to a due regard for the interests of the workers, and I hope that their conversion That will be complete. I am afraid, however, that, like their loyalty, it is largely a matter of mere l i p talk. In every other country proper atten^ tion has been paid to the timber industry. Several European countries have gone in for reafforestation, realizing that the timber industry is a key industry, and that adequate timber supplies are absolutely essential. Here we have hardly started to scratch the ground in connection with reafforestation. We should increase these duties, and show the State Governments, together with the Commonwealth Government, that reafforestation is absolutely necessary, so that we may make full use of our. own timbers. There are some honourable members who would put every item on the free list, and I am waiting to hear what they will have to say in regard to my proposed increase. I ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment temporarily in order that I may move that to which I have just referred.",28
78,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I withdraw it temporarily if the honourable member will agree to a vote being taken ab once. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Mr ' MATHEWS - V e r y well. I move That the item be further amended by adding to sub-item (G) the following:-""And on and after 2Sth June, 1921, per 1.00 super, feet, British, 7s. 6d.; intermediate, 7s. 6d.: general, 10s.""' Will the Minister accept my amendment ?",28
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,No ; I am not prepared to go any higher than I have indicated.,28
80,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I l l a w a r r a ) 3.56] - I am sorry that the Minister Mr Greene) did not make, before we went to a division on an earlier sub-item last week, his statement with regard to the mystery that exists as to the difference between the prices that the producer obtains and what the builder .of houses has toi pay. It is quite evident from his that no increase of duty that we Gan put on here is going to help the saw-miller, who today .is able to produce timber at a price immensely lower than that at which the consumer has to purchase it . It emphasizes again the futility of the high increases of which we .approved the other day, and, still further, the futility of the amendment we are now discussing, as a means of setting going once more the saw-mills in the electorate of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton). I - think that honourable member is paying rather too much atteution to the unemployed in the saw-mills. He is overlooking the fact that for one man who is unemployed in the sawmills today there are many unemployed in the building trades, and that every shilling we add to the cost of the raw material of the builder is going, not only to throw out more men in the building trades, but. as it does so, to throw more and more saw-millers out of employment. We have focussed our attention too much upon the fact that at present there are mauy saw-mills unemployed, aud have failed to look for the reason. We ar© assuming that the reason is something that can be cured by a higher duty, whereas the fact is altogether the reverse. It may be possible to start some of these saw-mills again by reducing' the cost of timber to the consumer, but none of them will be started by any increase in cost that this Tariff may place on the product of the industry. It may be that the Tariff will not prevent the erection of houses, but if we are to accept the amendment now before us, and to add to the estimated increased costs which the Minister placed before us last week a still greater increase, it will not He possible to build a house of any size under £900 or £1,000. It will be necessary to secure still higher wages for the workers of this country before they oan afford to carry *the increased burden which this Parliament is placing upon them in the way of house rent or the cost of building. In New South Wales only houses erected some years ago are available for renting today. The unfortunate toiler who wants to start a home for himself will spend many weary week? wandering about Sydney trying to find a house to let, and then, if he turns, as many have done, to building, he will find that a house which cost £600 a while age, and which he could finance at that price, is today eosting £900, £1,000, or even more. I know people in the city of Sydney who for months have heen hunting for houses containing five or six rooms, for which they are prepared to pay £1,100 or £1,200 each, but who are unable to find them.",28
81,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does the honourable member think they would be able to get houses with greater ease if there were no duties on timber?,29
82,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They would get them for less if the price of timber was not as high as it is today. I do not say that if we took off the duties on timber they would obtain suitable houses for less, but that the imposition of these increased duties will not help them to get houses.",29
83,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If we took off the duties, would houses be cheaper?",29
84,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the duty were taken off oregon today they would get houses for less. The timber trade in our State is controlled by the men who own the forests there, and not by the merchants who sell the timber. The Minister is entirely misinformed as to the position in New South Wales if he is told that the whole question is entirely one of distribution. The evil lies really in the monopoly of the sources of supply.",29
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I know that that is not correct so far as a great part of New South Wales is concerned. The honourable member has been entirely misinformed..,29
86,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,And it is not so in Queensland.,29
87,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I quote again a fact which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chariton) has placed before us-the fact that the Government of Queensland, in respect of the timber lands owned by it, can impose a tax of £1 per 100 super, feet, which shows that some people outside the Government, in respect of the timber they hold, are taking an undue profit of £1 per 100 super, feet.",29
88,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,I did not make - that statement.,29
89,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then I beg the honourable member's pardon. After all, it does not matter who made the statement, the essential fact is that it is correct. The honourable member is unable to deny that today the Queensland Government's royalty upon the timber taken froin its own forests is in the vicinity of £1 per 100 'super, feet.",29
90,Mr COBSEB,PUBLIC SERVICE,That 'is absurd.,30
91,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It'is 15s. Mr HECTOR LAMOND.^When I stated' here last week that in respect of some classes of timber a royalty of 25s. per 100 super, feet was charged by the Queensland . Government, the honourable member for Wide {Bay (Mr Corser) said, ""No;' £1."" Now, when I say that on quantities of timber a royalty of £1 is chaTged by the Government, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. West) says that the royalty is -15s. Assuming that it is 15s. per 100 super, that shows that the people who own timber lands in Queensland, outside the control of 'the State Government, are able to impose a tax of 15s. per 100 super, feet in excess of the actual value of the timber itself.",30
92,Mr COBSEB,PUBLIC SERVICE,You can get as much timber as you want for an export duty of Is. per 100 feet.,30
93,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the New South Wales man who owns timber in Queensland desires to bring it to New South Wales, he has to pay Is - per 100 feet export duty on his own material; but I am talking of the Government royalty, and not the amount illegally charged for the transfer of timber from one State to another. I have stood on public platforms beside honourable members opposite when they denounced in the most scathing terms the iniquity of royalties charged on coal in England.' I do not know anything worse in connection with the English coal royalties than the royalty imposed on timber by the Labour Government in Queensland. But instead of hearing a denunciation of that impost by the Government upon timber in certain parts, and by private owners in other parts, of that State, we are implored to help a struggling industry by putting a further tax on the houses ef the working people. The proposed duty is not justified by any of the facts that confront us today; the existence of this monopoly is proved by every fact that has been adduced before the Committee. We are paying, approximately, twice as much as we ought to pay for the timber to be put into the houses, that the people are anxious to get but cannot get because the cost of building is too dear. We would be better employed, in trying to give cheap houses to the people instead of piling up dutieson imported, timber. I am .told that the War Service Homes Commissioner claimed that he could produce timber at half the price at which he could get it from the Combine before he started his saw-milling enterprises in. Queensland.",30
94,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE,That was in war time.,30
95,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The war. was over. It - is undeniable by anybody in the trade, be he feet, builder, carpenter, or bricklayer, that the timber employed in a house "" to- . day is a heavy item of the expenditure, and we have no right to permit a monopoly to take toll of the people in this way. I shall not support any increased duty on imported timbers, and I do not know that anything we may do by means of the Tariff will have any effect upon the unemployment in the timber-cutting trade today. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) referred to the big increase in the imports of timber during 1920. What was ""the reason for the increase? In New South Wales, twice as many houses were built in 1920 as during 1919. What has happened in the timber trade has happened also in the soft goods and every other importing trade. The importers received delivery at the end of the war of three years'- supplies which they had not expected to get while the war continued. During 1920 immense quantities of timber were delivered which the merchants would have been very glad not to have received. They naturally made contracts for supplies on the supposition that the conditions, which, according to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, explain away the case put up by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story), would continue. They could not get delivery of their orders, and so they ordered much more than they required; but delivery commenced as soon as the war was over and freights were available, and the merchants now have in their yards immense quantities of timber that they do not require for the current year. I believe that the War Service Homes Commission also has imported immense quantities of timber, that swell the figures that have been quoted today, in order to build thousands of homes that will not be built. The State Housing Board in New South Wales has been launching out in the building 'of homes, and the Victorian Savings Bank has been embarking on the same policy. The importations for the current year are below normal because the accumulated orders of previous years have been delivered and merchants are not ordering further supplies. The importers have acquired more than their ordinary stocks' and they must quit them before they oan resume importing. is to the advantage of those who pay rent that the timbers hitherto used in' house construction should be available. I have heard ho arguments that would justify me in believing that any duties imposed on imported timbers will do anything to solve the unemployment of people in the timber-cutting industry. Here is another fact to be taken into account: Australia will not continue to build houses at the same rate as in 1920. When the soldiers were returning in thousands and asking to be set up in homes, an endeavour was made to meet this abnormal demand. This Parliament launched out On"" the building of War Service Homes, involving an estimated expenditure of £30,000,000. Saw-mills were set in operation all over the country and industries were started in the expectation that that money would be expended in a very few years. The Commission has accumulated vast quantities of timber, and it would be better for the soldiers if it had not done so but had finished the houses that had been started instead of importing huge quantities of material for future construction. whole of the facts, as far as I can understand them, - show that the conditions of unemployment in the timber-cutting trade are not due to any trouble that the Tariff can cure, and any effort to remedy the disease by increasing the Tariff will merely make it worse.",30
96,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wide Bay) [ 4 . 1 3 ] have never heard a more exaggerated statement of the facts than that to which we have just listened' by. the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond). I do not say that he has w i l full y misrepresented the true state of affairs, but he has been misled. . He has complained of the existence of a huge Combine. If there is a Combine in his own Statei-and I do not deny it-h e should not reflect on other States that have no Combine. The Combine in New South Wales consists of the importers who will not support Australian production, but are clamouring for the introduction of timber from overseas. According to today's Argus, the imports of timber for the ten months ended A p r i l ; 1920, were valued at £1,996,566, as against £4,531,281 for the ten months ended A p r i l , 1921. That timber is imported mainly into States that have no sympathy with the other States which produce timIt ber. In Queensland the mills are closing down, and every timber merchant's yard is full of timber of a quality as good as that of any that is imported. Because there is a Combine of timber importers in New South Wales the honourable member for Hlawarra would support them in the outrageous action' of importing material from overseas to the amount of £4,500,000 in ten months, when we have in Australia sufficient timber for all requirements and our mills are closing down for lack of orders. The timber that is being i m ported is not as good as that produced locally. If oregon is considered superior for some special work, let it be imported for that; but to shut down our local timber industry that is of such importance to northern New South Wales and Queensland in order to suit the requirements of a Combine of importers, is an outrage. I cannot understand why such an appeal should be made to this Committee. Even the increase of d u ty proposed by the M in ister (Mr Greene) will not be sufficient to deter the Combine from importing foreign timber. The Mr HECTO B LAMOND,-The honourable member denied that there was a Combine.",31
97,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I denied' the honourable member's allegation regarding the existence of a Combine at the source of supply. The honourable member also referred to the Government charging a royalty of £1 per ton. The only royalty that, to my knowledge, is put on timber - I sent from Queensland to another State is the export charge of Is. per 100 superficial feet.",31
98,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,That shilling is i h addition to the royalty charged by the Government.,31
99,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am coming to that. I do not think that any charge should be made on timber being sent from one State to another. I do not think the Queensland Government have a right to impose an export duty. Mr HECTO B LAMOITD - Is it because , there is not enough timber in Queensnot applicable today? land, and the Government desire to keep their supplies there?",31
100,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Not - at all. I challenge any honourable member to go through Queensland and see the vast area of standing timber, and' also the enorwas mous quantities of timber ing to be sent away but for which there are no orders. Some honourable members are trying to k ill the local timber try in order to bolster up the importers. The honourable member for Illawarra is an advocate of high protection in regard to industries in his own electorate, but, because the timber industry is not i own State, he gives his sympathy to Combine of importers. In regard to the their timber requirements. royalty to which the honourable member referred, the explanation is that standing timber is generally obtained by tender. An area of scrub land is available, and tenders are invited from the different, saw-millers. Those tenders have, instances, been as high as £ 1 per 100 superficial feet, and. even more for quantities. But those amounts have - beensolely the result of competition' between saw-millers in a certain locality. The royalty used to about Is. 6d. to 2s., and I believe i not be long before it is down to that again. The only authority given to the Queensland Government was to impose a royalty in order to provide funds f o afforestation. MT . RICHABD FOSTER - They use half the proceeds of the royalty for reafforestation, and the balance is revenue.",32
101,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not approve of certain actions of the Queensland ment. What they are doing in this respect was not done by any previous Government in that State, and will not done when the present Ministers are out of office. But why should we try an industry of such importance to the State because this imposition has been made? At the present time there are every other item. many large areas of scrub land under offer to the saw-millers at a royalty which has been fixed at a small rate, but no offers can be obtained from them. That is the position in Queensland today. . Why, then, should honourable members talk of matters which, although they might have been applicable some little time ago, are The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story) has told us that in 1918 some people in South Australia were, not able to get timber from Western Australia, but that was evidently because there was no shipping available. Mr HECTOR . LAMOND - The contract made in 1918, but the goods haye not cut and waityet been delivered.",32
102,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"At any rate, in 1918 there was no shipping available to carry industimber from Western Australia to South Australia, and even if the honourable member for Boothby is correct in what he says, which I question, it is not a justification for his attempting to k ill a Queensland inn his dustry for the sake of South Australian n. importers, most of whom prefer to import When the honourable membei* wants some duty appertaining to an industry in his. own State, then we shall see him argu- ing in favour of the highest possible protection, with no memory on his part in some of what he has been saying during the laist few days. We shall not hear small him saying then, "" What about the poor man who has to utilize these things ? What about, the returned soldiers?"" He will say, "" W in e s, dried fruits, currants, salt, ought to be protected, to the h i l t , "" and be that the people of Queensland, who do not t will produce these commodities, should be figure loaded with the duty upon them. As a matter of fact, the people of that State have been very lenient in assisting the in r redustries of South Australia to get protection, but when they ask for reciprocal treatment they are met with the answer, ' ' Look at the poor unfortunate soldiers paid intowho use these things ! "" * Mr MAKIN - The honourable member for Boothby does not represent the whole of Govern the interests of South Australia.",32
103,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Of all honourable membe bers in the House, the honourable member for Boothby is the least representative of to ruin the interests of the Commonwealth.",32
104,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Because he has voted with the lionorable member for Wide Bay on,32
105,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,He has voted with me only when it suited his own electorate to do so. He has been absolutely against me on other items. I hope that the Minister will do his utmost to protect the sawn-timber trade even to a greater extent than he now proposes.,32
106,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter) [4.27] Unfortunately, there is a great deal of truth in the statement of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) that the cost of building is nearly double what it was prior to the war; but any one listening to the honourable member would come to the conclusion that this was due to the operation of the present Tariff. How often must honourable members be reminded of the fact that the price of almost everything is now nearly double what it was in pre-war time ? Let us look at the facts. This Tariff has been in operation for fifteen months, and the only duty placed on oregon during that period has been Is. per 100 super, feet. Does the honourable member for Illawarra say that that small duty was the means of doubling the cost of building ?",33
107,Mr HECTOR LOMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,No ; but it entrue abled the monopoly which the honourable member denounces to add another'Is. its already extortionate charges to the workers.,33
108,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"During the period the Tariff has been in operation the only monopoly I know of in the Australianquiry timber industry existed - among the porters, who find supporters among orable members in this House. The very specious argument is put up in this chamber that this impost of Is. per super, feet of soft wood has increased cost of - building; in fact, has almost doubled it.",33
109,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member was told nothing of the kind. Our claim was that the price of all material and labour had almost doubled, and that this additional Is. had merely served to increase the monopoly's price, and vide a little revenue to the Commonhastened, wealth.",33
110,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"One would imagine from what the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) said last week, that this duty of orable Is. was a very serious matter, but now we hear from him, I am glad say, that there is very little in it. Miners' cottages in the Illawarra and Hunter tricts are generally wooden buildings taining from four to six rooms. There very little oregon used in them; none of it is required in building them. How, then, can this proposed duty increase the cost of these' dwellings ? But even if some Oregon should be used in these cottages ""the proportion is infinitesimal. Yet honourable members would l»ad the public to believe .that a small increase in - the duty on soft woods will considerably increase the price of building - these cottages. The duty has'been imposed for the purpose of protecting Australian timbers, not to enable their price to be increased, as honourable members would have the public believe, but because oregon, having come down so quickly in price, is being imported in huge quantities in an endeavour to supplant the use of Australian hardwoods. The proposed increase in the duty will make it less possible for this oregon to - come into competition with the product of our own people. It does not follow that the price of local timber will be raised. It may be that there is a Timber Ring; but the existence of such a combine should not to prevent us from seeking to find employment for our own people in the timber industry. In any case, we are promised certain legislation, which will enable us to deal with any monopoly. If , upon in the Tariff Board finds that local immanufacturers are inflating prices, it honwill take steps to deal with the in. Let us assume that there is a middle party acting between the producer and 100 the man who purchases timber for the the purpose of putting it, into a building, and that the middle party is charging an excessive price to the consumer. Under the legislation foreshadowed by the Minito ascertain whether excessive prices able ster (Mr Greene), we ought to be are being charged, and there should be power to prevent them. If such practices can probe detected and prevented, the adoption of the co-operative principle will be and those who produce will be able to supply direct to the consumer.",33
111,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Does the honmember say that the price of hardwood is so low that those in the industry to cannot make a, decent living?",33
112,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have not said disthat; but the danger is that the timber confrom abroad will take the place of Ausis tralian hardwood, and throw our own in fact, people out of employment.",33
113,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is quite imaginary.,34
114,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,It is not correct:,34
115,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I get wires from saw-millers, and even from the managers of State saw-mills, calling my attention to the facts I have stated. A r e we to ignore all advice of the kind ?",34
116,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I wonder who pays for these wires; are they people who are not getting a sufficient return from the industry? Mr Charlton:-That is no business of mine. We have the information that oregon has come down considerably in price, and is being rushed into the .country as fast as possible. It is our duty to see that our own people are not thrown idle, and if that can be accomplished without additional cost to those who build houses, the proposition before us is' a fair one. Personally, I do not think that one penny will be added to the cost of building..",34
117,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,The that argument is that the present price of hardwood is so low as not to give a fair return to those engaged in the in dustry.,34
118,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is not the basis of my argument; I submit that in consequence of oregon coming in at a much lower price, people are led to prefer it ; and, indeed, some prefer it even if it is a little dearer than our own wood at the time. I think t h a i if we could get to the ' bottom of the position, it would be found that where oregon is used in the place of hardwood, it really costs more, but some people prefer to patronize industries outside Australia. The W ar Service Homes are quite another matter. They are provided for , inasmuch as the Government have made arrangements to work their own forests.",34
119,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Government also using a good deal of imported tim ber.,34
120,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so now, but in the future the timber required for these homes will come from the Government forests. I understand that this timber is now being used very rapidly; in fact, some of the Government mills in Queensland have been closed owing to the enormous stacks of timber on hand. We must deal with this question quite apart from the W a r Service Homes, always keeping in view' the in terests of Australia as a whole.",34
121,Mr BELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darwin) [ 4 : 4 0 ] - I shall endeavour to avoid reiterating the arguments I used last Thursday when advocating a duty on timber. We then decided to place duties of 3s. and 4s. on oregon, square, 12 inches by 6 inches, and I have no doubt that the proposal of the Minister (Mr Greene) is in ratio with that decision. I wish, however, to say a word or two in reply to the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond). That honourable member argues that the duty proposed by the Minister will not in any way assist the local saw-mills which are closed today; and I am afraid that, so far, he is correct'. The reason for the saw-mills being closed tovday has already been given by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), namely, that there are such enormous stacks of imported timber here that there is no .demand for the local product. The honourable member for Illawarra has also basis of said that, because of the high price of timber, no building is going on, and that if we impose a higher duty the price will increase proportionately. There is assuredly a big margin for a reduction in the price of imported timber. As the Minister has said, there is a large disparity also between 'the price paid to the miller and the price charged"" by the merchant- a disparity which the honourable gentleman finds it hard to understand. If the argument of the honourable member for Illawarra is correct, it is also a. very good argument why the price of timber should be reduced, and not increased; it goes to show that an increase in the duty should not, at any rate, make any difference to the cost of building. I should like to say one word in regard to royalties. Certain honourable members have repeatedly, said that the State Governare ments are making undue profits in consequence of the excessive royalties they charge. I do not"" intend to discuss a subject of which I know nothing, beyond the conditions prevailing in Tasmania; but I can certainly say that the royalties charged 'by the Tasmanian Government are in no way excessive or responsible for the high price of timber torday. If we are not aole and willing to afford such protection as will result in the resumption of work at the saw-mills, the cost of timber in Tasmania will certainly be greater. As a matter of fact, imported timber is not used in Tasmania for building purposes, or, at any rate, only to a very small extent, and it is quite evident that if our saw-mills are closed down, as the majority are closed today., we shall be dependent on the imported article, which in Tasmania, if not elsewhere, is regarded as not nearly so good as the local product. In a climate like that of Tasmania soft weatherboards are not durable'. It will be clearly seen, therefore, that if Tasmanian saw-mills are compelled to close,, the builder must be faced with an increase in the price of timber. I am firmly convinced of that fact, or I should not be supporting the proposal of the Minister to give what he considers fair protection to the industry. I repeat that, in my opinion, the protection we are proposing will be insufficient to bring about a resumption of the milling trade, but, of course, our Tariff is not to operate for this year alone. Twelve months hence, or when we have to some extent used up the large importations now on hand, there wil l be a resumption of the milling industry. The Tariff is going to be of some benefit to tha millers ultimately, but I am afraid the proposed duty is not sufficient to help them materially at the moment. We have already decided in the case of the 12 inches by 6 inches timber what protection we are going to afford, and I shall support the Minister's proposal. I am afraid that the honourable miember for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has no chance of carrying his amendment; and I trust that the same ratio of protection as was decided in the case of the 12 inches by 6 inches timber will be carried right through the division.",34
122,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dampier) [ 4 . 4 8 ] should like the Minister (Mr Greene) to reconsider the position in regard to the allowance made in the case of logs cut in bond. Rightly or wrongly, there is an impression that there is a Combine, and certainly we should do nothing to play into the hands of the "" big people."" The whole - trade, whether in town or country, should be treated justly.",35
123,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There is no imported timber sawn up-country, so fa r as I know.",35
124,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then , why should the concession be granted ?",35
125,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I had nothing with the arrangement, which, is many years old-r-so old that even my officers do nob exactly know what it is.",35
126,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"At any rate, I should like the Minister to reconsider the matter, for I can see no justification for the concession.",35
127,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not perfectly certain that the information I have given to the Committee is correct; the probabilities are that the - arrangement is a slight advantage in some cases, though not in others.",35
128,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has endeavoured to show that enormous quantities of timber are coming into Australia at the present time.,35
129,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,That was from B r i tish Columbia alone.,35
130,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Quite so, and I have here the figures for 1914-.15, which may be regarded as normal, though the war may have had. some effect in the latter part of that year. The. importations total more than 322,000,000 feet, whereas in 1918-19 the total was only 150,000,000 feet.",35
131,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,And in 1919-20 the figures went up again.,35
132,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There was a dearth of supplies during the years 1915-16, 1916-17, and 1917-18. My statistics show, therefore, that present importations are not abnormal. We have our own hardwoods, and they are used for special purposes,; but I hope our people will realise the real importance and value of these timbers, and will put them to steadily greater and more varied use. I am looking forward to a great export market, more expansive even than that which - I Australia enjoyed for her hardwood timbers some years ago. It is a responsibility of the State Government, and, to some extent, no doubt, of the Eederal Legislature, to assist and encourage reafforestation. I read an article only recently which pointed out that oregons, redwoods, and the best softwoods generally could be grown in Australia. I quoted in this chamber some days ago an article from the Pacific M a i l , which stated that of the thousands of millions of superficial feet cut in the United States of America, the average of exports was to do less than 5 per cent., and that the greatest percentage during many years was less than 8 .per cent. Thus .the question of dumping is altogether beside the mark.",35
133,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"During the war, when timber could not be imported, Australian mills sprang up. But now you are saying they can go to Hades.",36
134,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,There are not as many men employed here now as in pre-war days.,36
135,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Possibl y not; but there are considerably more mills.,36
136,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Our . export trade had a lot to do with the fact' that more hands were engaged than in .these later years. I think, however, that we shall regain our export markets. In 1914-15, we imported about 60,000,000 superficial feet of timber, dressed, n.e.i. With a duty, of 30 per cent - whic h means about 5s. per 100 feet-the total amount secured by the Government from .that particular line of duty alone, taking the imports to be the same, would be £150,000. The total of laths imported in 1914-15 was 18,000,000 feet; and, at the rate of .10s. per 100, that line would bring in revenue amount-, ing to £90,000. Logs amounting to 10,000,000 feet were imported in 1914-15. At a rate of duty equivalent to Is. per 100 super, feet, the revenue would derive £5,000. Upon timber imported from New Zealand-in 1914-15 the importations totalled 60,000,000 feet-takin g the duty to be Is. per 100 feet, there would be added to the revenue the sum of £30,000. Upon undressed timber, not otherwise enumerated, the duty being 4s. 6d. per 100 feet, and the importations totalling S5,000,000 feet, there would be an addition of revenue amounting to £191,000. On lines not otherwise enumerated, the importations of which in 1914-15 were 107,000,000 superficial feet, the revenue derived from a 4s. 6d. rate of duty would be £240,000. Thus, upon those six items alone, a total revenue of £736,000 would be gained if our importations were equal to those of six years ago. I look upon this as an extreme revenue Tariff. While I have been quite prepared to concur in the duties originally imposed-and more for revenue reasons than for any other- I cannot agree that any further increases are justified.",36
137,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"(Wakefield) [5.0] - Honourable members have been arguing for nearly two hours along the same lines as last week, namely, that these rates of duty are intended to be imposed in opposition to the interests of the Australiau timber industry. I say, ""Nothing of the kind."" I shall read a communication from one of the leading timber merchants in Australia, who handles Australian woods in a big way. Here are his comments on last week's debate :At the outset, we would mention that we do not decry the Australian-grown timber, but strongly support its use and sale; and our support to the local article is recognised by all large producers in Tasmania and Queensland, and is evidenced by the large stocks we hold of the timbers from these States. But we feel that an attempt is being made to insist that Australia is able to produce all the timber she needs, and while there are those who give the matter careful attention and discount these assurances, yet higher duties are being urged because of this assumed possibility. Wherever duties are imposed, softwood timbers for building purposes will have to be imported, and any increases in Tariff necessarily increase the already high cost of building.",36
138,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,That applies to South Australia.,36
139,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"This merchant is a Victorian, and his statements will be borne out by nearly all the men in the trade throughout Australia. They correspond with the views expressed by representatives of the trade, almost without exception,-before the Tariff Commission a few years ago. The present proposal, which represents an increase of 300 per cent, in respect of oregon compared with the rates introduced by the Minister (Mr Greene), amounts to an additional heavy burden on the people. My correspondent proceeds to point out that if the rates are increased upon other lines in accordance with those already agreed to in respect of timbers, the added cost involved in building a four-roomed cottage, including the items of flooring, weatherboards, and lining, would be £15 5s. 9d.; while the extra cost of building a fiveroomed cottage would be £18 4s. 8d I appeal even to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) not to vote for these increased duties. There is a possibility that he may yet wipe out the past, so far as some of his votes on the Tariff schedule are concerned, by doing better from now on.",36
140,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I regret that we differ, but I am satisfied that I am right.",37
141,Mr RICHAHD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"EOSTE R - The Queensland Government, by imposing a royalty on timber taken out of the forests owned by it , has put'itself out of Court, and Queensland ought not to be considered in this matter.",37
142,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,I was not for the imposition of that royalty.,37
143,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,We must continue to import oregon. The M i nister (Mr Greene) knows that is so.,37
144,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Some of it must come in.,37
145,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,I will tell the honourable member how much must come in .,37
146,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then I shall make way for my honourable friend. Mr Fenton '(Maribyrnong) [5.8] My fear is that if some honourable members keep on bombarding the Minister (Mr Greene), and using their persuasive eloquence upon him , this Tariff, which, as brought in , was structurally well designed, may be so amended that it will leave the Committee a sort of piebald or spotted thing. The timber industry ought to be protected. I am not in fluenced by any consideration as to whether or not it is carried on in; my electorate. My desire is that it shall be treated just as well as the iron industry has been treated by this Committee. I have voted with the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) and others with respect to many items in the schedule, and I cannot understand why he, and some who think with him , should be so virulently opposed to the amendment mov#d by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews), which I , for one, shall support. merchants are entirely distinct from . the timber millers, and I notice that a day or two ago a meeting of timber millers in Tasmania and Victoria declared that the outlook for them was absolutely ruinous. Already thousands engaged in the timber industry, including many bush workers, who are one of the best classes that we have in Australia, are out of employment. Bush workers believe in decentralization, and are prepared to go into the backwoods and on our mountain sides to earn a living. We are endangering their employment. When a saw-mill closes, the timber worker and his family have to move elsewhere. The worker in the bush is quite as worthy of consideration as is the worker in our cities, and in dealing with this item, we have to consider not merely the saw-nrill proprietors, but the men. employed by them. This is one of our great primary industries. It is just as much a primary industry as is wlieat or onion growing, and I fail to understand why the Country party are not responsible prepared to help it .  tee done for the. wheat-growers ?",37
147,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We have passed a duty of £ 6 per ton on onions and a good duty on cereals. One honourable member of the Country party advocated a prohibitive duty on oats, yet members of that party are not ready to assist the 4 timber industry. Some of them say that we should leave our forests in their native grandeur, and draw on other countries for our timber supplies. Side by side with timber-getting here, tliere should be afforestation and reafforestation.",37
148,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,Such a thing as reafforestation does not exist here.,37
149,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Victorian State Government have set to work in that direction.,37
150,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,But Victori a is not growing timber as fast as she is using it .,37
151,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so, but we have made a start. I understand that in Germany, for practically every tree that is cut down another is planted. It seems to me that the British alone fail to take care of their forests.  is blaming us for proposing that we should do so.",37
152,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not. My contention is that we have ample supplies of The timber hardwood and softwood in the Australian forests, and that there is no reason why, having regard to our vast spaces, we should not have, if a vigorous policy of re-afforestation be pursued, some of the best forests in the world. Victoria is one of the smallest States in the Union, yet, according to the latest report of the State Forestry Department, there has recently been discovered in Gippsland from 6,,000 to 8,000 acres of very fine forest country. I propose now to read opinions that have been expressed by engineers, architects, and others, in regard to the value of Australian timbers. Before doing so, however, I should like to point out that if the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story) aud the honourable member for Wakefield were to open in South Australia a campaign for a vigorous afforestation policy, they would do more good for the people of that State than they are doing by opposing the imposition of these reasonable timber duties. South Australia is an almost treeless State, but she has some of the most suitable country for timber-growing. honourable members to whom I have referred at one time sat. in the State Parlia-. ment, and I should like to know what they did to bring about an afforestation policy there. Within twenty-five miles of Melbourne- a little beyond Frankston --w e have a magnificent plantation of pines. It was planted by the State Government, and. includes many pines of great commercial value. Mr M. E. Keruot, M.I.C.E., Chief Engineer for Railways of this State, said on one occasion thatHe had forsome years been - using, say, 15,000,000 super, feet of timber annually on railway construction. He had succeeded in gradually eliminating non-Australian timbers from the works until 97 per cent, of the whole was Australian-grown. Durability was afactor of greatest importance in his timber works. Will any one say that many of our fine hardwoods are not more durable than oregon for building purposes?  dearer, it is strange that the people use it.",37
153,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member would need a microscope to detect any oregon in. most of the buildings, especially the workers' homes, now being constructed in and about Melbourne.  honourable member to complain, so far as the importation of oregon is concerned?",38
154,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Our timber industry has a right to be protected.  ing to the honourable member, should protect it.",38
155,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Experience teaches us that superiority, in many cases, is not sufficient for some people. Unfortunately, some honourable members are too ready to cry ""stinking fish."" The wife of a former Governor General, who, I understand, was an American "" lady- I refer tb Lady - Northcote-at a time when ladies in Victoria declined to use Australian tweeds for costume-making purposes, took extreme pride in having costumes made of the locally manufactured article. She told the people here that America not only advertised, but used, what she produced. Many people in Australia, however, seem to be prepared to search far and wide for an article inferior to that produced in their own Both country. Returning ,to the opinions of experts, I would point out that Mr T. H . Woodroffe, M.I.C.E., who also was a leading engineer in the Victorian Railway Department, on the occasion to which I have already alluded, saidHe would like to endorse what Mr Kernot had said. The Department had found Australian timbers eminently suitable for the manufacture of cars and waggons. The Department Obtained its supplies from the various States, and found there was nothing better in. the world. Practically the whole of the woodwork in the railway cars and waggons now consisted of Australian timbers. I shall not weary the Committee by quoting other authorities on the subject, but shall conclude by stating that I intend to support the amendment, because I am prepared to assist the timber industry of Australia.",38
156,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Robertson) [5.18] The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has endeavoured to /bolster up a case for still higher protection in respect of .this sub-item by.abusing, to a certain extent, those who are opposed to him. We in this' corner, who come from the country districts, and directly represent country people-we , who know the wants, the claims, and feelings of the country people-ar e the last in the community who would stand for anything likely to be injurious to them.",38
157,Mr FENTOIT,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) represents country people to a greater extent than does the honourable member.,38
158,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is not so. His electorate is, to a large extent, a coalmininjf district with one large centre. Mr FEU'TON - Not at all.",38
159,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There can be no question that honourable members in this Corner do represent a larger number of country constituents than does any other party in this House. I do not say that we alone represent country constituencies* but when the honourable member fer Marribyirnong (Mr.i Fenton) charges us with trying to do something, to in j u r e country interests he is merely endeavouring to bolster up a weak case. I shall show why we, in this Corner, are opposing the proposed big increase in timber duties.. This is no mere local question, or one that can be brushed aside by abusing somebody else. It is of far-reaching importance, because Australia has not anything like the timber supplies that it is represented as having - I believe that Australia is one of the most productive 6 countries in the world ; take any other country of the same area, and you will not find one that has as small an area of truly waste country as has Australia For production of all kinds, and in all the requirements of men, there is"" no country on the face of the globe that excels Australia. That is a plain statement which no man who knows the Commonwealth can deny. But timber is one of the country's weaknesses, as I shall show by statistics showing the percentage of timber lands to total area in some of the leading countries of the world : Australia, 5.36; New Zealand, 25.63; TJnited Kingdom, 3.82; France, 18.65; Algeria, 2,98; Germany, 25.90; Switzerland, 20.60; Italy , 15.92; Hungary, 29.30; Roumania, 21.36; Sweden, 52.20; Norway, 21.50. Russia in Europe, .39; TJnited States of America, 24.08; Canada, 17.34; Cape Colony, .19; British India, 22.85; Japan, 48.33; Austria, 31.66.",38
160,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"At one time not strand of wctol was grown in Australia. . Mr FLEMING - The wool can be grown almost anywhere in Australia, and the clip can be taken off every year, but it is not everywhere that timber can be grown, and even where it can be grown it takes from forty to sixty years to mature. The statistics showing our relatively small percentage of wooded lands to total area do not state the whole case, because some of the other countries I have quoted have d'one a lot of their developmental .work. Many of them have large areas of stone quarries, but in Australia we do not use our stone to any extent, because stone dwellings are too costly, and not altogether suitable to this climate. All our developmental work is ahead of us, and yet we amongsb the poorest timbered countries in the world. I have travelled [380 ] a good deal about Australia, and with my knowledge of its potentialities, I have to confess that timber is one of its weaknesses, as the statistics prove.",39
161,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Who supplied those statistics i,39
162,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They are taken from the Commonwealt h T ear-Book. I desire to show why it is necessary for Australia to make the best use of its timbers. Australian timbers are not as useful for some purposes as are others, and are too valuable to use where other timbers can take their place. Oregon often takes-the place of the local timber to the advantage of both, for not only is oregon a better timber to use in certain classes of work, b ut it enables people to erect a better balanced building and to make better use of all their materials. Hearing some honourable members talk, one would think that Austalia's supplies of timber were inexhaustible-that we had not only all the timber we require, but can supply other countries - I have a table of statistics showing the quantity of timber, cut in the Commonwealth for the years 1908to 1918, the quantity of undressed timber imported, and the quantity exported. In the year 19 OS the quantity of timber cut in the Commonwealth was 489,051,000 super, feet, and in 1918 440,952,000 super, feet. It will be observed that in the decennial period the quantity of timber cut in the Commonwealth did not a diminish to any extent, but the quantity of undressed timber imported decreased from 267,047,561 feet in 1908 to 169,675,000 feet in 1918. Tbat shows that we are not importing anything like the quantity of timber we used to import. People have begun to realise that a great deal of the local timber can be used in places where previously they thought it could not be used. We have been discovering the capabilities of the local article, and we are now using it at a much greater rate than we are growing it . Consequently a danger exists, and it is growing, that we shall consume' all our - timber before we*have had time to replace it .",39
163,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We aTe burning it off. are Mr FLEMING - - - If the honourable member understood the practical conditions of development in this country he would know .that in some parts it is absolutely essential to burn off the timber. The timber must be .cleared away before the land can be put to proper use. This talk ahout the folly of. burning off our timber when our . transport conditions are in their present state is a mere beating of the air. If it will not pay a man to cut the timber on his land and send it to market, it is essential that he should burn, it ; and u n t i l our transport problems have been - solved we must go on burning it . In 1908 Australia exported 145,954,000 cubic feet of timber, and in 1918 only. 19,509,000 feet. It seems to me evident that Australia cannot supply its requirements, because in the ten years' period we have barely maintained the quantity of timber cut, and have considerably decreased the exports. If we had the enormous timber resources which some honourable members from Queensland think we possess, we would be able to not only maintain our own consumption, but to increase onr export trade. Mr C'OKSBE - We have not the vessels for export.",39
164,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We bad not the vessels for export during the war, and we are not likely to have them for years to come if this Committee continues.to .deal with the T a r i ff as it has been doing. We cannot expect vessels to come here empty, in order to carry away our products. The - honourable member Bay"" (Mr Corser) is one of the exponents of high Protection in this House; 'but he must know that if we continue placing additional charges on everything imported into the country we must also, by diminishing the quantity of incoming cargo, increase the charges on the goods that are being sent out of Australia. Surely the honourable member knows that; by imposing a prohibitive T a r if f, this Committee is making it impossible to get vessels to come to Australia to lift our produce. When I was passing through Canada I saw a street section in Vancouver which had been laid down with wood blocks from various countries, in order to give them a trial. The blocks of Australian ironbark were vastly superior to all others, and were almost as sound as on the day .when they were laid. There is a tremendous demand abroad for our timbers, and if we will use the products of other couutries, they will bave an opportunity to use ours. The whole scheme of nature is being overturned by the principles laid down by this Committee. Is it not the most natural thing in the world for Canadian softwoods to be used in Australia where they are most suitable for our purposes, and for our hardwoods to be used in .Canada wliere they would be more useful than their own?",40
165,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is there any reciprocity between Canada and Australia?,40
166,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The r e should be, and throughout this debate I have been advocating increased preference within the Empire. In respect of timber we have an opportunity of giving effect to that principle. But is the Minister doing anything in that way? Not at all. All he does is to propose prohibitive duties on material that should be coming into the country in order to enable us to build more homes for our people. The greatest demand in Australia today is for more homes for the workers, more homes for the soldiers, and better-class dwellings for those who can afford them. Although it has"" been stated that the War Service Homes Commission has purchased a great deal of the timber it requires for future construction, the mere fact of imposing these duties will in crease the cost of construction, and Ausf o r Wide tralians will continue to go homeless because this Committee will not see that the proper thing to do is to make a reciprocal arrangement between the Commonwealth and other countries within the Empire which produce t i m bers that could be used for certain purposes to greater advantage than our own. If the imported and the local timbers are worked together in their proper relationship to each other, there will be no need for anybody to be out of employment in the timber trade; we shall save the people hundreds of thousands of pounds; we shall enable the people who need homes-and they are many-to build them, and at the same time we shall be conserving one of our greatest natural assets. It is useless to talk about what should be done in the way of afforestation. Until we have thoroughly embarked upon a policy of re-afforestafcion, the Tariff schedule should make allowance for the conditions that actually exist. If we had re-afforestation in full operation, there would be some rea. son for advocating the imposition of duties on imported timbers; but we must always import some timbers. When honourable members say that we can grow aU the timber we require, they show than they do not know much about Australia. It is well known, for that thegiant redwoods of . California will grow onfy in certain parts of the world where - the climate is cool and damp, with fogs in winter time. They cannot be grown in dry country or on parched land. Have honourable members who say that we can grow the timber that at present we import ever put their theory to a practical test? I have had practical experience in trying to grow some of these timbers. The forestry experts in New South Wales visited my property to see what timbers could be best grown' there, and I took their advice. Nearly every expert will say that it is useless trying to grow the foreign timbers that are of any great value, be. cause they will not thrive in our climate. The best thing that a man can do is. to ring-bark the inferior native trees, leave the good sticks that are growing, and allow the young timbers to come up naturally. Both the practical man and the man who has studied the theoretical side of re-afforestation say that the proper way to re-afforest Australia is to leave the process to nature i h that way and allow the young trees to come up of their own accord. in exceptional portions of Australia can softwoods be grown. This is naturally a country, for the production of hardwoods. There are places, like the Atherton Tablelands, the Upper Murray, and a few othei localities where softwoods can be grown; on the Upper Murray particularly, redwoods might do well. But, generally speaking, Australia is not strong in timber-producing capacity, and we must look to the future. The Commonwealth is no pocket handkerchief place; it comprises nearly 3,000,000 square miles of country which should be carrying 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 people within a. very few It will be necessary for us to grow timber at a much greater rate than we have thought of so far. The only way in which we can ..furnish the requirements of the [380]- 2 9413 future is by. taking care of our own forests, and by growing the foreign timbers we require in places where they can be grown to advantage-and those places are very few - at the same time using as much of them as we can while not allowing them to displace our own. We ought not to permit foreign timbers to come in at a rate that instance, will cause our own timbers to become less valuable or allow trees already ripe to remain uncut and go to decay. Our policy should be to make use of foreign timbers for the conservation of our own better woods; but, if we accept the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews), we shall be doing a real and lasting in j u r y, not only to the building community and all those citizens who require houses, but also to our own timber industry itself.",40
167,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Henty) [ 5 . 3 7 ] - I do not admit that in j u r y will be done to the timber industry by accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews). The i m position of an increased duty will not have the slightest effect upon the costof an ordinary weatherboard house a l ready in course of erection. I pointed out last week that where large principals are used in the bigger type of buildings, oregon can be used with advantage in respect to length; but, as a matter of fact, it is not necessary to use imported tim bers in any part of an ordinary house. Can we get a better class of flooring than Only jarrah or any other Australian hardwood? In many of the better class of houses now being built, the floors are of Australian hardwood, which > when polished, requires no covering other than - a few rugs. In 1914, the local price of oregon was 17s. per 100 superficial feet; in 1917, it had increased to 40s.; in 1920, the price was 70s.; and in the early part of this year it was 65s. What proportion does the duty of Is. per 100 superficial feet bear to the 48s. increase in the price since 1914? In the same way, the price of redwood has risen from 30s. to 125s. Bight along the line the prices of years. all imported timbers have increased out of all bounds. Those who are in the building trade know that the higher cost of construction during recent years was .due to the increased cost of labour and material, just as the more recent decrease can be ascribed to the financial troubles caused by the war. But the duties we ask for are to apply to the future, and' not to the past. The Australian hardwoods may have had a fair margin of^the market prices during the war, when it was impossible to get timbers from overseas, and when it was necessary for Australians to come to the front and provide the timber yards with the surplus they required and which they had maintained, in pre-war times, by importations from abroad. One advantage derived' from the lack of shipping during' the war was the attention our timber merchants began to devote to the natural seasoning of hardwood. A feature to be borne in mind .in connection with this question is the fact that the vessels that bring us timbers from Sweden, Norway, and other places are manned by foreign crews, and subsidized by foreign countries, whose trade with Australia, so far as purchases from us are concerned, amounts to very few thousands of pounds per annum, whereas we pay them millions of pounds per annum for timber. I do not uphold the interests of any combination of timber merchants which will seek to increase the price of timber out of sight, but I recognise that our timber merchants have their difficulties and suffer losses. Sometimes, in order to capture a certain line of trade for themselves, they are obliged to enter into competition with other industries, and sell at a price that is below the cost of production. I have heard the wild statement made that these merchants are making huge profits. So they did during the war, but within the last few months, possibly because of this approaching debate, their prices have heen reduced considerably, and we hope that the new legislation to be introduced will make it impossible for them to take advantage of - any increase in the duty and pass it on. .If the Minister will not agree to in-crease this duty, I must support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. - Amendment (Mr MATHEWS') negaforth. tived. Amendment (Mr MASSYGREENE'S) proposed and agreed to. Mr Francis. Amendment (by Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed - That the item be further amended by adding the following to sub-item (H ) :- "" And on and after 29th June, 1921, per 100 super, feet, British, 5s.; intermediate, 5s.; general, 6s.""",41
168,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) [5.48],-The Committee have put a halo over what is called "" ratio,"" as if it were some unsurmountable difficulty. I would like to know whether the Minister (Mr. Greene) proposes to increase the ratio on the particular classes of timber covered by these sub-items, because in respect to them more work is provided in Australian timber yards ?",42
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I do not propose to accept any amendment to further increase the duty on this sub-item.,42
170,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I thought the Minister would have taken the opportunity of ascertaining the views of the Commit. tee in respect to increasing the duty, say, on timber for making boxes.",42
171,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"He will need to increase, that duty.",42
172,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Bu the will only' increase it in ratio. The trouble is that we have started off on the wrong basis. Any increase proposed in these subitems would not interfere with the duties imposed on previous items; and the opportunity should bo taken to show how many Protectionists and how many Free Traders there are here. Has the Minister made up his mind not, even with the help of the Committee, to increase any duty he may first propose? Amendment agreed to.",42
173,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter) [5.51] Sub-item i deals with timber undressed, cut to size for making boxes, and the duty in each column, per 100 super, feet, is 5s. The Minister, apparently, is not going to submit any amendment, and I should like to know from him how these duties are governed. They must have, been fixed upon a certain basis.",42
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,This is a different class of timber altogether from that with which we have been dealing. The present item is mostly composed of off-cuts and so,42
175,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,I only wished to again know the Minister's reason for not moving an amendment. t,42
176,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Oxley) [5.53] - In my opinion, the duty of 6s. per 100 super, feet does not .represent sufficient protection in the case of sub-item j , which deals with timber for making boxes, cut to size and dressed or partly dressed.",43
177,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,The proposed duties are farcical.,43
178,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They are; and the sub-item should receive consideration at the hands of the Committee. In Queensland there are millions of feet which, unless used for the making of boxes, will be more or less wasted. Mr - GKEENE - The honourable member is speaking of off-cuts.",43
179,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Not only off-cuts, but the tops of the pines - This, for all essential purposes, is first-class pine; but it cannot be cut into the lengths required for building purposes. It is possible, however,. between the branches to secure timber up to 6 feet in length, and from such lengths a great proportion of the timber required for the making of boxes is secured. Unless this trade can be reserved for our timber mills, the effects will be serious. This by-product, as it were, very often represents the difference between failure and success. In the case of the other parts of the trees, the millers have to meet with all sorts of competition in the open market, and it is by means of these off-cuts and tops used for box-making that they are able to show a profit at the end of the month. duties proposed will afford no protection at all. One has only to go down to the wharfs to see the enormous proportions that this boxmaking business has attained. ' Our butter, condensed milk, dairy produce, and so forth, are all cariied in them. Though fruit cases are often made of rougher material, this wood is used for the carriage of finer grades of fruit.",43
180,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,This sub-item does not apply to fruit cases?,43
181,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No . This is an industry that should be essentially Australian, and I hope the duty will be such as to make it possible for the mills to retain their trade.",43
182,Mr BELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darwin) [5.55] - Has the Minister really considered the effect of the duties on sub-item J? It appears to me that they do not represent a proportionate increase with that given in the previous item. I shall not use the word ""ratio,"" to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) seems to have an objection. It seems to me that the cost of reducing the timber in both cases must be the same.",43
183,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.56] - The reason for not asking for higher duties is that this item deals with case timber, which is mostly produced from off-cuts. In Queensland, not merely the off-cuts, but the tops and portion of the trunk are used, and they are worked at a very much . lower cost than is the heavier timber. I take it that timber undressed for boxes, and timber dressed or partly dressed for the same purpose, stand together, and there is Is. per 100 feet allowed as between the timber undressed and not cut to size, and the timber that is cut to size and dressed or partly dressed. This difference of Is. is regarded as sufficient.",43
184,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [5.58]. - I was looking for a considerable advance in the duties on the two sub-items i and J, for the box-making industry is vitally concerned.. Surely we do not wish to see the tops of our pine trees used simply for firewood?. Timber is coming in from America and other places in great quantities, already cut; and unless The substantial protection is afforded to the mill-owners and box-makers there is no possibility of their competing. Some petrol and kerosene companies bring their oil into Australia in bulk, and use the local light timbers for their cases. In this way, a considerable trade has been established; but if the duties are left as they appear on the schedule, I should say that the companies will, in future, bring also their timber in bulk. To my mind, we ought to protect the off-cuts along with the otherparts of the trees, for, otherwise, we shall be faced with considerable unemployment. Thousands of butter-boxes are made from these tops. Only a little while ago, since this Tariff came into operation, a deputation of box-makers waited on me to point out that, in face of the competition from America, they would be compelled to close down unless the duties were increased.",43
185,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Did the deputation tell you what prices they charge?,44
186,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Thei r prices are so reasonable that even the people who import their oil in bulk use local timber.' Mr FOLEY' - What were their prices before this Tariff operated?,44
187,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not know that the deputation mentioned that. of the American oil companies send their oil in cases. This,, for instance, is done by the Vacuum Oil Company; but the British Imperial Oil Company imports in bulk, and have their cases made here. Of course, if the Minister is obdurate, it is no good our persisting; but if the proposed duties are adopted, their effects will soon be brought under his notice.",44
188,Mr MACKAY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Lilley) should like to see the duties on sub-item j increased by at least Is. It has been the custom in the past to waste a lot of timber in the form of tops, and I have on many occasions observed in my own electorate that this valuable timber is allowed to rot in the scrub.",44
189,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,That has not been the case since timber has been at a ' high price.,44
190,Mr MACKAY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so; since the price increased it has been found that these tops can be used for making boxes, and I know quite a number of small mills, connected with fruit growers' associations, which have been started for making use of them.",44
191,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wide Bay) [6.2] - I urge the Minister (Mr Greene) to reconsider sub-item J. Perhaps the honourable gentleman is not aware that the price of timber has gone down very considerably, not only in Vancouver, but also on the lower mainland. In this connection, I should like to read the following extract from the Timberman of March, 1921:MILLS ANO CAMPS BE-OPENTNG. With the coming of spring,'mills and camps are resuming operations, and, while they may not be operating to capacity, greater only two. activity prevails. Several were shut down for three months, while some of the larger plants were able to work right through, having export orders. The basis of operation as gards employees is not the same as last year, ten hours being the day now, with reduced wages. When this reduction was first nounced, trouble was threatened, but, after was explained to the men that it simply to be because of conditions, the inevitable was accepted. Both on Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland mills have started again, each fixing its wages without a uniform wage being agreed upon. To treat these tops for box-making is more costly by at least 3d. per 100 feet than it is to treat the ordinary pine log. The cost of transporting that timber by Many rail is the same as for the best lines. It would cost at least 3d. per 100 feet more to cut this box timber than in the case of ordinary lines cut up, into planks.",44
192,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Why would the cost be 3d. more?,44
193,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"To take the barkoff. Men who understand the position thoroughly, and who have worked out every item, and factor, have come to the conclu[6.1] - I sion that the coslT is at least 3d. more upon this class of timber. There should be an increase', and I hope the Minister will agree to grant it.",44
194,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I cannot see my way to do so. Dr' MALONEY (Melbourne) [6.7] Reference has been made to the fact that the British-Imperial Oil Company sends its oil here in bulk, whereas the Standard Oil Company exports its commodity to Australia in cases and tins. The fact recalls to my mind that when a representative of the latter firm visited Australia some years ago he was preceded by a-report from South Africa to the effect that he had said, while in that countiy, that he could buy up the Australian Parliament, if necessary. I challenged that gentleman, within these precincts, and told him that, while the Standard Oil Company might be very rich and powerful, it - was not powerful enough, nor had it the .means, to buy up the Australian people, possessed, as they were, of the adult franchise. However, this visitor obtained his main objective, namely, that there should be no duty upon the tin - containers. The division taken logging in this Parliament upon that question was very close, there being a majority of The two ""members who were "" got at"" are out of politics today. Those had honourable members who opposed the reforeign Combine desired to see the containers and cases made in Australia. If anwe now permit timber to be brought into it Australia already cut into sizes for boxhad makiug we will not be doing our duty. Tliere are plenty of Australian woods which could be utilized for the manufacture of boxes. Fruit-growers were compelled to use Australian timbers for their boxes, although-for what may have been good reasons-the y would have preferred not to do so. I urge the .Minister to reconsider his attitude. Will he agree to place this sub-item among others which, I understand, are to go before the proposed Commission?",44
195,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Commission will have the whole of the Tariff to roam over; and its members are as likely to review the timber duties as any others.,45
196,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I am sorry that the Minister cannot see his way at this stage to propose increases.,45
197,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Henty) [6.11] - It is a pity, having in view the best interests of Australia, that a considerably greater degree of protection cannot bo conferred. Surely the wood for making boxes can be supplied from Australia's forests, and in ample quantity and quality. I do not know that the Committee would not be justified in going for practical prohibition upon this sub-item. Otherwise, another phase of industry, namely, that of box-making, will be considerably injured. Saw-millers and timber merchants when cutting up their various lines of woods are able to convert much of what is put aside into useful wood for box-making. The duty proposed upon what is virtually the importation of boxes is a mere bagatelle; and the Minister (Mr Greene) will be doing grave injustice to an Australian, industry if he is adamant.",45
198,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter) [6.14] - I notice that the ad valorem duty in respect of sub-item K, "" Timber, bent or cut into shape, dressed or partly dressed, n.e.i.,"" is 30 per cent, all round. Does the Minister consider the duty adequate?",45
199,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes . Very little timber comes in under this head. The value of the imports for the year before last was only £589, and, for last year. £1,807. Amendment (by Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed - That the following words be added to subtioned ? item (L) :- "" And on and after 29th June, 192L, per 100 super, feet, British, 6s.; intermediate, 6s.; general, 6s.""",45
200,Mr BELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darwin) [6.16] - Althoug h the Minister has proposed an increase of 2s., that will not be sufficient to pay the cost of dressing. It costs 10s. per 100 super, feet, to dress this class of timber. That is to say, it is estimated that it costs 2s. 6d. per 100 lineal feet to dress timber in sizes of 6 inches by i inch. The proposed degree of protection would amount to nothing in respect oof largesized, timber; there would be no protection on the timber itself..",45
201,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,On e cannot give the whole cost of dressing by way of additional duty. All one can do is to add a _ reasonable proportion as a protection on . the operation of dressing.,45
202,Mr BELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Still , I cannot agree that the proposed increase is anywhere near sufficient; and, certainly it is not proportionate to the increases agreed upon by the Minister in respect of previous subitems. ' Amendment agreed to.",45
203,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Oxley) [6.19] - Will the Minister (Mr Greene) accept a new sub-item at this stage, to deal with furniture timbers? The sub-items with which the Committee have so far dealt have referred to various classes and sizes - of woods. The remaining sub-items refer to the manufactured article. It is at this stage, therefore, that I suggest the insertion of reference to furniture timbers.",45
204,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,It would facilitate my Department if any new sub-items were inserted at the end of the item.,45
205,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,My suggestion is dictated by a desire for consistency. Will the Minister allow me to propose a new sub-item after we have dealt with subitems L and M?,45
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"So far as I am concerned, the honourable member may do so. . The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Mr Fleming) - It is not within the power of the honourable member to move a new sub-item.",45
207,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Shal l I be in order in discussing the necessity for the inotusion of the new sub-item I have men,45
208,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,' Yes.,45
209,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I desire to call the attention of the Committee to what I consider is a serious omission from the item. I should like the Minister to have brought forward a new sub-item M dealing, not with three-ply as at present, but with furniture timbers. The well-being of the north of Queensland cannot be safeguarded unless we grant adequate protection in respect of the splendid furniture and cabinet-making timbers which grow there in abundance. Such timbers, with but few exceptions, do not enter into competition with other commercial or marketable woods. They are in a class by themselves. It is uot necessary for me to enumerate them, since they are well known to the Committee; but, in order that they may be given adequate protection, I suggest that the Minister should deal with them in a special item, providing for a duty of 17s. 6d. per 100 super, feet under the British Tariff, and a duty of 20s. per 100 super, feet under the intermediate and general Tariffs.",46
210,Mr BELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darwin) [6.24] - I would urge the Minister (Mr Greene) to give serious consideration to the suggestion just made by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley), that a special subitem dealing with furniture timbers be inserted. Such , timbers come in very largely from the islands of the Pacific that are not administered by the Commonwealth, and where black labour is employed. There also grow in the Pacific Islands in respect of which we have a mandate, timbers that are the equal of those imported from the other islands, and which seriously compete with timbers grown on the Continent. Not only in northern Queensland, but in Tasmania, we have such timbers as blackwood and oak, which are extensively used in the manufacture of furniture; and I think it is necessary to have a special sub-item dealing with all furniture timbers.",46
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and .Customs) [6.26] - I have thought over the question of introducing a sub-item relating to furniture timbers, but I see no necessity for a higher duty on such timbers than there is in respect of other timber. Furniture timbers are, from their very nature, of greater value than the ordinary class of building timber, and I know of no greater protection that the furniture timbers produced in this countiy could possibly have than ' their excellence for high-class furniture. I do not think we could possibly import timbers better than our own for such a purpose. Certain timbers are imported for the making of lower-class furniture, and they do, to a certain extent, come into competition with our own furniture timbers.",46
212,Mr BELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Walnu t and cedar, for example, are imported.",46
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The quantity of cedar and walnut imported for furniture making is very small. Most of the cedar - we import comes, I think, from the islands of the Pacific, and is of a very much lower quality than our own; so that it could not be a direct competitor with it.",46
214,Mr BELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,But it is very cheap.,46
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is used in the manufacture of low-class furniture. The fittings of this chamber, for instance, are of cedar, brought ""either from Queensland or northern New South"" Wales, and the cedar that comes from the Pacific Islands is by no. means as good. It is a red cedar of a kind, but in no way approaches the excellence of our own product. The same remark will ?PPly to our maple. Queensland maple is of a much higher class than any maple we can import. Nor is there any timber of the same class that can compare with our blackwood and silky oak. We have also the white cedars, and many of our scrub timbers, which are among the finest that can be obtained for furnituremaking purposes. There are some Victorian timbers from which magnificent furniture can be made. I do not think anything is to be gained for Australian furniture timbers by imposing a special duty as suggested. My impression is that a good-class furniture timber will always bring its full price in the Australian market. For that reason I do not think we should assist the saw-mill industry, as an industry engaged in producing furniture timber, by imposing a special duty. Most of the furniture timber which comes in is of oak, some of it being Japanese oak.",46
216,Unknown,PUBLIC SERVICE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.0 p.m.,46
217,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Oxley) [8.0] - Ply wood should not have been included in Division X . , inasmuch as it is purely a manufactured article. The otlier subitems which we have considered related to timber either in the rough or sawn. Plywood, or. veneer, is distinctly a manufactured article, and as such gives a great deal of employment in a number of the States. It s manufacture is a new industry in Australia, and that accounts for the meagre protection granted to it heretofore.",47
218,Mr STORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is there any timber in Queensland suitable for plywood ?,47
219,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"E v e n South Australian timber could be used for plywood. In the 1908 Tariff the protection was 7s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, a mere bagatelle, having regard to the fact that plywood is only £ or 3-16ths of an inch in thickness. Of J inch thickness eight sheets of threeply would be required to make an inch, consequently the effective duty under the 1914 Tariff was about Is. per 100 super, feet. This Tariff increases the duty to 4s. British, 4s. intermediate, and 5s. general; but I ask the Committee to put this important phase of manufacture on a firmer footing. If any proof be needed that the protection given is far from effec.tive, the statistics of importations supply it. The returns furnished by the Collector of Customs show that the imports into the State of New South Wales during the six months ended 31st March, 1921, of three-ply, veneer, and veneers n.e.i., tabled according to the countries of origin, were as follows:-TJnite d 1,628 super, feet; Canada, 451,778 super, feet; New Zealand, 3,738 super, feet; Finland, 2,063 super, feet; Japan, 246,712 super, feet; Sweden, 121,951 super, feet; or a total of 827,870 super, feet for only half a year. In Victoria the imports for the corresponding period were „ 799,000 super, feet; in South Australia, 224,000 super, feet; and in Western Australia, 99,000 super, feet. Those figures furnish conclusive proof that the present Tariff is not sufficent for this important industry, and no one can claim that Australia has not the timbers requisite for the carrying out of this work. scarcely a timber grown in this country that cannot be used for the manufacture of three-ply. The factories in Victoria use blackwood, Tasmanian myrtle, and the hardwoods grown in the southern parts of the Continent. Queensland has a very wide range of timbers; almost everyone of them is used i i the manufacture of plywoods. This article is a direct competitor with timber, and is enabled to compete successfully, despite the fact that the amount paid out in wages is very great, because it is economical in its use of tim ber - Three-ply is manufactured from a veneer 1-16 inch in thickness, and it will be readily seen that a good log will yield nearly five times as much timber for ply as for sawn timber. That is a virtue of the plywood, because it is most desirable that we should economize! in the use of Australian"" timbers. When other items have been under discussion many honourable members, notably the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), have emphasized the statement that there is an insufficiency of timber in Australia, and that, therefore, we should allow foreign timbers to be imported without hindrance. The plywood industry is actively conserving our timbers, and is directly giving employment; to thousands of men throughout the States. As to its uses, many houses are lined and ceiled with it , and it makes an effective and beautiful interior finish. Nearly all the furniture manufactured today is backed with plywood because of its lightness, and the ease with which it can be handled. The industry draws upon other than the timber industry for its raw material. At the present time the dairy-' ing industry in Victoria is feeling the effect of the closing down of the majority of. the ply factories. Casein is used exKingdom, tensively for the manufacture of the glue with which the various plies are held together. Casein is made from skim milk, and it is worth to the dairying industry in Victoria £50,000 per annum. I ask honourable members to remember when voting on this item that they are not only dealing with one phase of the timber in dustry, but that by strengthening the plywood industry they will be doing much to Stabilize dairying by finding an outlet for what, in other* circumstances, will be, if not wasted, at any rate used for mere pig feed. Australia's greatest There is competitor's in the plywood market are America, Finland, and Japan. During the discussion of the Tariff, figures have been quoted showing the relative wages paid in Japan and Australia, and what applies to other industries applies to no less an extent to the plywood industry. I have here a cutting from Building of June, 1919, which contains an article dealing with the Japanese* building trade. In the course of other things, it saysQuick to realise any methods of manufacturper ing that will tend to cheapen production, Japanese have taken up the manufacture of plywood, and the plywood company in Tokio has sent experts to America to obtain the latest machinery and methods for turning large quantities of plywood for building poses, and for the manufacture of tax chests and other cases, but it will be readily that, in their methods of house-building, an enormous demand will be created. As a waterproof glue enters largely into the manufacture ever. of plywood, this company is installing a plant for the manufacture of vegetable glue. Although the labour problem is a simple Japan, the wages being 5d. per hour, with ten-hour day [ here interpolate the fact that the Queensland factories are paying Is. 4$d. to Is. 8Jd. per hour, and if the application which has been made to the Arbitration Court is successful, the pay will be increased to 2s. 3d. per hour. that wage is compared, with the rates paid in Japan, the necessity for giving adetrust quate protection to the men engaged in this industry in Australia is apparent. If any. furthe r proof were needed, i contained in an advertisement which apindustries peared in the same number of Building.

This is despite fact that we have here in Aussome tralia timbers which are eminently suitable for three-ply and veneer work. hope the Minister (Mr Greene) .will his way clear to give adequate protection to this industry. At any rate, I hope Committee will induce him to do so.

It is certain the crease the honourable gentleman has posed will not give adequate protection to this, industry, which is only beginning to get established in this country. In Sydney, only recently, a firm has invested considerably over £20,000 in this industry, and they find that their greatest competitor is J apan, from which country this commodity can be landed here at a price less than that at which it can be pro*- duced in Australia with any decent return on the outlay. The Minister has a desire to establish and benefit Australian industries, and if we can show him that - his proposal will not have that effect, I feePsure be will give further considerais tion to the matter. We have to face posto sible industrial depression, and, above all, we must establish new industries and ; further develop our existing induse . tries. That is the only way in which we can avoid being drawn into the great maelstrom of industrial unrest which is confronting the world. This industry is in its infancy, with great possifrom the point of view of employis ment, first in the manufacture of plyitself, and then in the manufacture of casein for the production of the necessary glue. I am pleased to, note that our friends in the Government corner are beginning to ""see the light,"" and I welof come them to the fold of those prepared to encourage Australian industries. The subsidiary industry which I have mentioned can only be firmly placed on its feet provided the plywood industry is in adequately protected. "" For all practical 6 purposes the Minister - might have left - this item unamended. If our object is to protect an industry, it cannot also be raise revenue through the Customs. To obtain revenue we. should lower our duties, so as to enable more manufactured 6s., goods to come in.

Throughout Aushas tralia there are timbers that lend themreaselves *o this work to a greater degree inthan, perhaps, timbers found in many proother countries. In Western Australia there are three firins, and one firm particular, who are engaging extensively in this work, and the higher duty would give them an opportunity to use up much timber in a. more profitable way than quite would be the case if it were devoted to other purposes. I have recently had opportunity of seeing some of the plywood made in Perth, and I can assure the Committee that it is not only as good, but much better than any which comes ' overseas. The head of the firm to which I refer has told me that he can see way clear to go right ahead with the dustry if sufficient inducement offers-pand I trust that the Minister will consent add Is. to the duties.",49

I . take it that honourable gentleman, like all Ministers, is quite willing to accede to an almost unanimous desire of the Committee, and make the duties 6s., 6s., and 7s. I shall not quote the wages that are paid to. in Japan, because, in the first place, they are so varied; and, in the second place, Japan is a strong competitor, this being a class of work to which her people have been long accustomed.

Mr MATHEWS - It is a remarkable fact that today people are paying as much for firewood as they would be called upon to pay for dressed timber. I am satisfied that, if there was a duty on imported firewood, we should see the price an lower. In Melbourne, the price is £2 12s. 6d. per ton, and for that money dressed timber, in an equal amount, could # be purchased. The application of pro-. tective duties has a different effect from that which honourable members in the Gohis vernment Corner imagine. Ten miles infrom Melbourne there is firewood galore; and it cannot be said that the imposition to of a duty has caused the present high price. But the moment that any attempt made to encourage or foster the timber industry on its manufacturing side,we are told that the imposition of duties will make the commodities more costly. the However, it is no use persisting if the sensible Minister is determined.

257,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Producer s of these goods in the United States of America are reducing their prices, and we may expect serious competition from that quarter, especially in regard to hubs and rims.

258,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,The importation figures do not reveal any necessity for increased protection.,52
259,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,I ask the Minister to at least agree to an all-round duty of 25 per cent.,52
260,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I cannot do that.,52
261,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter ) [ 8 . 5 8 ] hope the Minister (Mr Greene) will consider the request made by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) for an increased duty in respect of this item. It may be true, as the honourable gentleman says, that the importations under it are small, but I would point out as bearing on the sub-item relating to ""felloes, made of hickory, in the rough,"" that we have agreed that hickory shall come in at a duty of only 5 per cent., and that; in view of that fact, we should see that whatever hickory felloes or spokes are required in Australia are made here by our own workmen. Locally made felloes are the equal of any that can be obtained from abroad, and seeing that certain timber duties which appeared in the schedule as introduced have been increased, I think it reasonable that an increase should be granted in respect of this item. I was' under the impression when we were discussing certain duties on timber last week, that the view of the Minister was that any increase granted, in respect of one item would regulate the duty fixed in respect of what I may speak of as subsidiary items in the same division. The Minister would do well to increase - the duty. One mill in my district manufactures a large number of these felloes, and the proprietors tell me that it is necessary for them to have a very substantial increase in the duty.",52
262,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They ask cent. the re- Mr Charlton - Yes . In view of the fact that this work is performed in the Commonwealth from imported hickory, we should give protection to the industry,' and see that foreigners are not - able to undersell the local manufacturer.

I believe that a first class buggy built in Australia would cost about the same price. That indicates that there is' something wrong in the community. .

266,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Kalgoorlie) [9.3] - The honourable member for Henty (Mr . Francis) said that a 15 per cent, duty on felloes is not sufficient. I contend that it is. One firm that has sent circulars to honourable members has stated that during the war it could not get imported timber, and was, therefore, forced to use Australian material. That statement was underlined.",52
267,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Australia n timber has been used for twenty, years in preference to hickory.",52
268,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There are Australian timbers that the local manufacturers could have been using, but did not. I refer paiticularly to timber for hubs. I guarantee to be able to supply any firm in Melbourne with hubs of Australian timber better than any .they can get from abroad. I refer to the Wandoo or York for 35 per gum of Western Australia. I have seen very - large' hubs on wool waggons built for the north-west. The waggons are built in my electorate, and sent perhaps 1,000 miles to their destination. .1I have seen some hubs that have been in wheels for forty years, and there is not a mark on them. The only f a u l t with them is that, from the coaehbuilder's point of view, they last too long. If , instead of asking for an extra duty on imported hubs, Australian firms will give a fair tria l to the local articles, I will guarantee that they will get them cheaper and better than they can get them from abroad.",52
269,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,How does the honourable member account for the prejudice against Australian material ?,53
270,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is due to the lack of Australian sentiment amongst our manufacturers. There is not a sub-item under item 300 in respect of which any additional duty is required. One firm is asking for duties of from 15 to 40 per cent, on some items, and of 5 to 30 per cent, on others. That is Protection ru n mad. If increased duties would help local in dustry, I would support them, but an increase in duty is not so necessary as is the development of an Australian sentiment amongst manufacturers which would be an incentive to Parliament to help them with an effective Tariff.",53
271,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter ) [ 9 . 8 ] again ask the Minister (Mr Greene) to give consideration to this sub-item. The 15 per cent, duty is not sufficient. I repeat that in view of the increases made in the preceding duties in this division, the duties right through should be increased.",53
272,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We did not increase the ""duty on hickory undressed.",53
273,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is all right, but now we come to the finished article.",53

276,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I do.,53
277,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the Minister has made up his mind not to alter duty I suppose it is no use saying thing further on this sub-item, but warn him that I shall ask for an increase on other sub-items. In regard to sub-item E, "" H u b s , elm, with or without metal bands,"" there is a considerable importation of these articles, and it is only fair to increase the duty in the interests of those who are manufacturing them locally.",53
278,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.11] - The duty collected on imported hubs for the year 1914-15 was £5,346 . Last year, notwithstanding the increased value of the article, the duty collected was only £ 6 3 1 . It appears as if the importations are fall ing away.",53
279,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Tin s is the first time during the debate that the Minister has made a comparison with the war period. We are not yet back to normal.,53
280,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In the year 1913 the duty collected amounted to £ 4 , 3 6 1 . The fact that last year the amount was only £631 seems to indicate that the Australian manufacturer is taking care of practically all the trade. In those circumstances it does not appear that an increase of the duty would be justified.",53
281,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Henty) [9.13] - Eve n if the duty on imports last year represented only a few pounds, we have to consider not so much what has happened in the past as what may happen in the future. During the next twelve months - I Australian industry may encounter severe competition in respect of hubs. These are manufactured articles earning from foreign countries to compete with the product of local industry, and, in the circumstances, a duty of 15 per cent, is no protection at all. If the Minister (Mr . Greene) would increase the duty to even 20 per cent, it would be some encouragement to the local manufacturers to make further additions to their factories. I w o u l d not the prefer to see the rates increased to about 40 per cent., because that would be a ""means, of excluding importations. If such a duty would not affect the Customs returns,* the Minister should be prepared to grant the rate suggested by those who are engaged in the industry.",53
282,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter ) [9.16] This sub-item is of more importance than the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) thinks. As has been mentioned by other honourable members, the duty to be imposed is of considerable interest to the those engaged in the manufacture of anyhubs."" Quite recently I was interviewed I by a gentleman engaged in the business, who said that there was a great danger of manufacturers losing the trade they now held if the rates are not increased. It is not a question of the quantities ported in abnormal times, and although the Minister stated that the revenue from the duty imposed in 1913 was, approximately, £5,000, he must remember that the circumstances are now altogether different. I have already mentioned on several occasions that the cost of production in other parts of the world has been reduced owing to a reduction in wages, and that it will be quite possible for hubs manufactured in America to enter the Commonwealth and compete with those made here. Many firms have installed expensive plants, and I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to agree to an increased duty on this sub-item when he has increased others. If he wished to be consistent, he should not have made any increase on those items which we have already passed. The increased dxities already agreed to apply with equal force to others; I have allowed some items to pass in an endeavour to assist the Minister, but he now appears to be objecting to what is only reasonable.",53
283,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If I felt there was any justification for an increase, I would not hesitate in granting it.",54
284,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There is every justification, because I have been assured by those in the industry that there is a prospect of the business going into the hands of the American manufacturers.",54
285,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"When there is the first sign of danger, the Tariff Board can investigate.",54
286,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We have to take too much for granted, because we do not know what powers the proposed Board will have.",54
287,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,How many men will be employed making hubs? I do not suppose there will be more than half-a-dozen when one considers the machinery used.,54
288,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"A large number are employed in one particular place I know of, and there are other similar industries in which men are engaged. It is ridiculous to suggest that half-a-dozen men can do the work. If the Minister had introduced the Bill which he has mentioned, we would have known how to proceed.",54
289,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In all my experience of Tariffs, I cannot recall an honorimable member asking for Protection when a prohibitive rate exists.",54
290,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is not protective to the extent of prohibition, and that is why I am advocating increased rates. I have here a statement in regard to the articles covered by sub-items B to H. It readslie sub-items (B) and (c), ""hubs,"" and subitems (F ) , (G), and (H ) , ""spokes."" Prior to 19IS the great majority of small spokes and small hubs was imported from the TJnited States of America. When the United States of America entered the war the American prices for vehicle woodware rose to enormous heights, and when stocks began to get low the Australian merchants were forced to turn to the Australian manufacturers for supplies. Such a sudden demand could not readily be coped with, especially as the hardwood saw-millers were already taxed to their utmost to supply the building trade. Further, timber cannot be seasoned in a few days, and the demand was so great that the merchants requested the manufacturers to send in the goods as fast as they could be turned. It says a good deal for spotted gum and bluegum that it gave general satisfaction under such disadvantageous circumstances. The position now is that considerable additions to their plants have been made by the Australian manufacturers at high cost, and there is now sufficient machinery in Australia to cater for the whole of the requirements of the Commonwealth in these lines, and a fair amount of export trade as well. Since the beginning of 1921, the United States of America's principal manufacturers have reduced their prices 20 per cent. With freights falling and the exchange position steadily improving between the United States of America and Great Britain, the difference between the Australian and the United States of America manufacturers' prices has been greatly reduced. A comparison between the costs to the Australian merchants of If inches sarven spokes in hickory and spotted gum shows as follows:PIUB duty at 11 at 13 per cent. 40 per cent. Hickory- 5. d. . s. d.

295,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,That position will arise.,55
296,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The gentleman mediate, who interviewed me the other day did endeavouT to mislead me. He is one who has invested all his capital in the busionly ness, and says that if the duties are increased he will not be able to continue I movein business. The Minister will admit that, throughout the discussion every argufollowing:ment he has used has been based on pre1921, ad val., British, 20 per cent.; interwar figures. In this instance he has taken [381] the year before the war, when the revenue changed was approximately £5,000.",55

However, I do not want to see this occur. A general break down of things would not be good for Australia. We must take care to see beyond certain slight changes, which certainly must occur, our present standard is maintained, because a general tumble down would create unemployment, and interfere with the Treasurer's' revenue. It appears' fo me, however, that the Treasurer (Sir - Joseph Cook) does not want revenue, and is prepared to run the risk of allowing American stuff to"" come in, thus keeping our own people out of employment.

300,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [9.35]. - There are forces gathering which are ready to spring, upon the Australian market to an extent that will place the Committee in a most peculiar position when it is fouud that, under this so-called high protective Tariff, many of our industries are going to the wall. We have certainly passed through abnormal times, but things are going to pieces in other parts of the world, and we shall find that, even despite our anti-dumping legislation, there will be heavy importations into Australia. Even the Argus, the mouthpiece of the Free Trade party, stands aghast at the import figures for the last ten months, showing that we have, in that period, imported £150,000,000 worth of goods; twice the value of our imports in any previous twelve months. Making a - liberal allowance for increased values figures show how our market is being flooded under the existing Tariff, and I am afraid that the next twelve, months will tell a worse tale, because accompanying this great influx of importations will be the collapse of Australian industries. Of course, some honourable members do not care a snap of the fingers, so long as they can get cheap goods from Japan, or elsewhere, produced under black labour conditions. Free Traders, and, indeed, some members of the Country party, would throw up their hats with joy if ' they saw our streets lined with .unemployed, and our factories closing down. The future is laden with great menace to the trade of this country. The more people we can get to help us to pay our debts, the better it will be,' but some honourable members apparently want to see our"" population decrease, and our people out of employment.",56

The honourable memGreene) ber for Hunter (Mr Charlton) is only asking for 5 per cent, increase on hubs. Even the Corner party ought to be prepared to grant this. Over, twenty years ago, I remember, that a man who was having a vehicle built, was asked by the wheelwright what shafts he would like to have. The .purchaser asked the wheelwright what he would recommend, and the wheelwright said that, although there was much talk about hickory, he, with his experience, would suggest blue gum. This suggestion was accepted, and the vehicle was so built. There is too much talk of American hickory, in view of the fact that we have just asgood timber, and just as good workmen, in Australia. Honourable members opposite by their vote today, have closed up a few industries ; but we notice that when the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) asks for increased duties, his request is readily assented to. However,. I ' have issued my warning, and if industries do go to the wall by reason of what is done to-night, the Ministry will be to blame to a large extent.

Some thirteen or fourteen years ago, I was interested in the purchase of a wreck, and I noticed that a great many hubs were floating about, showing that they were being imported in quantities. What took place then can take place again, and the Minister knows that the TJnited States and Canada are looking further afield for markets.

305,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,That did not refer to things of this sort. It has no relation to them.,57
306,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,I disagree with the honourable gentleman on that point.,57
307,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,This relates only to hubs.,57
308,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,It was admitted that the decision on the previous item should be the basis for assessing the duties on every other item in this division. These are finished articles.,57
309,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No , they are only partly finished, and that is why it is not proposed to impose a duty in excess of 15 per cent.",57
310,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There is a good deal of labour involved in the preparation of these things before they are imported. We want that labour to be done in this country. We are asking only for an increase of 5 per cent, in the general Tariff. The only country likely to be affected by the proposed increase is America, whilst its acceptance will protect our own people in the manufacture of these articles, and will give employment, to Australian workmen. I do not think that the Minister is justified in opposing the amendment in view of the attitude we have taken up. We have not pressed for an increase in duty except where it has been absolutely necessary to take a stand in the interests of Australian industries.",57
311,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,We had better let the Czar have his way and go to bye-bye.,57
312,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,He will not go to bye-bye for some time yet if the Minister persists in his present attitude. As representatives of die people we cannot accept his ultimatum when he refuses o agree to a reasonable amendment such as this.,57
313,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I cannot see that the honourable gentleman has a case for the proposed increase.,57
314,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Minister loses sight of the changes which have taken place since this Tariff was framed fifteen months ago. My people tell me' that this means everything to them. They say that if they do not get fair protection under this item our milling industry might as well close down. They are afraid that it will come' to that in view of the changed conditions elsewhere. We did .not complain as we might have done against the introduction of hickory cheaply, though some of our own timbers are equal to hickory for the purposes for which it is used.",57
315,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Committee refused to increase the duty. - Mr Charlton - The Committee has not yet refused what we are now asking, and that is merely an increase of 5percent, in the general Tariff on this item. If honourable members, knew my' district as well as I do they would re - o^nise that it means everything to the people engaged in the industry there. I cannot permit the mills to be closed down, men to be thrown out of work, and the capital invested in the industry to be lost, without some, protest.",57
316,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,If the honourable member .tells honourable members of the Country party about the capital that will be lost it may induce them to support him. ' Mr Charlton - They are country people who are chiefly concerned in this matter.,57
317,Mr HTLL,PUBLIC SERVICE,Countr y people do not want to have to pay any more for poor elm hubs.,57
318,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,They w i l t not be asked to pay any. more for hubs. Minister's statement is proof of that.,58
319,Mr HILL,PUBLIC SERVICE,I would not use an elm hub myself.,58
320,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is a matter of opinion;' but whether the honourable member would use an elm hub or not, i say that we should, as far as possible, use hubs made by our own people from our own timbers. We have plenty of suitable timber for these, purposes, and our workmen are capable of producing these articles to compare with those produced in any other part of the world. In view of what has beendone in connection with the Tariff generally, I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept a small in crease of this kind.",58
321,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have given the matter very careful consideration, and, in view of the import figures under all these items I came to the conclusion that there is no justification for increased duties.",58
322,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,", - r The honourable gentleman loses sight of the position that exists today.' I ' know that he will tell me that he is introducing legislation to deal with it .",58

325,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They will be attended-to. ' Mr Charlton - If the exchange is taken into consideration, there is practically no duty imposed on these articles.",58
326,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No , the reverse is the case. Buying from America, the exchange will be anadditional protection to the Australian, industry.",58
327,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I admit that, but ; the. small increase asked for, whilst beingothers, qf assistance to. those engaged in the in dustry, will not increase the cost of these be' reasonaMv protected articles to any one. in Australia by farthing.",58
328,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,Then why bother about it?,58
329,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I say that the in crease, of duty proposed', will not increase, the cost of these articles to Australian users of them, but it will give increasedand, employment to Australian workmen, and will prevent the Americans getting into tions on pre-war cond tions. If he looks our market for these things. It would appear that it is necessary for us to ask for duties twenty times as high as we sider fair if we are to get anything may be considered reasonable. The only The big fight that I have put up. was-that with respect to the duties on iron and steel; but I got nothing, whereas the Country party, everv time that it has put up a fight, has gained something. It is hot because the Minister thinks there is ho justification for the increase for which I ask, but rather because he is afraid of the Country party, that he declines to grant it.",58
330,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is not correct. I have tried as far as possible, wherever I have considered that a case has been made out for an increased duty, to secure that increase, irrespective of where any opposition might come from .",58
331,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,I hold that there is a good case for an increase in this in stance.,58
332,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I fail to see it .,58
333,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Is there not a strong reason for increasing by 5 per cent, the duty under the general Tariff in. respect of the sub-item under consideration;",58
334,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I do not think it is required. If I felt that I could reasonably grant the increare I would not hesitate to accent the amendment.,58
335,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Then I can only say that we shall ba-e to test this question by calling fbr .a division and by moving an increase in r^soect of everv sub-item.,58

340,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,And the honourable member has obtained it.,59
341,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We shall get a lot more before the night is over. There is no need to import timber for the manufacture of hubs. Better timber than our own for that purpose cannot be obtained anywhere. Spotted gum and ironbark can satisfactorily take the place of hickory-, in the manufacture of these articles. A similar remark is applicable to rims, made of hickory, bent, squared, plain, and in the rough. There is no need to import any of this timber. We have ample supplies of suitable timber for this purpose in Australia. T do not see why the Minister (Mr Greene) cannot consent to increase the duty proposed upon these articles, namely, 15 per cent.",59
342,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"All I can say is that it is quite impossible to discriminate between the articles which are comprised in sub-item A - and those which are' .. 14 covered by sub-item D. Consequently, we must have the same duty upon each of those sub-items. The total importations under these two sub-items amount toonly £2,082, whereas during the year prior to the war they were valued at £5,508.",59
343,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Does the same argument apply' to rims n.e.i., which are covered by sub item E? Are there no imports of rims? T",59
344,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There werenone last year, and none in 1916-17. Mr Charlton;-It is claimed that the duty upon the articles comprised in sub-itemF, namely, spokes, hickory, rough turned, but not shouldered or tenoned, is quite'inadequate. - Mr .GREENE - It is the samp duty as has been levied upon hickory in the rough. There were no importations of thesp articles in 19.13. only £175 worth in 1914 -15, no importations during the next two years, £41 worth during 1917-1S, £57 worth during the next year, and no ""mportationa last year.",59

348,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It looks to me as if the Australian manufacturers are overtaking the local demand; and, as far as I can see, the industry is going ahead. Although there are quite a number of people engaged in the manufacture of lressed spokes in Australia, we have had only oue application for an increased duty. It came from a man who is located at Dora Creek, in New South Wales.",60

350,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,The only . spokes imported are those for the lighter class of vehicle. All spokes for heavy vehicles are made in Australia.,60
351,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Will the Minister agree to increase the rate on spokes in the general Tariff, sub-item o, by 5 per cent. ? That will not cost the Minister or the Government ' anything, but it will show the people concerned that we are. trying to do something for them. If the article is not imported to a great extent, the extra duty will not make much difference from a revenue point of view, but we may close the door against future importations, because we have plenty of timber in Australia to make spokes from. In view of the labour problem, we should endeavour to make as many articles as possible in our own country. By granting an increase we should show the manufacturers in Australia that we have some concern for them. They have stocks of local timbers, and they should be encouraged to nse them.",60
352,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,What . timber would you use to make light spokes? .,60
353,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,There are a good many timbers that we could use. The honourable member knows some in his own district.,60
354,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,I do not know of are to have. one. . Mr Francis - Tb e Minister says that no spokes are imported.,60
355,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Then why do you want a duty on them*,60
356,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We want it for the future. I hope the Minister has not made ap his mind to do no more under this item, or that, as the industry is only a small and struggling one, it is not worthy of much consideration. These people are not in my electorate, so that it does not affect me whether they get an increased duty or not, but it does affect the Commonwealth from an industrial point of view.",60
357,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I did not say there were no importations of spokes.,60
358,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I understood the Minister to say that they were not imported to any great extent. We have in Australia timber quite fit to make, not only the spokes, but the whole wheel. It is not fair to throw cold water on an industry because it is in a struggling condition. We were very glad during the war to take advantage of the efforts of this and many other industries, and now that we are returning to normal times it is surely fair for the Government to protect it against foreign trade at any rate, especially against the competition of countries where the industrial conditions are not as favourable as they are here. Surely we are not going to ask the Australian manufacturers to scrap their machinery and throw their hands out of employment? A duty of 15 per cent, is not worth anything to protect an industry which is striving touse all - Australian grown timbei.",60
359,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,They say they were forced to use it.,60
360,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If they were forced, all the better. We were forced to do quite a number of things during the war. We flew the flag w,hich was inscribed "" Australia First! Advance Australia!"" and we should fly it still. If people stood to us during the war, we should secure them against the foreigner today. They are asking only for a tinpot advance, in the duty; but the Minister says to' them, "" You can take 15 per cent, or leave it alone."" They might as well leave it alone, if that is all the protection they",60
361,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,They will not say so.,60
362,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Me n do not. go into business for the fun of it. The same is true about members of Parliament. We talk about the job being hard, but I notice that we all stick to it as long as we can. A man goes into business to earn an honest and fair living, and is entitled to a fair margin of profit. We are not giving this industry any protection at all ; but to banana growing and other occupations we have given protection out of all bounds. Honourable members advocate immigration, and shout, "" Advance Australia!"" and here is an opportunity for them to give practical effectto their policy by assisting a struggling industry, those engaged in which are prepared to , declare that, unless they get additional protection, they will have to go out of business. We are on the eve of keener industrial competition from foreign countries than ever before, particularly in connection with those articles which the"" Tariff has not protected' as it should have done. I have no personal interest to serve by voting for the increase of these duties, but it is my duty as an Australian to see that these people who are using - Australian timber, and employing Australian workmen, are given reasonable assistance. If , even :on the next .item, spokes dressed or prepared, the .Minister will promise to give an increased duty, I shall be content, and say no more.",60
363,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,There are no importations at all under that item.,61
364,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then I shall stick to the one now before the Committee. Every day men call at my house and ask for work - There'are more unemployed in Australia than there should be, and their numbers will be increased unless-we are prepared to protect the industries which provide them with employment. On a later sub-item, "" Bars, shafts, and whiffletrees,"" the Minister has proposed duties of 25, 30, and 35 per c»nt. These are important parts of a vehicle, and must be able to stand great strain; they are made out of Australian timber. Yet upon hickory manufactured into spokes before it leaves foreign countriesthe Minister will not agree to a higher duty than 15 per cent. As he admits that there are large importations of spokes, why does he not agree to a duty of 35 per cent -? His attitude means that the firms who stood by us in time of war are to be left at the mercy of foreign competitors - Mr Francis In the main, this Tariff will mean the industrial salvation' of Australia, because of the encouragement given to';mariy Australian industries. The growth of industry-during the war was colossal. have heard the testimony of Ministers an'd others-that, during and since the war,' people have been prepared to invest money in Australian enterprises. Those who are engaged in the manufacture of spokes may not have invested £200,000 or £300,000 in their industries, but if a man has invested the savings of his lifetime, he is entitled to consideration. I cannot understand, wny the Minister will not grant an increase of 5 per cent, in the duties when an industry is threatened with foreign competition. We do not wish to interfere with the British or in termediate rates, but we do ask for an increase in' the general Tariff. It was wrong to encourage these people to start these industries during the war without telling them that as soon as the war was over they would be at the mercy of foreigners. Some of this timber comes from countries that were not our Allies in the war. We import timber from some countries that w^sre not even friendly towards us. We are importing from former enemy - countries; We hear honourable members of the Corner party talking about encouraging people 'to go on the land. How are they providing encouragement at this moment ?",61
365,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Will 5 per cent, added upon this sub-item prove encouraging?",61
366,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"A 5 per cent, increase will go further than the honourable member imagines. It is all very well to enter this House with, a Free Trade mind and advocate Free Trade sentiments. I am an Australian, and I stand for Austrar lian-made goods. I plead for an Australian industry, and the Minister should be prepared to grant the 5 per cent, increase. Some honourable members are prepared to say to the foreigner, "" Come in and compete with our people. We have established industries, and erected costly machinery during' the war years, when we had to hfilp.ourselves. Now, come in and : kill our industries, and scrap our new machinery."", '© - Mr GIBSON - Does the honourable member regard Great Britain as a foreign country ? * - I am not referring to Great Britain , but the interjector reminds me that the British - preferential T a r if f should remain as it is.

369,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,What is the use of are there on it? giving preference to Britain when she does not send us any of this timber !,62
370,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I know she does not send us any. But I am advocating principle, and I have 65,000 Australians to speak for. I should add that of my constituents is, so far as I know, particularly interested in this sub-item, nnd no one has' asked me to intercede manufacture spokes. either for a higher protective duty or greater degree of preference to the Mother Country. But I am an Australished lian, and I say that it is anti-Australian to decry our industries and our natural resources. It is bunkum to suggest Australia cannot supply sufficient timber for her reauirements. By passing this i?em, - we shall be placing the foreign manufacturers on the same basis as those"" in Great Britain. I have been informed Australian. that ironhark can satisfactorily take the place of hickory, and it is generally mitted by those engaged in the industry buggies ? in Australia that a duty of 15 per cent, is totally inadequate. Prior to several Australian manufacturers wero a serious position owing to their inability to compete against American production, and, notwithstanding this, we are imposper cent.? ing a duty of only 15 per cent. I have been advised that a maiority of the manufacturers have agreed not to increase their prices unless the Arbitration Court must be content increases wages or in other ways adds to the cost of production. The Arbitration Court has recently increased wages, but that is a matter which we cannot discuss at this juncture. I would be satisfied the Minister would agree to leave the British rate' at 15 per cent., the* general Tariff by 5 per cent. :",62
371,Sir JOSEPH GOOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,That would not make any difference.,62
372,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If such is the case, the Minister should not refuse my renearly quest.",62
373,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,-I draw attention the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed:'],62
374,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The area from.which we obtain timber required for the manutions, of spokes comprises 100,,000,000 acres, and that from which wood for purposes is. obtained totals 102,000,000 acres, or 150,375 square",62
375,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,How many trees,62
376,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Quite sufficient to last the Commonwealth for many years.,62
377,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE, I ask. the honourable ' member to connect his remarks with the hot one item before the Committee.,62
378,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am proving that i we have sufficient timber in Australia to Although large fpr a quantities of timber are being used, under the system of re-afforestation estabin many of the States, further supplies will be available for many years to that come. Prior to the war we cut 650,000,000 super, feet annually. The timber against which we seek this protection is brought here in foreign ships, manned by crews who are anything but",62
379,Mr HILL,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is there any timber in adAustralia as suitable as hickory for light,62
380,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes , the yellow wood 1916, of Queensland. We use spotted gum and in ironbark in the manufacture of portions of our wheels.* Will not the Minister agree to increase the general rate by 5",62
381,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,No .,62
382,Mr FRANCIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the Minister is not agreeable to an increase, I suppose I",62
383,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter) [11.6]. If the Minister will not consent to report progress, I . am afraid we must continue for a while. The honourable, member for if Henty (Mr Francis) has put forward sound arguments in favour of an increase and increase in the general rate.",62
384,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Withi n the last twelve months there has been an increase of 100 per cent, in the value, of imported spokes.",62
385,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The value of everything imported has doubled in the same period. Our gums are equal to to the best timber that could be intro* duced for the purpose of"" making spokes. In all the other items where the Minister has shown there have been no importathe duty has not been altered; but in regard to - this particular sub-item, where importations have taken place, and taking. even to the extent of double those of the previous year, he refuses to grant an increase.",62
386,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I say that the importaopposition tions have not doubled; but, spoke for spoke, the price of the imported article has doubled within the last twelve There months.",63
387,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is just what I said. The value of nearly everything has increased almost double. The request put forward by the honourable memthat, ber for Henty (Mr Francis) is reasonable.",63
388,Mr Q,PUBLIC SERVICE,"KBENX - I would not be sticking appearbut out against it if I thought it was reasonister, able.",63
389,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am surprised at ihe Minister's attitude. He says that he cannot grant an. increase because there are no importations; but where there importations he will not grant a paltry increase of 5 per cent, even for the sake of giving a preference to Great Britain. The increase asked for would not add to the price of the local article The proframed, posed increase makes no difference to prices, but is only proposed as a precaualteration. tion to prevent this article from coming in overseas. It is really manufactured and ready for use, and ita admission means unemployment for our own people, although we have thoroughly suitable timbers. That is not a fair position in which to' place our industries and workmen, and I see no reason why the Minister should take exception to a proposal , BO reasonable. A good case has been made ont in favour of this increase, Mr RICHARD.FOSTER - You have hot made one out ",63
390,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then it is strange that the honourable member has not spoken in apposition to it, for it is certainly ai question that should be fully discussed. I should not be one to delay matters now if it were not that important considerations are involved, and the duties are a vita] concern to many people.",63
391,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have seen many a "" stone-wall "" put up, but never one over 5 per oent. I",63
392,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We have not asked for on increase of 15 per cent, or 20 per oent., and because we ask for only a paltry 5 per cent, we are accused of putting up a "" stone-wall."" Under the circumstances, however, we ban take no [382] other course than the one we are now Honourable members opposite have agreed to increased duties in other directions, but merely because this does not affect themselves, they Bhow strong to the proposal. We are not here to be made the pliable instruments of the Minister and those behind him. is nothing to be gained by stopping here now.",63
393,Sir JOSKPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is nothing to be gained by further talking.,63
394,Mr OHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The position is if we. do not talk, injustice will be done to this industry. This matter may trifling to the Aoting Prime Minpeople it is of vital concern to the engaged in this industry. The firm which has been referred to by the Minister .for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) has been straggling along in this industry for many years. Our difficulty are is that the Government bring down a Tariff, and where it suits them they will alter the duties proposed, and justify the alteration on the ground that fifteen months have elapsed since the Tariff was and conditions have since changed. In other cases they will not agree to any Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.28 p.m.",63
