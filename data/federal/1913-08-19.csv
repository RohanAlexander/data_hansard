1,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [3.3] - B y leave, I return to the subject which was engaging the attention of the House when we adjourned last Friday, the condition of the rura l workers of Australia. I take up the argument at the stage which it had reached in my reply to the honourable member for Boothby, who referred to the condition in which he had found our r u r a l workers, and suggested that it was necessary for the intelligent section of the community to go to the help of the less intelligent, and secure their emancipation. I am solicitous that honourable members should know the true conditions existing between our farmers and their workers. They are conditions of harmony and satisfaction. We have had it stated on unimpeachable authority that the effective wages of the Australian workers have decreased. W it h that statement. I am in agreement, except so far as our r u r a l workers are concerned. In my opinion, the effective wages of the r u r al workers of Australia are relatively better than the effective wages of any other of our workers. Farm hands, for the most part, live for the whole year round on the holdings on which they are employed, and conditions that contribute to raise the cost of living affect their employers rather than themselves. If honourable members take a survey of the conditions prevailing in our rural districts, they will see that probably 90 per cent, of our present farmers began life years ago as far m workers.",13
2,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,That is as it should be.,13
3,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Yes. Whatever laws may be made for the administration of the lands of Australia-and land legislation is, of course, within the province of the State Parliaments-the y should be framed to make it easy for the far m worker of today to become the farmer of tomorrow. I venture the suggestion that the f a rm worker will be better assisted to the acquirement of a f a rm of his own by the co-operation of his employer than by the creation of antagonism between him and his employer. The honourable member for Boothby said that he had known the f a rm workers' working time to extend over sixteen hours.",13
4,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,At certain periods of the year.,13
5,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"On the average, the farm labourer's hours do not exceed eight a day. I make that statement on my own authority, and base it on my pracThat experience has been gained by leaving the entire work on my holding to the men I employ there.",13
6,Mr WEST,Unknown,Why are the farmers afraid of the' Arbitration Court if the conditions of their workers are' so good 1,13
7,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I repeat what I have already said, that I think that the Commonwealth A r b it r at i o n Court is. a body not well constituted to deal with the relations between farmers and their employee's. Conditions differ greatly in various parts of Australia; the lines of production differ, and farmers remain units throughout their enterprise. I have said that I do not object to reasonable organization by the rura l workers, hut the movement which is now said to come from them has not come from them. It has come from those who hope to benefit by stirring them up. At the present time there is a dearth of r u r al workers in Australia. I may well be asked why that is so, and I shall therefore anticipate and answer the question. It is because so many experienced rural workers have become farmers and possess farms of their own. If there be. any department of industry in which oo-operation and profit-sharing can be followed with advantage, it is farming, and. to a start upon tliose principles very many of our farmers the holdings that they possess. It is - within my certain knowledge that men without sufficient capital to obtain effective plant have been put into possession of land and equipped with teams by landholders to enable them to enter into profit-sharing agreements with them, with the result that many who years ago were merely rural labourers are today farmers possessing their own farms. I might venture the remark that for the industrial peace and welfare of Australia it would t)e well if this system were extended to many other avenues of industry. Some references have been made to the alleged degradation of the conditionof rural workers, but if there be one worker who more than another is brought into close relation with his employer it is the rural worker. In a great many cases he sits down to the same table, and in the farm-life of Australia today he is excluded from very few of the comforts of the home. I come now to deal with the question of the high cosb of living, which vitally affects all and particularly the workers of Australia. The Government are censured under this heading, and I might be excused for asking why censure on this account comes from a party who, if they desired to do so, had the opportunities during the past three years to do something towards reducing the cost of living in this country. Why did they not do so? Will any honourable member opposite tell me why they did not take steps to reduce the cost of living during the time they were in power ? Failing an answer, I am led to infer that they looked to the carrying of their referenda proposals to give them the power they desired for the purpose. The Australian people declined to place in the hands of any party in this Parliament the powers then sought for, and I should like to know whether it is on that account that our opponents support this motion of censure relative to the high cost of living. it not a fact known to every one in the community that the increased cost of living is a matter beyond the control of political parties? Ib is a world-wid'e tendency, and in this country I should say that 90 per cent, of the people have themselves contributed to the tendency. It is not confined to Australia. We have in this country aimed at a high standard of living, and time will prove whether the standard at which we have aimed is owe too high to be maintained. Personally, I should hesitate to support any movement to put back the hands of the clock of national or social progress, but I say that since each individual in the community contributes to the tendency to increase the cost of living, so each individual, if he chooses, may do something to reduce that cost. The question is everybody's question, and if every one faces it down will come the cost of living. We were told by honourable members opposite that their proposal to reduce the cost of living was to fix prices. I take one commodity, and I say that within two years the price of potatoes went up to £ 1 5 per ton, whereas the price is now down to 40s. per ton-abou t the bare cost of production. Migh t I ask in what direction the activities of our opjionents in politics would be exerted to now fix the price of that commodity?",13
8,Mr HANSIBVINE,Unknown,They are going to regulate the seasons.,14
9,Mr EODGERS,Unknown,"Exactly . The question is one of natural production, of supply and demand. Dealing now with the question of money stringency which has its effect upon every one in the community. The greatest factor in producing the money stringency affecting Australia in common with every other country in thp world is the pace of armament building, not by one, but by the whole of the nations of the world. Money is in this way taken out of production, and devoted to the building up of warships and armaments, and war chests, and human beings are removed from their proper sphere of economic activity. The national revenue of Australia is approximately £20,000,000 a year. Out of that, £5,500,000 is appropriated for defence purposes, and to that, by the way, I have no objection. Approximately, a further £3,000,000 is devoted to provision for the amelioration of the lot of the least fortunate in the community. Again, I have Is little objection to that expenditure, but I point out that an expenditure of over £8,000,000 out of a national income of £20,000,000 puts us up against the position that if we wish to be relieved from the condition of money stringency we must take action to extricate ourselves. I have no doubt that with common sense, energy, grit, and some sacrifices, Australians will be the first amongst the nations of the world to emerge from that condition. We have here great latent wealth and resources awaiting development. exercise of common sense, and by all Australians putting their shoulders to the wheel, we should have no difficulty in relieving ourselves from this position. Parliament is charged two duties in particular-first, of laws, and next the administration those laws. As one who has had little to do in the past with the making or administration of laws, I may be pardoned for saying that administration my judgment, engage much more of our attention, if it is to be made effective. The cost of has been too high, and we should look for more economy and greater I agree with the honourable gentleman who recently controlled the Home Affairs Department that business methods should be imported into many of our public departments. Dealing with the question of national insurance, I am pleased to be able to support the Government matter. I think that the scheme outlined in the memorandum placed before honourable members to make better for sickness, accident, maternity, hood, and unemployment is one which, on national grounds, is deserving of support. With my honourable friends opposite I hope we shall not in this country any introduction of the spirit of the poor laws. If honourable members be honest in their contention, and do not desire the enactment of poor laws in this country, they should assist the Government to pass a measure providing for contributory insurance which will be free from the objections urged against poor laws. They will agree to allow each person, while in the possession of good health and in the full enjoyment of all his faculties, to assist in building up a great national fund. Employer and employee making contributions, and the State assisting, a great national fund would be established from which provision may be made to meet the cases to which I have I propose now to speak of the Northern Territory, and I refer to it chiefly for the purpose of dealing with the matter of land tenure. The Northern is, perhaps, the most vulnerable spot in the whole of Australia, lying as it does nearest to the coloured the world. If we do not occupy and develop that country, we may take it as pretty certain that we shall find some one Mr Rodgers. else in occupation of it . We stand for By the a White Australia. I believe in the policy for two reasons, first of all because I would not be a party to tainting the white race, and next because I tliink we undesirable should not encourage the introduction to with Australia of people for whom we the making should consider it advisable to estabof lish an inferior set of conditions. While we have one code of laws affecting every man and woman in a nation we shall be on right lines. But, if we are to must, in govern the Northern Territory properly, common sense must prevail. I support the principle of a. grant of the freehold administration of such lands as are f it for occupancy alternating with the leasehold for such efficiency. land as can only be held in large areas for pastorai purposes. If the Northern Territory is to be peopled from the other portions of Australia, where the privilege of freehold obtains, we must grant liberal facilities there. I do not propose to occupy more of the time of the House, in this but express the hope that legislation will be passed in the interests of the people of this country. I have spoken from exprovision perience of contact with both sides in widow- politics. We have been told that there is a desire on the part of all parties to do the business of the country in this House. But I venture to say that so far have the country has not obtained what was promised to it . I trust that the spirit opposite of national co-operation will prevail, and result in good business being done in the interests of the people who have recently been put to considerable trouble and expense in determining the issues between the two parties in politics.",14
10,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [3.22] - Honor able members opposite-and I refer particularly to members of the Ministrywhen Parliament met in July raised a great outcry in regard to what they called their electoral scandals. I remember the honourable member for Henty going out on the warpath in his electorate, and saying that he intended to move for the appointreferred. ment of a Committee to inquire into these scandals.",15

19,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"It is impossible to "" make a noise "" in the press.  in Queensland.",16
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The right honourable member spoke of thousands of alleged duplications in Western Australia. Statements of the kind put me in mind of the story of the little boy who told his mother that there were "" thousands of cats in the garden."" When she said, "" Surely not , "" he said, "" We l l , there are hundreds."" And when she expressed doubt as to that statement, he said, "" Well, there is our cat and another."" But would it not be well for honourable members opposite, instead of talking about our alleged misdeeds, to pay attention to some of their own ? Have they made such a great success of their administration since they came into office that they need point to alleged faults of ours? If I may judge from the Commonwealth Gazette of the 26th July, which contains an announcement of the repeal of the Sugar Excise Act , I venture to say that they have lost to the Commonwealth and handed over to the rich Colonial Sugar Refining Company and other companies or many thousands of pounds. able members opposite may laugh, but we shall get at the t r u th of this matter before we have done with it . We have not all the information yet. What we know is that there . was over 5,000 tons of Australian sugar in bond in Sydney on the day of the repeal of the Act. There was also about 4,000 tons member's of Australian sugar in bond in Victoria, The figures for Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania are not yet available. No doubt the M in ister will in due course let us know how much the Government by tlieir maladministration and their financial incapacity - reall y those are fairl y mild terms- have lost to the Commonwealth and handed over to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",16

22,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Three-fourth s of the Excise that ought to have been paid on that sugar has gone to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Honourable members. I know as well as I do that that Excise should have been paid to the Commonwealth, but through the incapacity of Ministers in proclaiming the repeal of the Act as they did, the Commonwealth lost the money.",16
23,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Is it the honourable member's idea that we should have repealed the Bounty Act ouly?,16
24,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Minister should have his own ideas as to what ought to have been done. I certainly have mine. I believe that the Government know the mistake they made by this time. They know they have made a blunder.,16
25,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It seems worse than a blunder.,16
26,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They have blundered badly. Are the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the other companies in need of assistance? We find from the evidence taken by the Sugar Commission that the company will obtain about three-fourths of this Excise. Probably the Minister knows the exact amount upon which the company should have paid £A per ton to the Commonwealth. By the bungling of Ministers the taxpayers have been robbed of this large amount of money. To-day the Government are not paying the bounty to the growers who have earned it , simply persons because they neglected their duty in proHonor- claiming these Acts. The Minister of Trade and Customs asks me if I would have proclaimed only the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act , and if I would have allowed the proclamation in regard to the Sugar Excise Repeal Act to stand over for a time. Undoubtedly I would. There was no necessity for the Government to have proclaimed the two Acts on the same day. It was within the sands of pounds into their pockets. power of the Ministry under the provimust sions of the Customs Act to have kept bond the thousands of tons of sugar that were stored in Sydney, Brisbane, Milla20,000 quin, and elsewhere instead of allowing the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, would), thus be £80,000. the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company, Messrs.

31,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Did the honourable memtions. ber say that certain firms had made big dividends in consequence of the action of the Government? Mr ,TTJDOR - I did not. that the persons whom I have mentioned have benefited to the extent of thousands of pounds by the action of the Government in simultaneously proclaiming abolition of the Sugar Bounty and Sugar Excise Acts. This Parliament both of those Acts last year, and their abolition was to be proclaimed on a date to be fixed. There was nothing to pel the Ministry to simultaneously proclaim the abolition of the two Statutes. But in the Gommonwealth Gazette of 26th July last, we see that they did this, and they thus allowed these rich companies to put thouland It be remembered that upon every ton in of this sugar a bounty of £ 3 had been paid.

38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I would point out comthat interjections are disorderly.,17
39,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member asks whether we intended to proclaim the repeal of the Sugar Bounty Act . My answer is that we did intend to do so when we were satisfied that the QueensGovernment had conceded the conditions which were in existence, say, durthis ing the last sugar season.

I am well aware of the action taken by some of them, as well as by some of the Liberal candidates who were not returned, and I do not hesitate to say that no oue could justify them. I was going to speak about a person- I do not know whether he is a "" person "" whom they sent to oppose me, but I shall leave that matter for the present. the 13th instant the Leader of the Opposition asked in this House I wish to know from the Minister of Trade nnd Customs",19

60,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Then I shall not read the question. The Leader of the Opposition, on the 13th instant, asked the M in ister of Trade and Customs whether bounty had been paid to the growers who were asking for it , and he received a reply that the bounty was being withheld from the farmers until certain arrangements had been made. I freely admit that I did not know that the Ministry had been guilty of this act of gross negligence until I heard the Minister's answer. His reply caused me to look up the Gazette, and when I saw that they had proclaimed both Acts simultaneously, I realized that the Commonwealth had been taken down to the extent I have mentioned. Excise Branch of the Department of Trade and Customs keeps a record of everything in bond, so that we shall be able later on to find out exactly how many thousand tons of sugar have been taken out of bond. I am safe in speaking of 9,000 tons-5,00 0 tons, which were in bond in New South Wales, and 4,000 tons in Victoria. As crushing operations had started in Queensland, more must have I am been taken out there, so that I think that the amount which has been lost to the Treasury through the incapacity of the present Ministry is not less than £50,000, and will probably prove to be well over £100,000.",19

62,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Quite so. During the I referenda campaign, in 1911, the then honourable member for Indi stated at Wodonga that the Sugar Refining Company had contributed £50,000 to the fund to oppose the referenda, and that by the simple process of increasing the price of sugar it had more than recouped itself within a couple of days. The company will not have to' resort to any such expedient on this occasion. Let the M in ister bring before the House a return showing the quantities of Australian sugar in bond on 3rd A p r i l last, 31st May last-the date of the general election - the 30th June last, and on the 25th On July. If that be done, I am sure we shall find that there was a larger quantity in bond on the 25th July, the day on which this marvellous Government, having in its ranks five lawyers, proclaimed the The hon- Act, and allowed",19
63,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,So there should be. They were manufacturing.,19
64,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Of course, there was more. They were piling up sugar. Notice was given that the old Act was to be repealed, and they were trusting to the blundering of the Government",19
65,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Not blundering.,19
66,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They were trusting to my honourable friends opposite to realise that they should not have to pay all this money, and they were not disappointed. They have not had to pay it . What answer do the Ministry make to this charge? Not one has said a word. All are dumb. There is today no chorus of interjections.

69,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,I do not know.,19
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Giv e the honourable member for Yarra a piece of sugar.,19
71,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Othe r people have obtained some very big pieces. To use a slang expression I sometimes hear in my electorate, these companies have "" got a little of the dough,"" and they have got it to the extent of many thousands of pounds. As soon as I heard the Minister's reply to the question put by the. honourable member for Wide Bay, I compared the revenue returns for July of last year with those for July of the present year, and knew that unless at least £100,000 more was paid up this year on account of the repeal of the Excise duty, they were going to the bad. I found, however, that our revenue for July, 1913, was very little different from that received in July, 1912. I have not asked one question in connection with this matter. I have obtained my figures from the public press. Sydney Daily Telegraph publishes from time to time the quantities in bond in New South Wales, and I obtained from the Statistical Branch the figures relating to Victoria. I trust that the Minister will lay upon the table of the House full information as to the quantities in bond on the dates I have mentioned.",20

73,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It all depends. If honourable member asks me a question which I deem to be nasty, I shall, like my honourable friends opposite, ask him to give notice; but if , on the other hand, he asks a question off which I can score, I shall answer him. The honourable member may go ahead.",20
74,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"As the farmer and the workman seem to have been paid, it would appear, on the honourable member's own showing, that it is the Sugar Company that has fallen in .",20
75,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The only persons who have fallen in are those gentlemen who sit on the Treasury bench, and the taxpayer, who has suffered to the extent of many thousands of pounds. The bounty must have been paid in a great majority of cases, and I suppose that in nine-tenths of the cases it had been paid prior to this; indeed, some of the sugar may be that of last year in regard to which there had been neglect to collect the bounty. The Ministry have no right to occupy their positions five minutes after such an exhibition of incapacity, and a similar incapacity may be shown in other directions. All the time, however, the members of the present Government are looking round and raking up the files, in order to discover mistakes which may have been made by their predecessors, though I must pay the tribute to my successor that he has not done so in regard to the Department with which I was associated for three years. In any case, however, I am indifferent whether the honourable gentleman does so or not. The Ministry are more anxious to throw discredit on the late Government than to administer the Departments aright.",20
76,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Especiall y the Prime Minister and "" Bill y "" K e l l y !",20
77,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There are three of the Ministers who, apparently, do nothing else than attempt to throw discredit on the honesty and straightforwardness of their predecessors. They even dragged up The a trivial mistake in regard to the erection of some buildings in the Federal Capital, and also drew attention to the fact that a motor tractor purchased for the Federal Territory has occasionally gone wrong. On this latter point a carefully inspired question was asked, and a typewritten answer read. Yet at the same time they permit the great injustice to which I have referred, to be inflicted on the people of Australia, who are all in the terested. Will the Sugar Company reduce the price of sugar by the £ 4 or so per ton?",20
78,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,Certainly .,20
79,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that the Sugar Company will certainly do so ?,20
80,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,I hope so.,20
81,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I eay that the Sugar Company will certainly not do so; they will no more reduce the price of sugar than the honourable member himself would reduce the price of any commodity in which he is interested, if the Excise on that commodity were accidentally taken off.",20
82,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The honourable member is becoming quite a Free Trader.,20
83,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is what a candidate belonging to the Liberal side said at the last election, but the electors thought so little of him that they gave him only a few votes, and myself the rest. Every honorahla member will admit that a reply is required to the statements I have made. The Ministry cannot go on without replying.",20
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They do not intend to.,20
85,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,This question is apart from the fiscal question-it has absolutely nothing to do with Protection or Free Trade.,21
86,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That - accounts for the dispassionate way in which the honourable member is treating it?,21
87,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I admit I could have used language such as that used by honourable members opposite during the election campaign, but which ought not to be used in this House.",21
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"--The member has done pretty well, I think.",21
89,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I could have accused them, as honourable members opposite have accused honourable members on this side",21
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member does not call his language today abuse ?,21
91,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I certainly do not think that it is abuse; indeed, I should be quite prepared to take a vote of even honourable members opposite as to whether I have abused my position today. I accuse the Government of incapacity and financial blundering and bungling.",21
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And from behind the honourable member charges of corruption are made.,21
93,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Does the Prime Minister father all the statements of the honourable members who sit behind him ?,21
94,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Surely,21
95,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I am dealing with the Prime Minister at present. Is the honourable gentleman prepared to stand by the statements of all the honourable members behind him?,21
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I merely made a remark.,21
97,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And I merely made a remark back at the Prime Minister.,21
98,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"We are all free on this side, and no one can be responsible for us.",21
99,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There was a gentleman, Mr Speaker, who occupied the same honourable position as yourself in a State Parliament, and who, as a member of the Liberal party, desired to show a little of his independence. When he took the chair in that Parliament, I never knew a man who received fro m the press, or i r o m the men with whom he had been associated in Parliament, more abuse than he did on account of his display of independence. He was told that because he was independent, and would not come to heel at the crack of the whip, he would be opposed at the next election.",21
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Why doss the honourable member not complete the statement, and say that that was owing to contempt of the people who put him in the chair?",21
101,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If every honourable member is, as the honourable member for Werriwa says, independent, they will allow the man to whom I have referred the right to his independent honourable action, and if they do not do that, they show that they are just as much bound as the members of any other party in politics. The Prime Minister said that some honourable members on this side had charged the Liberal party with being corhonorable rupt. He desired to put that charge into my mouth, but I naturally declined to allow it . If I thought the Liberal Government and party were corrupt, 1 should say so; if I thought that the action to which I have referred had been done wittingly, I should go outside this House and say what I thought about them. As a matter of fact, however, I do not believe they knew what they were doing.",21
102,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,D.oe s the honourable member mean to say that the Attorney General did not know what he was doing?,21
103,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not think that they understand this question; and that is the most charitable view I can take. At any rate, they have allowed the public to bp robbed of thousands of pounds-no t less than £50,000, and probably more than £100,000.",21
104,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"And this is the first fruits of sound, economical government!",21
105,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If this is the first fruits, I do not wish to be here when the harvest is gathered, nor would I care to be over there.",21
106,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,It was not bad over there.,21
107,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I candidly admit that in the present position of affairs, the Ministry being only one up, and dependent, as the Prime Minister has said, upon the Speaker's vote- I shall deal with that in a moment or t w o - I would sooner be here than over there. I should not like to be hanging on by my eyebrows. Mr Speaker, I consider a statement made outside the House regarding the way in which you were going to vote was a reflection upon you, and your honourable office. I have read in the press the statement of the Prime Miuister, where lie has said that the Ministry are dependent upon the Speaker's vote. I consider it a reflection upon the honesty, the integrity, and the impartiality of the Speaker. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Would you mind reading that statement ? '",21
108,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have not the statement here, but at Wangaratta, at a banquet, a "" shivoo,"" or a tea party-mem bers can fil l in their own phrase, I have no objection to them putting in whatever phrase tliey like-the Prime Minister said that the Ministry could only hang on by the Speaker's vote.",22
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that not so ?,22
110,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The statement was that the Ministry could only hang on by the Speaker's vote.,22
111,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That they had an arrangement with the Speaker.,22
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is with it?,22
113,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is admitting that the Speaker is not impartial or absolutely fair.,22
114,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,It is admitting justice of our case.,22
115,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I will ask the honourable member for Yarra not to bring the Speaker into the discussion. It is quite irregular to do so, and the honourable member's good taste would surely show it to him.",22
116,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I had no intention of dragging you into the struggle, Mr . Speaker. I was objecting to your being dragged into it by the Prime Minister. I was endeavouring to protect you and your impartiality, and to believe that you will be fair. That is all.",22
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If you do not stop talking like that, I shall resign.",22
118,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am not afraid of that. I have sat in this Parliament with the honourable member for twelve years, and the thought that the honourable member is going to resign, and that we are to have an election, will not cause me any loss of sleep. However, I want to know what the Ministry are going to do about the bounty to these farmers, the bounty that has been properly earned by them.",22
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Hav e finished with that yet?,22
120,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . If the honourable member wishes me to finish dealing with this, I shall keep on longer, because it shows me that he is not enjoying it . Many hard things were written about me, especially in the Sugar Journal. They said more than the Age, which is saying a good deal. They denounced me for the attitude I took up in connection with the industry, but that very action has been endorsed by the Queensland Parliament, who are giving these men the wages they dauounced me for saying they should receive. I was denounced throughout Queensland for saying that the men should receive ls. an hour, but if I am to j'udge by the vote received by the party with which I am connected, they are nob sorry in Queensland for the decision made by the Ministry preceding the present Administration. I do not desire to refer to this again, when the Miuister of Trade ancl Customs returns to his place in the House, but I want to know why tliey do not pay the bounty. The honourable member for Richmond is also out of the chamber, probably keeping his eye wrong on the majority , because he is afraid that some of his party cannot stand this matter that has come up today.",22
121,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"That is hardly fair tactics. All your men are not here, so why call the attention to the absence of members from this side? I am surprised at you.",22
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,When the honourable member has been here a little time he will not be surprised.,22
123,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member for Richmond stated that the bounty was not being paid because of this no-confidence motion. Will any responsible Minister make the statement that the bounty is being held up on account of this no-confidence motion ? Do Ministers mean to say that they do not collect revenue or pay other bounties? It is absurd. No responsible Minister would make such a statement. I see that the Minister of Trade and Customs has returned to the chamber.,22
124,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I thought you said you had finished with that subject.,22
125,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is my fault . I said earlier in the debate that I wanted to know why the farmers were not being paid their bounty, and the honourable member for Richmond-the Government you not Whip-said , "" Finish this no-confidence motion, and it will be p a i d , "" thus trying to mislead the farmers into thinking that the bounty was being held up on account of the no-confidence motion. Will any Minister make that statement ?",22
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It was not a misleading statement in any way.,23
127,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Then is it correct that you are not paying the bounty on account of this no-confidence motion ?,23
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Ge t on.,23
129,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is an absolutely misleading statement to use. is being held up, and every member on the Government side knows it . Do M in isters mean to say they are not collecting revenue at the Customs Houses, or paying other bounties, during this debate on a no-confidence wheels of government are going round all the time, and Ministers will collect everything they are entitled to collect, and Gippsland ? they will pay the bounty to every person who is entitled to receive one. the reason they are not paying this bounty is because they neglected the Excise they Gippsland ? should have collected, and are trying to make some arrangement, admitting, as tory. the honourable member for Grampians states, they hav6 made a blunder by collecting the money. So they ing it out of the farmers by not paying the bounty.",23
130,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,I said that if they made a blunder I was quite certain they would make those who got the extra money disgorge.,23
131,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"-They cannot them disgorge. If they tried to do so, it would be admitting that they made a blunder. Once a duty is repealed, you cannot collect it . The lionorable member knows something about a certain class of article. Assume that he was getting in £ 1 0 0 worth of spirits, and that he had it in bond.",23
132,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The Customs A c not repealed. That is the difference.,23
133,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member does not understand. If he comes side when I have finished, I will take couple of hours trying to explain i him. I think I could easily explain it as to him in a couple of hours.",23
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You might be sorry.,23
135,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not think the Prime Minister would be sorry if I took the honourable member out for that length of time. I am anxious to get on with but my speech. I have devoted more time to this matter than I had intended to but no more than is necessary. More w be heard, not only here, bnt outside, of the action which Ministers have taken, or shall I say of their want of forethought.",23
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Incapacity !,23
137,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am not anxious to wear out one word like the honourable member does in going round the electorates, and saying "" This is my m a j o r it y . "" The bounty He reminds me of a gramophone which has ouly one record. He keeps on the record no matter where he is. If he goes to Gippsland he says, "" This is my maj o r it y . "" If he goes to Corio or to Wangaratta or to Riverina, he says the same motion 1 The thing.",23
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have not been to,23
139,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Did not the honourable But member go to the Farmers' Conference at Bairnsdale. and is not Bairnsdale in,23
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is ancient his,23
141,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is a visit by the honornot able member to Gippsland since he has are takbeen Prime Minister ancient history? The honourable member for Echuca, who, I am very sorry to see, is not in his place, stated at a meeting in Costerfield that Mr Fisher, Prime Minister, and Mr O'Malley, Minister for Home Affairs, were robbers. He accused them of taking money out of the Commonwealth Treasury and putting it in their make own pockets, and said there were men in gaol doing two or three years for lesser crimes than these Ministers had committed. I have that statement embodied in a statutory declaration signed by four men. I have another statement made by the honourable member for Gippsland, but I will keep it back u n t i l lie returns to the chamber. I desire now to refer to the statement of Ministerial policy which has t was been laid upon the table. First, Ministers say that they are going to have the elections pure. They made a great cry, outi t wil l be remembered, about the extena sive duplication of votes. I - have asked t to questions here over and over again to what action they intend to take regarding those persons who were alleged to have voted twice. I shall not trouble to refer to the position in any electorate other than my own. Of the forty-eight alleged cases of duplication of votes in my electorate, I do not believe that there is one genuine case, if there is, it is the duty of honourable members opposite to take action at once. do, I have gone carefullythrough the list ill which has been supplied to me by my scrutineer, and I know only one person out of the forty-eight names on the list, even by sight. No person I know of in E. M . K . the list has been connected with the Labour movement, even in a shadowy form. It is quite possible that many these persons may have voted Labour, just as it is quite possible they may have voted the other way, or informally. forty-eight persons on the list, twentyvenue eight are women, and twenty men. Honbreach orable members opposite went about makmembers ing the extravagant statement that this was a pre-arranged affair, and it was albut, leged that in one case a person had seventeen times. Why do they not prothey secute him ? What action are. they going to take regarding any of these alleged I duplications? In my electorate there are only six subdivisions and ten pollingfor booths. In four subdivisions there two polling places, and an elector can vote at either of them. opinion, the reason for the alleged cation is that the persons in charge, i their hurry, probably crossed off the wrong name. There are plenty of persons with ths same name in a subdivision. In tral Richmond, where there are about 10,000 persons, and about four pages are off i u mistake for his."" covered with the names of persons called Smith; there are, I suppose, a dozen more persons called John Smith, some of them following the same occupation some of them standing to each other i the relation of father and son, where mistake might easily have been made.",23
142,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Did any of the Smiths vote twice?,24
143,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes ; a Mr J. H . Smith, at North Richmond, is alleged to have voted twice. There happened to be BIX persons of that name on the roll for the subdivision. If the Government find that five of them voted once and one twice, then it is clear that there was case of duplication, but if one i r them did not vote at the election, then Ministers must admit that in all protion bability a mistake was made, and if they made their statement honestly they w i l acknowledge that they were led away the press, and that there was not the amount of personation alleged to have taken place. It is of give the full names of the other persons on this list, and so I will content myself with giving only the initials. persons bearing the same Christian and voted surname, there are nineteen cases, among more whom are the following:-T . F . , J . F . , E. H . , F . J ., J . C , A . R., and Three persons with the same Christian and surname have the initials E. S., aud one of these I know of by sight. From what I know of the only person who is alleged to have voted twice, I do not believe for a moment that that Of the person could be tempted by the whole reof the Commonwealth to commit a of the Electoral Act . Honourable on the other side have tried to make political capital out of this matter, as in the little incident I voted related, when they are bowled out,. admit that probably there were mistakes made on their own side. n the majority of cases, the supposed in stances of duplication are to be accounted by the enrolment of two or more are persons possessing the same Christian and surnames. This sort of thing occurred, In my too: On polling day a man came to my duplicommittee room in the morning, and n said, "" Frank, they will not let me vote."" I said, "" What is the matter?"" He replied, "" My name has been crossed off, Cenalthough I have not voted. My father has voted, and my name has been crossed The officials stated that if the son would bring his or father back to the booth, and obtain a declaration from him that he had already and voted, and that his name had been n crossed off by mistake, they would allow a the son to vote. Had the son gone to another polling booth as an absentee voter, hia vote would have been allowed, and there would have been forty-nine instead of forty-eight alleged cases of duplicate voting in the Yarra electorate. No doubt, similar mistakes occurred in all the electorates, for which there are many persons enrolled possessing the same Christian and surnames, and in many cases following the one same occupation. What is easier than to more of confuse mother and daughter, whose names are the same, and whose occupai n each case is "" home duties"" ? If Ministers have a vestige of justification l for their charges they should go further, by and press them home. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, speaking at Fitzroy on the 21st July, said, as reno advantage to ported in the AgeOn the day the writs were issued there were 314,000 more names on the roll than persons Of two entitled to go on. Sixty thousand more people in Sydney than were eligible, 60,000 more in Victoria, 30,000 more in Queensland, 17,000 in South Australia, 11,000 more in Western Australia, and 7,000 more in Tasmania. worse of it was that some of these people twice. I should like to know what proof there is of that statement. According to the Electoral Department, in no case did more than 80 per cent, of the electors enrolled vote at the last election.",24
144,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Eighty-the e per cent, in Ballarat.",25
145,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"What action does the Minister in charge of the Department in tend to take in regard to the alleged personation and duplication of votes 1 admit that it is an accident that he is in office, to be accounted for largely by the fact that in Victoria polling-day was wet; but, as he is there, I should like to know what he intends to do. Has the Attor ney-General's Department been structed to take action against those at fault? If not, will the Minister admit that the statements to which I have referred are without justification, and were merely electioneering squibs ? I have so much f a it h in the people of Australia that I do not think t h at it can be proved that there was this double voting on the 31st May last, though mistakes may have been made by electoral officers in the crossing-out of names. Those who visited city booths during the busy parts of polling day know that electors were standing three or four deep waiting for their ballot papers, and possibly, in the hurry of the moment, mistakes were made by officials in the striking off of names.",25
146,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the honourable member thinks that the Australian voting public is incapable of wrong-doing at elections, why did he and his party vote to abolish the postal vote, and why did they make so many calumnious statements regarding the electors?",25
147,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Ver y few members of the Fusion were returned afc the General Election of 1910. Those who came back protested, against the abolition of the postal vote. But they knew that in 1909 every member of the Labour party had voted against the postal vote, and the country was aware that if returned with a majority we should abolish it .",25
148,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Not one member who voted against the postal vote in 1909 was defeated at the following election.,25
149,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is so, though many of those who voted for it then were defeated, among them being Messrs. Tilley Brown, Jabez Coon, R. The Crouch, J . G. Wilson, Hume Cook, voted Dr Liddell, Colonel Foxton, and others. Mr Archer did not vote on that occasion, and perhaps he was wise in refraining from doing so, and Mr Dugald Thomson and Sir Thomas Ewing retired.",25
150,Mr RODGEKS,Unknown,Has the honourable gentleman a list of those of his own party who have been wiped out since the postal voting provisions were repealed?,25
151,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member need not worry about them, because they will come back. Abraham Lincoln said, I "" You can fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time . "" Honourable members opposite fooled the peopio at the last election by misstatements, but the rural workers' in- log will not cut so much ice at the next election, and the statement of an honourable member opposite that £4,000,000 had been unaccounted for by the Fisher Government will not go down next time.",25
152,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,Absolutel y untrue.,25
153,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member will have to withdraw that. I have here the statement he made at Swan Reach.,25
154,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member should withdraw the statement he has made.,25
155,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"If I have transgressed the rules of the House, I willingly with draw the words.",25
156,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am prepared to quote the statement which the honourable member made at one of his own meetings, but 1 ant dealing now with the postal vote, an.il I am not to be side-tracked by any misstatement or withdrawal by the honourable member. I say first of all that every member of the Labour party voted against the postal voting provisions in 1909, and that, therefore, people kne%v what the party would do in that connection in 1910. I refer honourable members to the use made of the postal vote at the referendum in 1911. I quote from the Labor CaU figures taken fro m the official returns laid on the table of this House. I find that no less than 13,000 postal votes were recorded in Victoria, whilst there were only 23,000 postal votes recorded in the whole of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Kooyong interjected the other day that the reason for this was that the system had been in operation longer in Victoria. A. Sir ROBERT BEST - Hear , hear.",25
157,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That statement is absolutely incorrect.,26
158,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,It is not.,26
159,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is incorrect, because the system was in operation in South Australia before we adopted it . We copied it from South Australia, and when the Federal Parliament adopted the system, it had, of course, to be used in all the States. The honourable member for Kooyong doubtless feels keenly upon this matter, because of the enormous number of postal votes recorded in his own electorate. In the three metropolitan electorates of Kooyong, Balaclava, and Fawkner there were more postal votes recorded than for the whole of New South Wales, and four times as many as were recorded in Western Australia.",26
160,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,What does the honourable gentleman say is wrong with that?,26
161,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I wil l tell the honourable gentleman. I believe that persons were induced to vote by post who should not have voted in that way.,26
162,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Can the honourable gentleman give any proof of that statement?,26
163,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I can give more proof of it than auy of the present Ministry can give of the alleged abuses of the absent vote. I direct your attention, sir, to the very unusual circumstance that while a vote of want of confidence i u the Government is under consideration, there is not a meinber of the Ministry in the chamber. The Minister of External Affairs has just come in , and has saved the situation.",26
164,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I was ouly at the door.,26
165,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Then the honourable gentleman wil l probably be glad that I directed attention to the circumstance.,26
166,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I can always hear the honourable gentleman at the door.,26
167,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I thought that some of you might be listening outside, and afraid to come into the chamber.",26
168,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member should address the Chair.,26
169,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Cerla i nly, thought I was entitled to direct attention to the absence of Ministers. The Minister of External Affairs would appear to have had some wireless communication with the chamber.",26
170,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Let the honourable gentleman come along with his proofs.,26
171,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In the "" toffy ""' electorate of Kooyong, 1,226 persons voted by post, whilst'in the working-class electorate of Yarra, just across the river, which is not very much wider than the length of this chamber, only 185 postal votes were recorded. Does the honourable member for Kooyong mean to tell me that the birth-rate was higher in Kooyong than in. Yarra ?",26
172,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"So far as I could assist it , it certainly was.",26
173,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Did the enormous number of persons who voted by post in the Kooyong electorate adopt that means of voting for that reason ?,26
174,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,My honourable friend is aware that there were reasons other than maternity which caused people to vote by post.,26
175,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Were there more people sick in Kooyong than in Yarra ?,26
176,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,There may have been more business men in the Kooyong electorate who could not be present at the poll.,26
177,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Of all the lame excuses I have ever heard for the postal vote that is the lamest.,26
178,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Of all the lame evidence to substantiate a charge the honourable gentleman's is the lamest.,26
179,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,What is the honourable gentleman's excuse ?,26
180,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"My time is limited, and I am given to understand that I have only twenty minutes more in which to conclude my speech.",26
181,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The honourable gentleman's evidence is limited.,26
182,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not think it is. I say that the people of Australia knew that the Labour party would abolish the postal vote, because every member of the party had previously voted against it . If honourable members opposite at the last election had said that every member of the Labour party voted against the postal vote in 1909, and in 1910 did only what might have been expected of them in ..abolishing the postal vote, they but I would have been more honest in the statements made to people outside. But they gave the public to understand that it was only because the postal vote was recorded against them in 1910 that they abolished it . They did not tell the people that the party voted against it in 1909. I have no doubt thab in some of the' electorates we could look for a majority of postal votes. I take such an electorate as my own, for instance. It has been said that our opponents put up a man there merely in order to keep me at home. They did not even do that at the last election. I managed to squeeze in , although the Age opposed me. The only thing I was sorry for was that the Age did not keep up its opposition to me until the day of the election. Had it done so, the other chap would probably have lost his deposit. ",26

186,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Let the honourable gentleman give us his proofs of the abuses of the postal vote.,27
187,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I say that one-fourth of the postal votes recorded at the election to which I have referred, were recorded in three metropolitan electorates of Victoria, and none of the reasons for this alleged by honourable members will hold good. They have told the public that the privi lege of voting by post has been taken away from mothers. The birth-rate was higher in Melbourne Ports than it was in Balaclava ; it was higher in my own electorate than it was in the electorate of Kooyong. If it be said that the greater use of the postal vote in those electorates was due to a greater amount of sickness in them, I say that there is more sickness in working-class electorates than in other electorates. The honourable member for Melbourne has proved time after time that the postal vote was open to abuse. Honourable members opposite say that if the system is reintroduced, they will secure a major it y of such votes. I certainly need not worry about it in my electorate, although in some cases there is reason to worTy about it seeing that the vote can be manipulated more easily. Why do honourable members opposite make the statement that certain persons were prohibited by the late Government from acting as electoral officers ? Simply because they know that the persons in whom they are interested were capable of exercising influence. We are told that an order was sent out tnat certain persons should not be allowed to act as poll clerks or deputy returning officers.",27
188,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,A disgraceful thing!,27
189,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member for the Sydney quarantine station should keep quiet. I wonder why the honourable member is net making such a noise about quarantine now as he did when I was the responsible Miuister. Is the quarantine station matter a party one ?,27
190,Colonel RYBIE,Unknown,"No , I have not had a chance yet.",27
191,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member for Werriwa found a chance. Is not the honourable member for North Sydney as good as he? I maintain that it is a perfectly right thing to prohibit a person from being in charge of a polling booth who is likely to exercise undue influence over those who come to vote.,27
192,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"The late Government would allow a boss rabbit trapper, who could exercise influence over other rabbit trappers, to act.",27
193,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I will guarantee that there are more professed opponents of labour in charge of polling places throughout Australia than there are professed supporters of labour. Last week the honourable member for Wannon referred to voting at hospitals. I have here a clipping from the Age of 5th May, wherein the following piece of news is reported from St. ArnaudAt the meeting of the St. Arnaud Hospital Committee last night, a communication was read from the Divisional Returning Officer for the Grampians, stating that it was decided, if practicable, to provide facilities at public hospitals for inmates to record their votes at the elections, on 31st May, provided no objections were raised by the hospital authorities, and a convenient and proper room was available for a polling booth. The secretary read a letter, which had been sent to the committee in October last by the State Under Treasurer, to the effect that the State Cabinet did not approve of voting taking place at the hospital. It was unanimously resolved, on the motion of Mr Manallack, seconded by Mr Eowe, that the application of the Returning Officer be not granted. The mover of the resolution remarked that if the system of postal voting were in vogue hospital patients would be able to exercise the franchise at Federal elections. Here we see the attitude of the State Government, which is a Liberal Government, towards voting in hospitals. The party opposite see no objection to a hospital doctor or other authorized witness going up to a patient, and saying, "" Here is a ballot-paper for the electorate of Wannon. It contains two names, MCDougall and Rodgers. If you want to vote for Rodgers, put your cross there.""",27
194,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,What nonsense.,28
195,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If a doctor in a hospital does that kind of thing, it is all right. But if an electoral officer, who is in an independent position, puts the case fairly before a patient in a hospital the Victorian State Government say that it is wrong. I notice that again there is no Minister present. Of course, I do not care whether Ministers listen to me or not, but I do think that a Minister ought to be present while a no-confidence debate is in progress.",28

203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is a truth.,28
204,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is not a simple truth.. To return to the point, the party opposite think that it is quite right that a hospital doctor should act as an authorized witness, and have an opportunity of seeing that a patient votes as he desires, but when we wanted to make every hospital a polling booth it was objected to. Something has been said about the Labour party not supporting the hospitals. A sneer has been levelled at the workers. It was said that members of the Labour party never serve on hospital committees. Personally I wish all hospitals were nationalized. But those associated with the management of hospitals are glad enough to ask honourable members on this side to deliver Hospital Sunday addresses for them. I have been up to the honourable member's electorate, and I say that it comes with ill grace from him to sneer at the Labour party because of their failure to secure election to hospital committees. I venture to say that only yesterday the working classes contributed to these institutions as much in proportion to their earnings as did other classes whose members could better afford to contribute.",28

243,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [4.59] - The of Leader of the Opposition, who has submitted the amendment to the motion for was the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, has laid three charges against the Government. Had he endeavoured to formulate three reasons why the people of Australia should have displaced his Ministry from office, he could not have worded it more aptly. During the last election campaign many statements were made by honourable members opposite in regard to the Liberal party, and even as late as last night the Leader of the Opposition attributed the defeat of his party to misrepresentation. I do not think that the right honourable gentleman has ever lost a cause in a contest where the public were concerned in which he has not put forward the plea that his defeat was due to lies and misrepresentation. That was the excuse which he urged when the referenda proposals were first defeated in 1911; it was the plea which he put forward when the Labour party were defeated at the last State elections, and it is the reason which he assigns for the failure of his followers at the recent Federal elections. As a Democrat, it is about time he should bow with grace to the decision of the people of Australia. They are quite capable of pronouncing upon the merits of both parties and of understanding the issues submitted to them. I think that we might at least pay the people of Australia the compliment of believing that they are capable of weighing the policies submitted to them by the parties seeking their suffrages. It ill becomes the Leader of the Opposition to seek to explain away his defeat by making a charge, more or less indirect, against the people of Australia. I wish, however, to refer first of all to the question that has been raised by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs. In the first place, let me emphasize the point that if any difficulty has to be faced by the present Ministry in connection with the sugar legislation, it arises from the bungling and incapacity of honourable members opposite who framed that legislation. According to them they realized the difficulty that would have to be feared. If they did, why is it that, in the repealing legislation, no clause was inserted to meet such a contingency? The repealing Bills were rushed through Parliament at the end of the session, and in each case consisted simply of a clause repealing the whole of the Excise taxation and the whole of the bounty as well.",29
244,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,What else is wanted?,30
245,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If the honourable member will give me his attention he will learn, and he will learn also what action we have had to take because of the utter incapacity of the late Government to frame legislation suitable to the occasion. Towards the close of last session-namely , on 5th September-the Premier of Queensland wrote to the Prime Minister of Australia intimating that his Government was prepared to introduce legislation excluding coloured labour fro m the sugar industry, and to constitute a wages tribunal to deal with the wages and conditions of the industry. The two objects aimed at by our bounty legislation up to that date were to secure the establishment of a White Australia and the observance of White Australian conditions. This offer was made, but the Prime M in ister did not reply at once. It was not until the 5th December last that he sent the following telegram to the Premier of QueenslandReferring to subject of your letter, 5th September, igi2, I have now honour' to inform you that the Commonwealth Government will introduce Bills during the current session of Parliament to abolish the Sugar Excise and Sugar Bounty Acts, which shall be brought into operation by proclamation upon the States concerned passing an Act to (a) Confer upon Commonwealth Parliament the power to legislate in respect of the employment of coloured labour and regulation of wages and conditions of labour; or (J) Abolish colouied labour in the industry, and establish tribunals for the regulation of rates of wages and conditions of labour; such legislation, whether by Commonwealth or State, to adopt the recommendations of Royal Commission on Sugar Industry as to minimum rates of wages and conditions of labour. The second of these proposals was accepted by the Premier of Queensland. But the point that I wish to emphasize is that it was not made u n t i l the 5th December, at the very moment when the Queensland Parliament was about to be prorogued.",30
246,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,A b o u t to be?,30
247,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The telegram was received only two or three days before the State Parliament was prorogued. The Queensland Government had at that time passed a Bill providing for a Wages Board for the sugar industry. The State Parliament rose before this Legislature had done anything, and it was not u n t i l the 24th December last that the Royal assent was given to our repealing legislation. The position, therefore, is perfectly clear. The agreement made between the respective Governments is set out in the correspondence to which I have referred. The State Government was to pass an Act abolishing the employment of coloured labour in the industry, and establishing wages tribunal in relation to the sugar industry, and on that legislation being passed the Government of the Conimonrepealed wealth was to issue a proclamation bringtime ing into force the Acts repealing our friends of the grower. Excise and bounty legislation. clearly was the contemplated agreement. The' Labour Government were charged with having increased the cost of producducer tion to the sugar-growers to the extent 40 per cent, by imposing upon the sugaron growers certain labour conditions, while at the same time giving them no relief whatever. When they were asked why, although they had seen their way clear help the workers, they had not given any relief to the growers, their reply, the first instance, was that they had wait u n t i l the Royal Commission on the sugar industry had furnished its report. A f t e r Parliament had been prorogued, Labour Ministers went to the country and declared that the Excise and Bounty Acts would have been repealed long ago if the Queensland Government had only passed legislation.",30
248,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",31
249,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member says "" Hear, hear ! "" Let me point out him what this means. If the Queensland Government had jpassed the necessary legislation on 17th December, then on 24th December the Commonwealth Exmary cise and bounty legislation would have been repealed, both the bounty and the Excise would have been abolished, tha whole of the sugar manufactured Queensland during the following months-the Excise value amounting, probably, roughly speaking, to about £600,000-woul d have been free of Exis cise duty.",31
250,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"£600,00 0 ?",31
251,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I said "" r o u g h l y in g . "" I am speaking from memory. The honourable member did not inform me 5th A p r i l that he was going to raise this question.",31
252,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There have never been the 100,000 tons of sugar in bond, and the Minister knows that.",31
253,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member may be correct. He did not pay me the courtesy of informing me that he in tended to raise this question, and, in consequence, I am speaking without the p P , a e r s but I will accept his own figures. Assuming that had been 100,000 tons in bond, then the amount payable would have been a £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; but, whatever the quantity, the position would have been exactly the same as that which was created when we the old Acts. During all this the Labour party were posing as the They declared That that they were eager to assist the primary producer, although, as a matter of fact, they never thought of the primary proprior to the introduction of this of legislation. When a deputation waited the honourable member for Yarra, who was then Minister of Trade and Customs, he, without consulting any of the primary producers concerned, and without even to waiting for the report of the Royal Commission, immediately brought into operai n tion a schedule of higher rates of wages, to which increased the cost of production, .so we are told, by 40 per cent. At the same time, he never gave one penny of relief to the sugar-growers themselves. Y et we find honourable' members opposite posing all over the country as the friends of the primary producers. Let us look a little further into the history of this question, which must naturally have come before the ex-Prime Minister during the election campaign. He would naturally to be asked, "" When are you going to repeal the Excise and bounty?"" because, as long as the Excise and bounty legislation remained unrepealed, the unfortunate p r i producer was paying the increased wages and getting nothing in return. However little consideration the proand ducer may have during the rest of in the year, as soon as an election six comes round he is told that he is the backbone of the nation, the pioneer who deserves to be looked after-that he the man who has been grabbed by the trusts, and who must be fostered and coddled in every possible way. The exspeakPrime Minister is reported to have said, in a speech delivered at Childers, on the He had pledged himself in Parliament that proclamation would be issued when Mr Denham passed a legal Statute according to his promise; ancl he could not set that aside.",31
254,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",31
255,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Ha d Mr Denham f u l filled his promise at that moment, the ex-Prime Minister, f a it h f u l to his word, as I believe him always to be, would unthere doubtedly have issued the two proclamations.",31
256,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It was not necessary.,31
257,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Of course it was not, because the Statutes had not been passed.",32
258,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It was not necessary to repeal the Excise to grant the bounty.,32
259,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member's promise was that he would do both.,32
260,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And protect the revenue at the same time.,32
261,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Again , on the 21st May, which was getting very near to the elections, the Prime Minister is reported to have saidThe Federal Government had carried out their part of the undertaking, and were now ready to make their act of abolition operative as soon as the Queensland Premier completed his part. There, again, was the assertion of a promise which remained up to the time we took office. What that promise was is clear and unmistakable, namely, that, as soon as the Queensland Government had f u l filled their promise, and introduced the necessary legislation, both acts would be repealed. That was the position in which we found ourselves when we took office. The Queensland Government, in the State Parliament, were proceeding to do their part of the contract. They had already passed au Act dealing with the industrial conditions, and had absolutely started to constitute a Wages Board. "" The State Government had fulfilled their statutory part of the arrangement. introduced and passed' a Bill for the express purpose of excluding coloured labour from the industry. Then, another was passed which is not mentioned in the original correspondence. They passed the Sugar Growers Bill , the object being to secure for the grower the benefit of the full amount of the remission of the Excise. There was, however, a point in the interest of the workers which did not appear to us to be covered. If the repeal of the bounty and the Excise took place, the labour conditions would be gone, and we thought that they ought to remain until another properly tribunal could settle those conditions in the interests of the workers. That suggestion was made by us, and adopted by the Queensland Government. It will be seen, therefore, that the Queensland Government had fulfilled to the letter and the spirit the whole of their contract. They pointed out that they had provided for a White Australia policy, for industrial tribunals to settle conditions for all the workers; that they desired to secure to the grower the full amount of the Excise of £ 4 per ton remitted from the manufacturer and the refiner; and that, in order to preserve the rights of the workers, they passed an Act continuing those rights as an arbitration award until such an award was given. What was our part? Gould the Government repudiate the legislation of this Parliament? The legislation was passed distinctly on the strength of the agreement; and the Queensland people, through their representatives in Parliament, had fulfilled tlieir part. What could any honourable Government do but fulfil the promise to repeal the two Acts, and hand over to the Queensland people the control of their own industry, preserving to the Commonwealth only the right of imposing its Customs taxation ? That was the position, and we honoured the promise. At the same time, the only machinery that we could bring into operation was the Acts which were drafted by our friends opposite, and which, I submit, were defective, but which this Parliament was asked to pass.",32
262,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Where were they defective ?,32
263,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Before I deal with that I wish to point out, in order that the grower may full y and completely realise what friends he has in honourable members They then opposite, and that he may know exactly what would have happened if they had been in power, what tlieir proposal was. Bill The ex-Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon has said that had the Labour Government been in power they would have repealed the bounty forthwith, but would have kept on the Excise.",32
264,Mr FBAZER,Unknown,O u sugar in bond.,32
265,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There was no discretion as to that; a tax operates on everything covered by it . Parliament was in recess at the time, and we had to fulfil our contract, leaving it to Parliament, when it met, to make up any deficiency there constituted might be in the legislation. Let us see exactly what the position of honourable members opposite is, remembering, as we are told, that all was done in the interests of the grower. U p to the time of the repeal of the Act the grower was entitled to a bounty of £ 3 , to be paid by the Commonwealth when he delivered his cane to the mill. The Excise, however, was not paid until the sugar went into consumption. Under the proposition of the Labour Government the bounty would have completely gone, and the mills would not be in a position to pay him more than the price paid to him before for his cane, and the growers, consequently, would not have got any real benefit from the proposed action. Could the manufacturer pay the grower any more-coul d he make up the bounty of £ 3 ? No, because the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs said he would have kept on the taxation. Therefore, all the time the Excise remained unrepealed the industry would have been subject to a tax of £ 4 per ton. That is the statesmanlike proposal of our friends opposite to settle this matter.",32
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is their game, always throwing the worker over.",33
267,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am glad my friend now realizes that his Administration made a mistake. I have shown here tonight exactly what the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs said was the policy he would have pursued. There is no getting away from it , and the growers should know that our friends would have continued this taxation of £ 4 a ton on the industry, and that they would have had no relief u n t i l the Minister thought fit to repeal the Excise. I have stated the position in which we found ourselves as a Government, with the problem set us by our predecessors - I dare say at the time they were proud of what they had done-w e had to honour their agreement, and we did so; we take full responsibility for preserving the f a it h and honour of the Commonwealth with a State Parliament which has legislated on this matter. The honourable member for Yarra says he knew all about it , and, of course, as Minister he should have known all about it ; but if he did realise the position, as now he says he did, why did he not put into the Excise Act a clause providing for the retention of the Excise on sugar for the period until it was repealed? A single clause in the Act would have done it . Yet the honourable member talked about our bungling incapacity. The late Ministers went into this matter with their eyes open, after three years of experience, and with a Prime Minister who had lived and grown up with this industry, and who ought to have been - able to give the necessary information if anybody could.",33
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Incapacity !,33
269,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We believe that the grower should get the benefit of the repeal of this Act fro m the beginning of the present season; and it is the intention of the Government to introduce legislation so that the grower, in addition to the bounty he has been receiving under the Act , will get the additional bounty from the beginning of this season. At any rate, so far as we are concerned, the grower is not going to suffer. Then, again, as regards the sugar, we intend td introduce legislation; and we intend to collect the money for the collection of which the honourable member failed to provide.",33
270,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,You have been quick old to find out your own blunder.,33
271,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Adelaide does not hesitate to ascertain the facts first of all. His idea is to get in something that will sting and afterwards ascertain whether he is right. The honourable member implies that it is since the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs spoke that this was ascertained. I may say that telegrams had already been despatched before the House met, notifying the persons concerned of the action the Government intended to take.  n e s t"" ?",33
272,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The real position is that members opposite have only now discovered where they blundered; and because we see the difficulties and defects of their legislation, and have the courage to take action to remedy them, we have these cries opposite.",33
273,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,You have lost many thousands of pounds i u revenue.,33
274,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member is now trying to invent something else. As a novelist, he would have made a reputation that would have .put Australia in the front rank.",33
275,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,You will hear more of this.,33
276,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have several times called for order, and I must ask honourable members to preserve order when I call for it .",33
277,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I thought honourable members opposite would have shown some gratitude. We have tried to cover up their gross mistakes and utter incapacity. But honourable members opposite are pastmasters in the art of misrepresenation. They find out that they have committed a serious blunder, and their first dodge is to put it on to the other side. In fact, the three grounds on which the want-of-confidence amendment is based are just their own three blunders, which they are trying to foist on to us. An honourable member has interjected that there was no mention of this in the policy speech. Since we took the action of repealing the Excise and Bounty we have endeavoured to make an arrangement to try to have the matter settled, if possible, by an adjustment by means of the Customs and Excise officers, and the bounty was only withheld in order that the farmers and growers might have got, if possible at an earlier date than legislation, the full amount of the remitted Excise, that is to say, including extra 2s. 2d. However, difficulties were found in the way of bringing that about, and the bounty will be no longer withheld. The extra amount will be paid by the Commonwealth, and legislation will be brought in to secure to the growers the extra 2s. 2d.",33

In the amendment to the A d dress-in-Reply it is proposed to addYour advisers fail to realise the urgent necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff. That is interesting: that comes well from honourable members opposite. What do the words "" urgent necessity,"" and the words ""immediate revision,"" imply?

It is always well to listen to the honourable member for Adelaide, because at all times he is so clear, so emphatic, so decisive, and so absolutely accurate. One thing I like about the honourable member is the absolute accuracy of his statements. There is hardly a statement he makes which is not strictly in accord with fact. During the debate the other day, my honourable friend, the At it torney-General, very properly asked why it was that during the last three years honourable members opposite did nothing opwith the Tariff. The honourable member Adelaide, of course, had an answer "" How could we, Mr Speaker,"" he said, "" d e a l with the Tariff?

When the honourable member for Adelaide was asked to state why the Labour Government did not deal with the Tariff if a revision is urgent, he said, "" We were pledged to new Protection, and, therefore, we could not take any action."" Let us put that statement side by side with the speech of the ex-Prime Minister at Maryborough. Speaking in a Protectionist constituency, he announced that his Government was going to take up the policy of effective Protection, and, further, he said, "" The Government's policy had largely increased the incidence of Protection for Australian industries."" The honourable member for Adelaide told us that the Labour party could do nothing with the Tariff unless the referenda proposals were carried and the policy of new Protection was adopted, bub the ex-Prime Minister took up a different attitude. He boasted to his constituents that his Government's policy had largely in creased the incidence of Protection for Australian industries.",35

306,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall refer presently to the 1911 Tariff, so that honourable members may see what duties were altered, and how their Protective inciI n d i saiddence was affected. The honourable member for Wide Bay says - now the session, that Protection is urgent. But when industries he went out of office, his Minister years. of Trade and Customs had before him 117 Tariff schedules which had been sent to the Department in pursuance of quest made to manufacturers desiring Tariff revision to communicate suggesvious two years. tions. I do not say that all the remedies asked should have been, or could have party been, granted; but 117 schedules had assistance been sent in , and, in addition, between fight 470 and 500 letters had been received present appealing for an alteration of the Tariff. Further, a large number of deputations had waited on my predecessor, asking for Tariff assistance. Therefore, the members of the last Government have not to a the excuse that there was no material for them to work on. Of the schedules to proposal which I refer, 69 were carried over from the the year 1911; 23 were received in 1912, Parliament, [TO] and 5 were received in the present year. Knowing the case for Protection to be so urgent, why did the members of the last Government take no action when in office? Why have they waited u n t i l now, in the hope of securing a vote hostile to this Ministry, which is pledged to maintain the policy of Protection, and has appointed the Inter-State Commission to enable the Tariff to be dealt with at the earliest possible date ? At the end of last year, Parliament passed an Act authorizing the creation of the Inter-State Comniission, and empowering the Commission, when appointed, to deal with Tariff matters. If the members of the Opposition are so eager for the revision of the Tariff, why did they not, in December last, when they were in office, appoint the Inter-State Commission? They made no appointments to the Commission, and, in consequence, eight months which could have been used in Tariff investigation have been lost. Who",36

308,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member, whose speeches are always entertaining as well as practical, pointed out to said the late Government, on several occasions, that it was absolutely necessary to revise the Tariff. He was not the only member of the party supporting that Government who appealed to it in vain to take action. When the House was called together in 1912, the then member for I hope, however, that, at a very early stage of something will be done to give the of - Australia more effective Protection than they have enjoyed during the past two He was appealing to the Labour Government to give more effective Protection a rethan the country had been enjoying under its administration during the preOf course, I know that the Tariff is a nonquestion, and I shall be prepared, with the of honourable members on both sides, to to the very last ditch, in order to make our Tariff more effective in the interests of the industries of this country. The then member for New England made a similar appealI am prepared dt any time, even in the last session of a Parliament, to give additional protection number of items that require it ; and if the Government had chosen to bring before the House a to add twenty or thirty or f if t y items to Tariff they would have had my solid support; but I would not support, in the last session of a a wholesale re-opening of the Tariff. The then member for Riverina spoke to the same effect, and the honourable mem-, ber for Melbourne expressed these strong opinionsEven in the last days of the session I hope that the Government will see fit to .bring in a Bill to amend the Tariff, especially in regard to those industries where employers and employees agree that the conditions could be improved by Tariff amendment. Where employers are shown to be fair and just to their employees, I think this Government ought to say, "" We will introduce an amending Bill affecting certain items, and no more,"" so as to cover such cases. I am afraid that the present Tariff falls far short of what is wanted. Indeed, it is not protective. In effect it is purely a revenue Tariff. I say that as a Protectionist. The honourable member for Capricornia put in a plea for Protection, as he did on several otlier occasionsI think my friends in the Cabinet will make a mistake if they do not introduce a Bill to amend the Customs Tariff Act this session. Quite a number of members of the Labour party urged the Labour Government to take action to improve the Tariff, but nothing was done. In 1910, a number of Labour members asked for definite action in regard to the Tariff, but their appeal was in vain. The Minister of Trade and Customs introduced a small amending measure, but declared that his Government did not propose to open the Tariff. He said that the Bill waspractically a departmental revision, for the purpose of making the interpretation of the Tariff better and clearer. We have not dealt with any items which the Cabinet consider to involve Tariff revision. The honourable member for Herbert was very disappointed with what was proposed. He saidThe proposals of the Minister are very unsatisfactory to me, and, I think, to a great many other honourable members, because we understood that the Tariff would be revised to some extent, and duties raised or lowered as circumstances warranted.",36
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why does not the honourable member blame the Caucus?,37
310,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The honourable member knows that these proposals have not been before the Caucus. The party would not allow them to be discussed in that wav.,37
311,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why not?,37
312,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Because they do not affect our political programme. That is a different version from that given by the honourable member for AdelaideOn fiscal matters every member of the party has a free hand. For example, my views on Tariff matters are diametrically opposed to those of the honourable member for Calare, who sits next to me In 1911, proposals for the alteration of the Constitution were referred to the people, but just before the referenda the.then Minister of Trade and Customscaused this circular to be issuedDear Sir,-In order that due considerationmay be extended to your request of . . . . for further Tariff assistance to the industry in which you are interested, I am requested by the Minister for Trade and Customs to forward herewith a form which it is desired you will complete, and return to this office at your earliest convenience. The form contains a schedule dealing with Tariff revision. The referenda proposals were defeated, but when the Government met Parliament they introduced certain Tariff proposals. I have a list of them here, indicating the intention to deal with several items in a distinctly protective way. There is the item of preserved fruits, for instance. In 1910 the Government were asked to amend the Tariff so as to give further protection to bananas, and refused to do so, because it was claimed that that would open up the whole question of Tariff revision.  should not mention bananas; that is what I slipped on.",37
313,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member appears tc have slipped to some purpose,, because I see that the duty on bananaswas increased from ls. to ls. 6d. per central. Then there was the loom industry,, which received a benefit under the Tariff.. I think that the item was free before, and a Tariff of 40 and 35 per cent, was imposed. I find that dredges of 500 tons register, which were formerly free, weremade dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent. The protective incidence of the Tariff wasincreased also in connection with harness, pianos, and other items. The only reason we ha\e had given why the Government did not go in for a further revision of the Tariff is that the party were bound' to the policy of new Protection, whichmeant that there was to be no Protectionin the old sense of the term unless the referenda proposals were carried. Wefind, however, that after the proposalswere defeated the Government carried legislative provisions of a distinctly protective character. If they could do that in 1911, what was there to prevent them doing it during the whole of the year 1912 ? There was absolutely nothing to prevent tliem. I suppose that the real reason they did not do so was that they intended to use the Tariff as a lever to> try to force the referenda proposals through. If the manufacturers of Australia were prepared to vote for the referenda proposals the Government would be prepared to introduce Tariff legislation, and if they would not do so they would get no Tariff assistance from the Government. However, in 1913, notwithstanding that they still adhered to the new Protection policy, the Government came along with an undertaking to adopt a policy of Protection. It is most significant that as a party honourable members opposite have declined to put Protection on their political platform . I have here a manifesto issued and signed by Andrew Fisher and David Watkins, from which I quote the followingProtection is the settled policy of the The Labour party, therefore, will take such steps as are necessary to make that policy effective, and will, at an early date, bring down such amendments of the present Tariff as will protect the manufacturers and producers of the Commonwealth against unfair outside competition. As the fiscal question is not included in the platform of the Labour party, the views of members of the party have been ascertained. It has been found that the great majority of members support the promise given by the Prime Minister at Maryborough, on March 31st, to bring down a scheme of effective Protection. That is not the attitude of the party as a whole. Effective Protection is not in the party programme, and honourable members who are condemning the present Government for not carrying out effective Protection are not bound to carry out a policy of effective Protection themselves.  man says that we are bound.",37
314,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No , I say that honourable members are not bound to carry out such a policy.  member, from a platform at Toowoomba, say that we are bound by the Caucus.",38
315,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I say still that upon any question in the Labour party's platform honourable members opposite are bound. They are tied up as tightly as it is possible for them to be tied.

They took credit for all premeasures of reform which we had preThe first ten years of Commonwealth history was the real period of constructive statesmanship in Australia. The Liberals came into power in July, 1901, with nothing but a piece of parchment in At the end of ten years, that piece of parchment had become the life-blood of a nation. Liberals had organized the whole of the Departments of the Commonwealth, and all the leading problems awaiting solution had been dealt The late Government when they came into power actook up a whole series of measures which their predecessors had left ready for legisYet, at the last election, they went about the country proclaiming that they were entitled to the Take a few instances.

331,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I took care to do so, the because the honourable member would not. I venture to say that at the next State election he will realise what the strength of Queensland Liberalism is. May I take the opportunity or adding this: Honourable members opposite talk of misrepresentation. I do not believe in mutual recrimination, but I do say that if ever there was any misrepresentation, honourable members from Queensland know perfectly well that there, at any rate, there was the grossest misrepresentation of Liberals.  *' liberal.""",39
332,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I should say that it was done "" with Labour."" During the election one interesting note was struck everywhere. It was said that the Labour party was in favour of industrial peace. Their candidates declared, "" We are anxious to put an end to all this strife. How necessary it is, therefore, to amend the Constitution so that we may be enabled to bring about industrial peace!"" Probably some people looking upon the angelic forms of honourable members opposite, and listening to their melodious voices, thought they were in earnest, and that their policy really did entail industrial peace. Consequently there was a feeling in favour of giving them a chance. But did they mean it? Are they really apostles of the gospel of peace? If an amendment of the Constitution had been made, and they had the power to amend the Arbitration Act, as they desired, would they have brought about the industrial peace of which they talked so much ? There are brains in the Labour party which are not always represented on the fron t bench. There are men who are very influential in the party, apart from its official leaders. Speaking in Sydney, the honourable member for Darling, to whom I refer with the greatest respect, used the following wordsThere are only two classes _in the political field, and there can be nothing but war between them. Then he went on to say that this warfare must continueuntil capitalism as a social system was thrown over altogether. The honourable member for Darling may be taken as a very fair exponent of Labour ideals and policy. What he says comes to this-that no matter what legislation may be passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, there must continue to be warfare until the capitalist system is overthrown. I find in a telegraphed report concerning a meeting held in connection with the formation of a union in Melbourne which was to embrace about 35,000 employees engaged in the distribution of food, one of the objects was said to beFinally, the overthrow of the capitalistic system. What chance is there of attaining industrial peace in the light of those declarations? How much of a desire for peace lies behind their proposals, if such be the real intention? I suppose that their policy may be really embodied in this pronouncement-that there is to be continual warfare upon a class basis until the present system is overthrown. If that be their object, what good results can be expected to follow from their industrial legislation? It is just as well that the people should kuow what their true aim and object is. It may be true that thedifferences between honourable members opposite, within their own ranks, is considerable, but the motive force and ideal of their party was clearly and emphatically stated by the honourable member for Darling. He pointed out, as a fact, that the unions are political. He proposed, in Sydney, an amalgamation of 100,000 workers in one union, which, he said, would "" enormously extend the influenceof labour, both industrial and political,"" because "" the industrial and political movements are interwoven."" Honourable members opposite cheer that statement. They believe that the unions should be political. Yet they ask that preference in the employment of men by the Government of Australia should be given to members of these political unions. That is the position unmistakably. I wish now to make one or two observations upon unionism from the stand-point of the contribution of funds to political expenditure. From the report of the Registrar-General of Queensland for 1910 I gather that for the previous year the receipts of the unions registered under the Act amounted to £16,867 . The re^. port statesThe expenditure for iqoo amounted to ,£16,256, of which £2,532 was paid for benefits, £8,z<)8 for management, and £5,326 for other payments, mainly assistance to other unions, legal and political expenses, and contributions to Labour newspapers. In view of recent legal decisions, the positions of the unions generally respecting these latter payments is doubtful, and I have advised the officials to that effect as necessity has arisen, and when considering amendments to rules submitted. In the report of the same officer for 1911 I find the followingThe expenditure for iqio amounted to ,£25,428, of which £4,641 was paid for benefits, £8,607 for management, and £12,180 for other payments, mainly assistance to other unions, legal and political expenses, contributions to the Labour newspapers. These figures are distinctly interesting, especially in view of the statement of the honourable member for Boothby, who affirmed that if the rural workers were brought within the scope of the Arbitration Act the necessity for the paid agitator and secretary would disappear. As a matter of fact, now that we have more highly-organized unions there are more paid officials and secretaries connected with them than has ever been known in the history of Australia. From the figures which I have quoted it will be seen that the money paid by unionists, and which was intended to be used in times of unemployment and distress, was not devoted to that purpose. 1910, only £4,641 was so because the expense of management totalled £8,607, and £12,180 devoted to other payments, mainly assistance to other unions, legal and political expenses, and contributions to the Labour newspapers. Unfortunately, these trade union Acts prove very awkward to ray honourable friends. They require these institutions to file their returns, and the Registrar-General is unkind enough to let the public know how their funds have been expended. That officer in his report for 1912 saysDuring the year some of the largest labour unions withdrew from registration, mainly on account of the necessity for closer restriction of their objects as set forth in the rules consequent on legal decisions affecting trade unions. . . . Of this total expenditure, amounting to £11,0,60, £3,151 was paid for benefits, £6,677 for management, and £2,130 for other payments, the latter item, owing to the withdrawal of the unions which devoted their funds lo purposes outside of the scope of trade unions as now interpreted, fell by £10,050.  of Trade and Customs quoting?",40

But, on that occasion, the question arose as to what should be the status of unions now that they were becoming political bodies, when they came before the Court. I stated my opinion emphatically then, and I adhere to it now. I said that if an organization which had political objects asked the Court to grant it a preference, it would practically put compulsion on all non-unionists to join it .

347,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I wish that the honourable member would do so. In conclusion, let me say that honprable members opposite have failed hopelessly to justify the amendment they have launched. They have failed to show in the slightest degree that the Government propose to do anything to interfere with the true social and industrial legislation which should operate in a democratic community. On the other hand, they have placed on record the fact that witliin the last three years, during which they were in office, there has been an increase in the cost of living, and they have emphasized by the amendment the fact that, whilst they were in office, they did not raise a finger to reduce that cost. Tliey have placed it on record that, whilst they were in power, Tariff revision became an urgent necessity, and that, although they had behind them a working majority to enable them to revise the Tariff, and had passed a measure providing for the appointment of a Commission, which could have dealt with the Tariff question, they did nothing whatever to assist the industries that were suffering. They have rendered the Liberal party a magnificent service in thus frankly placing on record their own in capacity, incompetence, and maladministration.",42

349,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [7.45] - The whole address of the Minister of Trade and Customs may be summed up in the old saying of "" No case-abus e the other side."" He seems to have forgotten that this is a vote of want of confidence in the present Government, and not a vote of want of confidence in the Opposition. All his speech was directed to an attack on the Opposition; and he forgot the logic of the recent event of the 31st May, which, according to his showing, meant that the country was not satisfied with the Labour party, and wished to have the Liberals in power. If this latter view is correct, it the means, I suppose, that the Labour party failed, amongst other things, to bring in a Tariff measure, and that they were put out of power to be replaced by the The Liberals with a mandate to deal with the Tariff, and deal with it quickly. My own idea is that the object of the Minister of Trade and Customs in directing an attack on the Opposition was to cover up in at much dust and verbiage the bungle that the present Government have made in regard to the proclamation of certain measures. Here we have a Government which is supposed to be the right kind of Government, allowing the taxpayers to be robbed of a very large sum, and it finds itself in the admittedly humiliating position, as disclosed"" by the Minister of Trade and Customs, of having to apply to some of its own supporters for money which ought to have been paid as taxation. That is really the position when we analyze the admitted facts. It . has not been shown that the two Acts need to have been proclaimed on the same day; the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs stated that it was not necessary, and his statement has not been denied. Liberal candidates, during the last election, in dulged in much talk about the "" bungling "" L a b o u r Government, and that sort of thing, but here we have a Government which came in to do justice all round, and which is supposed to contain all the virtues and all the experience, commencing operations by placing itself in such a humiliating position that it has, as I say, to apply by circular for money which ought to have been paid as taxes. There is some talk of introducing legislation to make those people pay up, but I have yet to learn that the Government is in a position to do any such thing. Of course, the Government's p.m. friend, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, has been spoken of as giving largely to political funds.",42
350,Colonel RYBIE,Unknown,What is the honourable member's authority for that statement?,42
351,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The statements of the company's manager, Mr Knox, before the Royal Commission.. How much the Colonial Sugar Refining Company contributed I do not know, and, therefore, I do not say; hut there is sworn evidence to its being something like £50,000.",42
352,Colonel RYKIE,Unknown,That is not correct.,43
353,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am quite aware that the honourable member stands as the representative of that great monopolistic in stitution. No one believes that the Government would wittingly put money into the pockets of this company, but its in competence has had that effect; and this is a part of that neglect, of which complaint is made in the amendment. The present Prime Minister, in lus policy speech at Parramatta, gave a very concise statement of the aims of the Liberal party in regard to the high cost of living, and he is thus reported in the Daily Telegraph, the bible of the Liberals:The one recipe for reducing the high cost of Uving is : Restoration of honest, economical, efficient government. Yet the Government have made a start by losing to the country close on £150,000. I presume that, after this fact becomes known, everything will come down in price tomorrow, although we know that, as soon as this Government came into power, butter went up l j d . per pound, along with other commodities, and that there was something very like a financial panic. The Liberals used to blame the Labour party for every calamity that happened in the world; and I think we are justified in saying that this rise in prices is due to the return of the Liberals. In any case, however, this is the most serious charge of in competence that could well be made against any Government; and I agree with the honourable member for Yarra that, of itself, it is quite sufficient to justify ""any healthy Parliament in immediately dismissing such rulers. At any rate, I full y expect that the Prime Minister will "" unload "" the present Minister of Trade and Customs, who has started with such a failure in his effort to carry out the aims and ideas of the Government. That M i nister made some reference to the Tariff, but did not say why the Government are not going to carry out their policy in this respect. On the other hand, he found fault with the Opposition for not dealing with the Tariff while they were in power. I again remind the honourable gentleman, however, that the Opposition is not now under review, and that, at any rate, they have a complete answer. party put a distinct Tariff policy before the country at the election of 1910, and adhered to that policy for three years. At the last election the Labour party declared that they would deal with the Tariff whether or not the referenda were carried, so that nothing can be said against the Opposition on the score of their attitude in this connection. Previously, the Labour Government were not pledged to deal with the Tariff, except by the way of new Protection, which, of course, would necessitate an amendment of the Constitution. Be that as it may, the Government should answer the charges of the Opposition, and as yet the Government have not done so. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech at Parramatta, also saidOur aim is to leave the policy of the present Tariff intact, with a prompt rectification of anomalies. The little scheme or memorandum-the Government know better than to give it a name-whic h has been laid before us is, so far as we can see, only the Deakin platform re-hashed, and the re-hash is even more gelatinous than the original. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u w i ll find there are more bones in it than you can swallow.",43
354,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I would like to call the attention of the Women's National League, who helped the farmers to put the Government into power, to the fact that for the first time we have a distinctly class Government representing a small section of the community. When the platform of the Women's National League was originally drawn up they were strong in having one plank inserted-' ' Loyalty to the British Empire under the Crown."" 1 call the attention of the Liberals-the '' farmers ' ' of the Government benchesto the fact that this plank has now been thrown overboard. They ought to in quire whether the latent republicanism of the Prime Minister is not showing its head. I am sure the honourable member for Flinders does not agree with this ' ' gelatinous compound."" We always like to hear the honourable member and the honourable member for Parkes, because they are generally pretty straight. In my opinion the laboured effort of the honourable member for Flinders the other night to make a policy for the Government affords evidence that The Labour he does not approve of this form of political food. Before coming to some of the issues before us, I wish to call attention to a matter which I do not think has been sufficiently emphasized. Whatever differences we may have as parties-and there must be differences and bond fide ones-w e should always remember that we are the National Parliament, and should endeavour to uphold the national character of Australia. Apar t from speeches in which men may say things when they are excited, T have to complain of the written stuff the Liberal party put out. I wish to call attention to one or two statements that are not only most unwarranted, but are a serious reflection on the people of Australia. We all know that the Prime Minister, when he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Opposition, was a great fighter, and did not mince matters; his cry always was that nothing the Government did was good; that everything was bad. It may be a very good policy for a Leader of an Opposition to follow, to refuse to see any virtue in the Government, but when the honourable member for Parramatta went before the count r y he seemed to follow the same line of conduct, and even now that he has been raised to the dignity of the leadership of the Australian National Parliament I. am sorry to see that there is still in him some of that recklessness that characterized him so much as Leader of the Opposition. I do not wish to weary honourable members, but there are one or two samples I wish to lay before them. I am sorry the Prime M i nister is not in the chamber, but I have with me an official document issued as a supplement to a newspaper, and signed by Archdale Parkhill, who is, I understand, general secretary to the Liberal League. This gentleman made a statement that ought to be withdrawn or proved. It is a reflection on a party. He saidThe existing era of jobbery, corruption, and maladministration will be continued in the interests of the supporters of the Labour party. To charge any party with jobbery, corruption, and maladministration is a very serious matter.",43
355,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,They did not give £100.000 to the Sugar Company.,44
356,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister can be held responsible for this statement, because he publicly expressed appreciation  campaign. It is a slander on Australia to put such a thing in the public press. What will they think of us elsewhere, if they do think of us at all ? The statement is misleading and untrue of any political party Australia has had. Every one knows that the public life of Australia in the past has been clean.",44
357,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Why , the member for Adelaide made that very same charge this afternoon.",44
358,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am speaking of what the Liberal party, as an organization, are responsible for through their general secretary, a very different thing from what an erratic individual may say in the country. I may instance the statements made by the honourable member for Echuca. The honourable member made most serious charges, though he says he is going to prove them. I will not stop to drag in other matters in this Liberal supplement. They make statements about the Minister of Lands in New South Wales regarding Mangoplah which are inaccurate and untrue. Then they wind up with an extraordinary statement, which I quote to show the kind of stuff they submitted, and by which they sought to influence the electors. Without any special heading, they sayMr Griffith expressed strong opinions in favour of proportionate and against equal representation in the Senate, and, failing to carry an amendment to that effect, supported the following amendment :- "" That the Senate shall be composed of members representing the States in proportion to their population, but no State shall have less than three members. The Senate shall consist of not less than forty members."" That amendment, which would then give a representation in the Senate toTasmania ... ... .1 Senators. Western Australia ... 4 ,, South Australia ... s >, ueensland ... ... 6 ,, ictoria ... ... io ,, New South Wales ... 12 „ was carried, and in the division in support were prominent Labour members, including Messrs. Edden, Griffith, Hughes, and Watson -[Han sard, N.S.W., 14/7/07, p. 2007.) Even Liberal members will be surprised to know .that there is no such record in Hansard, and every one knows that neither Mr Hughes nor Mr Watson was in the New South Wales State Parliament in 1907. Yet this is the kind of thing authoritatively published with the approval, apparently, of the Prime Minister, because he publicly expressed his high appreciation of this gentleman's services.",44
359,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Is it not 1897?,44
360,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"You cannot get 1897 out of the figures "" 1907."" ",44
361,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I do not know. took the trouble to look up Hansard of 1907 to see if it was there. I have intention of referring to a personal matter, but I have here a further sample, quoting a portion of an address I made. It is in the paper called the Fighting Line, the official organ of the Liberals the late election. They make a quotation of mine; they pretend it is a quotation, cause they put it in quotation marks. The Minister of Trade and Customs today quoted me correctly. But they interpolate words to make me say something 1 did not say, and this was circulated by the thousand. I shall read the paragraph to show how these words were put in to mislead the readers of the paper. They sayThe worker has nothing in connection with the capitalistic institutionsAnd they put in in brackets, ' ' namely, the employers,"" and continueand there can be no peace between Ihem. I did not speak of the employers at all. How could they be called "" capitalistic institutions "" ? The words, "" meaning employers,"" were put in by the editor this rag, which the Liberals issued ing the campaign. That is the kind of stuff with which they won the elections.",45
362,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The honourable member was so reported in two of the morning papers.,45
363,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I was not reported with that interpolation. The quotation is taken from an official report. The terpolation of these words is what I comwhat plain of as fighting tactics which are below the belt, unfair to the individual, and likely to mislead and do in j u r That kind of thing was resorted to dehad liberately.",45
364,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I took it that you had made the statement.,45
365,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Every reader of the report would take that impression, beI cause quotation marks were used. I am not quite a fool on economic questions, and when I speak of capitalistic instituleagues tions I do not mean individuals, but social system. Before the Liberal Gopied vernment could possibly get a grip of what sixteen pages to thirty-two. the Labour Government had done, they said that tliere was chaos in the Departments. That statement has been circuat lated ever since the Liberals took office, but no evidence in support of it has given. It is the product of the Conserexecutive vative mind. The Conservatives think 1 that they are the only persons who know how to govern a country. They assume no that they are the only persons who know what is good for the working man. They believe that they are sent especially by the Almighty to run the world, and that other persons should feel obliged to them in for taking sufficient interest to tell them what to do. Their idea is that nobody bebut themselves can do anything. We had a sample of their bungling in the issue of a proclamation by which the country must lose about £150,000. They do not seem to understand who are the makers and doers of things in the world. We have not a great number of persons in Australia who cannot be classed as workers, and who are doing things. Those who have sprung from the ranks of the makers and doers of things have, at least, had a practical training. It is a daring assumption for those who have just come in to think that they are the only persons who know how to do things. The Liberals expected to find everything in a state of chaos, and before they had taken the steps to get a grip of the Departments, of and learn what to do, they indulged in durwild assertions. Whenever they indulge in this kind of conduct, they ought to support their statements with definite facts. And when they fail to take that step it is not fair fighting. At the last elections we had a sample of their unfair methods from the Honorary Minister, who, we all know, takes Parliament as a in - place for amusement, and indulges in he regards as smart witticisms. An illustration of the pabulum which the Liberals submitted to the electors' is f u r y. nished by his statement that the Worker increased its charge for printing the rules of leagues. Needless to say, his statement was absolutely without foundation. It was made without any inquiry as to the facts by the honourable member. t is untrue to say that the Worker raised the charge for printing the rules. The central executive used to supply branch with copies of their rules free; a but the rules grew in number, and occudouble the space, increasing from Every one knows, of course, that it is not possible to get thirty-two pages of matter printed any office for the price of printing sixteen pages; even the Honorary Minisbeen ter must realise that fact. The central made a charge to the branch leagues for printing the rules, but there was no increase in the price charged per page. That is a sample of the kind of of the organization or for others. stuff which the Liberals circulate the electors. The Attorney-General referred to the question of union and it was referred to again here today. Honourable members on the other side do not take the trouble to ascertain the facts ,, Donations --before they speak. If they want to get at the truth , it can be easily done. They have quoted fro m some returns, and a quotation was made today from QueensDaily. land. Let me tell these honourable members that the forms which are sent to By Salaries, trade unions to fill up and return are of no use, except to prove the utter in competency of Liberal Administrations. They used only two headings in the form. "" Benefits "" had to be stated under one heading, and all the other information given under the heading of "" Management."" Our honourable friends on the other side quote the figures under the second heading as if they represented the actual position. Only recently, under our very able Statistician, and under a Labour Administration, too, a start was made in Australia to get accurate information regarding the social movement, trade, unions, the cost of living, and so on. Previously, we had no statistics of any value. I have never gone to any of these sources for information. I tried to get the information direct from the organizamanagement tions by means of their balance-sheets. An y one who took au interest in ject could obtain information in the same way. For the benefit of the Attorneyan ignorant man. General and others, I have made a stateber ment of the receipts and expenditure the Australian Workers Union for a period covering the twenty-five years which ended en the 1st June, 1911. That Union is openly taking part in politics and social reform, and has always done so. It is a big union, and is growing bigger. In my statement, I phow its exefficiently and well. penditure under twelve heads, six of covering everything in connection with management, including buildings and property, of which we have a good deal now.",45

369,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,That is the comment of The honourable memknows nothing about the objects of of the union. Its aims are not commercial.,46
370,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The honourable member said that it is run OD business lines.,46
371,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have always preached to unions, whenever I had the opportunity , the doctrine that they should not still hoard up money, but should spend it Experience has them shown that unions which hoard up money and hamper thenselves with benefits become conservative, just as the farm labourers who, according to the honourable member for Wannon, ha/e become farmers have also become conservative, and are supporting the Liberal party because of the promise that while it remains in office the wages of the employees will not be It seems to be human nature six that, when one gets 3 acres and a cowto use a phrase which used to be current in the Old World-on e becomes conservative. Modern trade unions do not hamper themselves with benefits. Their work is active organizing. They keep paid officials, partly because, in the old days, the trade union official was certain to lose his job, and partly because these officials give their whole time to their work, and by federation and growth the work is always increasing. If every penny of the union funds was spent on what might be called management, a good return might still be got for it .",46
372,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Will the honourable memlikely ber tell us about the strike in the Worker office?,47
373,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The Minister is in politics only for the f u n of it . He has never taken things seriously.,47
374,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That strike is a pretty serious thing for the men in the office, who were asking for the rates of wages eurrent in Sydney.",47
375,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Thei r case had been dealt with, and their wages had been increased all round; but they did uot take the trouble to ask for a reply to their complaint, and went to a body that had nothing to do with the question. What would the honourable member say to men who had behaved like that?",47
376,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I would not call them bushrangers.,47
377,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has complained of the attack made upon the Government by the Opposition, but it was he who threw out a challenge which we were bound to take up. have taken it up in what even new members must realise is the best way. What satisfactory debate could there have been had we been content to discuss the miserable rag of a programme put forward by Ministers, which contains no definite proposals? There are no bones in that programme. It is nothing but a ""gelatinous compound,"" "" p o l it i c a l food for infants,"" as the honourable member for Plinders termed a former programme. The best way to make a straight-out attack on the Government is to do what we have done. If the supporters of the Government desire honest, efficient administration, they will withdraw their support after the disclosure that was made this afternoon' about the way in which Ministers have allowed the country to be robbed. The Government issued a challenge to the Opposition when it proposed an amendment of the. Arbitration Ac t to exclude rural workers from its benefits. The statement that the Labour party was to blame for bringing the rura l workers within the Arbitratio n Act has been circulated throughout the farming community; but we are proud of what we did. We do not desire any section to be excluded from the benefits of arbitration. No section should be denied justice. There is no body of men whose members cannot bring cases before the ordinary Courts and secure justice; though, perhaps, the more money a party possesses, the more he is to win his action. The law was amended to give some consideration to rural workers as well as to others, and now honourable members opposite, after the matter was threshed out previously, have the impudence to come forward with a proposal to exclude the rural workers from the benefits of the law. At the elections, they told the farmers that if they were returned they would alter the law; but when they did so, they had not the remotest idea that they would occupy the Treasury bench. When honourable members left this chamber at the close ol last session, they had no hope that they would be successful at the elections. They openly admitted that they believed they had no chance of success. They fluked in , and having fluked in , they said that they must keep their promise to the farmers. The honorablo member who moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply said that if the party opposite went to the country the We farmers would send them back. He said that the present Government is a farmers' Government. The Government evidently represent a class, and have entered into a compact with a particular section of the community.",47
378,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,The Opposition tried very hard to secure the supyiort of the farmers.,47
379,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have never been opposed to the farmers, and am not opposed to them now. I have been trying to find a farmer on the Government side of the House, but it would take a very powerful magnifying glass to discover one. No doubt there are some Collinsstreet, York-street, and Sussex-street farmers amongst honourable members opposite, but there are very few real farmers amongst them. A bargain was made with the farmers at the general election, and the Government feel under an obligation to carry out that bargain. I give them credit for that. The honourable member for Wannon painted a picture, which, if he has knocked about much will make similar interjections. amongst farmers, or has ever worked on farm, he must know was true of only a very limited number of farm workers. dispute. Every one knows that where men are unalways organized they are poorly paid and helpworkers less to improve their condition. No case can be mentioned where those who are unorganized are in as good a position those who are organized.",47
380,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Is the honourable memI ber aware that the increase in the the unorganized is greater than amoug the organized?,48
381,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I know what I am talking about, because I have taken the trouble to verify my statement. history shows that, without organization, men are helpless to improve their condition. It is true, also, that where are grouped together they have better chance of improving their condition than where they are isolated as indihonorable viduals. W it h very few exceptions, the workers in rural industries are grouped, and so have to Lake what is offered them or go unemployed. No one denies that many employers act fairly as men should act, but no one will conwill tend, on the other hand, that there is not a great number who do not act fairl their employees, or that there is not a and keep him down. great number of workers employed at miserable wage which no one should be' permitted to work for in Australia. The the manufacturing industries. charge I make against the Government this connection is that it is the unfortunate bottom dog, the man who is helpless by lack of organization to improve his dition, that they propose to jump upon. The president of the Farmers Settlers Association has admitted that some farmers pay even higher wages than are asked for in the rural workers' log. The honourable member for Wannon has told us that farm workers do not work chasing power. more than eight hours per day.  hours a day all the year round.",48
382,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,It is becoming hopef u l that if we succeed in having the conference for which we have asked on behalf of - the rural workers it will possible for us to come to terms.,48
383,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Thes e interjections be very useful at the conference.,48
384,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"They will, and I hope that a few more Collins-street farmers I am a hopeful that the proposed conference may result in a settlement of the points in I say that the unions are out to lift up the lowest-paid to the level of the better paid. When a union frames a log or scale of wages they take as the basis of their as claim what the fair employer is paying at the time. I know of very few cases in which that course has not been followed. n this case, as on the admission of the case of honourable member for Hume, some farmers are paying more than the rural workers' claim, it is clear that they have not taken the highest wages paid in the industry as a basis, and in framing their log the wages asked for might very well All have been liigher than they are.  men is raising up straw bogies with the object a much of knocking them down again.",48
385,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Before I have done members opposite will know who have been raising the straw bogies. not What I condemn is the practice of denying justice to those who, owing to the conditions of their occupation, are helpand less to improve their position. No one help the rural worker, and the great National Parliament of Australia is being y by asked by the farmers to jump on him The honourable a member for Hume has said that he does uot object to trade unions connected with I do not in say that the whole of the farmers are opposed to any improvement of the condition of the rura l worker. Many of them desire to be fair, but the attitude conwhich some of them take up is that they should be allowed to retain the old right and of. freedom of contract and individual bargaining. They say that trade unions are all right where the industries concerned have a market for their produce, since higher wages involve a higher purThe market for Australian produce is chiefly Australian. Only wool, butter, and wheat are ex prices.",48
386,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"That is so. I could tell honourable members something of the be operations of the Wheat Ring and the Millers' Ring. If farmers studied their will own interests, arid did not leave everything to auctioneers, land agents, and others they would do much better. One of their secretaries told me that when he asked a farmer to attend a meeting, the reply given him was, "" If you attend it will be all right. I have some ploughing to do."" This secretary was a storekeeper, a distributor of farmers' produce, and one of the men who live on the farmers. I say nothing against him, but I have told farmers that they should take an interest in matters themselves - I have said that I believe in unionism as a principle, and that if the workers do organize they must expect to suffer. I have always been urging them to organize; and if they looked closer into their own interests, and were not led away by middlemen, profit-makers, they would tackle the Wheat Combine, which robbed the farmers of 2d. per bushel. Do honourable members know what has been taken out of the pockets of the farmers by the Wheat Combine and the agricultural implement .makers? amounts to £1,000,000 a year.",48
387,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The honourable member votedf or the duty on agricultural implements.,49
388,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Yes , and I would vote to keep the duty there. The 2d. per bushel taken by the Wheat Combine amounted to nearly £500,000 a year to the Australian farmer. During the last five years these increased charges meant to them a little over £3,000,000. whilst the farmers tolerate the Wheat Ring and the Agricultura l Implement Makers Combine, they are ready to jump on the poor unfortunate workman who is dependent upon his wages.",49
389,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Will the honourable member let us have a detailed statement Court, and allowed for. of the charge he is making in connection with the agricultural implement makers?",49
390,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The reports of the Royal Commission in South Australia of the Commonwealth Royal Commission contain the facts.,49
391,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The Commonwealth Royal Commission which inquired into the agricultural-making industry made such calculation.,49
392,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I am giving the facts.,49
393,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I was a member of the Commission, and I know that no such of Australia. calculation was made.",49
394,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"If the honourable memtoral ber can detect me in making statements which are not in accordance with facts, I will resign my seat. I am not so foolish as to make statements without having evidence to support them.",49
395,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The least the honourable member can do is to give an extract in support of his statement.,49
396,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that the RoyalCommission showed the great differencebetween the cost of construction of agricultural implements and the price charged for them. I take that difference and not multiply it by the number of machines sold per annum. The price of drills was shown to be £ 3 6 , whereas they can be made for £ 2 2 . All that is asked by the working men is that the most downtrodden portion of the community shall be lifted up. Is not that fair? Yet honourable members opposite are prepared to vote that an opportunity shall not begiven to attain .this object peacefully. It was simple foolishness to tell the It farmers that they would escape the payment of fair wages if they put theLiberals into power. They have the Liberals in now, but are tliey going toescape fair wages in consequence ?",49
397,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,They want to pay fair wages.,49
398,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The Fairest body to decide is one which will judge between the farmers and their workmen on evidence. But Mr Rodgers - Quite so; the Statesystem.,49
399,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It has been said, over and over again, that the conditions in the farming industry in different parts of the country vary; but it is forgotten that the differences are stated before the The varyingconditions in every industry upon which an award is given are allowed for by the Court. There is no other institution than the Arbitration Court before which eviand dence can be given by both sides. Suppose the Government were to carry a measure exempting the farming industry - and they will certainly not be able to do so-it would simply bring moreno trouble upon the farmers. It is just as well that it should be known that the Australian Workers Union has taken up the case of the nomadic country workersI t has enrolled men wherever they can be found. In the pasindustry matters are working peacef u l l y and harmoniously under an award of the Court. We are now devoting our efforts to helping those whom the honourable member for Wannon says are already quite contented and happy. Perhaps it is best to laugh at the assumption of those who say that the rura l workers are contented. The honourable member is a farmer and an employer. Does he expect his workmeu to tell him that they are dissatisfied and discontented 1 Perhaps he meets some who do say so, but there are not many who will, and that is because they are afraid, knowing that they will be liable to lose their position if they say that they are not contented. Members of the employing class do not get to know the t r u th about these matters. I am sorry to say that we have frequently found that men who have been proved to have stated to their employers that they were quite satisfied have shortly afterwards taken a prominent part in meetings against those employers. Those who know the conditions of employment understand that perfectly well. We are told that those who take up the case of the discontented are agitators. agitator, in the opinion of some people, is quite a shocking person. But no man in this world ought to be ashamed of being an agitator. Wherever there is suffering and injustice, there should be agitation to remove it . It is no discredit to a man to make demands for improving conditions, and to denounce injustice wherever it is found. Unionism has been formed from a recognition of the weakness of individuals to help themselves. The Australian Workers Union has now taken up the case of those who have hitherto been unable to help themselves, and is anxious to come to an arrangement with the employers.  Workers Union want an arrangement with our organization ?",49
400,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Yes ; we want to arrange a conference affecting all the States excepting Western Australia, which has been lef t out because of its distance from this part of Australia, and because matters there can be fixed up locally. We have invited the representatives of the employers to meet the representatives of the Australian Workers Union in conference, with a view to arriving at a settlement in regard to wages and conditions of employment. We desire that an arrangement should be arrived at, if possible, before the forthcoming harvest. organization, the Australian Workers Union will not cease its endeavours u n t i l it has obtained fair conditions for these helpless individuals. It will not rest u n t il reasonable wages and fair treatment are meted out to the rural workers throughout Australia. If effect be given to the proposal of the Government, any body of men could, in the middle of the harvest, when the wheat was in ear and falling to the ground, go upon strike. ",50
401,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,They do not. Under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act strikes are illegal.,50
402,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"And , therefore, never take place, I suppose.",50
403,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Toward s the close of the last Parliament I wrote to the Commonwealth Statistician upon this very matter, and his reply is upon record in Hansard. He says that there is no record of any strikes kept.  is not a practical farmer, and does not An know.",50
404,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Unde r the existing law strikes are illegal, and the Australian Workers Union has not had a strike since it came under the operation of our Federal Arbitration Act. Por five years it has been working under an award. If its members are exempted from the operation of that Act, they will be in a position to strike legally if they choose, and strike they will.",50
405,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The award itself is unconstitutional. I do not mind advising the honourable member of that.,50
406,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member is a squatter and an employer. As a matter of fact, honourable members upon the other side of the Chamber are all farmers. They are prepared to farm out other people's money at a good interest whenever they have the opportunity to do so. The honourable member for Werriwa knows perfectly well that it would not pay to have the award under which the members of the Australian Workers Union are working declared unconstitutional. The existing conditions are better for all parties concerned. The Australian Workers Union is powerful enough to be able to enforce its award. The operation of the Federal law relating to arbitration has been so hampered by constitutional reasons that it is a marvel As an how efficient it has proved. I would like the Prime Minister to tell me his authority for the statement that there have bsen 253 strikes during the past few years. The Commonwealth Statistician says that there is no record of strikes. It seems to me that one would have to go to the newspapers to compile a list.",50
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My authority Sir John Quick, who took the figures out of the Registrar's office, I understand.",51
408,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The Commonwealth Statistician says that there is no record of strikes.,51
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should not go to Mr Knibbs for that information, but to the Registrar of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court.",51
410,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"If one were to pick out cases in which individuals have gone on strike, no doubt he might make up a very formidable list. But that is not what we understand by the term "" strikes."" There are 341,000 unionists peacefully working under awards and agreements in the Commonwealth. Of these 120,000 are working under Commonwealth awards, and there has not been a single breach of those awards. That is a complete answer to all the wild statements which have been made for the purpose of inducing electors to vote for a party which could catch votes in no other wayHonorable members opposite have attempted to fool the farmer by telling him that if the rural workers are exempted from the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act he will experience no more bother with them. In so doing they are merely precipitating him into an extremely dangerous field. If my honourable friends wish to do away with these Courts they are playing with dangerous weapons. In Australia, as in other places, there is a very considerable element which preaches the doctrine of universal strife u n t i l the period arises when they are strong enough to take possession. We have trouble with them in our industrial organizations. unionists generally are influenced a good deal by them, and some of the mischief wrought is due to these very people. If my honourable friends are going to force men into the position of having to resort to strikes, they will precipitate a conflict. It is far better that the opposing forces should come to terms in friendly conference if possible, and if that be not possible that the Court should settle their differences. If those differences are so small as has been indicated by two speakers who pretend to know, there ought to be no trouble in settling them.",51
411,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The honourable member has plenty of stuff to go on with?,51
412,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have plenty of so called "" stuff "" here. I have the speech is of the Prime Minister-yard s of it . It is very poor stuff. The Government have come down with a very miserable sort of policy. Apparently there is to be no increase in wages, no decrease of taxation; no decrease in the cost of living; and no help for new industries; but tliere is to be industrial warfare. Shortly put, that is the policy of the Government. I desire now to refer briefly to the question of the abolition of postal voting, which has already been well dealt with. Old members of this Parliament know that at first we thought the system would be a wise one to introduce. We thought we should learn by experience. Queensland tried the experiment, and soon found that it was dangerous. It found that the system was wrongly used.",51
413,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Why did not the Government prosecute?,51
414,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Would any of the farmers and others behind the Government dream of advocating the institution of proceedings against innocent young women of good character, and the production in Court of documents they had signed ? I am sure they would not; and no Department would think of doing so. The Government talk of restoring the system; but when a proposal is made to pass a law to help the poor and downtrodden, they set their faces against it . They give such people no hope; they would jump on them. They think such men are mere children, and that they know what is best for them.  union, the honourable member and his party jump on him. Trade Mr SPENCE - The honourable member's interjection reminds me of the references that have been made to the number of men who refuse to join a union. Honourable members of the Liberal party, in this respect, have ideas which need to be corrected. Those who are not members of a union are not necessarily non-unionists. The real non-unionist is the strike breaker. In a sixteen years' experience of a mining district where every man has to be a unionist, I have met with but a very limited number of such meu. In that district, even the directors of the mining companies agreed that their employees must join a union; and we have had oflicers who had authority from the employers to sack a man if he declined to join one. In my sixteen years' experience of that district, I have known of about only three cases where men absolutely set up their backs against joining a union. An honourable membei opposite has admitted that a man ought to join a union; that it is unfair that a man should take advantage of that for which unionists have fought and paid. A man who is asked to join a union has in reality nothing to pay for his membership. It is the industry, and not the man, who pays. It is a poor union that does not so improve the position of its members as to more than make good his contributions. The Australian Workers Union does not pay the cost. The Pastoralists Union really does. A man who has been a member of that union for about twenty-five years has close on £250 to his credit i tur n for a payment of about £ 1 4 . The i dividual who stands out of a union makes so much mischief that no sensible employer will retain his services. He recognises that such a man humbugs Ihe whole of his staff. We must, however, make allowances for human nature. would like to know why members of trade unions, who are just as sensible as are honourable members opposite, should not be permitted to do as they please with their own money. Why do not the Government bring in legislation providing that no organization whatever shall put any money into politics ? They do not propose anything of the kind. Is it not a fact that the Farmers' and Settlers' Associations devote money to political purposes? ",51
415,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"They do. The Farmers' and Settlers' Associations of New South Wales are going to run a party, and no Labour man will be able to join such an association since their funds will be used for political purposes. In this respect the Government propose to take a backward step. Apparently they made certain promises, and are going to try to keep them. The proposed action, however, cannot be defended. We shall have more to say about it when the Bill comes before us-if it ever does come - bu t we have had such an exposure of the incompetence of the Government that I expect to see them "" throw up the sponge."" I wish now to say a word or two about the story of the bangle. The Prime Minister recently went round the country retailing some gossipy yarnBorne silly story-that he heard about a bangle and the maternity allowance. The story is that a certain lady had a hubby in whom she trusted. Evidently he was a good sort of hubby, because she trusted him to collect the maternity allowance, and we know that every man cannot be trusted with a fiver. The husband justified his wife's high opinion of his in tegrity, for he did what he was told, as all husbands ought to do, and brought home a bangle. At this point there is a gap in the story .which the Prime Minister no doubt will probably fill in , because from a national point of view it is very important. I refer to the fact that the honourable gentleman does not say whether the bangle was for the baby or the mother. This yarn gave to the n re- Prime Minister the idea of amending the n - law in regard to the maternity allowance. We have not yet heard the details of hisproposal, but apparently the right of a woman to receive the maternity allowance is to be determined by her ability to buy a bangle. A. poor woman ought to know I whether she is to receive the allowance before the great and important event to which it relates-a n event of great importance to Australia-take s place. I am astouiided that any man could have the courage to look a woman in the face after making such a proposal as this. The scheme will involve inquiry in every case as to whether the applicant is so hard up tnat she should be granted the allowance. The Prime Minister proposes to degrade the maternity allowance into a mere charity dole. Whoever is responsible for the proposed alteration of the law-and 1 presume that the suggestion was first made in the party caucus - ough t to explain in detail whether in each case a constable is to be sent to interrogate the workman's wife at home, or whether every applicant is to be brought before a Court and examined. The proposal is an outrageous one. It is only a new way of recouping some of the public moneys that the Government have allowed the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and other people to secure. As the result of bad management they have thrown away thousands of pounds, and they now propose to come on the poor to make good the loss. Thousands of women of independent spirit will not apply for the allowance if this alteration in the law is made. How can the Department determine whether an applicant is or is not deserving of the allowance unless some test is applied? Are we to have the bangle test?",52
416,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That is to be the If a woman has a bangle she is not to receive the allowance.,53
417,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Apparentl y that is so. Does the Prime Minister mean that a woman who can afford a bangle shall not have the maternity allowance, although, presumably, if the husband has bought the bangle previously, not a word will be said about it? The whole idea is silly and degrading, and I trust Parliament will not disgrace itself by adopting it, but that honourable members opposite, when they consider the details of that administration, will be so ashamed of it as to let it "" g o by the board."" The Labour party have all along stood for universal old-age pensions, irrespective of incomes, and in this, as in other ways, we do not stand for a class. On the other hand, the present Government are openly, admittedly, and barefacedly class representatives. There are many independent women who would rather starve than at such a period submit themselves for examination and investigation.",53
418,Mr CONROY,Unknown,How does the honourable member propose to pay pensions when he has abolished the rich?,53
419,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,There will then be no pensions needed.,53
420,Mr CONROY,Unknown,There will be nothing to pay pensions with.,53
421,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"When there are no millionaires, or any chance of people becoming millionaires, and the community is co-operative, everybody will be well off, and we shall hear less of this great desire to make the "" other fellow "" do all the work. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Government proposal will mean that the mother and child will be branded as paupers.",53
422,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It is in such proposals, I suppose, that Conservatism finds expression. The privileged classes like to engage in charity, and take a great deal of credit for doing so; indeed, for this reason, they would be almost sorry to see the poor disappear. So it is with Conservative Governments, and the idea is altogether a wrong one. Amongst the proposals hinted at by the Government is one to establish freehold, and thus really give away the lands of the Northern Territory. A very suggestive fact, on which we on this side must keep our eyes, is that an idea is mooted to wheedle us' into sanctioning a land-grant railway in the Territory. It is strange that such proposals are made only test. when this kind of Government is in power. My own opinion is that the establishment of freehold will not attract one additional settler, but merely give rise to the operations of the speculator. There has been freehold in the Northern Territory for forty years, and, as Conservatives pay great respect to the past, the failure of the system ought to be a lesson to them. I think the Government ought to withdraw frankly the statements that have been made by their agents in regard to alleged electoral abuses. Had a trade union secretary made such remarks as  would have been sacked in a minute. The whole question ought to be investigated and settled straight away; it ought not to be allowed to go throughout the world that the Australian Parliament is a rotten crowd. The Returning Officer in my owu electorate says that, with four or five exceptions, the duplications, and so forth , are clerical errors, and that the purity of voting in Australia is unequalled anywhere in the world. I know personally of cases where fathers and sons, and mothers and daughters, of the same name and address, have given rise to the idea that there is duplication, and names have consequently been struck off. The wildest of statements have been made in this connection, and discovered to be entirely without foundation, and yet not a Minister has had the manliness to get up and apologize. The Attorney-General was careful to say that he did not know the facts, but other Ministers have allowed these unfounded statements to go abroad. The Government, when they introduce their proposals, declare that they desire an election. Well, let an election come. If there were an election tomorrow the present Government would no longer occupy the Treasury bench. The Labour party are ready for an election, and when it comes we shall see that the farmers have found that they have been fooled. As to funds of trade unions being used for political purposes, only is. out of the £ 1 a year contributed by the members of the Australian Workers Union is devoted to those aims, and the Newcastle miners, who number 10,000, although they did contribute 3d. a year at one time, do not contribute anything now, while, like sensible men, they vote solidly for Labour. It is nonsense to say that a man is coerced in regard to his vote because he joins a union. It is a fool's tale that people are too ready to swallow. Take the votes in the' Cobar district, in my electorate, and see how many my opponent polled, showing whether the members of the union do not vote unanimously. And nobody coerces them; at the ballot-box they can vote as they like. That is the test. B ut people do not take the trouble to look at the facts, and tliey are grossly misled. Perhaps what I have said will clear the ground. I hear nothing now from the Government about going to the country; but I say let us go right away, and have an election. We will reverse the decision at the last fight. It will tainly clear the air. The Government realise they are not going to do much harm, if they do not do any good. They came in to secure honest and economic administration, but we have already had a sample of their foolishness. I am afraid the effect of their administration will be to make us insolvent. According to their programme, they have proposed a Bankruptcy Bill . It does them credit. They know that every one w i ll be going bankrupt, and they have put forward legislation to meet the difficulties that are bound to arise.  I quite agree with the honourable member for Darling that if the secretary of the Liberal League made any statements that are not correct they sliould be cleared but while they are clearing them up, I would ask them to clear up some of those remarkable and romantic statements made by a paper called the Worker, to which every boy who g6es up for a few weeks' work in a woolshed has to contribute, whether he likes it or not. There are one or two things my friend said to which I would like to refer before I talk about our platform. For instance, there is the talk about our being all capitalists and the other side not. I have yet to learn that all on the Government side are capitalists born and bred. Some of them, for aught I know, may be self-made men; and those of us who cannot claim to be exactly that are men who have helped our fathers to be self-made men; but, as Australians, I think we have just as much sympathy with other Australians as any men on the Opposition benches. I have no knowledge of any Public Department but the Postal Department, which the honourable member for Darwin said was "" kicking like a mule."" If that is not in a state of chaos, I should not like to ru n a business that was. When one gets letters from the Department saying that a post-office in a progressive agricultural district will not improve in business for the next eight years, and, therefore, cannot have telephone communication, I think it is in a state of chaos. Then one is told that if a telephone line is granted, it cannot be built, because there is other work going on. I should not like to tell a buyer that I could not sell him a sheep because I was selling to others at the same time. I do not think the statement of the honourable member for Darling quite explains the cer- amount of money spent by the Australian Workers Union. He spoke rather quickly, and I could not take down the figures; but I got it down as £14,000 for political and parliamentary expenses. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That covered twenty-five years.",53
423,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The exact figure.,54
424,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"It is not all , and the honourable member will take fine care to see it is not all. Every organizer in the Australian Workers Union is practically a political agent, and 1 see there is a sum of £53,000 down for organizers; so these two items bring the amount up to £67,000.",54
425,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,They are industrial organizers.,54
426,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"They are political up ; organizers. Then there was a pamphlet about the land tax. The Land Tax Commissioner, in his annual report, said there had been separate transactions amounting to 18,000, and it was claimed by our friends opposite that the first year's operations put on 18,000 settlers.",54
427,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,He did not say that.,54
428,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"The Commissioner did not, but the organizers of the union did. I have it in a pamphlet bearing the name of ' Mr Anstey.",54
429,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Hav e you one of those pamphlets!,54
430,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"No ; but the honourable member probably has one, because they were published by the thousand. These two items I have mentioned amount to £ 6 7 , 0 0 0; but I , as a pastoralist, do not take exception to this if they like to spend the money. The only thing I object to, as an Australian, is that a man is compelled to pay it , whether he wants to do so or not. We on our side cannot compel employers, or any other class, farmers, settlers, or pastoralists, to pay money unless they care to do so. If we ask for a subscription they say, "" All right, we will send it along,"" but we never get it .  they do not pay up.",54
431,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"No , they do not; and we cannot exercise what you call "" m o r a l suasion."" If we could dip them up to their necks, or, as is recorded in Forty Tears of Unionism in Australia, make back logs of them for the fire, we might get more financial assistance.",55
432,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,That is merely the the Prime Minister used to enforce preference to unionists.,55
433,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"The honourable member is a barrister, and is more qualified to speak of workers than I am, and has had more connection with them. We have heard a lot about the Wheat Ring and the Bag Ring, so much so, that I have indented my own cornsacks and poll we ever had. woolsacks; but I never made much money at the game. Despite all the statements about the farmers being robbed, if a goes to any railway station and gives Jd. a bushel more than the London price, he can buy up all the wheat in Australia. cording their votes. The only time that price is given is when shippers are anxious to complete a shipthe ment. So the farmers will not swallow the tale about the Wheat Ring. have heard the Liberal platform described by our friends as not constructive; and from their point of view it is not; it is destructive. You can see the wounded all round the rural conor stituencies in New South Wales. There is one thing that the Labour party need tion readsto bear in mind. In the past there was a great deal of ill-feeling between first squatter and selector-it was the fault of bad legislation-bu t that, I am glad to say, has died out. The squatter is done, wages, the selector is done, and now all are landtralia owners, some being larger than others, and the small ones trying to get as big as the approved. large ones. Right down to some of the boys who a few years ago were picking up in the sheds in my district they are now land-holders. As regards the electoral law, I , for one, never thought that a number of men would go in and vote halfa-dozen times in the same name. I think that they would be only fools if they did. The recent inquiry does not show that some men did not get on the rolls in two different names and vote twice in two different names.",55
434,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,Anothe r insinuation.,55
435,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"I am not making an insinuation. I made that statement because the recent inquiry does not show that everything is all right. Mr MCKay will deal with the honourable member next time if he will only wait patiently. In my electorate the people want the electoral law altered. I do not know anything about the Kooyong electorate, or what happened there, and I do not care either, but I do know that in the western portion of the Riverina electorate there is way a number of small settlers who, if they cannot vote by post, practically cannot vote at all. The absentee vote may be as good as the postal vote, but it acted adversely to the recording of votes in my electorate, because it enabled men and women to go and vote where they were not expected to attend.",55
436,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It was the largest n,55
437,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"Q u it e so, and the voting would have been higher but for man that fact. At one or two places in my a electorate absentee voters came in , and the farmers had to drive away without reThere were more votes to be recorded at those places than electoral officials could deal with. Whatever may be done with the absentee We vote, the country residents wish the postal vote to be restored. As regards the rural workers, the farming community do not wish to deny justice to the men, nor was the farmer fooled about the rural worker his claim. The Labour party's argument for the amendment of the ConstituSo early in the history of Federation as the Parliament, it was seen that was quite wrong, and a resolution moved by Mr Higgins (now Mr Justice Higgins) that the Parliament ought to have full power to make laws as to hours, and conditions of labour for Auswas carried unanimously. The present proposed amendment, therefore, merely seeks to do that which the first Parliament unanimously Our Labour friends on the other side now say that the rural workers' log is only a claim. Well, is it an unfair claim? If it is, let them say so, and let Mr Justice Higgins inform his mind, as he terms it , of the fact, because, although the claims before the Arbitration Court have not been granted in their entirety, perhaps, as one member of the Opposition said, they have been granted so close up to that point that we ought to know whether the claims are honest or not. Once claims are. put forward I take it that every member of the Opposition is in honour bound, morally and politically, to endeavour to get them granted by the Court. In the case the men we had against us were not shearers, but members of Parliament, and one member of the House of Representatives gave evidence for the shearers. I put it to the farmer that if the proposed amendment of the Constitution were carried there was no reason why the rural workers' claim should go before the Arbitration Court, because the Parliament could then decide the hours and rates of wages, and as the members of the Opposition thought that they would be continued in power, and as they are merely delegates from the Political Labour Conference, the farmers were frightened to trust them with the authority desired. There was no fooling of the farmers'.  trouble with the Caucus.",55
438,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"So far as a Liberal Caucus is concerned, since I entered this Parliament I have not heard of a meeting. The only time that I saw all the members of our party together was on the day I arrived, when .1 was introduced to my fellow members. I have not seen them all together since.  trouble.",56
439,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,If I do I will soon get out of it .,56
440,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,You are following them.,56
441,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"No , I am not going to blindly follow Liberal or Labour; I claim my freedom, and that is why I am here. I do not think it is any reflection upon the intelligence or the integrity of the Arbitration Court to say that no one man-and I know it did not happen in the shearers' case, because I prompted the counsel for ten weeks-ca n assimilate all the varying conditions in an industry that extends over the whole of Australia. During the f if t h or sixth week of that case we were dumbfounded by a conversation we heard between the Court and the learned counsel. I have often heard of old rams in pastoral pursuits, and I might add in others, but it was not until 1 was in the body of the Arbitration Court that I ever heard of an "" adult sheep "" and ""a middle-aged wether,"" and that was after spending five or six weeks in trying to tell the Court what the different things meant. I think I can safely say that there is as much human nature on this side as there is on the Labour side. shearers' We do not wish to do any harm to the workers, but charity begins at home, and we have to look after ourselves.

443,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"It is. We have now to work our wool sheds almost under those conditions. At 12 o'clock if you have a few lambs belonging to ewes not cut out they have to be unmothered, because you have to knock off at the hour sharp.  "" adult sheep "" ?",56
444,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"We feed fools with some of them. _ Coming now to the fiscal question, Liberal candidates told the electors that they wished to provide for a board to inquire into industrial conditions with a view to their amelioration by Tariff revision. That, I take if , is better than to have members of the Chamber of Manufactures log-rolling here to secure higher duties, which, I understand, is what used to occur. We do not want that. We desire an independent board for the investigation of the conditions of each industry, leaving it to Parliament blindly to decide what Protection that industry is entitled to. I am a Protectionist, though not a Protectionist gone mad, and I hope that the Inter-State Commission will realise that the rural industries are the mainstay of Australia. As for the national insurance scheme, I think it only fair to say that I jokingly made the statement that one of my friends had bought a bangle for his wife with the maternity allowance. If I had had any idea that that statement would have been taken so seriously by the Opposition, I would not have made it . Since making it , I have heard of a man who bought a go-cart with the allowance, and of another who offered to pay shire rates if they would give him time. In my opinion, the granting of the allowlandholders ance should be looked at from a business point of view. We have no desire to all time. pauperize any one; but all our expendithing would occur. ture should be on a sound financial footing, because a time may come when we shall not have an overflowing Treasury. During the electoral campaign, my opponent drew tears from his audiences in speaking about the relief given by the allowance. I find that the State and private expenditure on the larger charities amounts to something like £2,200,000 a year, and that the Commonwealth spends £2,400,000 on old-age pensions, and £650,000 a year on the baby bonus, so that altogether Australia's charities cost over £5,000,000. In view of the huge naval and military expenditure to which both political parties are committed, can we increase our charitable expenditure indefinitely ?",56
445,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Whic h would honourable member cut down ?,57
446,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"I do not suggest far the cutting-down of either, but I suggest business administration. It is more cruel to give money and to suddenly stop what the g if t than never to give at all. As for the Northern Territory policy, I am in favour of giving freehold tenure for agricultural settlement, and leasehold CJ uion. tenure for pastoral purposes, reserving to the Crown the right of resumption. I this is done, leaseholders will know that after a certain period they must be prelike ? pared to make way for smaller men, and will do so without animosity, thus venting the old squatter and selector troubles. There are 335,000,000 acres cultural one? in the Northern Territory, and so large an area will need the co-operation of both political parties.

449,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Where did the honourable member obtain his information regarding what happened in China?,57
450,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"In a book that I am astonished the honourable member has not read, The Awakening of China, by Dr M a r t in . The author mentions the interesting fact that, about the time of William the Conqueror what were known as the Five Philosophers existed in China. One of them was what would now be called a theoretical Socialist, and thought that the State should own everything. He wrote a treatise embodying his views, and the Emperor was so taken with the happy picture drawn therein that he told him to put his ideas into execution. U n fortunately for the philosopher, the crowd the executed him before he could do so. As to the unimproved value of land, it is, so as country land is concerned, the in vention of our nimble-witted city friends, or of the E v il One. Land is worth only it will produce, and that depends on the exertions of the person holding it , not on what is done by any rural workers' association, or by the Australian Workers",57

457,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The honourable member ought to go with us for free railways.,58
458,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"All we want from the honourable member is freedom to shear our sheep in peace. There is an earned income in land, which depends solely upon the skill and experience of the landholder. There is no exemption of this earned income under the present unimproved land-value taxation, and I say that, if it be taxed, we shall get no one to take up land in the Northern Territory. It is just as possible to raise the rent of land as it is to tax improvements. It will be some time before the proposed railways are constructed in the Northern Territory, and I suggest to the Minister of External Affairs, who has charge of the Territory, that in the meantime it would be wise to open up all the stock routes by providing water facilities, so that stock may be brought down from the Territory. I remind honourable members that, as rapidly as the increase of population will permit of it , what have been pastoral lands i u Victoria and New South Wales are being turned into agricultural lands, aud we have to depend on the outback areas, and the pastoralists who are willing to pioneer them, for the meat supply of our towns. If there be one thing more than another in the legislation of the last Government by which harm was done to the comniunity - it was their interference with banking. The Commonwealth Bank may be labelled as harmless, because it won't go off, but the note issue has done considerable harm. First of all, the late Government made the private banks redeem their own notes to the extent of £4,300,000. They then made them find gold for £10,000,000 of Australian notes. One would have thought that when the Treasurer got hold of half the money he would have been prepared to give the Federal Bank back the other £5,000,000, but, instead of doing so, he lent it to the State Governments, and put it all out of the reach of the trading and producing portion of the community.",58
459,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Did not the Governments put the money into circulation?,58
460,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"No , they did not. Probably they sent the whole of it to England, and even then were unable to meet their deficits. There is one statement which was made by the honourable member for West Sydney to which I should like to refer. The honourable gentleman said: I should like to remind honourable members that whereas, according to Mr Braddon, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the private banks have now a gold reserve of only 22 per cent, of their total liabilities, we have a gold reserve of much larger extent. But no doubt there is something about a private bank in itself at once inspiring and reassuring. Our memories, of course, decline absolutely to go back to 1893. As a matter of fact, there is something in spiring and reassuring in a private bank, and it is that the men who control such institutions are possessed of some financial experience.",58
461,Mr HOWE,Unknown,They showed it in 1893.,58
462,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"I shall come to that. I was asked all these questions in going round my electorate, and know them off by heart. It is true that the private banks had only 22 per cent, of their total liabilities in gold, but their total liabilities are not payable on demand as are the Australian notes. That is the difference. So far as the private banks' liabilities at call are concerned, and these stand in the same relation as do our Australian notes, the banks have for the last three years maintained a reserve in coin and bullion of from 49 to 59 per cent, of those liabilities. It is clear, therefore, that the statement. I have quoted is entirely misleading. The Commonwealth Bank is one of the things which we are told we misled the people about, yet I find that Mr Denison Miller, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, has said almost exactly what I said on this subject, only in slightly different terms. He said : The withdrawal of the note circulation from the banks, and the consequent absorption by the Government of a large sum of gold for the Australian note issue, tended to - restrict the banks' resources. They had, further, to make provision for the opening of the Commonwealth Bank, which meant the transfer to that bank of a very large amount of Government deposits early in January. That is just what I said. Under another heading, "" Need of Capital,"" I find that he saidThe Commonwealth is developing so rapidly that the capital in the country is not sumcient to carry on the many projects in hand and conState templated, and until the introduction of considerable sums of money from England is accomplished ihe position will not show much relief.",58
463,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Can we not get it!,58
464,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,No .,58
465,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Why not?,59
466,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"I will tell the orable member i u a minute. He is like motor-car-h e gets there twice as fast possible, or not at all. According statistics, so far from capital coming into the country, it must, to a considerable tant, be going out. That, I think, is due to Labour legislation. The Labour party, in the manifesto they claimed that everything was increasing during their term of office. I think they mentioned everything but the cost of ing and the death-rate. A statement. I deal with that. put before the electors in my constituency was taken from the Australasian InsurWhat ance and Banking Record. It showed that non the manifesto referred to quoted the three years in which there was an increase, but not last year. The average increase of deposits in the banks of tralia for the three years was about £11,000,000; but last year it came down to under £1,000,000, or, to be more exact, to £971,000. Those are figures which taken from the Australasian Insurance and Banking Record. Naturally, it was impossible to see the effect of the legislaAs tion passed by the last Parliament until it had been some time in operation. have stated its effect as regards deposits, a low rate of interest. and, as regards coin and bullion, the article from which I quoted goes on to sayAnother feature mentioned in the returns decrease of £i.o=n.cT,i in the amount of and bullion held by the banks of Australia. Now about this £2,500,000 of a surplus which our opponents are taking so much credit for. Surely, after having years of income unparalleled in the tory of the Federation, they have not the country. much to blow about in having saved £2,500,000 ? They might have saved £12,000,000. They say that the Liberal party left them a deficit; but what i they did? From 1901 to 1907 we the worse seasons that probably Australia has ever known. The number of our sheep was reduced to 52,000,000 and of our cattle to 7,000,000. By 1909 we had bred up again, and when the Labour party came into power we had 11,000,000 cattle and 92,000,000 sheep; the area of it , too. under wheat was up to the normal complement, and we got higher prices than had been received for years previously. So that the Labour Government were in office in a time of unexampled prosperity. We were promised that when the Labour party came into power they would honcheapen land and money. They passed a eighty-three Acts of Parliament, but I do as not think they did one thing that they to promised to do. The land tax did not cheapen land; all it did was to average exup the size of estates.",59
467,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,"Honourable members on the Government side have been saying issued, that it made land cheap.",59
468,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"If honourable memlivbers opposite will give me time, I will I have not lost my memory, and I know what has been said. the honourable member for Wansaid on this subject was true. It restricted the borrowing possibilities of the land-owner, and its immediate effect yearly was to make land dearer; because honAusorable members opposite played such a tune up and down the country about land monopoly, making the farmer believe that there was no land available but that are which he could see over the boundary fence, that he bought on the land-owner's terms in order to keep other people out. to the banking crisis, my opponent told the electors that the Commonwealth I Bank would lend money for long terms at It was that sort of thing that brought about the crisis of 1893. But since then the banks of Australia have been confining themselves to legitimate banking business, and neither is a the Commonwealth Bank nor the private coin banks will lend money on long terms. Lending money on mortgage is not true banking at all. As to the trust bogy, I have no doubt that the Labour party secured a three great many votes by representing the hisimaginary evils that were coming upon They certainly frightened a good many, and secured more votes than they would otherwise have done for their proposal for dealing with trusts and monof polies. But, in regard to coal and shiphad ping, I think that our opponents are "" up to their necks"" in the trust business. The worse form of monopoly occurs when employers and employees combine together to "" rook "" the rest of the public.",59
469,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Y o u w i ll have more,59
470,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"As to the Beef Trust, I remember that the gentleman who was most prominent in calling attention to it in Victoria was the Hon. Mr . MCWhae, a member of the Legislative Council of this State. Mr MCWhae may know something ahout cutting up commission, but I am quite certain that he knows nothing about cutting up beef. I do not think he would know the end of a cow on which to put the tail. An y monopoly which there may have been in the matter of beef has not operated against the producer. The local exporters do not enter into competition with each other. I can speak as a grower of some amount of experience, and I have no hesitation in saying that, so far, there has been no Beef Trust in Australia. As a grower, I am not afraid of the Beef Trust, whether it operates from America or anywhere else. Indeed, I should welcome a little more competition, but not in the shape of a trust. healthy competition would do a great deal of good at the present time. As regards sugar, we were told by our opponents that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was the greatest monopoly Australia had to contend with. Yet, on page 30 of the report of the Sugar Commission, which is signed, not by one man, bu t by four, three of whom, I believe, are Labour men",59

I should like to know whether the honourable gentleman has been correctly reported, because some of the statements credited to him sound rather strange when coming from the lips of one holding his exalted position, particularly in view of the fact that as far back as 1911 Admiral Henderson presented a report which provided that certain things should be done. The Prime Minister is reported to have said"" The late Government proceeded to spend a very large amount of money-£15,00 0 or £16,000, I think-in making preparations for a naval base before it had been ascertained whether the ships could get into it or not."" Mr Cook produced the plan showing that the only way to get to the site of the proposed base was through two huge sand-banks, neither of which had yet been cut."" "" There is, therefore,"" he continued, "" no certainty that the ships would be able to get in, and we have now to lind out whether the money that has been spent will be of the slightest use. In spite of the fulminations of the Trades Hall, and its innuendoes against the Liberal Government, it becomes our imperative duty to see whether this money has been wasted or not. It would be very much more to the point if they themselves would undertake some of these inquiries, instead of gibing at the Government, which is doing nothing but taking ordinary business precautons."" Is the Prime Minister correctly reporbed ? I ask this question, because on page 56 of Admira l Henderson's report the statement is made that a channel for deep-draught vessels would have to be dredged through the Parmalia and Success banks. I am rather sorry the Treasurer is not present, because his knowledge of this area would have been of assistance to the Prime Minister. For years past plans and specifications relating to the dredging of these two banks have been in the possession of the State Government. If the Prime Minister is correctly reported",61

Even Admiral Henderson knew before he drafted his report that these two sandbanks would require to be dredged. More than that, the late Government ordered a dredge in order that this necessary work might be undertaken. It is very strange, therefore, that the Prime Minister should say that there is something in the nature of a political game on, as it affects the Cockburn Sound naval base. I have asked one or two questions regarding this matter, because, so far as I am concerned, it is much too serious to admit of it being designated a "" political game."" number of men have been discharged from their employment. They have their wives and families to maintain, and, therefore, the matter is altogether too grave to be described in the way that it has been. regret that the Prime Minister has acknowledged that he has been correctly reported, because, to my mind, it shows that he did not understand Admiral Henderson's report when it was submitted two years ago.",62

It was they who began to talk about games on the part of the Liberal Government. There are far too mauy of these political innuendoes being made just now. Ever since this Government took office nearly all the Trades Halls have been trying to gather up something in the shape of politics to throw at us. The other day a cry was raised about the Fitzroy Dock. Because we set out to protect the lives of the men engaged there, members of the Labour party, both in the House and outside, have been declaring that we are trying to do some in j u r y to the men.

According to the honourable member we wasted money in providing an additional £450,000 for the payment of old-age pensions, and we also wasted money in providing an additional £500,000 for defence. Why does not the honourable member give us all the facts? I am in an amiable .mood, and am quite ready to oblige my honourable friend. He can have it any way he chooses. But why does he not tell the House that the deficit of £400,000, to which he refers, was created into a deficit of £1,100,000, within the next six months, by the Fisher Government ? If he did so, he would tell the House and the country the whole truth , instead of keeping back half the truth , as he does by his interjection. Why does he not tell the House and the country that the Fisher Government liquidated that deficit of £1,100,000 by the end of the year by simply keeping money from the States. Returning to the question of the naval base, and the statement made by the honourable member for Fremantle, I have only to say that we have simply made some reply to the Trades H all i u Western Australia, which declared that the Liberals had some game on foot. I hope we may reply to such statements, as silly as they are untruthf u l , without being called to account in this way. That is all we have done. We have simply pointed out the fact that the Fisher Government expended £15,000 or £16,000 of public money on work which will be of no use whatever u n t i l some four or five years hence, when we have made a road through the two sandbanks, and have tested whether or not we can keep the roadway open.",63
508,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,l s it not possible to go on with the dredging whilst the land works necessary are being carried out?,63
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope that it may be. But would the honourable member begin to build a house until he had tested the foundations? Everything depends on whether the roadway through the sandbanks, when made,' can be kept open, and u n t i l we know whether or not we shall be able to get our ships through, it is idle to put up a huge establishment there. These are the facts, as I have heard them. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.24 P- - m",63
