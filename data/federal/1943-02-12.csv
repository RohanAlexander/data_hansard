2,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown," by leave^-Yrom time to time, honourable members have asked me questions in regard to the brown-out regulations, with particular reference to the use of motor car headAustralian lights in New South Wales and Queensapart land. The Defence authorities have now decided that in Queensland, south of line drawn at and including Rockhampstrength. ton, masks may be removed from motor car vehicles provided that the lights of such vehicles are not directed seaward. The owners of motor cars are required keep their masks in serviceable condition, for immediate use when so directed. Similar concessions are to be permitted in all areas of New South Wales and other States of the Commonwealth. M i These regulations are to be operated by the States after they have received a tralian direction from the Department of Home Security. It will be necessary for States to promulgate regulations cancelling those that are already in existence. EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN .",13
3,Dr PRICE,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for have claimed. Labour and National Service whether the proposed call-up of women will operate by age groups, beginning with the younger and unmarried groups, and be uniform throughout the States?",14
4,Mr WARD,Unknown,I hope to be able to make a detailed statement next week. AUSTRALIAN ARMY. NA IMPERIAL FORCE-RECRUITING .,14
5,Mr FORDE,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"I wish to make a personal explanation. Yesterday, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr , Spender) said that my statement that 70 per cent, of Australia's fighting forces who are medically fit for combat overseas service had volunteered for such service, was not correct, and asked what I meant by it . In order to clarify the position in the minds of honourable members",14
6,Mr SPENDER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,I rise to a point of order.,14
7,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"The Minister ing boon given leave to make a personal explanation, the honourable member is out of order.",14
8,Mr FORDE,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"In order to make the matter clear to honourable members, I - ay that the medically fit members of our fighting forces referred to by me include the Australian Imperial Force, the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal A i r Force and the M i l it i a , from those members of the M i l it i a who are unfi t for overseas service, and a comprise about 23 per cent, of its total On the strengths of the forces, given by the latest official figures in the reports of Chiefs of Staff, it will be found, after deducting the number of to medically unfit men, that 73.7 per cent, of the medically f it men of the fighting services have volunteered for overseas service. Taking the strength of the the Australian Imperial Force and the l it i a alone, and excluding the Royal Australian A i r Force and the Royal AusNavy, it will be found that 64.7 per cent, of the medically fit personnel the have volunteered for overseas service. That, I repeat, is a record of which any country can reasonably be proud. Still , there are some persons who would rob us of that credit by wrongly stating that Australia has not done as well as I",14
9,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,Order !,14
10,Sir EARLEPAOE,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"I rise to a point of order. The Minister for the A r m y was given leave to make a personal explanation, and he is grossly abusing the privi lege.",14
11,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,I have already called the Minister to order. He is now exceeding the bounds of a personal explanation.,14
12,Mr FORDE,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"I have since checked the figures on which I based my statement, and have also had them checked by other persons. I repeat that 73.7 per cent, of the men of the Australian fighting forces who are medically fit for combat service, have volunteered for service anywhere in the world. That statement :s based on official figures, and is absolutely correct. If the honourable member for Warringah will come to my office, I shall show to him the figures on which the calculations have been based. For havsecurity reasons, they cannot, be made public.",14
13,Mr SPENDER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,I desire to make a personal explanation.,14
14,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented !,14
15,Mr SPENDER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"I do. In the first place, I draw attention to the fact that the statement of the Minister which I contradicted was not identical with that which he has made this morning, because in his original statement he said that '73 per cent, of the fit men of Australia had volunteered for overseas service. That was incorrect. If the statement was intended to be confined to the Militia, as I thought it was, it would also be incorrect. Iu my statemeut, I mentioned that the Army consists of lines of communication units in addition to operational units, and I alleged that it was incorrect to say that 70 per cent, of the total number had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. It would be wrong to suggest that more than 30 per cent, of the total has so enlisted.",15
16,Mr BRENNAN,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"On a point of order. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it is necessary for an honourable member to obtain leave of the House to make a personal explanation. The Minister for the Army did, in fact, ask for leave. I seek your direction, sir, as to whether or not an honourable member may make a personal explanation, irrespective of the view held by a minority of the House. If an honourable member asks leave to make a statement, the position is different, is it not? In that event, if objection is voiced by one honourable member it is sufficient to prevent the honourable member from making his statement.",15
17,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"The privilege of making a personal explanation is in the gift of the House and not of the Speaker; but leave is granted so consistently in practice Mr Speaker assumes that the approval of the House has been given and calls upon the honourable member. Should doubt exist, or the slightest dissent be indicated, Mr Speaker asks House to express its approval or othermost wise. I did so in both instances this morning. When it is clear that approval will not be withheld, I assume the without adverse effect? authority of the House and call on the honourable member to make the personal explanation. Later:",15
18,Mr SHEEHAN,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,I ask the Minister for the Army whether the recruiting the Australian Imperial Force has been discontinued? What are the present activities of the Australian Imperial Force recruiting committees ?,15
19,Mr FORDE,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"Because of the universal call-up and the great shortage of men, active recruiting for the Australian Imperial Force has been discontinued. When men are called into the Citizen Military Forces they are given the opportunity to volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force or the Royal Australian Air Force, according to their preference. I shall discuss with the honourable member the activities of the recruiting committees.",15
20,Sir CHARLES MARR,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,When does the Minister for the Army expect that approval will be given for the thousands of transfers that are pending from the Citizen Military Forces to the Australian Imperial Force?,15
21,Mr FORDE,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"I have made inquiries regarding the lag in the transfer of men from the Citizen Military Forces to the Australian Imperial Force. The number of men awaiting approval of their transfer to the Australian Imperial Force is negligible compared with the number of those who have transferred. I am assured by the Adjutant-General's Branch that there is every justification to believe that the men whose transfer has not yet been approved are scattered all over Australia and that it necessarily takes some time, after they have filled in the transfer forms, for the forms to reach head-quarters from the various commanding officers. I assure the honourable member that the transfers are being carried out with the minimum of delay, and that the men concerned will be given their that X numbers as soon as practicable. HIRINGS ADMINISTRATION.",15
22,Mr JOLLY,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,Will the Minister for the the Army have inquiries made into the extensive impressment of some of the valuable real estate properties in Brisbane? Could not less expensive properties be acquired for military purposes,15
23,Mr CONELAN,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,I have been working on that matter for four days.,15
24,Mr JOLLY,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"I have received numerous telegrams in connection with not only the particular property to which for I now refer, but also other valuable properties in Queen-street, Brisbane.",15
25,Mr FORDE,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"All Queensland members bave received a number of telegrams, some of which have been presented to me in my office by the recipients. I bave been in communication with the Hirings Administration. The Director-General of Hirings is in Canberra, and I intend to discuss the matter with him shortly. I shall be pleased if Queensland members who are interested will hear in my office whatever explanation he may make. WHEAT INDUSTRY. INCREASED ACREAGE IN QUEENSLANDINTEREST. CHARGES ON Poor. ADVANCES - REDUCE D PHTCE TO MILLERS .",16
26,Mr MARWICK,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"Will the Minister for Commerce explain what is meant by the term "" temporary wheat farms "" as used in National Security Regulation No. 29, issued on the 4th February, 1943?. Is it intended under this provision toincrease the area under wheat in Australia ? If so, in what State is it intended that the increased sowings shall take place? Has the Minister given full consideration to the effect which any increased sowings will have upon Australia's already enormous wheat surplus?",16
27,Mr SCULLY,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"The amended regulation referred to will apply only to Queensland. It has been found that not nearly enough wheat is grown in that State to meet local requirements, and the greatest difficulty has been experienced in obtaining transport for the bringing in of supplies. At one time this season there was only a little over a week's supply of wheat in Queensland. It is desirable to increase the acreage in that State, and so this arrangement, which is of a temporary nature, has been made.  surer say whether interest is now being charged on advances made to wheat pools to cover the period in which wheat is held before sale?",16
28,Mr CHIFLEY,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,I shall indicate the exact position in a prepared reply.,16
29,Mr BADMAN,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture explain why the price of wheat to millers has been reduced from 4s. Ofd. to 3s. H i d . a. bushel, a reduction of l £ d . a bushel, since, the Labour Government took office ? Why have millers been granted thisconcession, as the price of flour, namely, £12 18s. 6d. a ton,, including tax, has not been altered during the last eighteen months ? Does it mean that the Government has granted this concession to millers and added the difference to the sales tax ? Will the farmers receive 1-Jd. a bushel less for that portion of their wheat consumed in Australia?",16
30,Mr SCULLY,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"I am not aware of the detail's of the subject, but I shall obtain them for the honourable member. GOAL - MINI NG INDUSTRY .",16
31,Mr JAMES,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"Can the Prime Minister say whether war materials are still being produced under the cost-plus system? Is it a fact that under this scheme many industries are carrying surplus labour, including men who had been trained as coal-miners, and whose services are now required in the mines to make up the shortage due to the compulsory retirement of miners at the age of 60 years ? If that be the position, will the Prime Minister consider revoking the regulation which forbids experienced miners from transferring from other in dustries, back to the mining industry where their experience would be of greater benefit to the country?",16
32,Mr CURTIN,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"It is a fact that certain, of the industrial activities associated with, the war are being conducted under what is called the cost-plus system. It is also a fact that the Parliament of New South Wales passed a law comp .ilsorily retiring coal-miners at the age of 60 years. It is also true that some men who had been working in the coal-mines are now working in other industries,, but those industries are as important as the coal-mining industry in their relation to Australia's war effort. Mr JAMES.:-But the men I have in mind are surplus labourers..",16
33,Mr CURTIN,TRANSFERS OF MILITIA TO AUSTRALIA N,"That may or may not be so. At any rate, regulations dealing with the direction of labour are under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Labour and National Service. He has authority to direct, not only unemployed labour, but also labour which is engaged. I have no douht that he will have, the whole matter reviewed, and will Teach a proper decision. NA TRADE UNIONS.",16
34,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,EMPIRE CONFERENCE OF,"Can the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that the Commonwealth Government has agreed to pay the fares of six union delegates who are to attend a conference of trade unions in Great Britain in April next? Can he give an estimate of the cost involved, and does he not think that, in view of the heavy taxation forecast by the Treasurer yesterday, this money would be better spent on Australia's direct war effort rather than on paying the expenses of delegates to a purely party conference?",17
35,Mr CURTIN,EMPIRE CONFERENCE OF,"The proposal to hokl a conference of trade unions representatives from the United Kingdom and the Dominions was first brought to my notice by the High Commissioner in London, Mr Bruce. The suggestion was that three delegates should be sent from Australia. The Governments of New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom have approved of the holding of this conference, regarding it as an invaluable contribution to our total war effort. It is to be held in London in April next, and three delegates are to go from Australia. In the very nature of the problem, transportation could not be provided except by the Government, and the Government proposes to provide it. All other costs, including those for loss of time, hotel expenses, travelling allowances, &c., are to be borne by the trade unions. If the Government did not provide transportation, the delegates could not go, and the conference could not take place. We regard the holding of the conference as a valuable contribution to the solution of the problems which the governments of the Empire have to face. The solution of the problems involves the co-operation - of trade unions in the war effort of each Empire country and of all the countries among the United Nations. The conference is being sponsored in the best interests of ultimate victory. USE OF HOTEL IN SYDNEY.",17
36,Mr MORGAN,EMPIRE CONFERENCE OF,"Has the Minister for the Army investigated allegations that, a large residential hotel in the heart of Sydney, with accommodation for 500 guests, .has limited the number which it will accept to 150, who are mostly country visitors, and refuses to admit servicemen on leave, including Americans of all ranks ? If the facts are as alleged, will the Government consider taking over the botel as a temporary hostel, or at any rate, requiring the management to admit members of the .services ?",17
37,Mr FORDE,EMPIRE CONFERENCE OF,"Inquiries are being made, and when I am able to give the honourable member some definite information on the subject. I shall do so. DEFENCE (CITIZE NMILITAR Y FORCES) BILL . PAIRS.",17
38,Mr GUY,EMPIRE CONFERENCE OF,"I desire to make a personal explanation. In at least one newspaper published this morning it is stated that the honourable member for Balaclava { Mr White), who is serving in the Air Force overseas, had paired in favour of the amendment which the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) moved to the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Bill. That is incorrect. I , as Whip of the Opposition party, had no means of ascertaining the views of the honourable member for Balaclava, and it is not correct to say that he was paired. As a matter of fact, there were no pairs in that division. The 'honourable member for Darwin (Sir George Bell), who is absent on account of illness, and who wished to vote against the amendment, sought a pair, but was unable to obtain one. NA COMMITTEE.",17
39,Mr ROSEVEAR,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Can the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether a newspaper report is correct which states that the War Commitments Committee consists of the Director General of Man Power, Mr W. C. Wurth, as chairman, the First Naval Member or his deputy, the Commanderin-Chief of the Allied Land Forces or his representative, the Chief of the Air Staff or his deputy, the Director-General of War Organization of Industry, Mr G. T.. Ghippinda ll, the Director-General of the ; Allied Works Council, Mr E. G. 'Theodore, the Director-General of Munitions and Aircraft Production, Mr Essington Lewis, and the chairman of the standing committee of the Allied Supply Council, Mr D. J. Nolan? Is that a full list of the members of the committee? If so, who is responsible for the choice of this very select band? In view of the great importance of the trade union movement to the war effort, which of those members of the committee may we regard as the representative of the trade union movement?",17
40,Mr WARD,WAR COMMITMENTS,"The War Commitment Committee does not come under the control of my department, but I understand that its personnel is as the newspaper report has stated. The committee was appointed on the decision of the War Cabinet, but I cannot say on what basis representation was decided.",18
41,Mr ROSEVEAR,WAR COMMITMENTS,"The secretary of the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne, Mr J. V. Stout, is reported to have said that the War Commitments Committee should have the responsibility "" of advising the War Cabinet in the work of policy, formation and planning of work associated with the subtraction of additional labour from civil industry and industries only directly connected with the war effort"". If that statement be correct, I ask the Prime Minister in view of the immense importance of this problem to the Labour movement, to explain why no representarive of the trade union movement has been appointed to the committee?",18
42,Mr CURTIN,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Mr Stout and Mr. Clarey, M.L.C., were misinformed, and, in consequence, their criticisms were unwarranted. Last Monday, I explained to the president and secretary of the tralasian Council of Trade Unions the functions of the War Commitments Committee, and they agreed that the proposals were satisfactory. The purpose of the committee is to ensure that projects involving the extensive use of man-power shall be examined by all the departments whose work will be affected by the jobs. In addition, the committee will consider the order of priority to be allotted to them. If the strength of the Army were to be increased by 50,000 men, they would have to be drawn from industry, and that would affect the production of food and elothing, or even munitions. The purpose of the War Commitments Committee is to review all these problems, technically, as a whole. The committee will meet as or when I direct; but the direction of man-power will not be one of its functions.",18
43,Mr ROSEVEAR,WAR COMMITMENTS,I assume that the Prime Minister would not often reject the recommendations of the committee.,18
44,Mr CURTIN,WAR COMMITMENTS,That remains to be seen.,18
45,Mr ROSEVEAR,WAR COMMITMENTS,The committee should include a representative of the Labour movement. Mr. Curtin.^-The committee is composed of officers of the Commonwealth Government. WOOL APPRAISEMENT CENTRES.,18
46,Mr ABBOTT,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Will the Prime Minister inform me whether the War Commitments Committee will examine the Government's project for the erection of country wool appraisement centres ? The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has informed honourable members that the initial cost of the projects will be £180,000, and I understand that ancillary stores will have to be built by the Central Wool Committee, at considerable cost. This work will absorb 1,000 men for a y ar. As the Prime Minister has r declared that the man-power position is of the utmost gravity, will he say whether this work has been examined by the War Commitments Committee, and if it hae been approved, what order of priority has been allotted to it?",18
47,Mr CURTIN,WAR COMMITMENTS,"The War Commitments Committee, which has been established within the last fortnight, will deal Aus- only with matters of major policy.",18
48,Mr AHBOTT,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Are not works costing £300,000 or £400,000 major projects?",18
49,Mr CURTIN,WAR COMMITMENTS,"The committee will deal, not with the details of projects, but with matters of strategical and economie significance involving the employment of not merely 1,000 men, but 10,000 or even 20,000 men. That function is indicated by the very composition of the committee. MAN-POWER. STOCK AND STATION AGENCIES.",18
50,Mr COLLINS,WAR COMMITMENTS,"The Minister for Labour and National Service will remember that I communicated with him regarding the call-up of men associated with, stock and station agencies, pointing out that different conditions seemed to obtain in different States. Will he examine the position with a view to establishing uniformity of practice in all States?",18
51,Mr WARD,WAR COMMITMENTS,"I have asked for a report on the matter, which I hope will be supplied to me within a few days. MEAT FOR BRITAIN . Mr MoLEOD - Is it a fact, as stated by Senator MCLeay in the Senate, that ships which came to Australia to load meat for Britain had to leave without being fully loaded because supplies were not available?",19
52,Mr SPEAKER,WAR COMMITMENTS,The honourable member must not refer to statements made in the Senate during the current session.,19
53,Mr SCULLY,WAR COMMITMENTS,"The statement quoted by the honourable member is misleading, and was obviously made without a knowledge of the facts. The matter of meat supplies for the United Kingdom is directly under the control of my department, and no person outside that department can know the true position. The statement was wholly erroneous, and should not have been made.",19
54,Mr SPEAKER,WAR COMMITMENTS,Order ! Both the question and the answer are out of order. DAIRYI NG INDUSTRY.,19
55,Mr ANTHONY,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Unde r legislation passed recently through this Parliament, provision was made for the payment of a subsidy of £2,000,000 to the dairying industry, but only £1,500,000 was allocated for the unexpired nine months of the year. Instead of making the period from the 1st October, the date for the tion of the provision was put hack to the 1st July. Will the Treasurer consider making available an amount £2,000,000 instead of £1,500,000 from lsti July last until the 30th June next?",19
56,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR COMMITMENTS,"That matter will considered by the Government.  tion of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to the fact that a meeting of representatives of all butter and cheese factories on the far south coast [23] at Bega on the 4th February last, carried the following resolution:That this meeting, representative of all the butter and cheese factories of the far south coast, bitterly protests against the meagre amount of the subsidy just disclosed, it being pointed out that the subsidy means an average of 10s. per week to each farm property, representing as it does the combination of a number of employees and a large capital investment, and that this meeting insists that nothing less than the price of Is. 8d. per lb. to the producer for butter and a commensurate price for cheese agreed upon at the mass meeting of farmers held in Bega during October, 1942, will allow farmers to maintain production. Is the Minister prepared to give consideration to that request?",19
57,Mr SCULLY,WAR COMMITMENTS,Yes . APPLES AND PEARS.,19
58,Mr BREEN,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Yesterday in the presence of the Attorney-General I made representations to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture for a revision of Statutory Rules 1943, No. 14, being amendments of the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations. The Minister conveyed to me last night his decision to revise the regulations. I now ask him whether, in order to preserve the general excellence of the regulations, he will meet my wishes to have anomalies removed by the simple expedient of eliminating paragraph a of sub-regulation 4 of regulation 17? That would allow the remainder of the regulations to remain in force.",19
59,Mr SCULLY,WAR COMMITMENTS,"I have conferred with the Attorney-General and the apple and pear interests, and it is proposed to eliminate the paragraph to which the honourable member has expressed objection. applicaBEAUMARIS GARDENS, HOBART.",19
60,Mr BECK,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior tell of me when arrangements for taking over the the Beaumaris Gardens, Hobart, will be completed? Numerous letters have been be written on this subject and promises have been made that the matter will receive immediate consideration and that a decision will be made at an early date.",19
61,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR COMMITMENTS,I shall ask the Minister for the Interior to furnish a held reply by next sitting day. HORSE AND DOG RACING.,19
62,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,WAR COMMITMENTS," by leaveFollowing the question asked on gentleman Thursday, the 4th February last, by the honourable member for Hume (Mr - Collins) in regard to dogs character being, conveyed in horse boxes to dog race meetings, I have had inquiries made in respect of this matter and am informed that racing dogs were on one occasion transported in horse boxes. Extra facilities for accommodation of racing dogs on ordinary trains are prowith vided occasionally where the use of addiis tional engine power is not involved. do not approve of the practice of transhe porting racing dogs to race meetings horse boxes, and have taken the necessary steps to ensure that racing dogs shall be conveyed only in accordance usual facilities available for their carriage. I am not prepared to alter the restrictions placed on the carriage race-horses to country meetings or elseby where. SYDNEY DAILY TELE GRAPE.",20

66,Mr FROST,WAR COMMITMENTS,To-day . I hope to aware make my second-reading speech next week. LIVERPOOL PRESS. DETENTION OF PROPRIETOR.,20
67,Mr BRENNAN,WAR COMMITMENTS,"I recall to the the Attorney-iGeneral some observations he made yesterday' regarding a man pected of exploiting the' anxieties and party ? griefs of relatives of soldiers who have fallen, and the action taken by the vernment. The right honourable gentlesaid that the person concerned was to be detained. I ask the right honourable whether that person is to be charged with an offence and tried in accordance with law? What is the of the detention to which the right honourable gentleman referred?",20
68,Dr EVATT,WAR COMMITMENTS,"I made a statement to the House on this matter yesterday. The view of the Director-General of Security is that the activities of this man are so systematic and so calculated to interfere the prosecution of the war that it not sufficient merely to try him and I obtain a conviction, because the moment is released from prison he immediately in endeavours to commit security offences. Mr CAT.WEIJ. - That is a rather with the dangerous principle.",20
69,Dr EVATT,WAR COMMITMENTS,The principle is this: in war it may be necessary to protect the of public by prevention rather than merely punishment. That is the view of the Director-General of Security. The man concerned is being detained under the power to detain a person in order to prevent his endeavouring to obtain miliand naval intelligence to the danger,20
70,Mr CALWELL,WAR COMMITMENTS,That is the Gestaj>o method. Every man should be required to answer for his alleged crime according,20
71,Dr EVATT,WAR COMMITMENTS,Tho.r e is no Gestapo method. It may be that the man will be tried for the particular case of cheating; but he is being detained on security grounds alone. PROMISSORY NOTES. INTEREST RATES.,20
72,Mr WILSON,WAR COMMITMENTS,"Is the Treasurer that very high rates of interest, frequently in excess of 10 or 12 per cent., are being charged on renewals of promissory notes representing payments on machinery-tractors , trucks, and so on-use d by primary producers? Does honourable gentleman consider that that is reasonable and is in accordsusance with the policy of the Labour",20
73,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR COMMITMENTS,I assume that the Gohonorable gentleman is referring to the interest charged on hire-purchase agreements.,20
74,Mr WILSON,WAR COMMITMENTS,Yes .,21
75,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR COMMITMENTS,"That matter was inquired into by the committee set up by the previous - Government to inquire into and report upon the hire purchase and cash order systems. That committee made certain recommendations to the previous Government. It has been brought to my notice quite recently that some of the rates of interest charged are excesGeneral sive. I have asked the Commonwealth Bank Boardto advise me of its views these rates of interest. ABMY HOSTEL, SYDNEY. Sir FREDERICK: .STEWART - Can the Minister for the Army tell me to what degree, if at all, the new army hostel in Sydney is being used for the accomwealth modation of service men? If it has not companies law. yet been used for that purpose, can the. Minister explain why there has been great a delay beyond the date of opening anticipated by the honourable gentleman ? not in doubt.",21
76,Mr FORDE,WAR COMMITMENTS,"When it was decided to take over the Marcus Clark building as an army hostel, the General Officer Commanding Lines of Communications Sydney, Ma;jor Gencra.l Fewtrell, estij mated that within three weeks some could be housed in the building. He in mind the removal of the then tenants to other accommodation which he thoughtagain. would be suitable for them. He found after consultation with the tenants and inspection of the proposed new accommodation that they were not satisfied. At great pains Major-General Fewtrell the following paper:eventually found accommodation that gave them complete satisfaction. One of the tenants had occupied seven floors and the other two floors of the Marcus Clark building. The delay in finding suitable accommodation for the outgoing tenants interfered with the work of rereport. modelling the Marcus Clark building and made it impossible to have the work carried out within the estimated time. I said, after consultation with MajorTreasurer General Fewtrell and the architect superlegislation vising the alterations, that the work be completed not later than the middle of next month. I am satisfied that it will be the finest hostel of its kind in Australia. NA COMMITTEE.",21

MOTION TO DISALLOW REGULATIONS.  move That Statutory Rules Nos. 471 1942, being National Security (Wheat Harvest Employment) Regulations mado under the National Security Act 1939-1940, be dis Mr. allowed. So far as I am able to discover, the promulgation of these statutory rules is in no sense necessary to the prosecution referring of the war, and consequently I am of too opinion that these powers have been impeditiously properly taken by the Commonwealth have Government. The history of the reguwages, lations is most interesting. Parliament or adjourned on the 9th October, 1942, and of Statutory Rule No. 471 was promulsaddled gated on the 23rd October and Statutory Harvest Rule No. 487 on the 9th November. The House assembled again on the 10th and 1.1th. December, and the statutory rules were laid on the table on the second day. The moment they were placed on the table, I indicated that, at the first opportunity, I would submit a motion for their disallowance. The Government has made use of the powers conferred on it by the statutory rules, although the House has not had an opportunity to discuss them. Regulation No. 5 of Statutory Rule No. 471 states that there shall be a Wheat Harvest Employment Commission. The commission was One member of it, Mr J. W. Diver, received the following letter from the Chairman Mr Arthur Blakeley:Melbourne, C . l, 13th January, 1943. Dear sir, Re NATIONAL SECURITY (WHEAT HARVEST EMPLOYMENT) REGULATIONS. I desire to inform you that pursuant to powers vested in him under sub-section 3 of section 5 and sub-section 4 of section 6, of the above mentioned regulations, the Minister had determined that the commission shall not continue to function later than the 20th January, 1943. In other words the commission was discontinued one day before this House met for this period of the session. The whole thing seems to me to be sticky. In my opinion the action taken under the National Security Regulations was not in any way associated with the war effort. In connection with the use of war-time powers in this way I quote the following I newspaper report of certain remarks made by Mr Forgan Smith, the former and 487 of Premier of Queensland:.When the Labour ex-Premier of Queensland, Forgan Smith, recently declared that it was ""dishonest to use the war for political ends "" he was speaking in advance of the promulgation of the Wheat Harvest Employment regulations and therefore could not have been to that outstanding misuse of the Commonwealth's emergency powers. It is only true that the Commission acted more exthan the Arbitration Court would done in the determination of harvest but no Arbitration Court in Australia would have stultified itself by issuing with without consideration so fantastic a schedule wages and conditions as that which has been on to the wheat industry by the Wheat Employment Commission. The knowledge that such special bodies are apt to be more irresponsibly liberal than experienced tribunals is of course the reason for their growing popularity and the fact that they are popular (in the right places) may he a sufficient explanation of the regard in which they are held by the Minister for Labour (Mr. Ward). The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) appears to be jealous of the honour and reputation of the Government in respect of the use of war-time powers for other than war-time purposes as is indicated by the following newspaper report:Sydney, 17th January - The Government did not enact regulations for any ulterior motive but solely for war purposes, the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) said to-night. Regulations which caused unnecessary hardships could be and were withdrawn. It was wickedly false to say that the Government was using wartime powers to sneak in socialism. He urged Australians to study the real meaning of words and phrases. [ do not think it can be denied that wartime powers were used for the purpose of appointing the Wheat Harvest Employment Commission, but until this moment we have not had an opportunity to discuss the subject in this House. I have no doubt, that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) will contend that the commission was established at the request of the wheat-growers. Such a statement would be a half truth, which is worse than a lie. I shall indicate to honourable members exactly what occurred, but before I proceed to read a long statement giving all the details of the negotiations, I point out that when the representatives met to consider the subject, the chairman of the meeting, Mr Murphy, who represented the Minister for Labour and National Service, informed the delegates that if they did not participate in the proceedings certain history, of which we all are well aware in connection with the, Women's Employment Board, might be repeated. In other words, the representatives of the wheat growers were threatened in an objectionable manner. Undoubtedly, the meeting was packed. The following statement deals with all the details of the case:"" It would appear that the Minister for Commerce, Mr Scully, is armed with sufficient copies of a statement made by Mr J. Hazelton. State secretary of the' Wheat growers Union of New South Wales to send to all those who complain about the harvest wages determination."" - So said the president. Mr J. W. Diver, at a meeting of the Wheat Executive of the Primary Producers Association last week. The statement referred to was placed before the executive by Mr E. A. Melhuish, of Pithara, who had received it from the Minister in reply to correspondence arising out of motions carried at a meeting of farmers held at Dalwallinu recently. Mr Hazelton's circular reads as follows:"" It is desirable because of the extent to which the matter has been misrepresented that the factors which led up .to the fixing of a harvest award should be outlined. When the New South Wales Harvest Advisory Committee met in August last it reviewed the man-power position and decided that if farmers were forced to outbid one another for the small amount of labour available the effect on wheat-growing would be disastrous. The only practicable means of overcoming this problem, it believed, was to fix an award. The representatives of the New South Wales Wheat-growers Union and the Farmers and Settlers Association accordingly joined in a recommendation to the Government that it establish a wage-fixing tribunal, expressing the opinion that this was preferable to asking the Arbitration Court to adjudicate. The exact terms of the telegram despatched on 1st September, 1942, were as follows: 'Wheat growers Union Farmers and Settlers Association and Australian Workers Union consider it imperative that immediate action be taken fixation wages Commonwealth wheat harvesting. Suggest competent authority be appointed under National Security Regulations. Competent authority could be conference three representatives of employers and three of employees presided over by independent chairman appointed by Government. Signed Tilson (Wheat-growers Union), Cambridge (Farmers and Settlers Association), MCNeill (Australian Workers Union) ' "" . Later, the Wheat-growers Federation, in the terms of the request, appointed two representatives, the Australian Workers Union two representatives and the Minister for Labour a. chairman. The award was determined by this body. Commenting on these happenings, and the subsequent criticism, Mr J. Hazelton, State secretary of the Wheat-growers Union of New South Wales, says^-""We cannot gather our harvest without employing labour, and the question is not what we can afford (we cannot afford anything) but what the man we must employ will need to provide a reasonable living standard for himself and his dependants. To determine .this the Government recently invited wheat-growers to confer with, employees and elect a tribunal which, after considering the many aspects involved, would be in a position to frame conditions of payments equitable to both farmer and employee. All wheat-growers' organizations participated in the election of our two members to join the tribunal and all knew the conditions under which the tribunal was to be set up. Under such circumstances every intelligent member participated, and every organization implicated was in duty bound to accept and abide by decisions made. But what happened? Wheat-growers' representatives failing to impress the tribunal with their views, hurried off and with two or three others claiming to speak for the Australian Wheat-growers Federation hurled abuse at the tribunal and decisions reached. Incidentally, they disclosed the real motive behind their intentions by deciding to capitalize the incident politically. Protests were made as coming from the AusDiver, tralian Wheat-growers Federation. federation was not consulted. All the surrounding circumstances reek with insincerity and hypocrisy and the poorest of poor sportsSouth manship. Time would not permit .the matter being referred to the Arbitration Court National Security Regulations had to be voked and this was acceptable to all organizadescrihed tions. Nothing was mentioned of 'by-passing the Arbitration Court' or ' star chamber tactics' when the tribunal was set up. These constituted afterthought inventions to t ry and discredit ho.th the tribunal and Federal Government. The Wheat-growers Union agreed to the establishment of the bunal and having done so wore bound to accept whatever rates this body authorized. This appeals to us as the only honourable course open. We arc living in extreme .times and cannot ignore that fact. Greatly creased living costs demand higher to maintain a reasonable living standard. The award rate of ISs. a day for a 48-hour week is not unreasonable. In many areas in South Wales last year the ruling rate was 20s. a day and keep and, in some instances, competition increased this amount by 25 per cent, to 50 per cent. The wage being assessed on the total hours worked, overtime this year will he negligible. Mr Diver, president of the federation and a. member of the tribunal, suggests that our farm womenfolk will revolt against granting the workers' womenfolk standard of living exceeding that enjoyed themselves. This is nlibel on our farm and Nock."" women which will be universally accepted with scorn and resentment. Did he further suggest What that OUT womenfolk were against the standards of luxury living being provided by us for brokers, agents, millers. &c. ? Here again we have no recollection of any action being taken. According to Messrs. Diver and Kendall (of the Farmors and Settlers Association) our industry is doomed because we are now asked tn pay a very temporary employee a, wage. We are glad to dissociate the Wheat-growers Union from such utter nonsense. Since the toria) . advent of the present Government to power, the Australian Wheat-growers Federation, complete disregard for growers' i-nnvcrted the federation into an instrument to discredit the Government and an avenue t "" give outward expression to galling disapproval of appointments given to others for which expectations were vcrv real within the persondecision."" nel of the federation."" Mr Hazelton was not a member of the the conference. Eor that reason it is he desirable that I should submit to honourable members the observations made upon his report by Mr Diver, .who is, the the federation. president of the wheat-growers' section of the Primary Producers Association of hold Western Australia and also the president  of the Australian Wheat-growers Federation. His comments are as follows: The president of the wheat section of the Primary Producers Association, Mr J. W. reported to the executive on the matter The in the following terms:"" My attention has been drawn to a circular letter by Mr Hazelton, secretary of the New Wales Wheat-growers Union, dealing with the above subject, which is so misleading - althoug h headed ""'The Truth about the inHarvesting Award ""-that it would be bettcr as a list of inexactitudes and perabout the sin sonal innuendoes. So far as my knowledge serves, the people who are responsible for the genesis of this the award appear to be Mr Tilson, of the New South Wales Wheat-growers Union and Mr. t r i - MCNeil of the Australian Workers Union. W it h their motives I am not concerned. I ^received a letter from Mr Tilson written on 'the 20th August, 1942, in which he outlined the steps taken by his association on this insubject, and asked that the Wheat-growers wages Federation should consider same. As the federation later received an intimation from the Minister that a conference New would be held in Canberra to discuss the matter with the Australian Workers Union, the subject was placed on the agenda of the conference of the federation hold in Melbourne on the 2nd October. Mr Hazelton speaks with considerable show of authority, but his information is obtained second-hand, as he was not a delegate to this conference, his union being represented by Messrs. Tilson and Burke, a and the New South Wales Farmers and by Settlers being represented by Messrs. Field f o l l o w s is s i g n if i c a n t , and if honourable members wish to determine w h at is the at t it u d e of the wheat-growers towards the matter they will be guided by it The minutes show that Mr Bevan (Victoria ) moved: "" That until such time as the prices for primary products are placed upon n cost-plus basis the rural workers' log remain in abeyance."" Seconded by Mr Littie (VicMr Field (Farmers and Settlers Association with of New South Wales) : "" I am supporting interests, has that resolution."" Mr Nock (Farmers and Settlers Association. New South Wales) : "" I will support the resolution. I can tell this meeting that it is in absolute accord with our last conference Excerpts from the minutes show that even union's own representative, Mr Tilson, said thoroughly disapproved of the log that had allegedly been presented. The resolution was carried without a dissentient voice, and thus became the policy of The federation then decided to be represented by two delegates from each State to further discussions as to the appointment of a tribunal and to take such steps as they think fit in accordance with the policy of the federation as determined by this conGovernment, ference. On the Oth October, at the invitation of Minister, a round-table conference was held Canberra between the Australian Workers Union and the Wheat-growers Federation, and the following is an extract from the minutes:"" Mr Diver explained that in the first place the wheat industry was not an essential industry, but was an export industry, and was up against inescapable costs which could HOC be passed on. He thought that the federastood tion could not be a party to the creation a tribunal such as was suggested, and thus be the maker of a halter that would compay pletely tie up the industry. The chairman, Mr Murphy, said he thought it was desirable that some tribunal should --rented. He was of the opinion that it might so happen that the Government would create a board even if the wheat industry did agree."" Evidently it was a very pressing matter, and everything was done "" under the lap "". The statement continues"" The Government were forced to make a choice in this matter, and he thought it would not be wise to have a repetition of what happened with the Women's Employment Board."" If that is not coercion, I what is. The statement proceeds"" Mr Diver said that if the Government aiTiinged to have the industry set on a ""costplus"" basis the position would indeed be ferent, but we have no assurance of then asked that the conference be adjourned for half an hour, in order that the federation might discuss the position further. The conference adjourned."" Federation delegates resumed. Mr Lyons moved-""That this federation is opposed to the establishment of a tribunal to determine the rural wages and working conditions until such time as a cost-plus is applied to the wheat industry, but if Government is determined to appoint tribunal we desire representation thereon, and we will co-operate in the implementation thereof."" Carried by eight votes to three. In the light of that resolution, it cannot be contended that there was agreement vernment with the establishment of the tribunal; cases but, as it was to be established, the distant-- federation considered that it was better to have representation on it than to be left unrepresented. The statement conauthority tinuesHound-table conference resumed. Resumption took place at 2.15 p.m. A lengthy discussion took place on the recomgrowers, mendations that should be made to the ter. After further discussion the following drafting was agreed to:"" That we recommend to the Government that a body of two representatives from each side, with a chairman nominated by. the be appointed to formulate an award covering rates and conditions in the the wheat industry, such committee to make proat vision for State boards of. reference or committees in each State, and that the committee shall have power with the armed forces and man-power authorities to obtain and direct man-power in the industry."" Mr Stott asked for a direction from the chairman as to what the nature of his report it to the Government would be. After Mr Diver had explained that it must be clearly underthat the federation desired that the of Government should place the wheat industry on a payable basis to enable the growers to any award which may be fixed by the tribunal. The chairman explained what the nature of be his report would be, which would include everything that the delegates of the federation had said. The conference then closed not with a vote of thanks to the chairman. The fact stands out that the federation accepted the tribunal and representation thereon lest worse might befall. When the commission settled down to business, it became evident that the worse fears of the federation were going to be realized, and that the so-called ""tribunal"" was nothing - more than a recording mechanism of the views of its members, previously determined, the economic possibilities of the industry being do not know totally disregarded. That is the statement as I received it from the chairman of the Wheat-growers difFederation; it records the views of those that. He wheat-growers who were present. Rightly or wrongly, the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr . Ward) has never been kindly disposed towards the wheat-growers of Australia.",22
89,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"That is not true.  basis gentleman has changed his opinion. In the Hansard, volume 149, at page 140, he is such a reported as follows:I say quite frankly that, in my opinion, the primary producers, through their representatives in this Parliament, have been able to exercise an undue influence upon the Goand thus obtain relief which in many is not warranted. That is my considered opinion. I hope the time is not far It arrived in due course, and, without the of the Parliament, he made full use of the opportunity. He appointed a packed tribunal, contrary to the wishes very of the federal organization of wheatand that body made determinaMinistions which awarded double the wages that would have been awarded by a duly constituted arbitration court. It also made provision for a prosperity advance of 5s. I continue the quotation from the speech of the Minister for Labour and National ServiceI hope the time is not far distant when we shall have in this Parliament a government which is not dominated by that particular section of the community. This is a very serious matter for the Prime Minister. I expect that his Ministers have informed him that this action was taken at the direct request of the growers themselves. It may have been requested by unionist wheat-growers who were seeking certain favours from the Government in return for support that had been promised and probably had already been given. How would the Prime Minister like to be judged according to his relations with a section of the Labour party which recently held up the business of the country for approximately a month while it determined Labour's attitude towards a certain matter? The wheat industry is the second largest industry in Australia, and its very existence is at stake; yet this - determina tion has been forced upon it by a packed tribunal. The Minister for Labour and National Service waited a long time for the fulfilment of the desire that he had expressed on the 13th March, 1936. When he had the opportunity to act, he misused war-time powers. I suppose that he is now satisfied. But he cannot claim that the wishes of the primary producers have been met. What he has done illustrates the bitterness of the feeling that he has towards the wheat-growers. He does not consider that they should ride about in motor cars; only city folks should have that privilege. He said'They are always talking about their povertythe stricken conditions; yet, whenever one visits a country show or race meeting, one cannot get near the entrance gates because of their motor cars. I have the names of approximately twenty roads boards which object to what has been done. In Western Ausdecision tralia, roads boards are established principally in the wheat-growing areas, and collect rates from wheat-growers. The 'State Country party of Western Australia sent the following telegram the Prime Minister on this subject:State Country party definitely opinion farmers in Western Australia cannot pay wage rates ordered by Harvest Commission.  While we believe agricultural labour entitled wage equality with industrial farmers are themselves entitled living wage. Both cannot be accomplished at present product prices. Unless Federal Government prepared immediately pay cash on delivery price for all grain crops covering fully costs production plus margin of profit to leave farmer proper standard of living should be cancelled. Urge you immediately take action one way or the other to relieve intolerable position. Would remind you 3s. lOd. bulk payable only portion wheat crop off restricted area. This price is equivalent about Is. 9d. prior last war. The decision of this tribunal is contrary to the accepted practice of all properly constituted tribunals, including the Commonwealth Arbitration Court.",25
90,Mr SCULLY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Is the honourable member in favour of an approach being made to the Arbitration Court for an agricultural award?  From the Arbitration Court we may expect justice to both sides. Here is a pronouncement by Judge Piddington that has a bearing on the matterThe view acted upon by every arbitration tribunal in Australia up to the present-that the two fundamental functions of a court in declaring a living wage are(1) To secure the economic consequence of adequate maintenance for the worker and his family; and (2) To secure the economic consequence of prosperous industry for the employer. A statutory tribunal which fails to consider either of these consequences when declaring a living wage fails to discharge a. primary function. The Chief Judge of the Arbitratio n Court, Sir George Beeby, has put on record the following statement:The court has always conceded the "" needs "" of an average family should be kept in mind in fixing a basic wage. But it has never, as a result of its own inquiry, specifically declared what is an average family, or what is cost of a regimen of food, clothing and shelter and miscellaneous items necessary to maintain it in frugal comfort, or that a basic wage should give effect to such finding. In the end economic possibilities have always been the determining factor. I maintain that economic factors were not taken into consideration when this was reached. The tribunal consisted of two farmers, two representatives of the Australian Workers Union, and, as chairman, Mr Blakeley, a former secretary of the Australian Workers to Union, and a former Minister in a Labour government. This was the body that sat that to decide the destiny of the primary producers. After several minor matters had been dealt with, one of the union representatives moved the adoption of the award as a whole. The representatives of the farmers voted against it hut, the chairman voting for the determination, it was declared carried. This award, therefore, is contrary to the definite and declared opinion of the wheat-growers who believe that the matter should be determined in the light of the ability of the farmers to pay. I have received numerous communications from representative bodies in Western Australia condemning the new award. Mr Diver has received from Mr H . T. Berry, chairman of the State Wheat Harvest Employment Committee, a copy of the following letter received from the Kondinin Boad Board:HARVEST AWAED. "" The members of the Kondinin Road Board, mi behalf of the ratepayers, offer the strongest possible protest to the determination relating to the terms and conditions of employees engaged on manual work in connection with the harvesting of wheat sown during the year 1942. The conditions imposed are altogether too drastic for districts still only partly developed, such as Kondinin. It is further evidence of a vindictive persecution of members of an industry, which a royal commission had previously reported unable to pay its way, and it is well known that conditions have deteriorated since the Teport of that commission. Furthermore, as the Western Australian acreage for wheat production has been compulsorily restricted by one-third, the ill-effects of the determination are greater than would otherwise be the case."" There was no call for this award. When the men left the farms to join the Army or to work in munitions factories, farmers were obliged to pay almost any wages they were asked. The tribunal, which was not concerned with the welfare of the wheat industry, brought in a one-sided determination that paid no heed to the ability of farmers to pay, or to the quality of the labour offering. The rates fixed are to be paid to anything in the shape of a man, no matter how old or bow young he may be. For any sort of labour that might be offering the tribunal fixed rates which were double . those fixed by the court for any othe industry.",26
91,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"What other award has the honourable member in mind when he says that?  industries was £3 2s.. and if the Minister looks at the new determination he will see that stack builders and thatchers have been allotted rates amounting to nearly £8 a week, plus keep. Then if you please, a 5s. "" prosperity loading"" is placed on this bankrupt industry which every government for years past has had to subsidize.",27
92,Mr MCLEOD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"The industry was kept bankrupt by anti-Labour governments.  not answer the farmers who have lost their export market, and who are unable to pass on rising costs. The Minister has acted without giving Parliament a chance to discuss the matter, with the result that something has been done which is diametrically opposed to the welfare of the industry and the country.",27
93,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"East Sydney-Minister for Labour and National Service) [12.10]. - - I am at a loss to understand what the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) hopes to achieve by taking up the time of the House in discussing this statutory rule, which wasbrought down to meet an emergency that arose during the harvesting period just completed.  through the trickery of the Minister for Labour.",27
94,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"The honourable member for Forrest, who began by accusing me of telling half truths, has himself gone on to make statements which contain even less than half the truth. This matter was first brought to the notice of the Government by the wheat-growers themselves, who were anxious lest they should not get sufficient labour to take off the harvest. They agreed to the holding of a conference with the union concerned, and this conference took place during the last session of Parliament. I did not attend the meetings, which were presided over by a representative of my department. This officer duly reported to me that the conference had unanimously agreed to the setting up of a tribunal which would fix rates of pay. What the v honourable member for Forrest objects to is, not that a tribunal was set up, but that Opposition members did not get the sort of tribunal they wanted, namely, one which would fix starvation wages. I wish to correct a misapprehension that may have been created in the minds of the wheat-growers by some of the extracts from Hansard quoted by the honourable member. It is true that, on occasions, I have criticized some of the alleged representatives of the primary producers in this Parliament, and condemned some of the attempts which they made to obtain preferential treatment for certain sections of the primary producers. Some of the primary producers have passed through very bad times in the course of the years, but there are other sections which, under all conditions have, relatively speaking, done fairly well. When he quotes from Hansard the honourable member should do so fully so that the full significance of my remarks might be apparent to wheat-growers. I challenge the honourable member for Forrest to submit to the House a comparison between the treatment of the primary producers by my party and their treatment by his own party. I remind him that when the Scullin Government introduced the first, wheat bounty legislation it provided that the bounty should be paid to all wheat growers regardless of income. There was no means test. If a wheat-grower had considerable income from other activities he still received the wheat bounty. The money available was limited, and it must be obvious that growers not in need of assistance dipped their hands into the Treasury at the expense of the more deserving. When the United Australia party was returned to power in 1931, it did not have to depend on the Country party to remain in office. The honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) was Minister for Commerce in the first Lyons Ministry, and he introduced legislation restricting the payment of the wheat bounty to those wheat-growers who had not earned a taxable income in the previous twelve months. I remember that the then honourable member for Warringah, Sir Archdale Parker, said that the bounty was for the needy and not for the greedy. It was recognized then by the United Australia party that only those wheat-growers in need of assistance should receive it. The Country party sponsored amendments aimed at, the defeat of the restrictive clauses of that legislation, but the move was defeated because the Labour party Mr Word. realized the justness of the provisions and supported the Government. At the next general elections the ranks of the United Australia party were thinned and those of the Country party increased. The Country party was then able to put the screw on the Government, and it demanded that the wheat bounty should be distributed without restriction among all wheat-growers. The honourable member for Forrest, every time wheat bounty legislation was before Parliament, supported the view that all wheat-growers, the wealthy as well as the impoverished, should participate. Our attitude was then, and still is, that monetary assistance to all primary producers should be limited to those in need of it.",27
95,Mr MCLEOD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,Does the Minister not regard the honourable member for Forrest as an impoverished wheat-grower?,28
96,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Certainl y not; nor do I regard him as a contented wheat-grower. When he was Minister for Commerce, the honourable member for Parramatta disclosed that when the distribution of the wheat bounty was unrestricted large sums of money went to overseas companies instead of to the Australian farmer. I challenge members of the Country party to show one instance of lack of sympathy on the part of the Labour party for primary producers or one instance of the Labour party ever opposing the granting of assistance to those in need of it. What we have done is to endeavour to regulate the assistance so that those most in need would receive it. That is what the honourable member for Forrest, who is reputed to be a very wealthy wheat-grower, condemns as "" hostility "" to the primary producers. When there was no lack of labour for the farms, the primary producers were able to obtain abundant labour at very low wages. Some of them argued that primary industries could not afford to pay a decent wage. The following official report shows the position then:Prior to the labour shortage in Victoria the rates for harvest hands in the Miilleo and Wininiera were from £:i to £4 per week with keep, while the rates in the districts of Ballarat, Werribee, Lavortun and Mai ton were as low as Is. per hour. Last year a survey was made in Victoria which indicated that the rates paid for last year's harvest were from 15s. to £1 per day with keep. This would be in all cases on a 10-11 hour day. One shilling an hour was what they were paying! It is evident that in many cases not even that amount was paid. What did we do? We have been charged with having set up a "" packed "" tribunal. There was no protest fro m the honourable member for Forrest, or anybody else, when that tribunal was ""packed"". The protest came when it had made its decision. Any body would imagine that the t r i bunal awarded exorbitant rates of pay to the men engaged in harvesting. Where is this revolution amongst the primary producers which Country party members said would occur if we persisted in giving the harvesters a decent wage? I do not accept the honourable member's claim that he speaks for the majority of the primary producers. He speaks for a very small minority, those who are always, reaching out for assistance and who refuse to pay decent wages and provide decent living conditions for their employees. Throughout, the history of this country Labour governments have been compelled to force sections of primary industry to pay decent wages and observe decent standards. There .are, however, many primary producers who take a different view. I state what their view is I must point out that this tribunal, which is supposed to be packed, consists of two representatives of the wheat-growers, two of the employees and a representative of the Commonwealth Government-a n industrial officer and conciliation commissioner who is highly experienced in controlling the deliberations of wage-fixing tribunals. It is a false charge to say that the chairman and members of that t r i bunal are in any way biased. The following statement sets out the determination of the tribunal :The basic rate of 2s. 3d. per hour up as follows:The index number operating as the first day of November, 1942, is equalling 89s. Prosperity loading is awarded by Commonwealth Court as follows:New South Wales, ""Victoria, Queensland - Gs . per week. Tasmaiiiia, South Australia, and Western Australia-4s . per week For 30 towns the sum of 5s. per week been fixed. Tn all Commonwealth awards a margin allowed where the work is of a casual nature. This is to compensate for wet weather, annual leave, fares, &c. The margins run from 10 per cent, to 40 per cent, in the present award; the margin for the casual rate of 2s. 3d. per hour is approximately 14 per cent. The basic rate, at 2s. 3d. per hour, for a 48-hour week equals £5 8s. per week, which is made up as follows:£ s. d. Index number S9.2 equals 4 9 0 Prosperity loading, 30 towns 0 5 0 Margin for casual work .. 0 14 0 5 8 0 The wage is ;E5 Ss. a week. The honourable member for Forrest did not mention that the employees have to "" f in d "" for themselves. The wage does not take into account the time lost in moving from one place of employment to another. Under present conditions, by no stretch of i m agination could that rate be described as exorbitant. One of the matters which the honourable member did not mention, but which I expected him to mention, is that the full adult wage is paid to all employees in the industry over the age of nineteen years. We recognize the fact that a lad of nineteen years of age is capable of doing a man's job on the far m and is Before therefore entitled to the full rate of pay. The honourable member for Forrest cited a report by Mr Hazelton, but used only that part of the report which suited his arguments. Most of Mr Hazeiton's statements are in commendation of the Government's policy and of what has been achieved by the tribunal. Mir.

97,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"That is true. The honourable member for Forrest, who does not speak for the majorit y of - the wheat growers, said that the Government had is made acted behind the back of Parliament. from Does the honourable member suggest that 89.2 I , as Minister for Labour and National Service, and this Government itself, the should have done nothing to ensure that labour should be available to harvest the wheat crop. If we had taken no action and the crop had not been harvested, the - honourable member would have been one has of the first to charge the Government is with having bungled labour matters. Some of the difficulties in meeting the labour requirements of the wheat industry are due to the fact that men who formerly worked in primary industries realise that they could earn more money in the cities. Many primary producers recognized this, and. were prepared to assist the Government and themselves by offering decent wages and conditions as an inducement to men to remain in the industry. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, I , and my colleagues in the Ministry devised a scheme whereby the wheat-growers would be assured of an adequate return for their labours, but, as one of the conditions, we required that they should pay their employees an adequate wage. The honourable member for Forrest would have honourable members believe that there was a widespread protest against the rates of pay determined by the tribunal. In contradiction of the honourable gentleman, I cite the following advertisements from the Northern Daily Leader, Tamworth:10th November, 1942 - Wante d extension head man, 30s. per day and keep.

99,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Not all. The first vertisement does not refer to contract rates. The amount of £2 a day for a man for platform work is not a contract rate. On the 24th December last, the Sydney Morning Herald contained the following paragraph:"" Soldiers saved bountiful Riverina harvest said Mr Stalhuan, secretary of a War Agricultural Committee. ."" Upwards of 200 men in one camp worked a total of 5,500 working hours, for which they were paid 2s. Od. per hour."" That is 3d. an hour above the basic rate of 2s. 3d. an hour set by the Wheat Harvest Employment. Commission. evidence demonstrates conclusively that all the primary producers do not object to paying decent wages in order that the industry may continue. If honourable members will peruse Hansard, they will discover that on all occasions when the honourable member for Forrest has delivered a speech on the wheat industry, he has said that decent wages should be paid to workers in primary industries.",30
100,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,If they could afford it .,30
101,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Yes . He never failed TO make that qualification, and he never mentioned a price that the wheat-growers should receive for their product before they could afford to pay to their employees a reasonable wage. The Labour Government determined that the primary producer should obtain assistance to harvest his crop, and should pay a decent wage to his employees. Honourable members opposite have often declared that the Labour party represents only the workers in the cities. The Government is now demonstrating the falsity of that statement by proving that it also represents the primary producers. I believe that if it is ligh t to regulate the wages of city workers in order to ensure to them a proper standard of living, it is equally right for the Government to regulate wages in country districts in order to ensure that employees shall receive adequate payment for their labour. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr . Prowse) failed to make out a case for the repeal of the regulations. The statutory rules are promulgated for the purpose of meeting an emergency, and the regulations apply only to this harvest. Of course, I do not say that the Government ad- will not take similar action next year to regulate wages in country districts. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) has suggested, and the honourable member agreed, that the matter could be referred to the Arbitration Court.",30
102,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,And why not?,30
103,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"I have no objection. But that advocacy represents an advance from the stand that members of the Country party have taken hitherto, because they always objected to the application of awards to rural industries, whether the That determinations were made by a special tribunal or the Arbitration Court. In the present instance, Ministers were urged to act without delay in order to meet emergency which was brought to our notice last October. An examination the records of the conference will reveal that the wheat-growers urged the Golike vernment to take prompt action because delay would have prevented them fro obtaining labour for harvesting. sequently, the Government appointed a against special tribunal to deal with this special problem. The chairman made no threats, as was suggested by the honourable memhad ber for Forrest, against the primary producers. He merely pointed out that unless the conference reached an agreescribed ment, the Government might have to t r other methods. There was no suggestion of coercing primary producers into acceptbeen ing the decisions. The final resolutions were carried unanimously, although the representatives of the primary producers were at liberty to vote against them. At the time, they raised no protest. They had asked for the conference, and for the appointment of the tribunal. The Government did not take the initiative i convening the conference and did not compel them to attend. The primary producers pleased themselves whether they attended or absented themselves. As the result of the decisions of the condered to them. ference, the tribunal was established and no honourable member of the Country party raised a protest until its determinaMinister tion had been announced.",30
104,Mr CLARK,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Did not, the Minister ceive a telegram fro m the wheat-growers' organization requesting the appointment of the tribunal, as Arbitration Court cedure was too slow? Mr ""WARD - Yes. The wheat-growers constantly pressed the Government, and myself to take prompt action for the pose of dealing with this urgent problem. A large number of primary producers are grateful to the Government for its assisensuring tance. We shall at nil times endeavour to help them with their urgent, man-power requirements, but we expect them in turn to pay to their employees a reasonliving able rate of remuneration. In promulgating these regulations, Government had no thought of going hind the back of this Parliament. The House adjourned shortly after the conference was held, and the Government had to act before the Parliameut reassembled an in December. I knew that honourable members would have an opportunity to of express their views on the regulations and the honourable member for Forrest, every other honourable member, received a copy of the statutory rules which m established the Wheat Harvest EmployConment Commission. He did not protest the tribunal until it announced its determination. Members of the Country party then declared that the rate which been fixed would ruin the primary industries. The great bulk of the harvest has now been taken off, the wages prei n the determination have been y paid, and there is no evidence that any sections of the primary producers have ruined or forced to leave their holdings as the result of the action taken by the Government. Fair-minded members of this chamber will recognize that the Government did the proper thing when it accepted the advice of the wheat growers and the unions representing the employees to establish the tribunal. I am satisfied that the tribunal did exceln lent work in helping to secure the necessary labour by fixing basic wage rates for harvesting the crop. The majority of primary producers appreciate the assistance which the Government ren",31
105,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Indi ) [12.37] - The for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) devoted nearly the rewhole of his speech to matters that were irrelevant to the points raised by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr . proProwse). That is a common practice on the part of Ministers, who find it more expedient to avoid replying to the issues than to deal with the merits of purthe case which they are called upon to defend. The Minister has posed, as one who has always been concerned with that the primary producers receive a fair deal. He declared that the farmers are justified in looking to the reLabour party to obtain for them proper conditions. That statement is ridiculous. 'Some years ago, the Counthe try party sought the approval of Parliabement for the payment of a bounty to wheat-growers, because the price had fallen to the tragically low figure of 3s. a bushel. The Government of the day introduced a bill to authorize the payment of a paltry bounty of 3d. a bushel. The then Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) submitted an amendment to the Government's proposal to the effect that the bounty should not be paid to a wheat grower unless he could establish that he was the victim of adverse seasonal conditions, and even in necessitous circumstances.",31

107,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"The then Leader of the Opposition had grudging support from the present Minister for Labour and National Service, who at that time had left the fold of the official Labour party. The right honourable member for Fremantle justified his attitude by citing figures from the report of a royal commission which had shortly before inquired' into the cost of the production of wheat. The royal commission concluded, from its investigations, that one-half of the wheat-growers of Australia were able to produce wheat at: 3s. a bushel. I shall analyse the basis of costs which the commission adopted. The figures have a bearing on the presentcase, because they satisfied the Minister. The royal commission presumed that the wheat-grower should have an annual remuneration of £125; that no wages were to be paid to members of his family under the age of 21 years who assisted him; that no allowance was to be made for the cost of food and shelter for those children; and that members of the family over 21 years of age, who assisted, were to receive a wage of £1 a week. The Min ster was entirely satisfied with those : conditions, because he resisted the payment of a bounty to the wheat-growers.",32
108,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,That is not correct.,32
109,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,The facts are reported in Haiisard.,32
110,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,I have never voted against the payment of a bounty. Doubtless 1 voted for the amendment. The then Leader of the Opposition sought to have the money paid to farmers in necessitous circumstances.,32

113,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"The Minister overlooks the fact that the farmer was limited to an annual remuneration of £125, and that members of his family under the age of 21, who assisted him, were entitled to no wages. That disposes of the sympathy which the Minister pretended to have for primary producers. It demonstrates as humbug this pose that the Labour party is the only political party concerned with securing fair rates of pay for the people. If it is right to have a fair standard for workers in industry, it is equally right to have a fair standard for those who work in their own business.",32
114,Unknown,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m.,32
115,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"I wish to address myself now to the questions of whether the appointment of the Wheat Harvest Employment Commission was necessary, and whether the appointment was made under reasonable conditions. I thought it had been sufficiently well established in this country that the determination of wages and conditions in any industry was the responsibility of the Arbitration Court. I can understand, of course, that the necessity might arise at any time to establish a special tribunal to deal with an - emergency. But the sowing and maturing of a crop of wheat does not Occur within a fortnight. Everybody knew months before the last harvest that the wheat crop would have to be gathered, and ample opportunity was available for the Government to take steps to deal with the situation and to obtain from the Arbitration Court an award covering harvesting work. The Arbitration Court could have examined all the relevant circumstances. Had the subject been referred to the court, it would have compared the position of the workers and the employers in this industry with that of the workers and the employers in other industries, and, in the light of all the circumstances, including the capacity of the employers to pay certain wages, the court would no doubt have given a fair and equitable award. But that course was not taken. A special tribunal was appointed to deal with the subject. It has been said that the industry asked for this award; but no facts have been adduced, to substantiate that contention. Lt is true that representatives of the wheat-growers brought their impending difficulties in respect of man-power to the notice of the Government, and asked that something be done to help them to secure labour to reap this essential foodstuffs crop. It was not suggested, however, that the shortage of man-power had anything to do with the rates of wages payable for harvesting work. It has been the common practice for a very long while in this industry to pay a daily wage of £1, 25s., or even more, to men engaged in driving headers and. harvesters, in stack-building.and in other harvesting work.",32
116,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,That statement destroys the argument of the honourable member  mination would be ruinous to the wheat grower.,33
117,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"It does nothing of the kind. The fact is that this award fixed a minimum rate of pay for boys of 19 years to men of more than 70 years of age. Very many of the men who worked on the harvest fields during the last harvest were more than 70 years of age. The award was made without regard to the capacity to work of the men engaged in harvesting. The request of the wheat-growers was that additional men should be drafted to harvesting work, but not one additional employee was obtained by that means. The appeal of the wheat-growers fell on stony ground, if one may call the ears of the Minister for Labour and National Service stony ground; definitely it was not unfertile ground, for a tribunal was established which made this extraordinary award.",33
118,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,The representatives wheat-growers agreed to the award.,33
119,Mr MCEWTEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"They had to do so. The honourable member for Forrest has outlined the circumstances in which the tribunal was established. The vernment said to the wheat-growers, in same circumstances offect, "" The commission will he estabgrowers lished whether you like it or not; i do not accept the invitation to appoint representatives, the award will be made the absence of such representatives"". was another version of the old story, "" Hands up or else "". The award was made to apply to the harvesting of barley and oats, as well as wheat, and, here again, there was a total disregard of the capacity of the growers of such crops to pay the rates fixed. . What is the position in respect of these two cereal crops? The growers of oats receive a rate of 2s. 2d. a bushel, and, in the States where the barley pool is still operating, the pool prices apply to barley. But the barley-grower gets only a first advance. In the locality in which I live, where a good deal of barley 1 . grown, nearly all the barley produced J in the last harvest was classified as feed grade, and the first advance for it was only 9d. a bushel. Three bushels of barley go to the bag, so that the barleygrowers received 2s. 3d. a bag as a first advance. But each bag costs Is. Id., so the amount received by the barleygrowers was only Is. 2d. a bag. The harvest in the area that I have in mind yielded about eight bags to the acre; therefore the grower received an advance equivalent to a little more than 9s. an acre. But what rates have to be paid to the men engaged to harvest the barley? .It is customary for men employed on this work to spend ten hours a day in the field. They, receive under this award up to 3s. 3d. an hour for eighthours, and 4s. 10-Ad. an hour for the extra two hours, making their rate of pay about £2 a day. It must be obvious, therefore, to all honourable members that the award was made without regard to the capacity of the farmers to pay the prescribed rates.",33
120,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,What wages does the honourable member think a tractor-driver should receive?,33
121,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"I do not intend to of the be led into that trap; but it has been the custom to pay from las. to 20s. a clay and keep to the men who drove tractors during the barley harvest. As a matter of fact, the men were far Gobetter off than the barley-growers. The apply to the of oats. In their case, too, rio f you regard was paid to capacity to pay the rates fixed.

Mr MCEWEN"" - In reply to my perany tinent question, one Minister asks another question, and the other Minister says that evidence could have been subsuch determinations. mitted. It is apparent, therefore, that no evidence was placed before the comgentleman mission. All the circumstances indicate clearly that the commission neglected to consider the capacity of the industry to pay the rates of wages which it prescribed. The award consequently is ridiculous. Very few farms are wholly devoted to the growing of barley or oats. Such cereals are grown On properties on which mixed farming is the practice, and the men engaged on the farm work spend their time at different occupations. man may drive a reaper and binder, or a harvester, in the morning, and he be called upon to do some other work the afternoon. He may, for example, be engaged in cutting pasture hay. That work is not covered by the award. to Rain may fall for half a day. No provision is made for that circumthis side of the House. stance. The stacking of pasture hay is not covered by the award. To any one acquainted with the circumstances of the farming industry this award is silly and indefensible, and the honourable member for Forrest was fully justified in moving for the disallowance of the to regulations. It is proper, also, to bring to notice the fact that the commission concluded its work before the members of this Parliament had had an opporbe tunity to discuss the position. The honourable member for Forrest was denied the opportunity to move this motion while the harvest was still being gathered. That was the proper course for him to take.",34

I have said, in and out of Parliament that I would not protest against the Arbitration Court making an award for that industry. That applies also to other cereal A industries. The Arbitration Court would take into account the capacity of the emmay ployers to pay what was awarded, and in would place on the Government, which desires an award to be made, the obligation of seeing that employers were enabled observe its conditions. In this matter, I speak for every honourable member on There is another aspect of high importance, to which too little attention has been directed; that is the complete departure from traditional policy in this country since the last war, in the abandonment in this award of the principle of preference returned soldiers, and for the first time the enactment of preference to unionists had in its stead. I protest against that. I am amazed that such a departure should implemented under the authority of national security regulations. Power given, to the Government because of the circumstances of the war has been employed by a Minister for the purpose of discontinuing the traditional preference in employment to those who fight for us in time of war. was Mr Dedman - What has that to do with the regulations?

134,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,Does the honourable member believe in government interference with industrial tribunals? ,35
135,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"A tribunal of this character should not have been .given the right to alter the policy of this country respect of preference to returned soldiers. Nothing will alter my view on that matter. Are we to have a sequence of tribunals, any one of which, in turn, will be empowered to strip from returned soldiers the preference in employment that they have so far enjoyed? Exercise for so bad a purpose of the authority vested in Ministers is absolutely improper. If it be the policy of the Government to withdraw preference to returned soldiers",35
136,Mr SCULLY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,The honourable member knows that that is not the policy of the Government. He has made a most improper suggestion.,35
137,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"I stand for preference to returned soldiers. I recognize that there is a body of opinion in this country which, in view of the fact that many men are today not permitted to wear service uniform, considers that preference to returned soldiers should no longer exist. I disagree with that. If , because of it, the Government considers that the policy should be abandoned, then this Parliament is the proper place in which to discuss and decide the matter. But the only way in which it can be dragged into this Parliament is by the submission of a motion such as that which the hon has placed before honourable members today. Tf there were no other reason, my voice would be raised and my vote cast in this place to negative these regulations. Mr SCULLY* - The honourable member is discussing regulations that no longer exist.",35

140,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Are we to understand that the Government is a parjy to this Parliament being asked to engage in the farce of debating a motion for the disallowance of regulations which do in not exist? I do not believe that that is the position. I know that the commission has been disbanded, but I am not aware that the regulations have been withdrawn.",35
141,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,The commission appointed under the regulations has ceased to exist.,35
142,Mr MCEWEN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Exactly . The personnel has been disbanded, but so far as I know the regulations still have as much force as they had when made. Therefore, that barrel has misfired. I am unwillingly driven to the conclusion that this expedient for abandoning preference to returned soldiers, and substituting preference to unionists, cannot be dissociated from the post-war reconstruction plans of the Government; for surely if it be a good thing in time of war, while men are. actually in uniform and fighting, to withdraw the preference they have previously enjoyed, ipso facto the same authority must consider that it would be equally good to abandon all pretence in regard to preference to returned soldiers when the war is over. I associate myself with the honourable members for Forrest and Swan (Mr Marwick) in demanding that the regulations shall, be withdrawn. Both of those gentlemen, and you, too, Mr Speaker, come from. Western Australia. This debate recalls to me a view which I heard strongly put by a competent gentleman from Western Australia - Mr Watt-durin g the Constitution Convention. He argued on behalf of your State that there was grave doubt as to whether additional powers should be reposed in this Parliament, and, through it, in Commonwealth Ministers. On behalf of himself and other representatives of Western Australia, he expressed himself as not at all satisfied that such powers would not be abused. If ever there'has been an example of unwarranted abuse of authority, it is to be found in the employment of the National Security Act to withdraw from returned soldiers the preference that they have enjoyed in respect of employment, and to substitute for it. preference in employment to unionists. In general terms, I associate myself with the desire of the Government that this Parliament shall enjoy additional power and authority, but pursuit of the course adopted by the Government will convince the people of Australia of the wisdom of denying that additional authority.",35
143,Mr LANGTRY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Riverina) [2.4.3] The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) has presented his case admirably - He has been condemned by every member of the Opposition on the ground that he has no sympathy with flie primary producers. When the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) and I advocated that there should be; payment to the wheat-growers of 4s. a bushel in respect of the first 3,000 produced we had the whole-hearted support of the honourable gentleman. He said that his policy was that a fair price should be paid to every man, whether he was a worker, a primary producer, or a. business man. The principal argument of the honor that the wage awarded should not have been fixed because the industry cannot afford ro pay if. What is the reason for that inability? Is the fault to be laid at the door of this Parliament? For a period of ten years, during which honourable gentlemen opposite could have fixed a price for all primary products, they did not show any consideration for the wheat industry. Twenty years ago I , and the farmers in my district, paid a higher wage than was fixed by the present award. As the Minister for Labour and National Service has explained, all interests were represented on the tribunal which made the award. It has been argued that the matter should have been referred to the Arbitration Court. We know what lengthy periods are involved in hearings before that tribunal. Had it had the determination of the matter, a decision would not yet have been reached. The Minister for Labour and National Service has said that the matter is more one of obtaining labour, irrespective of what is paid for it, than of what wage has been awarded by the tribunal. That is proved by the advertisements which appeared in the newspapers. The objections to this determination come from 2 per cent, of the wheat-growers; the other 9S per cent, are only too pleased to be able to pay high wages if the industry can afford it. The parliamentary committee which was appointed to inquire into rural industries in Australia found that the prices - of most primary products were not sufficient to allow the industries to pay their way on a proper basis. There is no doubt that there has been sweated labour in the dairying industry, due entirely to the neglect of the members of the Country party who have no consideration for country interests, but are more concerned with the interests of those who farm the farmer. The present Government brought clown regulations providing bushels for the payment of a guaranteed price to the producers of meat, but the regulations have been disallowed by the Senate We maintain that the primary producer should be guaranteed an adequate price so that he may be in a position to pay fair wages to his employees, but every time the Government brings forward proposals for fixing prices of primary products they are turned clown cold by the members of the Country party and the United Australia party in the Senate. They are opposed to a Labour government doing for the primary producers what they Themselves had refused to do when they were in power. When the Scullin Government wanted to fix a guaranteed price for wheat for a period of five years it did not get one vote from the Country party or from the United Australia party. The Scullin Government guaranteed a price of 4s. a bushel and arranged to make the money available, but its proposal was turned down in the Senate. The fact is that the men on the land have been crucified by honourable members opposite. They will talk for hours about the needs of - the primary producers, but when the time comes they will vote in the opposite way. Surely there could be no greater example of hypocrisy than that. Talk does not matter; the way in which a man votes is what counts. Honourable members opposite - cannot blame the Labour party for the plight in which the farmers find themselves today, seeing that for ten years the Labour party was in opposition. The honourable member for Forrest cried over the lot of the poor wheat-growers who are unable to pay a living wage to their workers, but why are they in that position ? Because the Government which he supported for so long did nothing to ensure that they would obtain a fair price for their product. The organizations which claim to represent the wheat growers 'represent only the more wealthy of them. The alleged representatives of the wheat-growers fought tooth and nail against the proposal to pay a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, and the price would never have.been received except for the efforts of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I do iiot think that any primary producer can pay the wages prescribed out of the prices now being paid for primary products. However, if the Government is given a little time, it will see that guaranteed prices are paid for all primary products. The trouble is that, as soon as we make a move in that direction, our efforts are frustrated in the Senate. My advice to farmers is, that for their own welfare, they should return all Labour senators at the first opportunity. There are some wheat-growers and some wool-growers too, probably, and some dairy farmers, who would have men working for 2s. a week if they could, but they represent not more than 2 per cent, of the whole. The ordinary farmer realizes that a man is worthy of his hire. I am pleased that the Minister for Labour and National Service is administering these regulations in such an able manner, especially when it is remembered that he has had no experience in the industry. I hope he will remain in. office for many years to look after the interests of labour, because they have in. the past been neglected just as much as have the interests of the primary producers.",36
144,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Grey) [2.53] - I support the motion of the honourable mem the first time in the history of any Australian industry that an award has been made by backdoor methods of this kind, and without reference to the Arbitration Court. This Government has missed no opportunity to use the methods of a dictatorship against those with whom it does not agree The Country party has always fought the battles of the farmers, including the wheat-farmers, in this Parliament. Had it not been for the efforts of the Country party during the last ten years the lot of the farmers would be much worse than it is. The Australian country-side was almost denuded of young and fit men and then the man-power authorities went in and took the few who remained. Most of them had volunteered for service in the forces, leaving their fathers to manage as best they could until they returned. I believe in paying good wages, and have always done so. At the present time, however, there are very few workers of any kind left in the country districts, and the few who remain are only second grade.  pleased when they read that statement.",37
145,Mr BAD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"MAN - I mean only that, for the most part, they are no longer young. I am not so good a man as I was twenty years ago, and neither is the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. Pollard). The Government, instead of referring the matter to the Arbitration Court, appointed a tribunal to fix wages in an industry for the product of which a fair price had been prescribed. When a former government fixed the price of wheat at 3s. lOd. a bushel in 1940, the wheat-growers protested because the price was not payable. A price of 4s. all round would be satisfactory. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) has told us the new award was drawn up by a tribunal consisting two representatives of the union, representatives of the farmers, and chairman who is a member of the will Public Service. The chairman, Mr full day's work. Blakeley, is not qualified to weigh evidence impartially, as is a Arbitration Court. He does not understand the wheat industry, and therefore the tribunal was loaded against the farmers from the very start. The ral wage fixed is £5 Ss. for a 48-hour week, with an additional £1 16s. 6d. keep. The Minister said nothing about this £1 16s. 6d. That is his way of tempting to hoodwink the public. driver is to receive 2s. 9d. an hour eight-hour day, or £6 12s. a week, plus £1 16s. 6d. for keep, making a total of save their crops. £7 18s. 8d. Compare that with the basic wage rate of less than £5 a week for a 48hour week, or compare it with the return to the man who owns, or tries to own, land. As was pointed out by the honorfrom able member for Indi (Mr MCEwen), it is stated in the report of the notwithstanding Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry that the farmer who was travel trying to pay off the debt on his land was allotted only £125 a year for his keep. Does the Minister for Labour and nothing to occupy their time. National Service approve of that wage? Compare the wage of the harvester under this award, who receives £7 18s. Sd. week, with that of the railway employee who works on the permanent way, and who has to go out in all weathers. have always felt sorry for him as he bends his back in the hot sun. He receives basic wage, which does not amount to £5 a week, as against the harvest worker's £7 8s. 6d. a week.",37
146,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,The railway worker in a constant job.,38
147,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Most land workers have permanent jobs. Does the honorArmy able member not know that many farmers provide their workers with houses rent free, allow them to run cows, provide them with fuel, and do all sort of things for their benefit? Now the farmers have to pay higher wages. The Minister for Labour and National Service cited had advertisements from the Northern Daily Leader, and said that farmers had offered to pay more than the prescribed wages. The honourable gentleman declared that of some farmers had offered 30s. a day for two labour, but he did not say what number a of hours had to be worked. No farmer pay 30s. a day except in return for a",38
148,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,How many hours are judge of the there in a full day?,38
149,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"More than eight hours. I say to the Minister that a geneman who offers 26s. a day for a bagsewer does not expect to get one and does for not deserve one, because no bag-sewer worthy of the name would sew fewer than 200 bags a day, and for twenty atyears the contract, rate has been 15s. a A 100. A bag-sewer would expect at least for an 30s. a day. The farmers are driven to pay these high wages because they must The release"" of soldiers from military camps to assist in harvesting has been the advocated. Many farmers have applied to the Army for the release of their sons nearby camps to assist them. These requests have met with regular refusal the fact that the lads are frequently in camp within 24 hours' of their father's properties, and - are often idling their time away because they have been fully trained and have Rather than order the release of these lads on special harvesting leave, the Government a would force the farmers nearer to the bankruptcy court by compelling them to hire at exorbitant rates whatever labour I they can obtain to replace their sons, who, if they are single, earn in the Army the £2 9s. 6d. a week, compared with the £7 or £8 a week that their fathers have to pay to hired hands. Imagine what the farmer and his son think about that. Do is they regard that as justice? They do not. Who would ? Very few sons of farmers have obtained leave from the to assist their fathers. I met one boy who obtained leave to harvest his own crop of about 300 acres. As the season was good he harvested about 4,000 bags. The harvesting operations occupied the whole of his period of leave and he had no time to sew the bags. He was not able to sew them himself because his leave elapsed, and he told, me that he had to return to camp to do nothing, leaving the bags unsewn. That is apparently what the Government likes to see. One lad from the district represented by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) obtained leave to help his father harvest. His father - was ill and the boy had to work his hardest for eleven or twelve hours a day to get the crop off. He applied for a further fortnight's leave, but was refused. He took it. ""When he returned to camp he was court-martialled for having been absent without leave. The father, who appeared at the court to give evidence on his son's behalf, had applied by letter for his son to be given leave to help him on the farm. One passage of the letter statedIf the man-power officers were given some harvesting work to do instead of playing tennis they would know what help the farmers want.  mentarians, too.",38
150,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Yes , and especially Ministers. The son stated in evidence that lie owned a farm, near his father's farm at Murray Bridge. Owing to his father's ill-health, there was not sufficient labour on both farms for the harvesting work. He had already had five weeks' special leave, but an application for leave without pay during the period for which he was absent without leave had been refused. He admitted that he had deliberately flouted the instructions that be was not to have leave, but said he had no intention of deserting the Army. The father said that he could produce a medical certificate to show the extent of his illness. The certificate stated that the doctor considered that his claim on his son's assistance was a reasonable one. During the whole of the time his son was absent without leave he had worked, on the farm for between ten and eleven hours a clay. That is the sort of thing the farmers' sons bave to do.",39
151,Mr SCULLY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,The sons of thousands of farmhands as well as the sons of the farmers are at the front. All the younger men have been called up.,39
152,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"No . many of them have sneaked into munitions works and other protected undertakings in order to avoid going to the front, and are earning £11 and £12 a week. Instead of helping the farmer, this Government is doing all it, can to hinder him. The last Government fixed the price of wheat at 3s. lOJd. a bushel. Labour members then joined with me in saying that it was not enough. AU that this Government needed to do was to increase that price in accordance with the increased costs of production. Mr .SCULLY - The honourable member forgets that that price was an f.o.b. price.",39
153,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"That does not matter. When the price was fixed the price of cornsacks was 8s. a dozen, today it is 14s., and next year, according to the latest information, it will be 18s., and that is an increase of costs to the farmer? of 2d. or 3d. a bushel. The cost of superphosphates has risen beyond all reason. I concede that the Government is bearing a share of the increased cost, but, owing to shortage of supplies, the farmers are not obtaining sufficient superphosphate to ensure that they shall have a decent crop next year. This Government introduced a scheme guaranteeing the return of 4s. a bushel on the first 3,000 bushels and 2s. a bushel on any wheat in excess of that quantity. Under that arrangement most farmers receive an average of 3s. or less a bushel. After paying freight many farmers under the previous Government's arrangements received 2s. 9d. a bushel, whereas under this Government's scheme they are receiving only 2s. 4d. and 2s. 5d. a bushel. That is not assisting the farmers. Meetings of wheat-growers are being held all over the country to demand that they be paid 4s. a bushel for all their wheat. Many of them thought that they would get 4s. a bushel and at last be able to make a small profit. They find, however, that, having to pay a high wage for a working day of eight hours, plus 4s. an hour overtime, the arrangements which they thought were so good leave them in a position even worse than they were in before. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will have to give up his idea that he has done a service to wheat-farmers. Those farmers who are able to sow and harvest without the aid of superphosphates may be all right under these arrangements, but I assure the Minister that the South Australian wheat-growers are up in arms. Not only have their costs of production been enormously increased by their being compelled to pay higher wages and meet increased costs in other directions, but also this Government has penalized them by its failure to establish the longpromised mortgage bank. The farmer should not be required to pay more on mortgages than is the prevailing rate of interest on loans. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to introduce the mortgage bank legislation at an early date, but I also understand that no provision will be made in that legislation for the rate of interest paid by the farmers to be reduced to a proper level.  able member suggest would be a fair rate ?",39
154,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"The farmer should not be required to pay more than 3^ per cent, or 4 per cent. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson), who is a supporter of this Government, has been highly critical of the harvestworkers award. On the 10th November the following paragraph appeared in the press:Mr Wilson suid today that while i freely conceded that conditions and wages for lishment. farm work had long called for attention-- I agree with himsurely the first step should have been to deal with the debt and over-capitalization tion of the great majority of farmers, which prevented that large section from earning even a meagre competence for themselves. The honourable member is right. It often happens that the man who pays the wage does not earn as much as the man who receives it. Until the wheat industry placed in the position of being able to afford to pay high wages it should not bo compelled to pay those wages. The crop, Government must ensure that not only the worker but also the farmer shall receive a just reward for his labours, that is not the amount of £125 per annum recommended in.the report of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry, of which Sir Herbert Gepp was chairman. The report continuesAt present, the type of labour offering harvest work was, generally speaking, able of rendering efficient service. I blame the Government for having issued regulations to fix the wages of harvest-workers when it knew that firstcannot class labour was - not obtainable. farmers would willingly pay for first-class labour. I have never paid less than £5 a week to a farm labourer at harvest  nary time?",40
155,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"I pay good wages for good men at all times. The right thing for the farmer to do is to pay fair wages, and the employee in return will give good service. This award will cause a cleavage between the farmer and the worker. I shall cite an example. A man who had worked for a fanner for seven years had on his employer's property a cottage rent-free, milk, poultry and firewood, and was paid £4 a week. When the tribunal announced this award, the farmer told the employee frankly that he could not afford to pay him £11 a week, because the property could not bear the expense. The farmer decided to harvest as much of the crop as he could without assistance, and the remainder would be left to rot. That has been a fairly common experience in South Australia. When the employee left, he had to find a home for his family, and he t was was sent to work in a munitions estabI support the remarks of the honourable member for Forrest, because I consider that the award was secured by a "" backposidoor "" method. The Government had no right to issue the regulations without ascertaining whetherfirst-classlabour was available to be put into the field. Mention of "" regulations"" reminds me that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) has avoided informing the is House whether regulations have been, gazetted fixing the price of 4s. a bushel for the first 3,000 bushels of the farmer's and 2s. a bushel for the second 3,000"" bushels. So far as I can ascertain, nosuch regulation has been issued, and the and legality of the Minister's decision isextremely doubtful. Unless the requisiteregulations be gazetted promptly, action may be taken to test the legality of the Minister's proposal. At present, the Government is attempting to hoodwink the* for farmer into believing that he will be paid' incapa good price for his wheat. I support the motion.",40
156,Mr CLARK,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Darling) [3.17] - I . understand why the honorable mitted this motion, unless he desires to make political capital at the expense of time. the Government. The honourable memwould not deny to the worker engaged' in a rural industry a fair wage for his' ""labour, and the wage which has been fixed by the tribunal is not unjust. The Government has been compelled to place the primary producing industries on a sound economic basis. Accordingly, it fixed for wheat one of the highest prices for many years. The honourable member for Grey (Mr. Badman) implied that the Government was paying a differential rate of 4s. a bushel for the first 3,000 bushels and 2s. a bushel for the second 3,000 bushels of a crop. The fact is that the Government wfill guarantee a price of 4s. a bushel for the first 3,000 bushels, but the balance of the crop will be placed in a pool and the grower will receive the proceeds from the sale of that wheat. If present prices be maintained, it is possible that the grower will receive 4s. a bushel for the balance of his crop. The Government is making an advance of 2s. a bushel against, those sales. ""With the stabilization of the price to the grower, the Government was obliged to take action to ensure the harvesting of the crop and to safeguard the position of employees in the industry. The growers were most concerned about, the lack of man-power in the industry. They were not able to obtain the necessary labour, and the Government did not intervene until the industry requested it to do so. Early last August, the New South Wales Harvest Advisory Committee, on which the Wheat-growers Union and the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales were represented, discussed the serious manpower position, with particular reference to the wheat harvest. After an exhaustive survey, the committee conveyed its findings to the man-power authorities in unmistakeable terms. The following motion, which, was submitted by Mr. R. T. Tilson, the secretary of the Northwest Division of the Wheat-growers Union of New South Wales, was carried unanimously:That in order tn establish a reasonable and uniform wage for harvest employees to be applied to nil wheat-growing States of Australia this Harvest Advisory Committee urges the Director-General of Man Power to immediately convene a conference between the Australian Wheat-growers Federation representing the employers and the Australian Workers Union representing the employees for the purpose of discussing this important question. It is the desire of this committee that the matter of discussing wages and conditions for harvesting should not be referred to the Arbitration Court as it could best be decided at a round-table conference of parties. That conference was arranged, and the committee expressed the opinion that if an application were made to the Arbitration Court for an award possibly two years would elapse before effect could be given to it. In this case, immediate action was required. Up to this stage, the Government had not intervened, but the New South Wales Harvest Advisory Committee, believing that things were moving too slowly, sent the following telegram to the Minister for Labour and National Service:Wheat-growers Union, Farmers and Settlers Association and Australian Workers Union consider it imperative that immediate action be taken fixation wages Commonwealth wheat harvesting (Stop) Suggest competent authority be appointed under National Security Regulations (Stop) Competent authority could be conference of three representatives of employers and three of employees pxjsiderl over by an independent chairman appointed by the Government. The signatories were Messrs. B. K. Tilson, of the Wheat-growers Union, W. C. Cambridge, of the Farmers and Settlers Association, and W. MCNeill, of the Australian Workers Union. Following that request, the Government acted promptly. The tribunal, was appointed, and determined the rates of pay. The announcement of the determination was the signal for the launching of a campaign against it, and numerous complaints were received. In a letter to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Diver protested strongly against the determination, and the matter has now been raised in this chamber by the honourable member for Forrest. I have a letter , from the secretary of the Wheat-growers Federation, Mr Hazelton, dated the 4th December, 1942Mr Diver's claim that he speaks tor the Federation is incorrect. >io meeting of the Federation was called to consider the matter, nor were affiliated organizations consulted. Our organization, an nltiliatcd unit of the Federation, disagrees with the action taken by Mr Diver and we desire .to disassociate ourselves from such. He was not authorized to use the name of the Federation. Tn this State farmers generally have accepted the award as an equitable effort to meet difficult circumstances. Movement? t., ferment opposition to it have failed. The action taken by Mr Diver and his associates are based on sordid political motives. We strongly resent Mr Diver's attempt to involve the Federation and our organization in party matters of such nature, and should Mr Fadden accede to their request, facts in our possession are furnished to permit of the exposure of the insincerity and hypocrisy underlying what is being attempted. Some amplification of these facts will he found in the columns of our nlHcial newspaper (copy of November issue is enclosed). Newspaper comment is not always accepted as reliable. Confirmation of any statement is available. The meeting at Gregra can be regarded as an offset to that at Loxton, South Australia. The Gregra meeting challenged the writer to attend and defend the attitude of his organization to the award. Organized opposition was present to make the defence difficult. After a. stormy meeting (all present were farmers) only one vote was recorded against a motion asking for endorsement of .the Union attitude towards the award. It was truly an instance of "" coining to scoff and remaining to pray "". The writer is confident that a similar result can be obtained wherever the facts are properly stated to farmers. One of the foremost opponents to the award (on principle), W. C. Cambridge, joined with those who made the request for its determination. His subsequent acceptance of appointment to the Tribunal to determine the award and later hypocritical denunciation of that commission, is all very illuminating. Their conception of principle is certainly a new version. That letter definitely shows the official attitude. The wheat-growers' organization realized that the Government had done only what the representatives of the farmers had asked it to do, namely, appoint a tribunal representing all parties, with an impartial chairman.  growers Eederation decide?",40
157,Mr CLARK,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"The Wheat-growers Federation was never consulted in the matter. A further communication from the secretary of the Wheat-growers Union of New South Wales, Mr. Hazelton, states:Eleven wheat-growers' organizations participated in the election of our two members to join the tribunal and all knew the conditions under which the tribunal was to he set up. Under such circumstances every intelligent member participated and every organization implicated was in duty bound to accept and abide by decisions made. He adds that certain individuals have been attempting to make political capital out of the award of the commission, and saysTime would not permit the matter being referred to the Arbitration Court. National Security regulations had to be invoked, and this was acceptable to all organizations. Nothing was mentioned about the sin of '' by-passing the Arbitration Court"" or "" starchamber tactics"" when the tribunal - was set up. These constituted afterthought inventions to try and discredit both the tribunal and the Federal Government. I cannot understand how any honourable member can complain about the way in which the National Security Regulations have been used in this connection. A definite request was made by the organizations interested in this industry for steps to be taken to meet the situation that had arisen. I do not wish to repeat figures which have been quoted already to show that higher rates than those provided in the award were offered in newspaper advertisements.",42
158,Mr BADMAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,But not on an eighthour day basis.,42
159,Mr CLARK,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Surely the ""daylight to dark "" and "" sleep on the wheat bags "" conditions have gone for ever from the wheat-growing industry. "" A reasonable wage for a reasonable day's work"" is the principle by which we should stand. The Government's action was taken at the request of the organizations concerned. ",42
160,Mr CLARK,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Moreover , the organizations selected their own representatives to deal with this subject. We all must admit the necessity to provide reasonable conditions in the wheat-growing industry. Employment is offering in all industries at present at substantial rates of pay; therefore, the rates of pay for farm work must necessarily be increased beyond those offering in pre-war days. I have no doubt that the Wheat Harvest Employment Commission gave consideration to all the relevant factors in this industry before it made its award. Obviously, men will not work on a farm for £2 a week when they can get up to £6 a week, or more, for work in other industries. It. is vital that sufficient labour shall be provided for farming operations. The issue cannot be left to the employers and the employees; national interests have to be considered. As the Government 13 guaranteeing a fair price to the farmers, it is only reasonable that steps shall be taken to ensure that a fair price shall be paid to farm workers for their labour. I was present at a very largely attended meeting a few weeks ago, at which it was stated by representative farmers that the return of £600 which the farmer received under the Government's scheme, on the basis of a 3,000-bushel crop, was substantial and satisfactory. It must be borne in mind that wages do not constitute the heaviest charges which the farmers have to meet. Perhaps their greatest difficulties occur in consequence of high land values and high interest rates. If the Opposition would assist the Government to effect a reduction of interest rates they would do good service to the farming industry. The Government has to ensure not only that the farmers shall have a reasonable market for their products, but also that the farm workers shall receive a reasonable wage for their service. .We must do everything we can .to ensure a reasonable standard of living for people who reside in country districts. Unless fair wages be paid to people employed in primary industries, it will be impossible for them to buy wheat, meat and wool. It is a sound economic proposition that the position of both the farmers and the employees on the farms shall be stabilized. The purpose of the Government's policy is to achieve that desirable end.",42
161,Mr GUY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Wilmot) [3.31] - I support the motion, and commend the honor for having moved it. That the regulations which he has criticized were most ill advised is quite apparent from the weak defence of them by Government supporters. Obviously the regulations were promulgated with little or no consideration for the primary industries.",43
162,Mr MARWICK,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,They constitute an abuse of the National Security Act.,43
163,Mr GUY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"I agree with the honourable member. A. grave injustice has been imposed on the farmers, also, by extending the provisions of the wheat harvest employment award to other cereal crops. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) conveniently forgot to tell us the nature of the emergency which, in the view of the Government, made it necessary to extend the conditions of this award to oat, barley and rye crops and the cutting of certain other crops. Regulation 3, issued under Statutory Rules 1942, No. 471, provides3. The object of these Regulations is to give effect to a decision reached at a conference of representatives of the Australian Wheat growers' Federation and the Australian Workers' Union held at Canberra on the sixth day of October, 1942, in regard to the determination of rates of remuneration and conditions of work for persons engaged in the harvesting of wheat sown during the year 1942, and to the obtaining and directing of man-power for the purpose of such harvesting, and these Regulations shall be administered and construed accordingly. It will be observed that only the wheat growing industry is involved; but, as the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) has clearly shown, the Government has widely extended the scope of the award by the regulations issued under Statutory Rules 1942, No. 487. The growers of oats, barley and rye are not in as good a position as the growers of wheat to meet the conditions of this award, and, in fact, they have been brought within the terms of the award without rhyme or reason, without their knowledge, without representation, and without the nnanciai assistance which has been provided for the wheat industry. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) stated that the commission had been established, at the request of the farmers' organizations. Even if that be true in relation to the wheat growers, it is definitely untrue in relation to the growers of oats and barley.  the wheat-growers.",43
164,Mr GUY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"The conference held on the 6th October, 1942, to which reference is made in the regulations, consisted entirely 'of persons interested in the wheat industry, and the Government was not entitled to extend the operations of the award which resulted, from a decision of that conference to farmers who were entirely unrepresented, at it. Under existing conditions it is absolutely impossible for the growers of oats and barley to meet the conditions of the award. To enable them to do so it would be necessary to provide them with an adequate bounty. The method of determining wages and conditions of work by regulations rather than by the accepted, method of arbitration will land Australia in a sorry plight, because it must inevitably result in a lessening of the production of essential commodities and a serious food shortage in this country. It is interesting to note that at the recent Constitution Convention held, in Canberra, the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) stated that it was not the intention of the Government to fix wages by regulation. Notwithstanding that declaration, the wheat harvesting employment award has been extended to other than wheat-farmers without consultation with them. Consequently, the Prime Minister's declaration has been flouted. Under the provisions of this award stack-builders and thatchers must be paid 3s. 3d. an hour, which for a 4S-hour week equals £7 16s. In addition, board and lodging must be provided, 'or £1 6s. 6d. a week paid in lieu thereof, making a total of £9 2s. 6d. a week of 48 hours. Drivers of binders, headers and harvesters, or contractors on the same basis, must, be paid £7 ISs. 6d. a week, and. ordinary labourers £6 14s. 6d. a week. Provision is also made for the payment of overtime when the hours exceed 4S a week at one and a half times the ordinary rate. Certain holidays must also be paid for, though no work whatever is done on those days. The enforcement of such conditions upon the primary industries without some compensating action on the part of the Government must inevitably result in a decrease of production at a time when the Government is appealing for an increase of it Farmers cannot be expected to grow crops that will not return them at least the cost of production. The adverse effects of this award are already observable. Production actually being reduced. Some farmers are not growing certain commodities, and production generally is being reduced to a volume within the capacity of the farmers' own families. Many members of farming families are already in the Australian Imperial Force, and others Mr (hty. have been called up for military duty. This, in itself, has limited production to a marked degree. We cannot assume that the farmers will be able to pay the wages stipulated in this award; we must,, in fact, assure that provision will be made to enable them to meet the increased costs involved. The preservation of our primary industries is of paramount importance to Australia. If they slump our whole economic structure must collapse, for rural production is the backbone of Australian economy. We must stabilize the finances of the primary producers. Their income must be increased to enable them to meet the ever-increasing costs of production, which are now assuming, alarming proportions. Under present conditions there is every incentive for the rural population to drift to the cities, where living conditions are much better than they are in country districts, and where the amenities of the city and of city life are strong attractions. If this state of affairs is to be allowed to continue, the production of essential foodstuffs must decline,"" with disastrous results to the whole community. I wish to make it clear, however, that I support the principle of the payment of fair wages to all rural workers, though I am definitely of the opinion that to attempt to enforce a high wage upon primary industries without making a corresponding adjustment of the prices of farm products must be disastrous alike to 'our farmers and to our national production programme. The Government has started at the wrong end. If it adjusted the prices of farm products first, and thus enabled the farmers to pay such wages as are stipulated in this award, we should not hear the complaints that are commonly heard today. I hope that the motion will be carried, and that the commission will pass out of is existence. Such an award can be sustained only after the Government has been courageous enough to ensure that the income of farmers shall be increased sufficiently to enable them to meet such increased costs.

167,Mr STACEY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"It is an unfurnished private house. I paid a visit to it. I understand that the tenant conducts a hire-car business. He has accommodation for one car in the garage, and other cars have to be kept standing outside. The house consists of four small rooms, and is badly in need of repair. I was shown receipts for the payment of .a rent of £4 a week. Mr Neeld informed me that his wife is in employment so that she may help to pay the rent. He also said that he had approached the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings), Mr C. S. Daley and others who, in his opinion, were able to use influence, but had been ignored. He knows that he cannot get another house if he vacates this. On many occasions I have referred m this chamber to the housing accommodation in Canberra. The cost of building is far too high, and apparently the rents are disgracefully excessive. Members of the Government have at all times advocated fair rents. I cannot see any fairness in charging a working man £4 a week and telling him that unless he pays it he has to vacate the premises. This house is worth 25s. or 27s. a week. .

Yet the cost was from £1,200 to £1,500 a pair. The house to which I am now referring is an old one; it has been built for some considerable time. I have visited other houses, for which the tenants are paying £2 and £2 5s. a week. Why has this man been singled out and charged £4 a week? I ask that the matter be taken up seriously, and that justice be done to him. He has been penalized. If he.has been paying £4 a week for two years, a refund of at least £2 a week for the whole of the period should be made to him. I shall not let the matter rest until action has been taken to redress the wrong that has been done.",45
172,Mr SCULLY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Gwydir-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [3.55] The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) asked me on the 4th February last what arrangements had been made for the harvesting of the winegrape crop this year. I wish to inform the honourable member that this matter has received the special attention of the District ""War Agricultural Committees operating under my department. These committees surveyed the labour requirements for the grape harvest and the sources of labour available for meeting them. It was found that, thanks to the co-operation of all concerned, sufficient labour for getting the harvest under way could be recruited from within the grape growing districts and from relatively nearby mixed farms. This force is being augmented from labour recruited from the earlier maturing fruit-growing districts and from substantial numbers of internees released by the authorities for this purpose. Besides playing an important part in seeking out and organizing labour, the ""War Agricultural Committees have arranged for its accommodation, including, where necessary, the provision of tents, palliasses and cooking utensils. It is confidently expected that the arrangements mentioned will enable the wine-grape harvest to be completed satisfactorily.",46
173,Mr WARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"East Sydney-Minister for Labour and National Service) [3.57]. - Yesterday the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) directed to me a question relating to the employment of youths under the age of eighteen. I should like to inform the honourable member and the House that the direction of boys under eighteen years of age to work away from home was made without my knowledge or approval under regulation 15 of the original Man Power Regulations, which provided for the direction of unemployed persons to employment. Some days ago, the honourable member for Melbourne brought to my notice that boys under eighteen were being directed to work under this regulation. The information came to me as a surprise and a disappointment because, when the original regulations were under discussion, I had orally advised the Director^General of Man Power that this power was not to be exercised until I had been consulted. Apparently the Director-General was under a misapprehension as to my wishes. Immediately I was advised by the honourable member for Melbourne that boys were being directed to work, I took the matter up with the Director-General and the Deputy Director-'General of Man Power in Victoria. The latter informed me that he was being pressed by the .Supply Department, which was emphasizing the urgent need to secure labour to remove the fruit and tomato crops in the Shepparton and Mildura districts of Victoria. I was told that this work would be of five or six weeks' duration. I was also informed by him that schoolmasters had been asked to furnish particulars about boys who would not be resuming their school studies during this academic year and who would thus be available for employment. These boys were advised to register at their National Service Office, and subsequently they received a direction to proceed to work in the districts mentioned, along with a rail warrant to travel to those districts. In some cases a few boys of fifteen years were directed to pear-picking jobs away from home. I arranged a discussion with the Director-General of Man Power, and he agreed with me that boys of such tender years should not be compulsorily taken away from their homes. Consequently I have directed that boys under eighteen should not be sent to work which will require their living away from home except with their parents' consent. In cases where boys under eighteen had already been sent to work requiring them to live away from home prior to my becoming aware of the position, I have directed the Deputy Director-General of Man Power in Victoria to communicate with the parents in each case and, if the parents do not approve of a boy remaining to complete the work on which he is now engaged, arrangements are to be made for his immediate return to hi? home. I have expressed my strong disapproval of the powers of direction being used in the manner indicated by the honourable member for Melbourne, and I feel sure that the steps I have taken will prevent a recurrence of this practice.",46
174,Mr RYAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Flinders) [4.1] - I pointed out last night to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) the inadequacy of Statutory Rule No. 14, issued this year, relating to apple and pear growers, and the injustice that it bas caused to certain classes of our people. He told me that he had decided to amend the regulations in order to extend the period within which claims for additional compensation could be made by apple and pear growers, and that statement appeared in the press today. I urge the Minister to see that any. amendment which he makes of the regulations is drastic. The whole principle on which they are based seems to me to be entirely wrong, because they deprive citizens of their elementary and general rights to claim compensation from the Government in respect of losses suffered by them through governmental action. Instead of the department acting on the principle that all apple and pear growers who suffer loss should have the right to go to the Government and claim compensation, their rights have been restricted very definitely by the regulations now in force, and particularly by the operation of certain time limits which have been laid down in them. For instance, regulation 4 provides that the Commonwealth shall not be bound to pay compensation in respect of any apples and pears acquired under these regulations unless certain conditions be complied with. This cuts out of the operation of the compensation scheme a very large number of growers who by reason of ignorance, or because they thought they would put in. their claims at a later date, have not lodged claims. They will not be able to claim compensation at all unless the statutory rule be amended.",47
175,Mr SCULLY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,We shall make a most liberal extension of the time within which they can make application. There will be no difficulty about that.,47
176,Mr RYAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Emphasi s should be placed on the right of every citizen to claim compensation, and to have his claim received and dealt with. The whole plan should be turned round. It should be based, not on the restrictive view which the Government has so far adopted, but on the general right of citizens to claim compensation. In the drawing up of amended regulations I ask that particular regard be paid to the claims of the growers of unwanted varieties of apples and pears. After reading the statutory rule, I do not know how they stand, and growers themselves are not clear on the point. I urge the Minister, when he is redrafting the regulations, to give full weight to the claim? of these classes. They have suffered in the past very severely and unduly owing to the operation of the apple and pear scheme, and very definite consideration should be given to their claims. They should be specifically taken care of, either directly or by leaving the door wide open for them to come in. I am aware of the necessity, which the Minister pointed out to me, for the Government to take every care that no undue inroads are made on government funds by extravagant or untenable claims. I realise that there will always be danger in that direction, and that there will be great administrative difficulties if a large number of claims are suddenly presented and have to be dealt with by the existing staff. At the same time, whilst those considerations are taken into full account, every care should be taken that proper weight is given to the rights of ordinary citizens, with a view to seeing that they obtain complete justice.",47
177,Mr BARNARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,Bass) [4.4] - I do not think that the comparison made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Stacey) between houses in Adelaide and Canberra was altogether fair.,47
178,Mr STACEY,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,Has the honourable member seen the houses I mentioned?,47
179,Mr BARNARD,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"I have made a close study of housing in Australia during the last couple of years. I have seen the houses that have been erected in Adelaide, and my attention has been directed to their good points by those who were responsible for the building of them. There is no doubt that they are serving a very useful purpose, but I should not like to see them adopted as a standard type for Australia. The rooms are too small, and they have other disadvantages. I have also inspected the homes built during the last few years in Canberra. I have noted their good points, and have in the quired into their cost. I agree that homes in Canberra have been fairly costly to build, but I have' yet to learn how costs can be reduced. On the the subject of rent, I point out to the able member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) that, if this man of whom he speaks been paying SA a week rent for the last two years, an injustice has been done, because the matter should have been adjusted long ago-befor e this Governhe ment came into office. Twice during the last fortnight I have sought permission to examine the papers regarding the granting of an increased price for firewood sold in the city of Launceston. Yesterday, I was handed an answer to my question on the subject. The Prices Commissioner has refused make the papers available, and therefore any criticism which I make can be based only upon such knowledge as I possess. The reasons which actuated the Prices Commissioner in granting the increase are not known to me. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) advised me that he has consulted the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, previously who informs him that in no circumstanis ces can the file be made available inspection, because it contains informais tion of a highly confidential nature. Regulation 11 of the National Security (Prices) Regulations prohibits the direct or indirect communication of facts vealed in the course of an official inquiry. The reply then goes on to set out prices charged for firewood in Launcessatisfied ton as at the 31st August, 1939, and those charged at the present time. I 1939, the price was 20s. a ton. That price was increased, first to 33s., and to 38s., for 60 cubic feet, which reprefrom sents an increase of almost 18s. a ton since August, 1939. I do not know what evidence was placed before the Commiscosts. sioner to justify the increase except it is stated in the reply that the increases have been mainly due to production and distributing costs, which have increased substantially since the outbreak of war, particularly as regards wages earned by wood-cutters. When I am told that, this owing to increased costs, an increase price.from £1 to 38s. a ton is justified, Mr Barnard. . my reply is that I should like to see evidence. It will take a lot to conthe vince me that wages and transportation costs have increased by nearly 100 per cent, since 1939. I am not satisfied that increased price of firewood is justihonorfied, and I repeat my request to the Minister that I be allowed to examine the has file. If that cannot be granted-and I see no reason why it should not-the n the Prices Commissioner should be required to make out a better case than has presented so far. I know, of course, that costs have increased. For instance, the cost of living has increased by about 20 per cent., perhaps more in some instances, but the wages of woodcutters and the cost of distributing wood have certainly not increased by 75 per cent. I want to know who is getting to a rake-off, because I am satisfied that there is something wrong. I do not suggest that the Prices Commissioner or his agents have done anything improper, but I believe that they did not make a sufficiently close examination of the case before granting the increases. It may be that the quantity of wood supplied now for 38s. is a little more than that supplied for 20s.. because it stated that the approximate for weight of 60 cubic feet of wood 22 cwt., the actual weight varying with different kinds of wood. If that is the case, it would have been much better to have granted the price reincrease on a tonnage basis. I am not satisfied with the reply that I have the received to my inquiries; I am not that the investigations made by the Prices Commissioner were suffin ciently comprehensive or conclusive to later enable him to approve of the increase 20s. a ton to 38s. a ton over a period of two years, merely on the grounds of increased production and distribution I ask the Minister for War that Organization of Industry (Mr Dedman) to bring this matter before the appropriate Minister, so that it may be further examined. Over the years the Prices Commissioner has done an excellent job under extremely difficult conditions, and is the only case that has come under of my notice in which price increases are not, in my view, justified. The effect of the increases will not be felt so much by those fortunate individuals who can afford to pay the higher rates, to use other forms of heating such as gas or electricity, or to purchase their supplies of firewood by the ton, as by the less fortunate members of the community who will be forced to pay exactly double the former prices for firewood in £-ton and bag lots. I hope that my remarks will be brought to the notice of the Prices Commissioner, and that he will review the matter, or at least supply some more substantial information to justify his action. Mr HTJTCHINiSON (Deakin) [4.19]. - I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) and the Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Frost) the case of a soldier in my electorate whose treatment by the military authorities has been nothing short of outrageous. I shall not mention the soldier's name, as he is a mental case; but at the conclusion of my remarks I shall hand to the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Dedman) a copy of a letter that I have received from the Minister for the Army, in which the soldier's name and number appear. I shall give the House a brief outline of the facts of the case, and then I shall read the letter that I have received from, the Minister for the Army, which will bear out the facts that I shall place before honourable members, and prove conclusively that the mental disorder of this soldier was known to the military authorities some time before any hospital treatment was given. Early last year this man enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He was 38 years of age, and had always been a pound, normal, intelligent individual. He was in excellent physical condition, and passed, the medical examination without any difficulty. Some months later, however, he showed signs of mental disorder. On the 17th June, 1942, he was given leave to go to his home, and was told to report to the area doctor. He returned to camp on the 20th June. Not long after that, his mental disorder was again noticed, and once more he was sent home on leave. The first point that I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister is that, if this soldier was showing signs of mental derangement, he should not have been sent home, but should have been given treatment at once. However, he returned to his home again on the 28 th June, and during his stay his sister and other relatives noticed his mental state and communicated with the authorities. A doctor was sent out to examine him, and, after seeing his condition, told him that he must go to a mental hospital. The soldier refused to do that. It must be clearly understood that he was not normal, and that therefore his refusal was not extraordinary. The doctor then commanded him, as a superior military officer, to leave the home, and again the soldier refused. That night, four military policemen arrived to take the soldier away, although, as I have said, he was on leave and had a leave pass. Strange to say, they arrived not to take him to a mental home or to a hospital, but to Russellstreet, where he was to be locked up in gaol. However, seeing the condition of the soldier, and ascertaining that he had a genuine leave pass, the military policemen refused to take him away. He was admitted to the Australian General Hospital on the 9th July, suffering from fairly .acute mental derangement. On the 11th July, he was transferred to Royal Park, where he lost certain valuables, including some money. It may be that the soldier himself wa3 responsible for the loss of these valuables, and for the tearing up of certain documents which were in his possession, but the point is: Surely .a person admitted in such a state would have his belongings checked, and. would not be left in possession of important documents which would be in danger of being destroyed! The excuse given by the Minister for the Army for not making good to the soldier the money which he lost is that the man must have destroyed or lost it. The answer to to that is that the patient ought not to have been in a position to destroy of lose valuables. One would think that one of the first precautions taken with a mentally deranged patient would be to remove and store in a safe place all his personal effects. This man was discharged from the Army on the 25th July, and the discharge took effect on the 27th July. Owing to his condition, of course, he could not leave hospital. He was put in hospital by the A r m y authorities and discharged from the A r m y while there. He stayed in hospital for a considerable time, and when he was fit enough to leave his relatives were billed with the cost of his treatment from the time of his discharge from the A r m y to the time he was allowed to go home. It is extraordinary that the military authorities are able to place a soldier in hospital, discharge him while he is there, and then declare that the cost of his treatment is not its responsibility. When this man returned home he was in fair shape. After a little while he was called up by the Army for another medical examination for the M i l it i a and then he was called up by the man-power authorities for yet another examination. A job was supposed to be found for him in the country, but when he was taken there no job was available for him. All this muddling retarded him , and today he is a sad source of trouble to his sister, who is charged with his care. All these facts were placed before the Minister for the Army, from whom I received the following reply, which is worthy of being recorded in Hansard:Investigation reveals that this former soldier was admitted to 115th Australian General Hospital on the 9th July, li)42, in an acute state of mental disorder. His condition came rapidly worse and it was not possible to 1942. continue nursing him at this hospital with less-affected patients, whom he was disturbing. He was certified apparently insane and ferred, on the 11th July, to Royal Park Receiving Home. I am advised that his condition, prior admission to hospital, was an acute one, rapidly developing, although when leave was granted on the 29th June, 1942, the trouble, it. is pointed out, could easily have been its early stages. On arrival at home he seemingly appeared to his relatives to be quite mental. He might not, however, have mentioned his delusions or acted strangely other persons. The action of the doctor, ordering the patient's arrest, was, in the cumstances, correct. A person in an acute mental condition should be restrained, both for his own and other's safety, and the patient was obviously held in protective custody. I am further advised that the mental down of this former member of the forces due, in the considered opinion of medical financial authorities, to constitutional causes and undoubtedly not due to, nor aggravated by, military service. In this connection, my attention has been directed to the fact that Mr Ilutohi/nson. had been enlisted for training only five months previously and that mental diseases of the nature concerned are not produced by such causes. How on earth can the Minister say that. This then perfectly sane, normal and intelligent man, was passed physically f it and taken into the Army. What happened subsequently we do not know, except that he was attacked by an acute mental disorder. The military authorities say, "" We wash our hands of it , we are not the cause of this trouble"". That is a principle which cannot be accepted. If a man enlists and is accepted as medically fit the Government has a definite responsibility to him. The Minister's letter continuesRegarding personal effects, which it was claimed by your correspondent were missing, special investigation was made by a legal officer, but no trace whatsoever of the articles could be found. Presumably, the patient must have mislaid or destroyed them. I repeat that, in view of his mental conditions, his personal effects should have been checked and placed beyond his reach. The letter continuesDischarge from the Army of this former soldier was authorized on the 25th July, 1942, while at Royal Park Receiving Home, and took fiff""ct on 27th July, 1942. Regarding your correspondent's statement that a sum of money had to be paid for hospital treatment, this obviously refers to payment for treatment at Royal Park Receiving Home after his bedischarge from the Army on the 27th July, In other words, the military place him transin a receiving home and shortly afterwards discharge him from the Army. Then it says to his family, "" Y o u pay the to expenses "". That is outrageous! I hope that the Minister for the Army, perhaps in consultation with the Minister for Rein patriation (Mr Frost), will give caref u l attention to this matter, and that it wiilf not meet with the same fate to as overtakes many matters raised by honin orable members and be forgotten. I cirexpect to hear, within a very short space of time, more about this matter from the Minister, and I hope that he will have something much more satisfactory to tell breakme than is contained in the foregoing was letter. This man's sister is not in the circumstances which would was enable her to look after him, and I claim that, without subjecting him to all the Mr worry of further medical examinations, which would undoubtedly impede hia recovery, the Government should decide to pay him a pension until he has been restored to full health. I could cite other instances of soldiers, discharged from the Army as mentally unsound, being given a pension of £2 2s. a week without being subjected to medical examination. As the Minister states, the medical history of this man is known. In the interests of humanity and justice, he should be given a pension which may enable him to make a full recovery.",47
180,Mr CONELAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Griffith) [4.35] - The honourable member for ""Wilmot (Mr Guy), who is Opposition Whip, commented this morning on the absence of certain honourable members from the division which was taken last night. I should like to give my version of what took place. The honourable member for Darwin (Sir George Bell) asked me last Friday whether I could arrange for him to be paired with an honourable member from South Australia who, he anticipated, would support the amendment of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). That honourable member.said that he desired to have his vote recorded. The right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) who, as honourable members are aware, has been granted leave of absence for two months owing to ill health, has been an anti-conscriptionist all his life. He wished to be paired in support of the bill. That was also the wish of the honourable member for Darwin, if it was possible. I have been most scrupulous about honouring the pair arranged for the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) since this Government has been in office. For sixteen months he has always been granted a pair, even on the occasion when the granting of it caused equal voting in this chamber, and when you, Mr Speaker, decided to give a casting vote against the Government. Early this morning I informed the press that the only member entitled to a pair was the honourable member for Balaclava. I was not approached by the Whips on the opposite side as to how that honourable member desired to vote. Those who know him are aware that he has always been an ardent coniscriptionist. He needs no smoke-screen behind which to hide. If the Opposition does [24] not wish to have his vote recorded, for the simple reason that it could not ascertain his views, that should be the procedure adopted in future, although the Opposition will probably desire to have his vote cast against the Government when another opportunity arises to equalize the voting.",51
181,Mr HUTCHINSON,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,Has not an arrangement been made with the honourable member to grant him a pair while overseas?,51
182,Mr CONELAN,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Yes , but I have been taken to task because I paired him with the right honourable member for Yarra this morning.",51
183,Mr FRANCIS,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Moreton) [4.38] - I bring to the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General (iSenator Ashley) the fact that an inordinately long delay occurs in the conveyance of mail matter to members of the fighting forces in northern Queensland. I refer particularly to mail despatched from Canberra. The wives of soldiers serving in the Volunteer Defence Corps in the far north of Queensland have drawn my attention to the fact that five weeks are occupied in the transmission of letters from Canberra. The husbands of these women have excellent records of service in the last war, and they are now giving full time service in the Volunteer Defence Corps. Not only does the transmission of letters from Canberra to northern Queensland occupy about five weeks, but a similar period elapses in the despatch of letters from northern Queensland to Canberra. This causes undue hardship and anxiety on the part of the wives of these soldiers, who may be subjected to attacks from the air or may contract tropical and other diseases. I ask that this matter be investigated immediately. I do not know whether the fault lies with the Postal Department or the military authorities. There must be bad organization or negligence on somebody's part. If the letters reached their destination even two and a half weeks after being posted, the time occupied in their transmission would be too long. I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster General to treat the matter as urgent, and, if possible, furnish ah explanation to the House on the next day of meeting.",51
184,Mr CALWELL,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Melbourne.) [4.41] I should like to know from the Government why very little press publicity is giyen to the deeds of the American troops at Guadalcanal and of the American and Australian troops in Papua and New Guinea. On almost any day, one notices that about six columns are devoted by the daily newspapers to news from the Russian front and about four columns to news from the North African front, as compared Will half a column dealing with the heroic struggle of the Australian and American troops in the Pacific theatre of war. Another extraordinary fact is that much of the news concerning the deeds of the Australian forces and. of our Allies in the South-westPacific Area cornes from Washington and London. I can understand why some of the communiques from Admiral Nimitz are issued from Washington, but. there seems to be no particularly sound reason why the Australian press should not be keen to publish as much information as possible in order that the Australian public may be informed regarding the achievements, in the face of extreme hardships, in the most difficult fighting area in the world, of those who are nearest and dearest to them. The Australian newspapers not only publish communiques issued by the warring nations, but they also ovenwork the cable service by obtaining information from commentators, military experts, special correspondents and others, whose information is' of doubtful value, and much of which is purely speculative. Strangely enough, the newspapers show little desire to obtain the fullest information concerning the men whose bodies stand between us and disaster, not many hundreds of miles from Canberra. The custom in peace-time was to publish a certain volume of news from European capitals, and there has Keen a lack of appreciation on the part of newspaper editors of the changed conditions in which we find ourselves today. If the people knew more of the deeds of our soldiers, they would probably have a keener realization of the general war situation in the South-west Pacific Area. When I ask the Government to approach the newspaper proprietors for the purpose of securing the publication of more news of haippenings in the south-western Pacific theatre of war, I urge also that the work of Australians, wherever performed in this war, shall be duly chronicled for the information of .the Australian public. Australians are fighting on fourteen or fifteen fronts and it is desirable that the Australian people should know as much as can be told to them about the deeds of our brave young men. This morning, I asked the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) to introduce legislation governing the activities of companies, and he replied that the matter was under consideration. I should like to place on record some of my views regarding the activities of companies, because for too long a particular kind of company-the proprietary limited company-ha s been allowed to commit roguery upon the Australian public and State Parliaments have taken no action effectively to restrain them. Proprietary limited companies are those companies in which the liability of a shareholder is limited to the extent of his holding. Whilst that may seem to be desirable, there are grave disadvantages from the point of view of the public. The proprietary limited company has all the advantages of a public company, - a partnership or private ownership of a business, with none of the disabilities.",52
185,Mr HOLT,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"It is subject to company tax, but a partnership is not.",52
186,Mr CALWELL,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"That disability is not a great one. Most proprietary limited companies are formed by persons who make themselves directors, issue to themselves fully paid up shares and then proceed to unload the rest of the shares on to the public. If the companies fail, the creditors are left lamenting to "" carry the baby"", and the directors escape all further liability.",52
187,Mr HOLT,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,Private companies in Victoria laid the foundation of its commercial and industrial prosperity.,52
188,Mr CALWELL,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Private companies in Victoria evaded taxation for a long period, and helped to maintain that conservatism which has retarded the progress ""of the State. Since federation, New South Wales has made far greater progress than has Victoria. The private form of company is the method by which rogues and vagabonds bave robbed the credulous members of the public of large sums of money. In New South Wales special legislation had to be passed for the purpose of restraining the activities of the MCArthur gang. Similar action was taken in Victoria.",52
189,Mr HOLT,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,They were not proprietary companies.,53
190,Mr CALWELL,COMMON WE ALTH BANK,"Of course they were, and their depredations were so extensive that they almost secured control of one insurance company. They owned a wireless station in New South Wales, but the licence was cancelled and re-issued by the government of the day to the Country party. I do not object to that. But it would be impossible for people of the MCArthur type to act as they did if there were no proprietary limitedcompanies. It is a fact that all the advantage is on the side of the people who form the companies; there is no corresponding advantage to the community. Every proprietary limited company should be made to publish its balance-sheets. At the moment, the balance-sheets are not published. We also have a system of holding companies such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the Myer Emporium Limited, - and others. They consist of small family groups who form proprietary limited companies and dominate the whole of the activities of the public companies. They do not, of course, disclose their profits. If the Attorney-General introduces legislation to control companies, I . ask that the In come Tax Act shall be amended at the same time so that the Commissioner of Taxation may, in his annual report to Parliament, publish the names of persons who pay taxes exceeding £500 a year, in order that the people may know who is robbing them. I suggest that not only the amount of tax but also the net income upon which the tax is based should he published. At present, the Commissioner of Taxation publishes the names of persons on whom penalties have been imposed. I see no reason why he should not also publish the names of those who pay tax in excess of a certain amount. Other things could be said about proprietary limited companies and about company law in general, We have undoubtedly suffered in Australia through the lack of uniform company legislation. The Attorney-General told me last year that in his opinion the Commonwealth always did possess power to pass uniform company legislation. This morning, he said that he preferred to wait until all the .State Parliaments pass the Commonwealth Powers Bill so that the matter may be placed beyond, doubt. When that oocurSj company legislation may be introduced into this Parliament. Some years ago, the Parliament of Victoria passed a comprehensive measure dealing with companies, but it was rather conservatively based, because it slavishly followed British company legislation. No one will say that British company legislation is marked by progressive tendencies or possesses radical traits. At any rate, the general public must be protected from company "" sharks "" and from those who are accepted as ordinary, decent people but whose commercial morality is, like that of almost all those engaged in commerce, not of a very high order. It is almost impossible for a man to be honest in commercial life. If he tries to be, he will not get business. In order to survive he has to do the things which most of his fellows do. Often, the average employer desires to treat his employees fairly, but when he is faced with unfair competition, he has, in order to continue to be an employer, to do some of the things which he would never do otherwise, and so it is with company activities generally;",53

I have examined the position, and am advised that the publication of this map was not a. breach of censorship. In anticipation of an announcement which it was known I intended to make on the following day, the relevant censorship instruction was relaxed. This left the Daily Telegraph free to publish the map, which was not submitted to censorship.
