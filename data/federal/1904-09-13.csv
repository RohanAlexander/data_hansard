1,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I had been speaking for about an hour before the luncheon adjournment on Friday last, and when I re-entered the Chamber after luncheon, and found that there was not a quorum present, I asked the honourable member for Barrier if he would direct attention to the state of the House. I did so because the leader of the Government had been away from the Chamber for the whole of the time that I was speaking. He is seldom in the House, except when be is speaking himself, and many of his followers take the opportunity",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I rise to order. I submit that the honourable member may not cast reflections upon the actions of another honourable member while making a personal explanation.,12
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understand the honourable member for Hume to be explaining the reasons why he desired t'he honourable member for Barrier to call attention to the state of the House on Friday last. So long as he confines himself to such' reasons, he will be in order.",12
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is exactly what I was doing. The leader of the Government, as soon as he heard that I was about to speak, took the opportunity to walk out of the Chamber, and he remained away during the whole of the time that I was speaking.",12
5,Mr REID,Unknown,I really must object to these statements.,12
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The front Government benches were empty during nearly the whole of the time that I was speaking.,12
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,So were the Opposition benches.,12
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It was not so with the Opposition benches. Putting aside my personal feelings in the matter, I say that such conduct was disrespectful to the House. I had not much to say after the luncheon adjournment, and would not have taken more than about twenty minutes to conclude my speech.",13
9,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member's leader was also absent from the Chamber.,13
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I felt that in justice to the importance of the subject, and to myself, the leader of the Government should have been present in the House, instead of being at the other end of the building, as I understand he was. My object was, not to count 'out the House, but to bring other members into the Chamber. I regret that the House was counted out; but I could not help it. My object was to compel the members who sit on the Government side of the Chamber to attend to their duties.",13
11,Mr REID,Unknown,"Since my name has been introduced into the explanation made by the honourable member for Hume,"" I think that I shall not be out of order in making a personal explanation. He stated that I went out of the Chamber just before he began his speech. That may 'have occurred; but I wish to say that he did not influence my movements on the occasion, and that my absence from the Chamber was due to some call of public duty. perience is that my presence influences the honourable member as a red rag does a bull, and that the only way to preserve his mental equilibrium is for me to occasionally go out of the Chamber when he is speaking.",13
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I desired the right honourable member to hear what I had to say. I did not wish to speak behind his back. NA ADMINISTRATION.,13
13,Mr HIGGINS,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I wish to know from the Minister of External Affairs whether, having regard to his declarations last year as to the six hatters case, he intends to bring in a Bill to amend the Alien Restriction Act so as to remedy the state of affairs of which he complained. If this is not his intention, why is it not?",13
14,Mr REID,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I should like to remind the honourable and learned member of the declaration which I made upon the subject before the people of Australia. I placed the matter before them as every sensible politician places a matter before the public. If I have the power to alter the Act in a certain direction, I will do so the moment I discover the fact; but an alteration of the Act is not part of the policy of this coalition Government. I should like to say that one of my strong objections to the painful incident referred to was the unjustifiable delay which occurred in dealing with the case, during which the men concerned were kept in durance vile. I guarantee that there will be more prompt administration, so far as I am concerned, and that no such painful experience will occur in the future. FORMATION OF THE MINISTRY.",13
15,Mr FRAZER,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"In last Friday's Herald an honourable senator is reported to have saidMr Reid offered a portfolio to a Western Australian, who would not pocket his pride and accept the office. Is it a fact that a Western Australian representative was offered a portfolio in the coalition Government?",13
16,Mr REID,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I can understand the question of the honourable member, in view of the peculiar circumstances in which he has recently been placed.",13
17,Mr FRAZER,ALIEN RESTRICTION,Do I understand that the right honourable gentleman refuses to answer the question? My ex- Mr Reid - Absolutely .,13
18,Mr FRAZER,ALIEN RESTRICTION,And he is the self-appointed representative of Western Australia !,13
19,Mr REID,ALIEN RESTRICTION,I absolutely refuse to enter into these matters. MILITARY ORNAMENTS' AND BADGES. .,13
20,Mr HUME COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I wish to repeat the question which I asked of the Minister of Defence on Friday last. Has he yet come to a determination to have the ornaments, buttons, badges, and so forth, used by our Military Forces made in the Commonwealth ?",13
21,Mr MCCAY,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I have made inquiries, and I have ascertained that, during the term of office of my predecessor, Senator Dawson, the buttons were ordered from England, but the badges have not yet been ordered. I 'am now making inquiries to ascertain if it is not possible, as I believe it will be found to be possible, to obtain as good an article at as cheap a price from Australian workmen as could be obtained abroad. NA TOWARDS SOCIALISM.",13
22,Mr WATSON,MINISTERIAL ATTITUD E,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question which I presume he can answer for his better half as well as for himself. Is the statement attributed to the Postmaster-General, that it is the intention of the Government to interfere with the exploitation of the butter industry by certain gentlemen who are engaged in private enterprise, correct? If so, how does he reconcile it with his own statement that he does not believe in Socialism, or the extension of its principle?",14
23,Mr REID,MINISTERIAL ATTITUD E,"I regret to say that I have not yet received any communication from my honourable colleague the Postmaster-General upon the subject to which my honourable, friend refers. In the absence of any information as to my honourable colleague's utterance, I am not in a position to answer the question. NA",14
24,Mr MAUGER,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether he will take steps to have applied to the other States regulations similar to those in force in Victoria, which make it imperative that the tenderers ""shall manufacture the goods supplied to the Department upon their own premises, and shall not sublet their contracts in any way ?",14
25,Mr MCCAY,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me that he proposed to ask this question, but I have not yet had time to make inquiries. I can promise, however, that the fullest inquiry shall be made, and that everything shall be done to insure that the workmen, as well as the contractors, receive every consideration. Mr Reid laid upon the table the following paper: Report of the Royal Commission on the at Goaribari Island, British New Guinea, on the 6th March, 1004, together with the proceedings, minutes of evidence, and appendices. Ordered to be printed. COUNT OUT OF THE HOUSE.",14
26,Mr BATCHELOR,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"I desire to know from the Prime Minister whether he is accurately reported in this morning's news. papers as having stated that his party, when in opposition, refrained from such tactics as attempting to count out the House; and, if so, whether he is aware that during one sitting his party attempted to count out the House no less than twenty times ?",14
27,Mr REID,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,If any such thing occurred I can only say that it affords sufficient proof that I was not present.,14
28,Mr MCDONALD,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,The right honourable gentleman was present.,14
29,Mr REID,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,I do not remember the circumstances referred to. HIGH COMMISSIONER.,14
30,Mr CROUCH,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, in reference to his announcement that the Government did not propose to appoint a High Commissioner until after a conference had been held between the Commonwealth and the States Governments, whether he will assure the House that 'he will not attempt to appoint the High Commissioner without previous legislation?",14
31,Mr REID,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"I not only will not, but I cannot do so.",14
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"Yes , the GovernSUPPLIES. ment could appoint the High Commissioner without salary. VENTILATION OF THE CHAMBER.",14
33,Mr LIDDELL,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"I desire to ask you, Mr Speaker, as chairman of the House Committee, if any measures have been taken fo improve the ventilation of this Chamber, and, if so, what means have been adopted to increase the circulation of the air.",14
34,Mr SPEAKER,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"Immediatel y after the honourable member for Hunter had called the attention of the House to the subject of the ventilation of the Chamber, some time since, a meeting of the House Committee was held, and it was decided that, instead of the fresh air being forced into PAPER. the Chamber at a point just above the woodwork, and thereby, as was pointed out by the honourable member, leaving undisturbed a body of vitiated air near the floor, the air Affray should be forced in through openings beneath the seats all round the Chamber. The work was immediately put in hand, and was completed some three or four weeks ago, since which time the new system has been in full operation. As I had not heard any complaints, and as I was aware that circulation of air in the Chamber 'had been rendered much more complete, I presumed that success had been achieved. I was, however, informed on one occasion that in at least one portion of the Chamber the air was very bad, and I have taken steps today to have a further quantity of fresh air forced into the Chamber, and to ascertain whether there are any corners in which the air still stagnates. If honourable members will inform me from time to time as to the condition of the atmosphere, I shall be able to deal with the matter more thoroughly. If there are causes for complaint, and they are not mentioned to me, naturally they will remain unremedied. I shall be pleased if honourable members will mention to me any matter which, in their view, requires attention. TELEGRAPHISTAT JERVIS BAY. Mr G. B. EDWARD S asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether the position of telegraphist at Jervis Bay, where messages involving the safety of life and property are frequently sent and received, is to remain "" non-official,"" with a salary of £72 per annum ?",14
35,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The position of the telegraphist at Jervis Bay is now being inquired into, with a view to a full reply being given as soon as the necessary information can be obtained. D ARLINGTON POST-OFFICE SITE . Mr G. B. EDWARD S asked the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether it is correct1. That the State of New South Wales is debiting the Commonwealth with ^280 for land at Darlington upon which a post-office is being erected by the Government? 2. That the land in question was vested in the Darlington Borough Council, and that the said council, being desirous of getting a post office suitable to the locality, freely ceded the rights they possessed to the land for that purpose subsequently to the control of the Post and Telegraph Department passing to the'Commonwealth ?",15
36,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,TENDERS FOR DEFENC E,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1 and 2. The Municipal Council of Darlington offered, as a site for a post-office, part of the area vested in them for Town Hall purposes. This was accepted, but it was found that the council had no power to dispose of the land, and the State Government was moyed to resume the part desired for postal purposes. The resumption has taken place, but the State Government now intimate that they have no power to alienate, but they will have no objection to the Commonwealth acquiring the land under the compulsory acquisition provisions of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act, at a valuation of ^280 7 S NA BILL. Debate resumed from 17th August (vide page 4264), upon motion by Mr WATSON, as amendedThat the Bill be now recommitted to a Com- mittee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clauses 4, 37, 38, 39, 46, 52, 67, 68, and 90 and Schedule B, and the consideration of proposed new clauses 52A, and 95A.",15
37,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I did not happen to speak when this debate was initiated. Possibly, by some prescience, I thought it would be more convenient that I should be in a position to make a few remarks at the present stage. I wish to say that the Government have considered the proposals embodied in the motion, and are perfectly prepared to go into Committee for the purpose of considering them. As to, I think, all the propositions but one, we are in a. position practically to approve of ' them. Many of them are unimportant, others are intended to remove drafting difficulties, and the only one of serious importance, to my mind, is the first. We have not had the advantage of a discussion, either upon the second reading of the Bill or in Committee, upon the precise matter involved in the first proposal, and I ' shall be interested to hear the reasons which influenced the late Administration in suggesting this al-, teration.",15
38,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the first proposal ?,15
39,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"T c eliminate from clause 4, paragraph b of the definition of "" industrial dispute."" The clause provides that, apart from disputes between organizations of employees and employers, or organizations on both sides, the Registrar, can certify that existing disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State are disputes which in the public interest ought to be brought within the jurisdiction of the Court. The proposal of the late Administration was that this provision should be. omitted.",15
40,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Such cases are provided for in another sub-clause.,15
41,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is the point with regard to which I should like to hear an explanation by. my honourable friend. I intend to suggest an alteration in the paragraph as it stands, which, I think, would effect a great improvement, but I should first like to hear, in Committee, the reasons to be advanced for omitting the provision..",15
42,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the right honourable gentleman's proposal?,16
43,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that it would be only fair to the late Administration if we were to first hear what were their reasons for suggesting that the paragraph should be omitted.  propose to do with regard to clause 48?,16
44,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is not now embraced in the motion.,16
45,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As a matter of practice, I would point out that, if there is no objection to the recommittal of clause 4, and if the question is simply as to what shall be done with clause 4 upon its recommittal, that matter could be most appropriately dealt with in Committee. If there is any difference of opinion as to whether the clause should be recommitted, that matter should be debated at the present stage.",16
46,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I am not quite certain as to the exact stage we have reached in this debate. If the effect of my speaking now would be to close the debate, I do not wish to bring about that result.",16
47,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,South SydnevV - I desire to move an amendment providing for the recommittal of clause .32A to enable me to again bring before the Committee a new clause which was partially discussed in my absence on a previous occasion.,16
48,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As there seems to be some uncertainty as to the rights of honourable members to speak to the motion, I may inform the House that the position is that the motion we are now discussing was moved by the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bland. The only other member who spoke to that motion was the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who concluded with an amendment, and the whole of the debate which followed, and which extended over several days, was upon that amendment. being so, the only honourable members who cannot speak to this motion, if they now 'desire to do so, are the honourable member 'for Bland and the Minister of Defence.",16
49,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I wish to move the recommittal of clause 92, in order to enable me to submit a new sub-clause, to be known as sub-clause 2. I gave notice of my amendment to the late Government, and"" when the Bill was originally discussed in Committee, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat supported a proposition which I then made to so amend the clause as to enable a witness to give evidence in camera if there was any danger of the disclosure of a trade secret. The then Government promised to recommit the clause if I desired them to do so, and I am glad to say that I subsequently prepared an amendment which the late Attorney-General was able to accept, and which met, not only my own wishes, but those of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I think that when it is put forward the Committee will agree to it.",16
50,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the amendment?,16
51,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I understood that when I first mentioned my proposal it also had the support of the honourable and learned member for Corinella.,16
52,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not object to the recommittal. Amendment (by Mr GB EDWARDS) agreed toThat after the word "" clauses,"" line 5, the figures ""32A,"" be inserted. Amendment (by Mr CROUCH) agreed toThat after the figures "" 90"" the figures "" 92 "" be inserted.",16
53,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," If the amendment of which notice has been given by the leader of the Opposition be carried, it may be necessary to reconsider clause 28, because the Bill as it now stands gives no power to an employer to submit a dispute to the Court! That evidently is due to a mistake on the part of the draftsman. The difficulty is partly overcome by paragraph' b of clause 4, which it is now proposed to excise, and if that provision be omitted it may be necessary to reconsider clause 28. I therefore move- z That, after the figure "" 4 "" the figures "" 2 8 "" be inserted. Amendment agreed to.",16
54,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I move That after ihefigures""52"" the words ""62, That paragraph b,"" be inserted. My object is to secure the amendment of paragraph b.",16
55,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In what way?,16
56,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It will be time enough to discuss the matter when we go into Committee.,16
57,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,- I merely desire to know the nature of the proposed amendment. Amendment agreed to.,16
58,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The feeling I entertain towards these proposals and the Bill generally may be simply stated. A majority in this House has carried provisions which in my view render the Bill absolutely unworkable and valueless, and I therefore do not consider that any responsibility in connection with it rests upon my shoulders as a friend of the measure. I contend that the Bill will not be availed of.",16
59,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will the honourable member mention in what respect he considers it valueless ?,17
60,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I hold that the amendment, carried on the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, is absolutely unworkable, and, so far as I have been able to obtain any indication of the position from the unions, they are not likely to register under it. That being so, the Bill must fail in the object for which it was ostensibly introduced. It can hardly be claimed that that will be the result simply because preference is denied to them; but, as I indicated when the main question was being discussed during the late crisis, it will be rather because it is absolutely impossible in many cases to prove when a union comprises a majority of those engaged in the trade to which it relates. The honourable member for Moira, speaking in Committee, before the question was made a party one-and therefore I presume when he was free to express an opinion based on the practical knowledge which he undoubtedly possesses",17
61,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,When was I in a different position?,17
62,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When party considerations came into play the honourable member seemed to lose sight of those aspects of the matter which he had put forward whilst speaking in Committee. According to Hansard, page 2640, he said on the 23rd June last, when discussing the amendment moved on clause 48 by the honourable and learned member for CorinellaI have said that I have not studied the ment proposed'! by the honourable and learned member for Corinella; but, from what I have heard of it, it would appear to be open to objection, inasmuch as it would make it necessary to secure the opinion of the majority of the workers in any particular industry. Although the honourable member had not studied the amendment at that time, he had become seized of the crux of it, namely, that it insisted upon a majority of those affected by an award approving of any request for preference. The honourable member is a practical man, and particular at7s 2 2 tention should therefore be paid to his opinions. On the occasion to which I have referred, he went on to say' In the earlier clauses of the Bill we have laid it down that 100 members may constitute an organization having a right to submit a proposal to the CouTt. If people are compelled to go beyond that to find out the absolute number of workers in any particular industry, tlvat they may be able to prove to the Court that they have a majority of those employed in the industry behind them, their task would appear to me to be an almost impossible one. I said that the honourable member was absolutely right. If there is a majority of honourable members honestly anxious to pass a measure which can be taken advantage of, this provision must be altered. Honourable members have so far decided not to alter it, and it seems to me that there is now no course open to those who are in favour of an effective measure, other than to throw the whole responsibility for the failure to pass such a measure upon the shoulders of those who have put this Bill in the shape in which it now appears. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat is another witness whom I desire to call. The honourable and learned gentleman saidThe Attorney-General urged that the clause proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella was open to objection, because it imposed difficulties upon the Court in the way of interpretation. I admit that it does. But, I say deliberately,/ without any hesitation, that it imposes on the Court a smaller burden than would be imposed by the clause which the Government have asked to substitute for it. The latter part of that opinion certainly gives some reason why the proposal submitted by the late Government should not have been accepted, but it does not at all answer the fact that the difficulty exists in regard to the interpretation of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. As one who was anxious to see this Bill passed in such a shape that it could be taken adamendvantage of by the people generally, and believing, as I do, that, in the shape in which if now is, it cannot be effective, and that, so far as the great majority of unionists are concerned, no attempt will be made to take advantage of it, I say that our duty, is to put the whole responsibility for this state of affairs upon honourable members opposite, the wreckers of tihe measure. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. In Committee-(Recommittal) . Clause 4 (Interpretation).",17
63,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION, The honourable member for Bland apparently does not propose to - move the amendments given notice of by the late Government.,18
64,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I propose to take no further part in it. Clause agreed to.,18
65,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We will not be parties to putting a fraud on the people.,18
66,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member appears to have accepted what he says is a fraud. Clause 28 (Disputes of which the Court has cognisance).,18
67,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I mentioned this clause as requiring to be reconsidered on the assumption that the amendment, of which notice had been given by the leader of the Opposition, would have been persevered in. I do not intend to move any amendment myself, but I should like to draw attention to the fact that as the Bill - now stands an employer has no power to submit a dispute to the Court-it must be submitted by an association of employers or an association of employees. It is necessary in the case of employ6s that an association should act for the whole, because one man could not do so; but there may be only one employer who may have a thousand hands in his employ, and as a matter of right that employer should have the power of submitting to the Court a dispute between himself and his workmen. As the Bill now stands, no such power is given. Clause agreed to. Clause 37The award of the Court shall be binding on(a) all parties to the industrial dispute who appear or are represented before the Court; [6) all parties who have been summoned to appear before the Court as parties the dispute, whether they have appeared in answer to the summons or not, unless the Court is of opinion that they were improperly summoned before it as parties; (c) all organizations and persons on whom the award is declared by the Court be binding as a common rule; and (d) all members of organizations bound by the award.",18
68,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In connection with this clause I propose to adopt the amendment suggested by the late A'dministration. I theiefore move That after the word "" is,"" line r3, the words "" at any time,"" be inserted. Paragraph c will then readA l l organizations and persons on whom the award is at any time declared by the Court to be binding as a common rule; There is an obvious utility in the insertion of these words, as.otherwise technical objections might arise as to the powers of the Court in enforcing its own orders. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amendfed, agreed to. Clause 38When an award or order of a State Industrial Authority is inconsistent with an award or order lawfully made by the Court, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.",18
69,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Tw o amendments suggested by the late Administration in this clause are, in my opinion, very proper amendments to make. I move That after the word ""When,"" line 1, the words "" a State law or,"" be inserted. Amendment agreed to. Amendments (by Mr Reid) agreed to. That after the word "" award,"" line 1, the word "" or,"" be left out. That after the word "" order,"" line 1, the words "" or determination "" be inserted.",18
70,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I point out to the Committee that by inserting. this clause in the Bill we are going far beyond our powers under the Constitution. This point was previously taken by the' honourable and learned member for Angas, but honourable members did not see fit to accept the honourable and learned member's view. I desire now to express my thorough agreement with the position then taken up by the honourable and learned member. I think this provision is beyond our powers and it should not be included in the Bill. I formally record my objection to the clause. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 39Subject to the Constitution, no award of the to Court shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question in any other Court on any account whatever.",18
71,Mr DEAKI N,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I notice that the first words of this clause, to which attention was drawn when the Bill was last to discussed during the time of the late Government, have not been withdrawn. It was, I think, the honourable and learned member for Indi who first called attention to the fact that the words "" Subject to the Constitution "" might convey a very serious implication. The clause, without those words, is clear; and I was able to inform honourable members, when the Bill was last before us, of the circumstances under which the words were introduced. The object was to satisfy the lay members of the Barton Cabinet that there was no intention to - overridethe Constitution. For .that purpose only were the words introduced; and I pointed out at the time that the clause, as it stood, would suffice. In the subsequent discussion in Committee, it was stated that "" subject to the Constitution ' ' having been introduced, the implication on the part of the Court probably would be that it was intended that, even if the Court created under this Bill were to override, to ignore, or to contravene some of the express provisions of the Act, its action could not be called in question in any other Court whatever. In point of fact, from the insertion of these words the implication would be that the Court would not be subject to anything except the Constitution, not even to the Bill under which it was created. That was a very serious consideration, and I followed the honourable and learned member for Indi in asking that special attention should be given to the point. I presume that attention was given by the late Government; but their inaction seems to me sufficiently momentous to, at all events, call for explanation. I think it would require a good deal of argument to satisfy the Committee that,' when we are passing a Bill for the purpose of creating a Court with certain very large and definite powers, we, at the same time, intend that any illegal action of the Court, so far as that action would be made illegal by transcending or violating part of this Bill, shall not be called in question in any other Court. additions which are to be proposed at the end of the clause are a decided improvement, and with them. I entirely agree; but those additions appear to be called for quite independently of the words "" Subject to the' Constitution."" The proposal is to add two sub-clauses which allow the President, if lie thinks fit, to obtain the opinion of the High Court, and' authorize the High Court to hear and determine the question and remit the opinion to the President. That is a very useful and proper provision, but it does not affect the prior issue. The question is whether we intend, by the insertion of the words, "" Subject'tb the Constitution,"" to set the Court free from the obligations which we ourselves have so carefully and elaborately set out in the Bill , or whether we do not mean what the clause originally said, namely, that no decision of the Court is to be challenged, appealed against, or called in question by any other Court, unless the decision is contrary to the Constitution - a restriction which, even if we wished, we could not evade or disqualify-o r contrary to this Bill . I take it that the intention was- I know it was my intention when the clause was draftedthat the Arbitration Court was to possess the powers set out in the Bill , and no others-jus t those powers for a specified purpose, and was not to be set free from any obligation, or to be allowed to create an authority for itself withoui the sanction of Parliament, as expressed in the Bill. I move That the words "" Subject to the Constitution "" be left out.",18
72,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is evident that the words "" Subject to the Constitution "" may lead to confusion, and as they are absolutely unnecessary in any of the Commonwealth Acts, which are, every line and word, subject to the Constitution, I accept the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. Amendment agreed to.",19
73,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In regard to this clause, the late Government made certain suggestions which I propose to adopt, if the Committee are agreeable. I move That the following new sub-clauses be inserted :"" (a) The President may, if he thinks fit, in any proceeding before the Court, at any stage and upon such terms as he thinks fit, state a case The in writing for the opinion of the High Court upon any question arising in the proceeding which, in his opinion, is a question of law.

74,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Northern Melbourne) Although the members of the late Administration do not take any responsibility for the Bill as it stands, still I think that in courtesy to the Prime Minister, I ought to state that the words which he proposes should be inserted were adopted by the late Government in pursuance of the promise made to the honourable and learned member for Corinella in the course of the discussion.",19

76,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs also may have spoken on the matter, but I was not aware of the fact. At all events, the desire was to, as far as possible, prevent litigation in the ordinary Courts with regard to the proceedings of the Arbitration Court. So far as the late Government were concerned, they did not recommend this proposal, but simply promised to submit it in pursuance of the generally expressed wish of honourable members, and, of course, as we promised so we performed. I should myself prefer to omit the words, inasmuch as the Judge of the Arbitration Court will be a member of the High Court, and it is very improbable that he will make a mistake in the. law of any matter before him. However, the Committee now understand how these additional words came to be proposed. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

78,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," It appears to me that this clause, even as amended, goes rather too far.",20
79,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The object of the clause is to give power to the Court in a particular case to give part of the penalty to a member of an organization which comes before the Court, as distinct from giving the penalty to the organization.

92,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What was the position at the time this amendment was carried ? There was before the Committee a proposal that I happened to move containing exactly the same words as now appear in this proviso, with the exception that it went a good deal further, and proposed practically to say to unions that they should not be plaintiffs in arbitration court proceedings as long as their rules permitted the application of their cir- funds to political purposes, or required their members to do anything of a political character. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs moved, as an amendment to my amendment, tp substitute the words which appear in this provisoShall be entitled to any declaration of preferI t is no ence by the Court.

113,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It will be recollected that this particular amendment, in its present form, was carried by a majority of one. The late Prime Minister proposed to reconsider its verbiage with a view to its recommittal later on if it were thought necessary, and, from circumstances over which I presume he had no control, he decided at the last minute to accept its exact verbiage, and Dame Rumour does say that it had some effect on the division which took place a few minutes later. But, apart from that, the late Government accepted this amendment, and the honourable members who spoke on it-particularl y such members as the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, and I think the honourable and learned member for Indi, and others-dre w attention to the fact that here was a plain, and a more proper, dividing line than the one suggested in my amendment. I cannot say that I yet agree with that view. But, as I said long ago, after the amendment relating to the railway servants was and before even clause 48 was .'redealt with, whether certain proposals mine were agreed to or not, I would support the third reading of the Bill . reI have no reason to recede from the position which I then took up. I would ask the was honourable member for Kennedy, who has now learned from the lips of the late At torney-General, as well as from the honordeable member for Bland, that on a occasion an agreement was arprorived at that this particular amendment should be accepted, whether he thinks he to place his leaders in such an embarrassing position",22

120,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not worrying. The honourable member, I understand, wishes to worry about myself, but I have not begun to do so yet. I repeat that the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs proposed this amendment, and that the late Administration accepted it. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbenches, bourne now declares that honourable memMinisterial corner. bers opposite are free from any bargains into which they previously entered. I venMinister there? ture to hold the view that they are not free, if they wish to be consistent. They agreed to this amendment, and they must have regarded it, individually at rate, as a practical one. I think that the interjection of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was really a casual one, and that he scarcely conwhether siders himself free to vote against a posal which he so fully accepted on a former occasion. So far as the proviso itself concerned, I think that the Committee were practically agreed not only that it was tifiable, but that it was desirable that some line of demarcation should be drawn between political and industrial purposes in organizations either of employees. The only question that arose was as to where that line should be drawn. I think it was the honourable and learned that. member for Ind i who. pointed out that here, in the progress of an industrial dispute, was reached the point at which a tical body. non-member of a union had a right to complain of being forced-by the grantin ing of a preference to unionists-to join union. H is view was that, so long as poses. a man was not compelled to join a union by the fact of a preference being extended to its members, he was not concerned with the question of whether politics entered its affairs or not, but that the moment 2 ference was granted by the Court, he had a right to protest against politics forming any part of its platform. Here, therefore, he urged, a point was reached, at which not I only was it permissible, but absolutely proof per, that a line of demarcation should be drawn. I thoroughly agree with that view. I thought that the point should I know that to the leader of the Opposition agrees with that no man should feel that he is bound the to join a union in order to obtain work, if that union exists for political purposes. of Under this provision, therefore, if not at an earlier stage, the purely industrial character of the Bill should begin.",23
121,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the Minister know me any union that has not political objects ?,23
122,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Upon , a former occasion the honourable member himself made a long speech to show that unions were not political organizations. I recollect very well when he spoke from the Government because I occupied a seat in the",23

After he had resumed his seat I had the honour to rise and to address myself to the same question. I remember that I discussed the question of trades unions were political orproganizations, and in doing so I referred to - the Australian Workers' Union. The honis orable member thereupon handed me their deed of association, in order that I might jusread for myself, and learn that it was not a political body. I read a number of the objects of that union, and it seemed to me that it did partake of the nature of a poliemployers or tical organization.",23

I am sorry that I have a prenot had time to obtain a few quotations from I Hansard upon this point, but it was only .when the honourable member for Kennedy proposed the recommittal of the clause that I realized it would be raised, and even then I did not anticipate that the Opposition would take up such an unfriendly attitude towards the Bill'. The position is that after long debate, and earnest consideration, this Committee, by a majority of one, accepted the amendment in its present form, as compared with the amendment in a stronger form. liamentary procedure means anything, I may therefore claim that the whole Committee were then agreed that some limitation was desirable.",23
129,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment was only carried by a majority of one.,24
130,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But those honourable members who constituted the minority, desired to obtain a still greater measure of restriction. The amendment in its present form represents the minimum restriction which the Committee would sanction. If the honourable member for Kennedy insists upon pressing his proposal to a division, I venture to say that honourable members will practically unanimously confirm the decision at which they formerly arrived, after a prolonged debate which extended over two or three days. I have no doubt that honourable members who then pointed out so clearly that this was the proper point at which to draw the line of demarcation, still entertain that opinion.",24
131,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I have just spent two or three minutes in looking up the Hansard report of the discussion upon this amendment, and I must say that I am astounded at the attitude which has been taken up by honourable members opposite. No doubt the Committee will recollect the debate which took place upon a former occasion. The honourable and learned member for Angas moved an amendment to limit the organizations which could register to organizations which were constituted solely for the purposes of the Act. The honourable and learned member for Corinella moved a lesser amendment, prohibiting organizations which had political aims or objects from coming before the Court. Then the honourable and learned members for Darling Downs and Indi prepared an amendment to the effect that no organization should be allowed to ask for preference if it were a political organization. The reasons which they gave are fully set out in Hansard). The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs is reported on page 2918 of that record to have saidFor my part, I should prefer that unions should not have political rules. At the same time, I say that if there is a large organization, composing nearly all the employees engaged in a specific trade, and if they have political objects in view, I do not believe that when they come before the Court for a decision in an industrial dispute the Court will be actuated in any way by a consideration of the politics of the union. If parLater on, he said I again point out that the difficulty can arise only in connection with the giving of a preference to unionists. I should like to ask the Minister of External Affairs, who is at present in charge of the Bill , if he will consider the advisability of dealing with this difficulty. Could we not provide that, where unions are political bodies, no preferences shall be given them until the objectionable political features are removed from their rules? So that the first suggestion came from the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. He continued The honourable and learned member for Indi and I have given this matter considerable consideration. We have tried to see whether we could not meet what is the substantial objection against the clause. Later on, he saidWhen we come again to deal with the question of preference to unionists, what I desire to see carried is an amendment which will provide that no preference of any description whatever shall be given to a union if by rule its funds may be appropriated in whole or in part for political objects.",24
132,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They could be political up to the last moment, and then be dropped.",24
133,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"So long as they do not ask for preference as a political organization, no harm will be done. The then Prime Minister spoke on the subject on the same day. His remarks, as reported on page 2945 of Hansard, 'are most interesting. They are as follows :The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs put forward an idea in regard to preference for unionists. In my opinion these two matters are largely bound up, as was rightly indicated by the right honourable member for East Sydney, and I think I am therefore justified in saying a word or two in regard to them. As I understand it, the view put forward by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs was that we should make some attempt to safeguard the non-unionist from preference to , unionists being granted to his detriment, and that would obviate the necessity for the amendments which are now before the Committee. Then he is reported, on page 2946, to have said I am quite prepared to meet the position by agreeing to an amendment that will secure that no preference shall be granted to a union while there is anything in its rules to which reasonable objection can be taken.",24
134,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why does not the honourable and learned member quote the extract at the top of the page?,25
135,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He said that he would much prefer that there should be no limitation whatever on preference. he told the House that he was prepared to accept an amendment to the effect that no preference should be given to a union, if there was anything of a political character in its rules. The next person to come on the scene was the honourable and learned member for Indi, who is reported on page 2956 to have said I see no reason for denying them-the trades unions-acces s to the Court, no matter what their political faith may be. But the moment they ask for an advantage or a preference; the moment they say, "" We .want something more than a non-unionist can get,"" then coercion commences, if they get it. If the Court gives it to them it says to other workers, "" You shall not get equal rights unless you join an organization."" If that organization has a compulsory political platform it is not giving political freedom to the outsider, and we should prohibit preference under any circumstances, so long as that political form exists. I think that that is a position which every honourable member on this side of the Chamber endorses. He further saidThe honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has been good enough to associate.himself with me in trying to frame an amendment which I intend to propose, and which I understand the Prime Minister is willing to accept. He quoted the amendment, which is as follows: No preference shall be declared to any organization under this Act if its rules, decisions, Conroy, A. H . B. or practices, or any of them provide for or permit either the application or appropriation of its funds, or any part thereof, for any political purEdwards, G. B. pose whatever, or any political action on the part of the organization. That is going as far as any honourable memFuller, G. W. ber on this side of the Chamber wishes to Gibb, J. go at the present time. On page 2957, Glynn, P. MCM. he is reported to have said I should much like to see no preference, if it Knox, W. could possibly be avoided. I think that preferLee, H . W. ences ought, in any case, to be most sparingly Liddell, F. dealt out.",25
136,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If it were possible to have no evasion of this Act, I should be glad to see no preference, but preference is necessary in some cases to prevent the evasion of the Act.",25
137,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Most of us would agree to that. On the night when the division was taken, the then Prime Minister said again that he was prepared to accept the amendment. The present Prime Minister chaffed him for surrendering his principles, but he became indignant, and denied in the most vigorous language that he had surrendered his principles. To quote from pages 3028-9 of Hansard, he said I say that the proposal put forward by the Then honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, and the spirit of which was accepted by me last evening, is quite in consonance with the views which I expressed in Sydney, I think, eighteen months ago, when a matter cropped up affecting this particular question, or affecting the aspect of it now under consideration. Mr HUM E COOK - Is he rejecting it now?",25
138,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He is giving a good deal of covert support to the proposal to reject it. I , therefore, say that the twin leaders of the Opposition were in harmony in support of this particular sub-clause, and that it was prepared by the two best friends in the Opposition corner possessed by the then Government; and as it was exhaustively debated, the conclusion come to upon it is one - upon which I dojiot think the Committee should plat- go back, more particularly as the then Government did not propose to recommit the clause.

The proposed new clause embodies a principle which I have endeavoured from the first to have inserted in the Bill. somewhat recast my original proposal, owing to certain strictures passed upon it by the honourable and learned - member for Indi, when it was previously before the Committee. It does not often happen that I am absent from the House, but, unfortunately, I was not present on the occasion to which I refer, and I do not think that the principle underlying my proposition received that consideration which it merited. It is for that reason that I have again submitted it. The proposed new clause, as originally framed, dealt merely with efforts at compromise. It was drafted by the right honourable member for Adelaide, and carried out entirely what I had in view. Any effort at settlement made under the direction of the Court would necessarily be in the direction of a compromise, even if it did not recede one iota from the original effort which the party in question might have made. To do away with the criticism to which my first proposal was subjected by the honourable and learned member for Indi and several others, I have so re-cast the clause that it will cover, not only an effort to compromise, but any effort that may be made subject to the conditions of the clause. It is, to my mind, a complete refutation of the charge levelled against me by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, that a vote given by me on another clause showed that I desired to destroy the Bill . I think that this proposal, which has been before the House from the first, must show that I am a friend of this class of legislation- a greater friend than are many of those who have denounced my advocacy of the measure as. political hypocrisy. I should like to briefly review some of the main provisions of the Bill in order to show, why my proposal should be adopted. It does not involve the fate of any Ministry. It has been brought forward by an obscure member of the House, and I am afraid on that account that it - will not receive that consideration which it"" deserves ; but I feel sure that. some such principle as that underlying my proposal will ultimately be embodied in legislation of this class, or it must necessarily break down. this reason that I desire, carefully and sincerely, to point out what are my reasons for endeavouring to secure the insertion of this principle, or something as closely akin to it as the Committee will accept, in this Bill. The Bill is entitled, "" A Bill for an Act relating to Conciliation and ArbitraI have tion,"" and honourable members should be sufficiently aware of its contents to know how much of it really deals with conciliation. The word "" conciliation ' ' appears in the title' of the Bill, and also in the introductory provisions contained - in clause 2, sub-clause 3To provide for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court by cor-ciliation with .a view to amicable, agreement between the parties. No further reference to conciliation is to be found in the Bill until clause 32 is reached. The intervening provisions deal entirely with arbitration, but in clause 32 we have this reference to conciliationThe Court shall, in such manner as it thinks fit, carefully and expeditiously hear, inquire into, and investigate every industrial dispute of which it has cognisance, and all matters affecting, the merits' of the dispute, and the right settlement thereof. Then in sub-clause 2 there is a further reference to conciliationIn the course of such hearing inquiry and investigation the Court shall make all such suggestions and do all such things as appear to it to be right and proper for reconciliating the parties and for inducing the settlement of the dispute by amicable 'agreement. If this Bill were consistent, part with part, one would expect a clause like this, declaring the general scope of the Court, to be followed by further provisions relating to conciliation, and providing for regulations dealing with the subject. But so far from that being the case, we find that there is only one further reference to conciliation in the Bill. It is to be found in clause 42, which provides thatThe Court may temporarily refer any matters before it to a Conciliation Committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees, who shall endeavour to reconcile the parties. Seeing that outside the title of the Bill itself only two definite references to conciliation are to be found in the measure, I think it has no right to the name which it bears, unless we make provision for something in the direction at which my proposal aims. Setting aside for the moment the It is for scope of the Bill itself, and referring to the operation of such legislation in New Zealand, New' South Wales, and elsewhere, we find that unless it provides some means to induce the settlement of disputes so far as possible by conciliation, the Conciliation and Arbitrations Courts become congested to such an extent as to make the legislation under which they exist inoperative and, indeed, a perfect farce. There are disputes now awaiting settlement in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court of New South Wales with which the parties are unable to do anything, because they know that in some cases it is impossible for the Court to take any step towards their settlement for a period of about two years. My desire is to bring about a settlement of disputes by some rough and ready means of natural justice. During the discussion of another clause, the honourable and learned member for West Sydney inquired what was "" natural justice '' in the view of the honourable member who was using that term? By the term ""natural justice,"" in its application to the proposed new clause, I mean that we should endeavour to put the parties to a dispute in such a position that they cannot attempt to gain any benefit for themselves that will not involve a corresponding benefit to the other side should they fail in their endeavour. Although this may seem a somewhat novel proposition to introduce in the statute-book of the Commonwealth, I may point out that the main principle underlying it can be found in legislation in force elsewhere, and that it is embodied more or less in many - of the enactments of the States Parliaments of Australia. I have previously pointed out that we find it in the old law of the Athenian democracy. A party charged with an offence during the fierce democratic struggles which prevailed in those days, had a right to plead guilty or not guilty, and to have his case decided accordingly, or to go further, and to name a minor penalty as en itpared with that affixed by the complainant, who acted the part of public prosecutor. It is well known to honourable members that Socrates, the philosopher, - when charged with an offence against the laws of his State-the offence of corrupting the youth - had the penalty of death nominated against him by the parties who had instituted the proceedings. It was then open to him.to plead guilty, and to nominate a far less drastic penalty, and that having been done, the dycastery, or jury, might have extended mercy to him, knowing that the prosecution was more or less a political one. In that way Socrates might have saved his life, but in a spirit of philosophical conMr G. B. Edwards. tempt for the prosecution, he nominated a penalty so low that the dycastery refused to accept it, and he went to his death.",26
142,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He demanded to be treated as a public benefactor.,28
143,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is so. He demanded to dine at the Prytaneum at the public cost. That is an instance of the introduction of a principle, very similar to that which I advocate, in the criminal law of a very advanced state of civilization, and of resort being had to it for a very good purpose: to 'mitigate the severity of the political strife which, in some instances, led to the institution of these criminal prosecutions. I desire to refer to one of the features of the oldest legislation of which we know. A book entitled The First of Emfires, which has recently been placed on the shelves of the Parliamentary Library, gives a description of a system of leasing, under improvement, which prevailed in olden days, and in which the very principle I am now advocating was observed. These Laws of Kammurami, the - first known laws that have been recovered from the ruins of ancient empires, embodied a principle under which a man took a lease of land to lay out as an orchard, under all the circumstances in which land is taken up today for improvement purposes. The condition in most of the leases was that in ten years' time half the land was to revert to the original holder. In order that the original holder might have the full benefit of the improvements effected upon the land it was left to the lessee to divide the land in halves, and then the original holder selected which of the halves he would take. There, again, there was applied this principle of a rough natural justice, under which the parties concerned were' able to compose their disputes without going through the formality of fighting them cut in a court of law.",28
144,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But it was a very bad code of law; they had no cure, no pay for doctors.",28
145,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is true that they had that rule; but that does not affect my present line of argument. Coming nearer to our own times,, in fact to the legislation of the various States forming the Commonwealth, honourable members are aware that we have a similar principle embodied in the Customs Acts of many of the States, though' I do not know that it is to be found in the Commonwealth Customs Act. Under many of the States Customs Acts it was left to the importer to value his own goods. The only check upon him was that if the State authorities chose they could say, "" We think you are undervaluing your goods,"" and they could then put a 10 per cent, advance upon them, and take over the goods at the importer's valuation, plus the .advance. This, again, was a rough and ready natural way of securing a just valuation of the goods by putting the importer in such a position that unless - he put a fair valuation on his goods he ran the risk of incurring the injustice he was endeavouring to inflict upon the State, by having his goods taken from him at a slight advance upon his valuation. The same principle has been adopted in the matter of land tax assessments in Australia, and in the neighbouring Colony of New Zealand. The land-owner is allowed to assess himself at what rate he pleases. If the State authorities consider that he has grossly undervalued his property, they can add a slight percentage to his valuation, and take over the property. Though I have not seen the Act, I am told that some fourteen years ago, in New South Wales, when it was found necessary to resume many of the extravagantly large leaseholds that had been given to people in the early days, it was decided that, although the total area should not be resumed, it would be wise in the interests of the State to resume at least half. Here, again, it will be understood, that if the State decided to cut the leases in halves and take one of the halves, the greatest injustice might, in some cases, have been done to the lessees. Instead of that, the enactment provided that the lessee might have his holding in any way he thought fit, and then the State stepped in, through its officials, and decided which of the two halves it would resume. It will be at once seen that, when it was left to a man to divide his estate, and he knew that the State would step in and take one of'the halves, he would take precious good care to see that they were equal. I desire to include this principle in the Bill. believe that it would have the effect of settling many disputes in a far better way than by Arbitration. settlement wfiich is likely to be arrived at after a long contested fight under arbitration, and with all the bitterness likely to be created in that way, is one which is not likely to. be the most desirable. whole scope of our consideration now should be not to create trouble by leaving the settlement of all cases to the Court, and thus occasioning bitter disputes, but to put the law in such a position that the desire to take advantage of it will not. be so great as it is at the present time, and that l it i gants may come to the conclusion that it is better for them to accommodate their differences, under the supervision of the Court, than to fight them out. I direct the attention of the Committee to the precise terms of my amendment. It will be seen that I do not propose to make it compulsory on the Court to require that the parties shall put in their best offers. That is left to the discretion of the Court. Throughout the discussion upon this Bill we have heard the argument used that we ought to trust the Court, and I think that if there is anything on which we should trust the Court it is on a principle of this sort, - when we know that already the Arbitration Courts in New South Wales and in New Zealand have intimated a desire to have some such a power as I suggest. They may not have said so in so many words, but, over and over again, they have told litigants, "" This is not a matter with which you should trouble us; you should be able to settle it amongst yourselves. This is not a matter of great importance, and our time is required for the consideration of matters of much graver import. You can surely settle this amongst yourselves."" If the Court had the power I propose, not only would it use it. in cases where plainly in the best interests of the operation of such legislation it should use it, but litigants themselves would see that by adopting this line of action they would have a better chance of settling their disputes, under the supervision of the Court, in such a way that the Court would register the decision arrived at, and it would be carried out with ail the formalities of law attached to an award by the Court-the finding being registered in the Court as an award of the Court. I should like to refer as briefly as I can to the report of the Royal CommisI sion on Strikes.in New South Vales. I am sorry to think that the volume in which it is contained has not been largely made use of A by those who have devoted their attention to the legislation now before us. There is in this volume, and in the evidence obtained by the Commission, very much that would greatly assist those designing such legislation as we have now before us. In The . paragraph 8 of the report, having used the. word "" conciliation,"" the - Commissioners sayIn using the term "" conciliation "" for the time in this report, it is convenient to here that the terms ""conciliation"" and "" a tration "" are often employed somewhat vaguely as if they were interchangeable, and yet represent two distinct things. The function any conciliation agency is to get the parties'to a dispute to come to a common agreement volun-. tarily without any opinion being pronounced on the merits or any instructions given. The tion of arbitration is distinctly to determine merits, and to give a positive decision abided by. If the declaration of such a decision can be avoided it is well that it should be, because decisions are generally more or verse to both parties, for even splitting ference is an equal censure upon both. But ciliation, if it is a success, allows of a settlement on a mutual agreement, and leaves no opening for discrediting the understanding impartiality of the arbitrators. That being the practical question that arises is, how this primary remedy of conciliation be applied.",28
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"All the same, concents. ciliation always means splitting the differit 6HCC",30
147,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; but I lay, hope to be able to show the honourable ber that the object I have in view is to tirely do away with splitting the difference. Further on in the report, the Commissioners state in paragraph 12Taking all these things into consideration, we recommend that, in the first instance, at and until circumstances justify some further differentiation in the constitution of the tribunal, there should be only one board, that this one board should be empowered in some form to discharge, as occasion may require, the double duty of conciliation and arbitration. That is to say, that its first effort should wards bringing about a voluntary agreement tween the parties, and failing that, that the board, or the permanent part of it, should charge the duty of adjudication, and pronounce a decision. The object I have in view is to give effect to the principle reported upon by this Royal Commission. We here have a Court, whilst the Commission speak of a Board, and I desire that our Court should use all the powers with which we can invest it have these disputes settled at the conciliastrikes tion stage before the parties are forced into litigation at the arbitration stage. ing with the evidence submitted to the Comhad mission, it will be found that on page 60 the appendix to their report, an account given of the Wallace Act, passed in the State of Pennsvlvania - a measure framed to facilitate arbitration industrial disputes. ' There are letters 'in connection with this evidence from Conciliation and [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. presentatives on both sides, commending the operation of the Act, and, anticipating advantageous results from its development. first Since those letters were written, there have remark been serious strikes in the coal-mining inr b i - dustry of Pennsylvania, as honourable memthey bers are aware-the very industry to which of these letters refer-and a glance at the results of the early operation of the law discloses a sufficient reason for the failure of functhe Pennsylvania legislation. It is another the case of attempting to settle these matters to be by ""splitting the difference."" The coal trade tribunal of the fifth judicial district less adof Pennsylvania was licensed under the the difWallace Act, to which I have referred, in con1883, and consisted of five representatives friendly of each side, and an umpire chosen by them or as a body. A strike was on, and the operaso, tors-whic h is the name they have 'for should masters there-offere d 3 cents, per bushel for mining, whilst the miners demanded 3J After several lengthy discussions, became apparent that an agreement could not be arrived at withoutconsiderable deand as an earnest'of good intentions it memwas ordered that the miners should resume enwork immediately, at a price to be thereafter fixed by the tribunal-the price to date back to the time of the resumption of work. The umpire had to be called in, and he awarded a price. Honourable members least, will know at once what his award was. As usual in these circumstances, the price labour he awarded was 3J cents. The men wanted but 3J, the masters offered three, and the umpire gave an award of 3J cents. This award, whilst it was apparently a disappointment be to to both parties, was accepted and conbecurred in for a few months as arranged, disbut before the expiration of that time the tribunal met to fix the price for a further period. This time the masters offered 3J cents., and the men demanded 3 § ' cents. Again the services of the umpire were requested, and he again split the difference, and awarded 3 cents. This award did not 1 appear to be satisfactory to all, but it was to accepted. Since then we have had great amongst the coal miners in Pennsylvania. What I say in this connection is that Deal- .if the award ultimately given in this case been given at first instead of the oriof ginal. decision it would have satisfied one is of the parties, whilst the other would have been in no worse position, and work would have been resumed. But under this system in of SDlitting the difference the demand is always increasing and the concesresion is always lagging tardily behind. Several of the witnesses before the Royal Commission on Strikes in New South Wales anticipated the friction that would arise over the principle of "" splitting the difference,"" which the new clause is designed to remedy. One of the witnesses was Mr W - E. Abbott, a gentleman well known to the representatives of New South Wales; and the following is an extract from his evidence, as reported on page 114: If we cannot enforce the decisions of the Court, do you think, as a rule, the decisions of the Court would be acquiesced in?-No . Thenwhat would be the use of it ?-The Court, as a means of settling disputes of that kind, would be no use, but as a means of registering agreements between the employers and employees or their unions it would be valuable. Then the best thing to be done is to have some arrangement for a written agreement to be registered in Court, at which either party can sue and get damages?-Yes , that is the only point I see on which the law can interefere in any way. If a Court undertook to interfere in any way, in such questions as whether a shearer should be paid 20s., or 2£5., probably the Court would split the' difference in some way; they would not give the 25s., and they would not give the 20s. At least that is the rule in most Arbitrators' Courts. Either side can then reverse the decision of the Court. If a Court said that 22s. 6d. was a fair thing, then the shearers would take the 22s. 6d. for the time being, and then go for 30s., in which case they would get (say) 24s., or the employer .would say that 22s. 6d. is not right, and he will go for 17s. 6d. My contention and that of Air. Abbott is that in the whole course of cur legislation all we are doing, unless we have some means to induce conciliation, is to absolutely constrain the men to make the largest demands, and absolutely constrain the masters to yield the smallest concessions. system of splitting the difference, which we see in so many of the decisions, the parties to these great industrial and social disputes, which are so dangerous to our ma-, terial welfare, and our internal peace, are forced further and further apart, whereas the design of legislation should be to induce them to come nearer and nearer-so near, in fact, that, in many instances, it will not be worthwhile to proceed further. I have read an extract from the evidence of one of the witnesses who represented the employers before the Royal Commission ; but honourable members may accept my assurance that there is evidence to the same effect on both sides. One of  Joseph Brennan, president of the Trades and Labour Council, Chairman of the Australian Labour Conference, founder of the Stewards' and Cooks' Union, and secretary to the Butchers' Union. Surely an occupant of all those positions ought to be able to speak of what was anticipated as the result of legislation, so far as unions and workmen are concerned. Yet Mr Brennan, on page 99, is thus reported:In any Court one side or the other is bound to be dissatisfied with the decision, but the rule has been with arbitrators to split differences; if in Courts of law they do not split differences, in Courts of Arbitration they have always split them; not only in the case of private arbitrators; Mr Oliver was not a private arbitrator, and Mr. Barton was appointed by a County^ Court Judge; I will not go into the technicalities of the matters sent before Mr Oliver, but I will say generally that the miners were willing to submit to competent arbitration. This man, representing unions of workmen, says that the whole tendency in Arbitration Courts is to split the difference; and I go further, and say t'hat if there is this tendency, this legislation will intensify and increase the number of disputes which we are setting forth with such good intentions to prevent. I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to the case of the Monumental Masons' Union against the Master Monumental Masons, heard in the New South Wales Arbitration Court. The men claimed that the price of cutting and blacking letters on free-stone tombstones should be 12s. per 100, whereas the respondents contended that the price ought to be 1 os. 6d. The Judge considered it utterly absurd to suppose that reasonable men could .not arrange whether ios. 6d. or 12s. 6d. should be paid for the work. I cannot say that, personally, I see that the By this Judge's remarks were called for, because the difference between ios. 6d. and 12s. 6d. was the difference in the wages for the day, and many other disputes heard before the Court do not involve quite so much. How- ever, this is what the Judge is reported to have saidTrie Court having power to dismiss any matter at any stage of the proceedings, where it thinks the dispute trivial, considered this 'absolutely trivial and dismissed it. I do not know whether we are-justified in reflecting on the conduct of the Judge, but if His Honor be correctly reported, I do not think that the men had their case properly inquired into. What I do say is, that the men ought to have had an opportunity such as I desire should be given, to submit their case to a primary or preliminary proceeding of conciliation; and, if it were impossible to have the dispute settled in that way, then, no Judge's time is too precious to be devoted to the work. Again, in the dispute between the Barrier Branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association and the Broken Hill Proprietary Co., the men asked for a 10 per cent, rise, and the masters wanted a 10 per cent, reduction in the wages; and the decision of the Court was practically that the parties should continue on the terms which had hitherto prevailed. I am not going to say whether the decision of the Court under the circumstances of the miners at the time was reasonably sound or not; but I do say tihat questions of that character, decided on those lines, will inevitably give rise to further litigation, and increase the number of great industrial disputes rather than, tend to decrease them and bring about easy settlements. But there is another and a most flagrant case of settling disputes on the principle of splitting the difference. Some time ago in the New South Wales Court, the case of the Hotel, Club, Restaurant, and Caterers' Employes Union was dealt with, and it is referred to on page 37 of the reports of the Arbitration Court. These men demanded sixty hours per week of six days, and the offer of the masters was seventy-one and a half hours for cooks, and seventy-eight for other classes of employees. The decision of the Court was in the first case .seventy hours per week of seven days, and in the second case seventyseven hours per week of seven days. demand in regard to wages was for chief cooks, £3, the offer of the. masters was £1 1 os., and the decision was £2 5s.; for second cooks the demand was £2 5s., the offer was £1 ss., and the decision was £\ for third cooks the demand was £1 15s., the offer was £1, and the decision was £1 5s.; for general hands, the demand was £1 5s,, the offer 12s. and 15s., and the decision was £1; for casual employees, the demand was 15s., the offer was ios., and the decision was 12s. 6d. In each of these particular cases, which involved the wages in different branches of this business, it will be seen that the demand and the offer were very wide apart indeed, and the only way which the Court could find to settle the dispute was to add the two sums together, and divide them. If that is to be the principle on which disputes of the kind are to be settled, we do not want a learned Judge, versed in British law, and a good deal of other law, and with a large salary, to settle such matters, because any ordinary, common-sense individual would be able to arrive at decisions of .this Mr G. B. Edwards. character. I do not deny for a moment that the Judges of such Courts give decisions involving points of very much greater importance than those which I have instanced; but I protest against that system of settlement for the reason, as I have said, that it must tend to increase litigation, and that it leaves behind it a more bitter and troublesome spirit amongst masters and men. If my proposal were adopted, we should say to the masters, in effect, "" What is the best you can offer?"" and to' the men, ""What is the least you are prepared to accept?"" The difference in the amounts would be reduced, and the parties brought so close together as to make it certain that the Arbitration Court would come toa satisfactory decision, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the parties themselves would deem it advisable to come to an agreement and have it registered in the Court. A similar plan is attempted in other countries. The honourable and learned member for Indi, in the early stages of the discussion on this Bill, made some reference to the Conseils de Prudliommes in France-a n institution which has much more limited jurisdiction than it is intended to give the Court under this Bill , but which works satisfactorily. I understand that in connection with this organization there is a principle adopted, which, however, I cannot find referred to in any book dealing with the subTbe ject in the Parliamentary or other library. But a witness before the RoyalCommission, whose evidence I give for what it is worth, stated that in the Conseils de Prudhommes five of the arbitrators are selected by the ios.; masters from among the men and another five are selected by the men from amongst the masters. If that be the case, the principle is the same as that of the clause which I propose. Under such a system the masters would select moderate and reasonable men, who are not likely, for any purpose, political or otherwise, to carry matters to extremes, and similarly the men would select employers whom they knew to be the most honest and the best-disposed towards their employees. Such a plan would result in a set of arbitrators more likely to come into accord than would be the case if each side appointed their own arbitrators. We here have the principle of natural justice, for which I have been contending all through my remarks, and which has been attained elsewhere. The facts will be best known to the particular masters and men selected as arbitrators, because they will be connected with the dispute; and, under the clause which I propose, the Court might be empowered to allow each party power to select a man from the other side. Above all, the clause would relieve the congested state of the Arbitration Courts. We know that, at the present time in New Zealand, and, perhaps, to greater extent, in New South Wales, it almost impossible to get disputes settled owing to the large amount of work with whkh the Courts have been rushed; and the number of cases, so far from decreasing, is increasing. I do not, as some ofiher Courts as at present conducted. honourable members do, hold the opinion * that the Arbitration Courts create litigation. In many instances, after having once an award registered, parties will not apply for another award, though they may ask for a variation to meet changing circumciliation stances. The fact remains that both New South Wales and New Zealand, the Courts are overburdened to the point of breaking down. In the principle of the clause I have proposed, we have a means making this class of legislation much more perfect than it is in the two States I have mentioned. I do not know to what extent honourable members consider that the Court will be occupied with disputes in difthat ferent parts of the Commonwealth, but is inevitable that if the High Court, in ciding as to.the extent of our power to terfere, should be in favour of the Arbitraproposal tion Court under this Bill having very full, almost plenary powers to deal with labour disputes of Australia, the Court have an immense body of work-wor k which not one Judge, nor even six Judges, will be able to do. that reason, more than any other, if desire this legislation to be successful in carrying out the objects which we to attain, and to remedy disputes, we provide beforehand for preventing the Court being choked with appliproposals cations, and so making it break down by the very weight and quantity of all. litigation. I say again, as I said in openthat ing,, that I desire this legislation to successful. I wish to see it successful the extent of ending our industrial warfare from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. In this clause, which I recommend to the consideration of honourable members, we have a means of making the Bill more perfect, and of carrying it into effect less chance of disastrous failure than will exist if some such principle is adopted.",30
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I have listened to the honourable member for South Sydney during a part of his address with a great deal of interest and with a desire to bring my mind to support his proposal j but I candidly confess that while a there is much to be said in favour of the is amendment, I do not think, on the whole, that the balance of the argument is in favour of it. For instance, one of his contentions is that this proposal will do away with the congestion of business which exists in the I do not think there is any analogy between the Courts as at present conducted and the got Court proposed to be established by this legislation. We are proposing to set up, for the first time, a Commonwealth Conand Arbitration Court. I venture into say that that Court will deal with and settle many matters which now go to the Arbitration Courts as at present constituted. new Speaking with a great amount of practical of experience on this subject, I do not think 'that a proposal of this kind would shorten the operation of such casjs by one minute. I rather think that it would have a tendency to lengthen them. It often happens a compromise is hit upon through sheer it exhaustion or through disgust at the way dein which the Court is spinning matters out. inBut if the alternative were to accept one or the other, the issue would be fought out to the bitter end, particularly the if there were a margin between the two will offers which might make it worthwhile to conduct the argument with strenuousness, and at length. Therefore, the amendment For would not save time, but would rather tend weto lengthen proceedings before the Court. Neither would the honourable member's prowish posal do away with the splitting of the must difference about which so much has been heard. Remember that in all these cases will emanate from bothsides before the matter goes before the Court at It is only after failure to agree they will' go to the Court for a final be verdict. If the parties do make minimum to offers to the Court, it would be a splitting of the difference on their own part, as compared with their previous offers to each other. Because, if they could agree upon a basis of settlement themselves, there would be no necessity to go to the Court. with It is only when they have made offers to I fear each'other and have failed to agree that not they go to the Court and ask the Judge to split their differences for them, or to settle the case in any way he chooses. If they make fresh minimum offers to the Court, it will simply be doing. what the honourable member has been deprecating-splittin g the differences themselves prior to their being argued in Court. But to my mind the Conciliation Court will unmistakably tend to promote good feeling as between the combatants. That is my experience of conciliation. It is different from arbitration. It often happens, as a result of splitting the difference and coming to an agreement around a table, that a good feeling is brought about between the parties. I fear that under a proposal of this kind good feeling would not be the result. Rather I should imagine that the party whose claim has not been accepted would leave the Court with a very bitter taste in its mouth. I do not think that in this respect the proposal of the honourable member has much to commend it. In view of the fact that we are setting up a Conciliation Court, I do not think that what he proposes (would be any better than the Court proposed to be set up.",33
149,Mr G,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,B. EDWARDS - Can the able member show me anv provisions for conciliation in this Bill?,34
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is the intention of the Bill, although it may have been carried out clumsily. The intention is to preserve and promote good feeling between the combatants. The very process of splitting the difference settles a great many more strikes than it provokes, and it does more than anything else I can think of at the moment to promote that good feeling which we all desire to see between employer and employ^. On the whole, therefore, I think we had better stick to the proposal of the Bill , which leaves the matter to the discretion of the Court, and allows the President to step between the combatants and to reach the point of justice, no matter how difficult it may be.",34
151,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,My clause also leaves it to the discretion of the Court. I trust the Court fully.,34
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Onl y in cases where special reasons appear. cases would not be within the discretion of the Court. I have no doubt that the Judge would often, in any case in which he desired to step in, find special reasons. It is an easy matter to say that certain reasons are special. But that phrase itself is very vague, as applied to industrial disputes. What does the honourable member' mean by "" special reasons "" ?",34
153,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I can show the honourable member much more vague expressions in othelr parts of the Bill. What, for instance, is a "" substantial majority "" ?.",34
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not carping at the honourable member's drafting. Personally, I cannot see what special reasons he is alluding to. I fancy the honourable member had something in his mind when he was drafting this proposal.' But I fear that it would lead to the protracting of cases, and to more! strenuous and bitter argument, while it would not be provocative of that good feeling which the Bill . aims at promoting.",34
155,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The Government have a great deal of sympathy with the object of the honourable member for South Sydney. His idea is, of course, that each side should be induced to state the minimum of what it wants, and not the maximum, which it hopes it might squeeze out of the Court. That is an object which it is always desirhonorable to attain in connection with litigation of any kind. But I am afraid that the amendment might, if adopted, lead to results that the honourable member himself does not contemplate. I listened with a great deal of interest to the illustrations which he gave of the .application of similar proposals. But I was not in the Chamber during the whole of his speech, and I do-not know whether he quoted the case of the wise 'old man who had two sons, to whom he left his property. He directed that the elder son should divide the property, but that the younger son should' have the first choice. He made that direction with a view of having the property divided as equally as possible. The instances which the honourable member gave are more in the nature of analogies than of parallel cases. In the first place, I should like to point out to him that the Arbitration Court is called into existence not merely to do what an ordinary Court does-that is, to settle a dispute arising between two parties, in which the rest of the public are at most Ordinary very remotely concerned. It is called into existence to consult as far as possible the interests of the public as well as the interests of the parties to the dispute. It is more in the public interest-or , at any rate, as much in the public interest-as in the interest of the parties, that it has been thought desirable to create Conciliation and Arbitration Courts. In the second place, I do not think that this proposal would meet the objections raised by the honourable and learned member for Indi, where one side makes a claim in which it thinks that it is absolutely right-and possibly may be almost absolutely right-and consequently cannot see its way to make any concession whatever.",34
156,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then it stands its rights.,35
157,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that is not exactly the idea that is conveyed by the honourable member's amendment. I also think that proposal of this kind might possibly lead to what I may call experimental disputes. A dispute would be raised with' a view each side getting a knowledge of what the other side desired.,35
158,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Are we going to avoid that under the Bill, as it stands ?",35
159,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that should encourage it . Possibly we have a great many disputes specially raised for settlement by the Court. ,35
160,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is harping back a matter about which we have had a great deal of discussion. I venture to say that B i ll will be operative, in spite of the of some honourable members. I am sorry to hear the honourable member take up such an attitude. I do not think that any party in a great public matter of this kindnot mean necessarily a party in politicshas a rig'ht to say that it is going to legislation ineffective because there happens the cause that we all have at heart. to be some one thing introduced into which that party does not like. That seems to me to be a very unwise proceeding.  objectionable things in this Bill. There too much lawyer in it, for instance.",35

162,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that the honourable member for Grey will admit that his interthe creation pf a special Court. jections are not quite relevant to the clause under discussion.  what the Minister was just saying. ' Mr MCCAY - Has the honourable memthese ber quite finished? ,35
163,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then , I am exceedingly sorry, because I have refrained from swering his two or three interjections, in_ the hope that I might thereby pacify his perturbed spirit. I would point out to the honourable member for South Sydney, in regard to the quotation which he made from the report of the Royal Commission on Strikes, relating to conciliation, that his on amendment after all is not very relevant to this particular proposal, in that so far as I can see the Bill introduces conciliation rather than arbitration. a Human nature being what it is, and not what it ought to be, I am afraid that this may not so conduce, and I agree with the of honourable member for Parramatta that, if each side is compelled to name its minimum, and knows that unless its minimum is accepted, that of the' other side must, practically speaking, under this clause, be accepted, they will fight it out to the bitter we end. Once each party has named what it may regards as a proper minimum, there will be no hope of a compromise, and the parties will fight to win all for fear of losing all. That does not, I think, encourage the to spirit of compromise. I would point out to the honourable member for South Sydney, the that this whole Bill is in one sense, novel, fears that, at any rate, no such. Courts as are here proposed are of any long standing, and that if in addition to the new Coiftt dealing with new subjects, we provide new I do methods of settling disputes, we may introduce too many experiments, and make consequently, injure, rather than help I it would, therefore, ask the honourable member to be content with having brought this matter under the notice of the Committee. of I may mention that the Government did is try to see its way to accept the whole, or a portion of the new clause; but in view of the novelty of the proposal, and the objections to its adoption, we could not Mr RONALD Southern Melbourne) - I sincerely hope that the Government will I think that the honourable member for South Sydney has made out a good case for This is called a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , and it seems to me that it makes a great deal of provision for arbitration and very little for conciliation. The constitution of Courts provides for a preliminary inquiry into the question as to whether there is a case or not. In my own country there is an official called the Procurator Fiscal, who anholds an investigation, and says whether there is a case or not, and that function which is of very great value in Scotland has its parallel in France in the court which has been quoted by my honourable friend, and which serves a very great and useful purpose. It saves endless litigation, and, above all, brings in that principle of master and men meeting face to face and comparing their grievances, and thereby attempting to come to a just settlement. Moreover, the principle exists under the Factories Act of Victoria, in the shape of Wages Boards. believe it will be found that if the men and masters come together and state their case to one another, they will see that very little litigation is required, and that the arbitration stage-a n expensive one to both sides-nee d not be reached. Mr FKAZER.'-That is not the experience of such Courts.",35
164,Mr RONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have been quoting instances to show that it has been.,36
165,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is not our experience in Western Australia, anyhow.",36
166,Mr RONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In Victoria the great value of the Factories Act lies in the fact that it has brought the men and masters face to; face before the Wages Boards. The principle of conciliation is at work. The minimum of demand on each side is made, and when the men see that the masters are reasonable, and the masters see that the men are rational, the dispute is half settled. But if an appeal can be made to the Court, and the lawyers are allowed to state the case from their point of view, they will prolong the dispute, and the result will be disastrous. I am always in favour of exhausting the lay element, which is common-sense, before we reach the technical and intricate element. I hope that reasonable men will look upon this proposal as a very useful supplement to a Bill which may be licked into shape and ""made of some use in settling those disputes which we all profess to be so anxious'to settle. Proposed new clause negatived. Bill reported with further amendments.",36
167,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," There are two comparatively unimportant amendments which I forgot to move in clause 4, and I ask the House to allow me to go back into Committee in order to make them. I move That the Bill be recommitted for the reconthere sideration of clause 4. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Commitiee (Second recommittal).

NA RAILWAY SURVEY BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message resumed from 9th June, vide page 2243), on motion by Mr. BATCHELORThat it is expedient that an appropriation of moneys be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to authorize the survey of a route for a railway to connect Kalgoorlie, in the State of Western Australia, with Port Augusta, in the State of South Australia.",36
170,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA," I do not desire to weary the Committee with any long argument in favour of the motion. The project for the construction of this railway has already been discussed, and will be further opportunities for discussion when the Bill is brought In. ' I shall only say that the proposal has found' favour, not merely with the last Administration, but also with its immediate predecessor, and the present Administration see that the duty of bringing it forward is imposed upon them. I am sure that honourable members will all recollect that at an early stage of the Federal movement an opinion was current that Western Aastralia was not likely to enter into the proposed union of the Colonies.",36
171,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why was this proposal not put into the Constitution?,37
172,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am coming to that point. We were quite prepared to believe that if Western Australia did come into the Union she would put forward certain conditions in return for certhen tain disadvantages which it must be admitted she would suffer. One of these conditions-the permission to impose her own on a gradually decreasing scalewas embodied in the Constitution.,37
173,Mr R EDWARDS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Was .the construction of the railway made a condition?,37
174,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And the question of constructing this railway was also raised.,37
175,Mr R EDWARDS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was not a condition.,37
176,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am going to state the case exactly as I know it from making inquiries.  for in the Constitution.,37
177,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware of that. That question was raised, and whilst it was not agreed to, consideration was promised, after due inquiry, by at least some of the Premiers, and more especially by some of the Ministers in South Australia, to this request from Western Australia.",37
178,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the Minister mean the Premier of Victoria?,37
179,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I mean some of the Premiers who attended the conference at which the question of the Transcontinental Railway was discussed. the Prime Minister-wh o was a party to that gathering-ha s already stated, whilst no agreement was arrived at that .the line should be constructed, consideration was promised to the project, and to that extent the expectations of the people of Western Australia were raised.. Further than that, certain correspondence took place between the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia upon which I do not intend to enlarge. That correspondence went much further than did the members of the Premiers' Conference, in the direction of attempting to connect Western Australia and the eastern States by rail, and it also gave rise to legitimate expectations, on the part of the people of Western Australia, that this matter would receive earnest consideration. That is the situation as I find it. I approached this question with a mind entirely unbiased. Upon one occasion, it is - true, I did attempt to check discussion upon this, proposal, but I stated my reasons for doing so. I said laterI took objection to this measure at a similar stage on a previous occasion, but for the sole reason that I considered that, owing to the important business-practicall y a vote of censurebefore Parliament, it was not proper to interpose the motion. To-riight, when I was questioned as to my attitude, I stated that I would make no objection to the motion being a tariff of passed as formal. I took no objection whatever to the proposal as such. What I did object to was that it should be interposed when there was practically a motion of censure before Parliament.",37
180,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does not a very similar position of affairs exist at the present time ?,37
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not that I am aware of. I have not yet observed any motion of censure.,37
182,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is coming all right.  any instance in which the other States have contributed towards the building or the survey of a railway in New South Wales or Queensland ?,37
183,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not aware that they have been asked to do so.  pecunious as is Western Australia.,37
184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not a question of impecuniosity. We know that in Western Australia very considerable discontent exists owing to the non-fulfilment of what was regarded as a promise that the proposal to construct the Transcontinental Railway would receive As earnest inquiry and examination. That discontent, if illegitimate, it might be our duty to ignore, although it would be very unfortunate if any substantial sense of injustice were allowed to exist in any of the States when we had the power to remove it. In view of what has taken place, and realizing what has led to the anticipations of Western Australia, I say that if we refuse to expend one penny in inquiring whether this important railway connection should take place, we shall be justifying that discontent, and each representative of that State will have fullest warrant for supporting the indignamatter. tion of its people.",37
185,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What will the surpressed vey cost?,38
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The exis penditure in this connection is limited to £20,000. If the line be constructed, understand that Western Australia is willfavour ing to pay her portion of any loss upon - that 'is, upon its own length. But thestand-point people of that State claim that the underof standing under which they joined the Federation was that the Federal authorinot ties would inquire into the! feasibility, payability, and the desirability or otherwise of constructing that railway.",38
187,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the line be owned by the Commonwealth Government?,38
188,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If it were this constructed by the! Federation, undoubtedly it would. But I would point out to honorNevertheless,' able members that at the present'.stage the question of construction is not under contion sideration. The whole point involved is, ""Do we think that Western Australia has such a legitimate case for inquiry that the Federal Government, which would own the line, if constructed, should expend a sum in making that inquiry?""",38
189,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then the ,£20,000 is really to be spent upon an inquiry ?",38
190,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; by adopting this resolution, Parliament will not be committed to the construction of line in any way.",38
191,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Who has to pay the £20,000?",38
192,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Commonwealth Government.,38

194,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What is the use of urging that the survey cannot partake of the nature of an inquiry, because an expenditure is involved? Perhaps the portion ? honourable and learned member for Parkes has not read the terms of the resolution. do think that a sufficient case has been is liable. made out by the people of Western Austramember lia to warrant an examination being made into the cost of the proposed railway the route it should take, if constructed. the resolution be adopted, Parliament will tion. still retain the power to sanction the work or otherwise, according to what, on the information gained, honourable deem themselves justified in doing. I the do not intend to enlarge upon the I will only add that the justice of the claim of Western Australia 'has imitself upon three Administrations. Surely that is some indication that there reason for the request which is made by that State. I can quite believe that at I a later stage reasons may be advanced in of the construction of the railwayit such, for example, as its value from the of defence, and the desirability having an approach to that important part of Australia by a means which could be interfered with ""By any Power, which the might be at war with Great Britain, placing fleets upon our coast. There are other reasons which might be urged in its favour - man y reasons. But I quite admit that, despite all those reasons, we may find, after survey 'has been made, that it is not desirable to construct the proposed railway. I ask the Committee to give to Western Australia at least that considerawhich is now asked, and to sanction a limited expenditure, so that we may know what the construction of the railway will involve, and so that we may be in a better position at a future date to decide whether limited that portion of the continent should be connected with the more thickly populated, and more favourably situated, eastern shore-line of the Commonwealth.",38
195,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Do the Government propose to ask Western Australia to contrithe bute anything towards this expenditure of £20,000?",38
196,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wester n Australia will contribute.,38

199,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do the Ministry intend to ask Western Australia to contribute members more than her proportion ?,38
200,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would it be fair to ask Western Australia to contribute to a proposal which may condemn the line?,39
201,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The proposal to construct the railway, I would remind the honourable and learned member for Parkes, is not now before the Committee. The matter immediately under consideration is a proposal to expend £ 2 0 , 0 upon a survey of the line. That money will be allocated under the provisions of the Constitution just as other expenditure is allocated. If we consider that the claim of Western Australia is altogether baseless, that she has no title to consideration in this matter, that she should never have put forward her proposal, and that no encouragement should have been given to it before she joined the Union, we might put it on one side, and we could then deal with the question entirely from the stand-point <;f the desirability or otherwise of constructing the proposed railway. But I think that the western State 'has established, at any rate, a good case for inquiry, and as the Commonwealth Government, and not the States, will own the railway, if it.be eventually constructed-becaus e the, undertaking affects not only Western Australia, but also South Australia and the eastern States we should at least elicit the facts nerissary to enable us to decide whether the work should be undertaken or not. I therefore commend the proposal to the consHerjtion of honourable members.",39
202,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA," I intend to support the proposal of the Government, though I do not wish it to be understood that, because I.shall vote for a survey of the proposed Transcontinental Railway, I shall, therefore, if I am in Parliament when subsequent action is taken in regard to it , consider myself committed to vote for the construction of the line. I am endeavouring to keep an absolutely open mind in respect to the main question involved in the project we now have before us. not look with indifference upon the proposal to connect by rail the extreme western State of the Commonwealth with the more thickly populated eastern States. Such a connection must eventually be of immense importance to Australia.",39
203,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It must come.sooner or later.,39
204,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The later the better.,39
205,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It must come some day. TO mymind, it is important; for commercial as well as - for strategic reasons, that there should some day be this connection; but whether, with our comparatively small population, we are at present justified in expending between £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £5,000,000 upon the work, depends altogether upon the probability of its returning, within a reasonable time, at 'east a fair proportion of the inte0 0 rest on the cost and the working expenses of the railway. The evidence we have on the subject so far is somewhat meagre. Optimistic statements have been made by the representatives of Western Australia as to the possibilities of the line, and I am sure we all sympathize with their patriotism, but there is comparatively little evidence upon which an unbiased observer can form an accurate opinion of its prospects. I have seen the reports of the engineer who made a flying survey of the route as to the character of the country passed through, and they have rather surprised me. He admitted that the opportunities for the conservation of water, which are so necessary to make the country reproductive, are not apparent; but he seemed to have the firmest opinion that the land would, in a large measure, eventually prove profitable for pastoral settlement. The question of water supply would be an immediately pressing one, if the railway were constructed, but we have recently had rather encouraging reports as to the possibility of obtaining artesian water within the areas that would be traversed by the line. We have, therefore,, I think, sufficient evidence to justify us in expending the comparatively small sum asked for in obtaining a proper survey of t/he proposed route. I take it that that survey will not be an investigation merely of the country within, say, a few hundred yards on each' side of the direct route, from a point at the head of Spencer's Gulf to Kalgoorlie, but that cross-sections will be made to determine the nature of the country north and south of the proposed line. If that is done, we shall 'have a more comprehensive idea One can- of the character of the country that will be served than can be obtained from a mere flying survey of the direct route. In regard to the question asked of the Minister of Home Affairs by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, I may say that', imme* diately on assuming office, some months ago, I entered into' communication with the then Premier of Western Australia, Mr. James, to ascertain whether his Government would guarantee to bear a larger share ol ; any loss that might accrue from the construction and working of the proposed railway than would have to be borne by the State in proportion to .its population, and, after a number of communications had passed between us, some of which have been laid-upon the table of the House, he stated that he was prepared to promise, on behalf of his Government, a liberal contribution over and above what t'he State would have to pay on a population basis towards meeting any loss which might accrue during the first ten years after the line was constructed.",39
206,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Was anything said about the increment in value which would be given to the land along the route of the line?,40
207,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; but seeing that it is State-owned land,40
208,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And seeing, moreover, that the State is not to pay for the railway 1",40
209,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At any rate, private individuals will not obtain the benefit of the added value given to the land by the expenditure of the Commonwealth.",40
210,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As the State owns the land through which the line would pass, the interjection of the honourable member for Moira adds force to the contention that Western Australia may be expected to make a special contribution towards meeting any possible loss; and the Premier of that State met my suggestion in a most liberal spirit.",40
211,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Hi s promise was a rather vague one.,40
212,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He very properly pointed out in the correspondence that, as it is not known what the railway would cost, and as it is impossible to make any proper estimate of its cost until a survey has been undertaken, it is rather premature to state definitely what contribution the State would make; but I regarded his offer as one made in the most generous spirit, and I am given to understand that the present Government of the State is willing to carry out the dertaking arrived at between us.",40
213,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The point I wish to emphasize is that the Federal expenditure will increase the value of State land.,40
214,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is so with all Federal expenditure. Even the erection by the Commonwealth of a post-office increases the value of the adjacent State land.,40
215,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have always been a believer in the idea that persons through whose land a railway is made, should give to the State some guarantee against loss on its construction and working, and, when a member of the New South Wales Parliament, 1 was one of those who moved to get the principle adopted in connection with some of the railways constructed by the State of recent years. What I speak of is not a betterment tax, as the term is ordinarily understood, but a guarantee against loss to the authority constructing the railway. The principle was adopted years ago in the Irish Light Railways Act, and has been found to work most satisfactorily ever since - the land-owners guaranteeing to the constructing authority, whether it be the State or a private company, a certain proportion of any loss that might accrue from the construction of a line.",40
216,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,More than half of the proposed railway will be in South Australia.,40
217,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was successful in getting the principle I speak of incorporated in some of the measures passed by the New South Wales Parliament of late years sanctioning railway construction, and the result encouraged me to ask of the Premier of Western Australia the question to which I have referred-Whe ther his State would be prepared to bear a proportion of the loss, if any, which might accrue in connection with the construction of the line? As I have said, I was met in a most generous spirit.",40
218,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did the honourable member ask the same question of the Premier of South Australia?,40
219,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; but I asked the Premier of South Australia if he would be prepared to ask the State Parliament to pass a Bill to sanction the construction of the line.,40
220,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why did not the honourable member ask the same question of both Premiers ?,40
221,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In arrangements beun- tween Governments, just as in business arrangements, it is well to proceed step by step, and the first step to take was to get the Government of South Australia to consent to ask the Parliament of the State to sanction the construction of the line through its territory. Up to the present time the South Australian Parliament has not given that sanction; but, under the Constitution, it must be given before the railway can be constructed by the Commonwealth.",40
222,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,South Australia has agreed to the survey being made.,40
223,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government of the State when in communication with me raised no objection whatever to the survey being made, but they refused to commit themselves on the main question as to whether they would or would not ask the Parliament of South Australia to sanction the construction of the line.",41
224,Mr EWING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member regards the motion merely as one to provide for an investigation. It does not bind him in any way.,41
225,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite , so. already said that. I hold myself free, if the evidence seems to warrant such action, to vote against the proposal to construct the line if it is ever brought forward, and I happen to be here at the time.",41
226,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The question is whether the investigation should not be undertaken at the expense of the people who would chiefly benefit.,41
227,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The whole Commonwealth would benefit.,41
228,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The question asked by the honourable and learned member for Parkes is a matter for argument. not one upon which one can dogmatize. There is more reason why the Commonwealth should take some share of responsibility in connection with this proposal than would apply to any other railway proposal that might come before us, since it is one which has in view the giving of communication to a State which is widely separated .from the other States.",41
229,Mr EWING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member think that there was a tacit understanding on this matter ?,41
230,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not attach very much importance to the promises or semipromises made on the subject by those who at the time had no authority to speak for Australia. The people of Western Australia may have been led into looking upon Federation more favourably because of the statements of certain leading politicians of the other States than they would otherwise have done.,41
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is no doubt about that.,41
232,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Stil l that fact does not bind the people of Australia as a whole, though it should bind those who made the promises to exercise their influence and to give their votes for the construction of the line.",41
233,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,- Why should not the Commonwealth also build a bridge to Tasmania ?,41
234,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The suggestion has been made that the Commonwealth should subsidize a line of steamers between the mainland and Tasmania.,41
235,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member for Newcastle would furnish .designs for a bridge which could be constructed at a reasonable cost, I , for one, should be prepared to consider the matter. I am glad that the Government have seen fit to introduce this Bill at an early stage, and I shall support the proposal it contains. I have Mr Bruce SMITH (Parkes) - I ""oo not think that there is any necessity to emphasize the proposition that, although the Committee may agree to this motion, no honourable, member will in any way be bound to subsequently vote for the construction of the proposed railway. There is no need to look so far ahead as that in any criticism of the proposal now before us. I think that this is a very serious matter, and although I have every desire to assist the Government in their legislation, the explanation, which we have had does not seem to me to recognise the seriousness of It is so novel a proposal.",41
236,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not a novel proposal, because it"" has been before two Governments.",41
237,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Althoug h a comparatively small expenditure is involved, the principle at issue is a very large one. The Commonwealth is, for the first time, being asked to undertake the first stage in the construction of a railway primarily for the benefit of one State, and we should therefore consider what principle is to be observed in these matters. The Minister, in explaining the proposal to the House, said that we must remember that the railway would ultimately belong to the Commonwealth. Now, in the history of railway construction in Australia, the consolation of Governments which have constructed railways which gave no immediate return has been that they are increasing the value of their landed estate. I admit that the sum now asked for is a comparatively small one. Mr HUM E COOK - What is to be the cost of the proposed survey?",41
238,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"£20,000 .",41
239,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The 1 amount is not mentioned in the motion.,41
240,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , but I understand that that is to be the maximum ex| penditure.",41
241,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is sum provided for in the Bill .,42
242,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Althoug h the sum provided for is comparatively small, we are now being asked to take a preliminary step which involves a very great principle. We are being asked to construct a railway at the expense of the Commonwealth, while the whole of the increment in value which it will give to the land through which it passes will go, not to the Commonwealth, but to a State.",42
243,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That will always be the case when the Commonyou wealth constructs a railway.,42
244,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but as this is the first instance in which we have asked to sanction such a railway, mittee should consider very carefully the precedent which' we are establishing.",42
245,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Do we not establish that principle every time we build a post-office Mr Bruce "" SMITH - No ; because the principle was established when we built tins our first post-office. The honourable memin ber is a most enthusiastic supporter of this project, and naturally so, not only in its preliminary, but in its ultimate, stages, I wish him to recognise that an important principle is involved in the proposal before us. I do not wish to single myself out as an opponent of it, but, years ago, when Federation was being advocated, I the opposed the idea of the Commonwealth coninterest structing this railway at an expenditure many millions of money.",42
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This railway?,42
247,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,42
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It was never promonwealth posed before.,42
249,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was mentioned we at the Federal Conventions, Federal campaign, the representatives of Western Australia contended that ultimately that State must be connected with the eastern railway systems, in order it might be brought into close union the State in which the Capital was to be established.",42
250,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And reasonably so, too.",42
251,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The right honam orable gentleman can advance that view cause when he addresses the House. The that previous Governments have been favour of making the proposed survey afpockets fords no argument why the work should be undertaken by the present Government. the Sir JOHN FORREST - At all events, it is an evidence of unanimity on the part ot those who have been in power.",42
252,Mr BRUC ESMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It shows that we are entitled to expect the Government to call upon the people who are going to be so largely benefited by the construction of the line to contribute to the initial cost. Surely it is fair to say to the people of Western Australia- "" We are perfectly willing to embark upon a preliminary survey, with a view to the ultimate construction of this line if , in view of the fact that are to be specially benefited, you will contribute something more than your pro rata or per capita share towards the cost."" been The Government might very well say to the Comthe people of Western Australia",42
253,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And also to the people of South Australia.,42
254,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , and also to ? the people of South Australia- "" In the report furnished by certain engineers upon line, it is represented that it is likely ten years to produce very satisfactory results, and, inasmuch as these results cannot be produced until this preliminary exand penditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is incurred, you should contribute more than your share per now capita."" It might be very fairly said"" This railway will primarily benefit you both, by establishing a trade so large that profit resulting from it will defray the upon the large capital outlay inof volved, and by enormously increasing the value of your territories, and, therefore, we shall expect you, in the first place, at all events, to find the money to defray the cost of the preliminary survey. If the Comshould ultimately decide to construct the line as a Commonwealth property, shall return you the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 expended and, during the upon the survey.""",42
255,Mr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A very good suggestion.,42
256,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not expect that honourable members representing Western with Australia to sympathize with my attitude upon this question. It is very natural that they should desire to have the work carried out in the interests of their State. I wish them to accept my assurance that I taking up my present position only beI think that it is fair and equitable to fact the other States that the expenditure inin volved should come primarily out of the of the two States to be specially benefited, even though it may ultimately be recouped by the Commonwealth.",42
257,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable and learned member apply the same principle to the expenditure upon the Federal Capital ?,43
258,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should be very sorry if any representative of Western Australia were to think that I offer my criticism in any spirit of Inter-State rivalry. I have all along been disposed-if I have not actually manifested that disposition-to deprecate the practice of constantly setting up State against State, arid it is because I endeavour to look at this question in its preliminary stage from the Commonwealth point of view, that I should have liked to see some principle laid down by the Government to justify the proposed expenditure without first making a strong demand upon the two States which are to be specially benefited to contribute the money in the first place.",43
259,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We all have to contribute towards the expenditure upon the of a project. Federal Capital, which is to be located in the New South Wales territory.",43
260,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should like the Committee to consider this proposal in light of a precedent. It will be said and-by that the precedent does not depend upon the proposed work being a railway, but upon its being a public work; and I can quite foresee that in the attempts might be made to place more enterprises of this kind upon the shoulders the Commonwealth, on the ground that Mr. Western Australia was receiving this tage. As I pointed out, the two chief vantages, if not the only ones that are likely to result from the construction of the line, apart from the fact that it will bring the western State into closer union with the ten years. eastern States, will be the establishment commercial traffic between Western Auscial undertaking. tralia and the eastern States, and the great ture. increment in value of territory which will accrue to Western Australia and South tralia. At the present time this Committee i's very ill-informed as to the character of the country through which the line is pass.",43
261,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We admit that.,43
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have read the report of the committee of engineers who were appointed to inquire into this matter, and I say that, although a flying survey a work which is peculiarly within the proin vince of an engineer, a member of that fession is one of the last men in the world to be considered qualified to estimate commercial results of a proposed railway. I had the honour of being the Minister for railway construction during the three years that I occupied the position of Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, and I know very well that one never thought of asking the engineers who made the flying survey in connection with a new line to express their opinions upon its commercial prospects. All the engineers were asked to do was, in the course of their professional business, to make their flying or their ultimate survey, as the case might be, and the Railway Commissioners were called upon to report upon the commercial prospects of the line. It is provided in the Public Works Act of New South Wales that no proposals shall be submitted to the Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation until the Railway Commissioners have added to the information supplied by the engineers, by reporting upon the commercial prospects Of course, this may be considered a mere side issue here, but it is important that we should recollect that the Committee is not at the present time in a position to form any clear conception with the regard to the character of the country bythrough which the railway will pass.",43
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Qh , yes; we have the reports furnished by the surveyors who future travelled over the proposed route.",43
264,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have read most of carefully the reports of the engineers. Henry Deane, Engineer-in-Chief advanin New South Wales, travelled over ada portion of the route, and he was one of the engineers' who made the estimate of the probable cost, and stated that the line was likely to produce satisfactory results in I am not, for a moment, atof tempting to criticise the line as a commerThat would be premaBut the fact that we are not committing ourselves to the construction of the Ausline affords no reason why we should in silence, and without full consideration, pass a proposal-the first of its kind in the Comto monwealth-to spend £ 2 0 , 0 00 upon the survey of a line which is to benefit primarily two States which are not being asked to contribute one copper, beyond their - per capita proportion, towards the expenditure. That is my point, and I contend that my is position is a sound one. I am not speaking any spirit of antagonism to Western Ausprotralia, because no one would be more pleased than I should be if the commercial the prospects were such as to justify the construction of the line. I think that it is one of the most unfortunate circumstances in connection with the Commonwealth that the centres of population are so wide apart that it is almost impossible for men who do not give .up the whole of their time to political work ' to attend Parliament, and take part in its deliberations. I should be one of the first to rejoice if the commercial prospects could be shown to justify the construction of the line. I would most strongly impress upon the Committee that it is only fair that we should ask the Government for an assurance that all the necessary steps have been taken to obtain from the which are likely to be primarily benefited by the construction of the line, some substantial contribution towards the proposed expenditure ",43
265,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is hopeless to expect South Australia to make any special contribution.,44
266,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know that. I can hardly conclude that it is hopeless to make such a request, even in the case of South Australia, because we know that some hundreds of miles of the present South Australian railways would be upon the route of the proposed transcontinental line. The traffic upon the Port Augusta railway at present is limited, and every one must recognise that if a through line were ultimately constructed, and a large trade such as would be necessary to justify the proposed work became an accomplished fact, South Australia would benefit very largely from the increased over her existing line. Therefore, it ought to be very easy to demonstrate, not only to the Western Australian Government, but also to the South Australian Government, that a very great future would be in store for them. It would surely be reasonable for us to say, "" We are perfectly willing to take this preliminary step, but we are not going to do it at the expense of the Commonwealth if the project should not be undertaken. If you, between you, will contribute this comparatively small sum-because it is a comparatively small sum-w e shall undertake",44
267,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the States wished to incur the expense of the survey, they need not ask the consent of the Commonwealth.",44
268,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not the fact that there is no movement for the construction of the proposed railway in those States a very strong argument against the present proposal r,44
269,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is a movement in Western Australia.,44
270,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then lef the movement go on !,44
271,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We . can do nothing except with the consent of the South Australian Parliament.,44
272,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On e honourable member for Western Australia says there is a movement in that State in favour of the construction of the railway, but when I turn to the right honourable member for S'wan, who has infinitely greater experience, he says, "" We can do nothing without South Australia."" States",44
273,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No r can we, because the proposed line would pass through 550 miles of South Australian territory.",44
274,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am perfectly well aware of that. That is my reason for pointing out that the Government might well have approached these two States, and have asked them to contribute a large part, if not all, of this expenditure of .£20,000, subject to one condition. If the line be ultimately constructed, it will undoubtedly be Commonwealth property, although if the sanguine accounts we hear about the land are true, it will add enormously to the increment of Western Australian State property. The Prime Minister is now present, and I would submit to him that the Commonwealth should have approached the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia, and have said, "" We are perfectly willing to emtraffic bark upon this preliminary survey",44
275,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The two States could embark on it, even if we were not vvilling.",44
276,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I would answer that interjection by asking why they do not embark upon it? If Western Australia and South Australia are going to benefit to the extent to which my right honourable friendsays they will by the construction of this line,44
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have not said anything.,44
278,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have heard my right honourable friend speak of the merchandise. which is to be carried over the line, and of the passengers who will be in such a hurry to reach the eastern States, that they will leave the comfortable and snug decks of a Pacific and Oriental or Orient steamer for a three days' railway journey across a stretch of country",44
279,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Was the honourable and learned member ever in a storm?,45
280,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In many, both political and natural. It would have been a very fair thing, from a business point of view, had the Commonwealth Government saicl to the two States concerned, "" This is a scheme which, if it results in the construction of the line, will enormously benefit you. The preliminary survey will involve an expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0. We are perfectly willing to embark on this survey, provided that you will pay the cost, on the understanding that if the railway be ultimately constructed, and become Commonwealth property, we will recoup you in respect of it.""",45
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A tremendous expenditure ! The honourable and learned member has such small ideas.,45
282,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have impatience manifested in front of me, and behind me. I need only an exhibition of it on either side, to allow of my pointing out my position by paraphrasing a well-known poem. What I . am endeavouring to do in the midst of these frequent interruptions, is to consider this matter from a business point of view. We are bound to' have regard to that consideration in dealing with the finances of the Commonwealth. We should say to the two States concerned, "" This undertaking may result ultimately in the construction of the line; the railway will be of enormous benefit to you in view of the increment in the value of the land which will take place on both sides of it . "" It might be said to South Australia, "" It will put you into much closer touch with Europe,"" and to Western Australia, "" It will put you into much closer touch with the eastern States. We are perfectly willing to take this preliminary step, provided that you bear the expenditure in the first place, on the understanding that if the line be ultimately constructed, and owned by the Commonwealth, it will recoup you in respect of this outlay, as being part of the total cost of the scheme. If , on the other hand, the survev results in demonstrating the practical impossibility of making this line, by reason of ""its great cost, as compared with its commercial prospects, we shall expect you to bear this cost."" think that is a very fair - proposal. The late Prime Minister us that he approached the Premiers of Western Australia, and South Australia with regard to the ultimate cost. He seems very satisfied-althoug h I confess that I should not have been, had I occupied his position-wit h the promise of generous treatment which he received.",45
283,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was in regard to the loss on the line.,45
284,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The leader of the Opposition said that he had received promises of the most generous treatment from the Premiers of the two States.,45
285,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; from the Premier of one State.,45
286,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Fro m the Premier of Western Austialia; they are a prodigal lot over there.,45
287,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Le t me argue the matter from the point of view that he received the most generous offer from the Premier of one State. That generous offei however, was of a very vague, non-committal character. It was simply this.: "" If the line is ultimately carried out, we shall be prepared to enter into some liberal arrangement with regard to the loss upon its maintenance."" That is just about as definite as the promise which a Minister has frequently to make to deputations that he will give the subject-matter of their request ""carefu l consideration."" I have made that promise hundreds of times, and know very well that it left me just as free as I was before I made it. This reliance on the generous offer of the Premier of Western' Australia to contribute a fair share to the loss which may occur when the line is open to traffic, seems to me very much like shutting the stable door after the. steed is stolen.",45
288,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Western Australian Government offered to contribute the loss on their own length of line. - Mr Mahon - For the first ten vears.,45
289,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That loss could not be ascertained until the line had been constructed, and it would be too late then to take exception to the degree of generosity which the State Government-and there might be half-a-dozen or a dozen different Governments between now and then-migh t show. I submit that my suggestion is a fair one. I urge, quite irrespective of the Government proposal, that it would be reasonable for the Commonwealth Government to say to the people of Western AusI tralia-""We should like to discount your generosity of ten years hence; we should has told like a little cash. We should like you to join with South Australia in bearing the cost of this preliminary survey, and if the I line ultimately becomes ours, inasmuch as this is a necessary preliminary expenditure - ver y much like an architect's fees for the plans for the construction of a house-w e will take it off your hands, and recoup you for what you have done."" We are creating a precedent with regard to the construction of a new kind of public works in the States-work s which ultimate admittedly in an increment of wealth to the State in which they are constructed. The circumstances of a proposal of this kind are unique. The Commonwealth is asked to expend money that will add largely to the wealth of Western Australia, and we shall be perfectly justified, therefore, in approaching the Governments of the two States in the way I have suggested.",45
290,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,South Australia would say that she would not do anything the kind.,46
291,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then she would show her want of bona fides in the matter.,46
292,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Sh e has alreadv done that.,46
293,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the Western Australian Government said, "" We are not arc. prepared to pay .anything beyond our capita contribution on the Commonwealth promise ? expenditure,"" they would also show a want of bona fides. I think that this is a fair test. The right honourable member for Swan, who has been accustomed to throw hundreds of thousands of pounds about 'in connection with water schemes and other works, should now realise the enormous portance which attaches to the construction of the proposed railway. I offer my combecause ments not in any spirit of antagonism, but in the belief that the people of the Comfirst monwealth are entitled to have this matter considered from a more business-like point of view. The hands of the Governmentthe would be materially strengthened if they were able to tell the House that they had approached the Government of Western Australia, and either that they had refused absolutely to contribute a penny to the or that fchey had undertaken to pay the whole cost in the first case. If the Western Australian Government refused absolutely contribute to the-cost, I believe it would lead this House to say that it showed their of confidence in the proposal; because, all, the cost of the preliminary survey, in proportion to the ultimate cost of the struction of the line, is much less than of a mere rough sketch of a proposed buildsaid ing. If I were about to construct a building for some relative, and he said to me, "" I not even pay for the cost of a rough the first stage,"" I should say "" We l l, you take very little interest in the matter, and I think that you are scarcely justified in asking me to put my hand in my own pocket to pay the cost of even a rough sketch for your building.""",46
294,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A fine Federal spirit! Mr BRUC E SMITH - The interruption is of sufficient importance to justify an answer. I hold that I am advocating the true Federal spirit, and I challenge the right honourable member to point to a single instance in which I have ever encouraged in this House any spirit of rivalry between the States. I have endeavoured always to forget the landmarks of the States, and to treat the funds of the Commonwealth as of the funds of the people of all Australia.",46
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable and learned member forgets that the States are now federated.,46
296,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I know that we per - Mr SKENE - What about the implied,46
297,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am deprecatvery ing a proposal on the part of the Government to spend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 on a preliminary survey, without first endeavouring to obtain the money from the States. The expense is to be incurred in carrying out a work imwhich is to ultimately benefit, not the Commonwealth, but the States concerned, it is admitted that we cannot expect any profit from the railway during the ten years of its existence. It would, therefore, be a huge expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth, for the benefit of States. I admit that the desire to join Western Australia with the other States by railway evidences a Federal spirit; but to say that we should look upon this proposal as if it had been provided for in the Concost, stitution-to say, as we have been told, that there was a sort of implied agreement between Western Australia and the other to States-that although the Constitution die] not provide for the construction of the line, want there is an obligation on the part of after the Commonwealth to make it-is , in my opinion, to very materially strain the situa-. contion which exists between the different. that States; and I do submit that what I have to the Committee is by no means inprejudice of that Federal spirit, which will jealously guards the expenditure of the plan at funds of the Commonwealth.",46
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA," I regret that the debate upon this matter should take place in Committee. I have no doubt that the course adopted is in accord with the Standing Orders, but it is not in accord with the practice to which I have been accustomed. Resolutions founded on messages from His Excellency the Governor, with reference to the expenditure of public money have in my experience, generally been agreed to as formal matters, and the debate upon the measure covered by the message has been reserved for the second reading of the Bill dealing with the subject. I thinis lhat is a more convenient practice than that which has been followed on the present occasion, as, under the practice now followed, a long discussion may be. initiated upon the Governor General's message, and there may be another long debate upon the second reading of the measure. I do not know who is responsible for this course of procedure, but I think the motion now before us might have been allowed to pass as a formal matter, and we could have taken the debate on the second reading of the Bill , which would have been at once introduced. The message in this instance covers a recommendation to appropriate funds for carrying out a survey of a railway to connect Eastern and Western Australia. Such a railway has been long talked about, much desired, and, in my opinion, and in the opinion of those who think with me, is absolutely essential' to the real federation of the Australian States. Honourable members are, of course, aware that Eastern Australia is separated from Western. Australia by a large extent of unoccupied country, and that there is no practical means of communication by land between the two except by several months of travel between the settlements on the eastern and those on the western side of the continent. The whole of the traffic, the whole of the .trade between the eastern and western States of Australia, is conducted by and it has been the desire the hope, not only of Western Australians, but of all who take a broad view of the ultimate prospects of the continent that the connection of the eastern and western States by railway should be undertaken. I very much regret that my honourable and learned friend, the member for Parkes- I think I may refer to him as such, because he is my friend personally-shoul d have made the speech 7T he did just now. I have been accustomed to listen with pleasure to the honourable and learned member. There is no member of the House to whom I have listened hitherto with greater pleasure, even when I did not agree with him, than ' the honourable and learned member. But tb-fnight he seems to have wandered away from those broad statesman-like views he has so often uttered, which were not 1 imited by considerations, for any parish, town, or city, and not even by the ocean that surrounds Australia. To-night I could hardly believe that I was listening to the honourable and learned member for Parkes. The views he enunciated seemed to me to be more fitted for the consideration of a matter affecting a small township or parish, and were certainly altogether out of place in dealing with a matter which affects the whole continent of Australia. We are not here dealing with the interests of Western Australia, or any particular State, but with the greater question of the Federation of continental Australia, and with what is embodied in spirit, if not in words, in the Constitution under which we live. I do not suppose that there is any one in Australia, or out of it, who will be found to argue that the Federation we are enjoying at the present time can be considered complete when one-third of the continent, with a quarter of a million of people forming a. very, progressive .State, remains separated from the rest of Australia, without any means of communication except by sea. Any one who takes the trouble tovisit Western Australia will find that the voyage will , occupy him four days, during the greater part of which time he will probably be out of sight of land,- and when he reaches Fremantle I find it difficult to believe that there will be foremost in his mind a feeling that he is still within the boundaries of the Federation he left four days before. He-would rather be inclined to believe that he had reached some island in the Indian Ocean sea, separated altogether from the country he and had left on the eastern side of Australia.",47
299,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How much nearer to Europe is Western Australia than are the eastern States?,47
300,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I say on 'my own belialf, and on behalf of the people of Western Australia, of whom I am one of the representatives in this House, that Federation as at present existing is not the Federation that we understood it would be when we entered into ' the compact of union. I know what were the feelings of the people of Western Australia-n o one should know them better-at the time we entered the Federation. The one belief throughout the length and breadth of that State-a . belief encouraged by the utterances of the public men of Australia, and by the terms of the Constitution, as I shall show before I sit down-wa s that the condition of isolation that existed between Western Australia and the rest of the continent would within a short time-withi n a reasonable number of years-com e to an end. The honourable and learned member for Parkes will probably appreciate my remarks when I say that the existing condition of isolation interferes very much-and to a larger extent than in the case of. any.other State in the Commonwealth-wit h the representation of Western Australia. in the Federal Parliament. It is not every*one, and in fact there are only a few people who are able to leave their homes for several months, and perhaps for a year, in order to attend to parliamentary duties. I have little doubt that, by the time. I return'to my home at the conclusion of this session, I shall have been absent . from it nearly a year, and this will not be the first time that that has occurred. There can therefore be no doubt but that the isolation of Western Australia interferes very largely with the representation of Phe State, because there are very few persons who have the necessary means and leisure to devote the whole of their time to public affairs.",47
301,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the construction of previously ? the Transcontinental Railway practically remedy that difficulty?,48
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It Would renow he is sorry for it. medy it to a very large extent, because a Western Australian representative could back to his State any and'every day, return .any and every day by railway, done by members representing, the other States.",48

306,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Tw o days' travelling, at any rate, but it is not only the saving in the time occupied in travelling, but in the waiting for an opportunity to travel. If we had railway communication we could travel everv day. I say again that the present condition of affairs largely interferes with the representation of Western Australia in this Parliament. We shall never obtain the same representation that may be obtained by the other States of the Commonwealth, because we shall never have the same.number of persons willing to come forward to represent the people of Western 1 Australia, so long as they are without an easy and rapid means pf getting backwards and forwards. If the difficulty were impossible of remedy, if the ocean divided us, and we could not help ourselves, we should have to make the best of it, but seeing that we can remedy the difficulty, I can see no reason why we should not set about it. I make this statement in the face 1 of honourable members,, and of the people of Australia, that, if the people of Western Australia had thought that Federation would mean to them a continuance of the isolation to which they had been subjected'in the past, they would never have thought of entering it. Why should they have entered the Federation if it was not intended to be a real union, a closer union than it had been",48

That was the great lever used by us all in inducing the people of Western Australia to join Federation. The honourable member for Wentworth smiles, but perhaps he does understand the motives that I and ist February, 1900others had in advocating Australian unity.

It was realized that any one who from selfish or motives endeavoured to prevent or retard the true Federation of Australia, in terests of the Empire, was taking a tremendous responsibility. No doubt that ing influenced imany of us in trying our best to set aside, as far as possible, all considerations in order to consummate the Union. What did the right honourable memStates ber for Adelaide, Mr Kingston, who was then Premier of South Australia, write me on the subject of this railway being constructed, and with the sole object of inducing Western Australia to join Federaback to the last. tion ?

321,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In my judgment it is not premature. I want to show that there were inducements held out to Western Australia to enter Federation, and that one of those inducements was that it would not be long before the railway, for the survey of which a sum of money is now asked, would be completed. How can my remarks be said to be irrelevant?",50

In Canada we have the instance of British Columbia, which fused to enter the Union on the original W'ales. terms. It was not until years afterwards that British Columbia undertook the Union, and that was only on condition that the Dominion Parliament should construct a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and run trains daily from end. If the Western people had been less trustful of the got a special Tariff. people of Australia, and had insisted on a similar condition, there the slightest doubt that long ere this a resolution would have been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament asking that ber State to join. We can hardly imagine patriotic Australian believing that the Comthe monwealth would be complete if one-third of the continent were not included. Federalist, I looked closely into the question, with the object of showing that some material gain would accrue to my State from Federation, but, so far as I could see, we had then nothing financially to gain; so far as the pounds, shillings, and pence aspect of the case was concerned, there was no advantage at that time to be gained by Western Australia. The railway, however, provided an inducement which could be placed before the people, as it would provide for daily communication with the rest of Australia. When we were holding up before the people of Western Australia the prospect Frederick of this railway communication, and the was discussed from one end of State to the other-whe n the adhesion of that State was one of the most important topics of the day, and was discussed in all the leading journals of the eastern letStates, and the public men of Australia showed intense anxiety that the Union should be complete-wa s anything said in the South Australian or the Victorian of press, or indeed the press of Australia, or in Parliament, adverse to the proposal ? the views which I and others placed the people of Western Australia, and were published in the eastern States Were as the proposals, which I was then suggesting, indescribed then by the press of VicNothing read? was said to lead any one to believe what was being promised to the people of Western Australia was not likely to be The offer to accomplished.",50

335,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-Was that when the Prime Minister was on a visit to Western Australia ?,51
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think so. I wish the honourable and learned member would not interrupt. Before he finds fault, the honourable and learned membei ought to make sure I am stating the circumstances incorrectly. Perhaps the honourable and learned member enjoys hectoring me, though I do not think he ought to do so, because I have a duty to perform which I ought to be allowed to carry out, without ridiculous interruptions from anybody. The Prime Minister, in a press interview lie gave at that time, is thus reportedMr Reid pointed out that it would not be of advantage to Western Australia alone, but also to the rest of the Commonwealth. shorten the journey between the eastern States and Europe, and be useful for defensive purposes. "" Western Australia,"" said he, "" is at the furthest end of the Continent, and hopelessly removed from the eastern States, so that it should receive consideration, especially in the direction of uniting it by rail with the other States."" Prior to the first Federal election the Prime Minister, commenting on Sir Edmund Barton's Maitland speech, saidThere is one part in the general statement of Mr Barton's to which I would like to refer, and that is the construction of the Transcontinental Railway. The work is one that must be carried out. It is absolutely necessary from a commercial, military, and national point of view. Although I , for one, will hold the Ministry to strict acts in all matters anticipating approval, I think the Government might take upon themselves the responsibility of undertaking the initial work of exploring the best possible routes.",51
337,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister meant the Government of Western Australia.,51
338,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Prime Minister did not mean anything of the sort, and the honourable member for Bourke does not think that the Government of Western Australia was meant. If the honourable member is going to misrepresent in his interjections, I shall take no notice of him. The report of the press interview proceeded""You can tell them a good deal more than the plain fact that I am in no way opposed to the construction of the railway to Western Australia. You can say that I am very strongly in favour of it ; furthermore, I am in favour of its being constructed at the earliest possible moment. I do not expect it to pay at first, and I think the Commonwealth should be prepared to cover any margin of loss. According to. the estimate prepared by Mr O'Connor, and lately published, the loss will not be great. If I had anything to do with it I would, of course, endeavour to reduce that loss."" "" Don't you think that the rest of the Commonwealth is, to some extent, morally bound to build the line?"" "" Whilst there has been no legal compact yet,"" replied Mr Reid, "" there is some obligation inasmuch as the belief that the line would be constructed was one of the main reasons why Western Australia joined the Federation. Many of the representative men of - the East I know pledged themselves to support the building of the railway, if Western Australia came into the Commonwealth.""",51
339,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Was that before the referendum ?,51
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , it was after the Maitland address, and before the first elections - The question is often asked -""Why does not Western Australia build this railway herself? The other States have built their own railways, and It would why should not Western Australia do the same in this case? Why should the Commonwealth be called upon to build it?"" If Western Australia had another State alongside, occupying the same position as she does, probably some arrangement would have been made by which the railway would have been built. But honourable members must recollect that for more than half the distance the railway would traverse South Australian territory. The shorter distance by 100 miles or so is in Western Australia. So that if we were to build the railway to the border, we should still be from 550 to 600 miles away from the nearest railway station in South Australia. That is one reason. But, apart from that, the object of this railway is not to open up the lands of Western Australia, although it may have some effect in that direction. My honourable and learned friend, the member for Parkes, spoke of the great value that would be given to the lands through which the line passed. For my own part, I do not think that there will be any difficulty in getting as much land on each side of the railway from the Western Australian Government as the Commonwealth desires to obtain. But I do not Kalgoorlie to Port. [REPRESENTATIVES.] think that that is of great importance. is not the value of the land, but what comes off the land, that is of value. A l that comes off the land would be available as traffic for the railway. It does seem to me to matter twopence who owns the land, so long as it is utilized. railway would insure the utilization of the land, and whether it belongs to the monwealth or to the State is, to my mind, State with a small population. of very little importance.",51
341,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I spoke of that point to show that the State is going to get all the increment.,52
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think that the land would be very valuable to State. It was not well watered. In fact, there is no surface water upon it. The capital value of the land would be small. It is the facilities afforded railway that would insure the improvement and utilization of the land. That is another point which shows that the honorthinking able and learned member for Parkes has not worked this matter out so thoroughly as he usually does. Otherwise he would not 'have used an argument like that. In entering Federation, every State of the Commonwealth was actuated, in some degree at any. rate, by the hope material gain. Every one of the States expected that Federation would bring about greater prosperity to its people. not know that they were wrong in thinking that. At any rate such is the case. in Western Australia we were unable to show the people, although we had every desire to do so when we were advocating Federation with all our might that one there was any material gain in sight. The only way in which we could show people of Western Australia that they would gain was by expressing the belief that their State would soon be connected by-rail with the rest of Australia. What tern we promised the people of Western Australia was that, as a result of Federation, railway would certainly be built, that their isolation would be removed, and political life would be brought about. We used the latter argument for all that it was worth. I have often doubted since Federation, was accomplished whether we have reached that higher political life. But, at any rate, we believed that it would come about, and that we should be on higher plane, occupy a better position in world, and be better able to assist the mother country in maintaining the Empire. Augusta Railway. It Those were the arguments which we used in order to induce the people of Western Ausl tralia to join the Federation. In all these noble sentiments, creditable alike to those not who used them and to those who believed them-ther e was nothing about material Thegain. How could Western Australia build a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta ? ComIt is a very large undertaking for a We do not own one-half of the territory which would be traversed by the railway. The other half belongs to South Australia. We have no power or right whatever to enter upon such a project. Of what greater advantage will this railway be to Western Australia the when it is built than to South Australia ' and to the rest of the Commonwealth ? Perhaps some of the honourable members who have been interrupting me so much will be by the able to tell the Committee what material advantage over the other States Western Australia will derive. If I were only of the advantage to Western Australia, and of the profit that might come into the pockets of the people of that State, I should be acting a selfish part. I cannot see that great gain will specially come to us from the construction of the railway. On the contrary, it must be rememof bered that some of the gold-fields' trade that now goes to Perth and Fremantle will be diverted to other. States. An honourable I do member has said that the railway is desired for the purpose of assisting the people of But Perth and Fremantle. But they must recollect that Perth and Fremantle at present get the advantage of the whole of the trade of the eastern gold-fields. Will any venture to say that they will, get all that trade when the railway is built? Is it not the evident that much of the Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie trade, instead of going to Perth, will go to Adelaide and Melbourne? Mr JOHNSON,-Lan d speculators in Wes- .

All town lands have to be subthe mitted for sale by auction. The land system of Western Australia is, I believe, as good and liberal as that which obtains anywhere.",52
346,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Our land laws are as good as any in the world.,53
347,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But I quite whisky ? agree with the honourable member for Lang that we must take care not to allow land speculators to come in and reap great advantages for themselves. I have fried to show reasons why I take so much siderable. trouble in the advocacy of the construction of the railway. The conclusion at which I thinking of. have arrived is that I believe that it will be a good thing for Western Australia, and good thing for the whole Commonwealth, double that of any other State. not on account of the trade that exists not because of things as they are-bu t beworth of gold. cause of the developments which will take place.

I may tell the honourable member that if we want to make Australia a great country, there is no room for the petty ideas he is interjecting. I have always looked upon the honourable and learned member for Parkes as a well-informed man with broad ideas, whose vision goes far beyond the limits of Australia, and embraces the interests of the Empire at large. But when he says that we should. enter into negotiations with the two States about the repayment of this money, and makes a lot of fuss about an item of £20,000 in connection with a great national project, I must say I am both astonished and disappointed. Does he know that Western Australia has spent a large sum, I should say quite £20,000, in examining this country, boring for water, and doing all sorts of things?

The voting of this money will not bind any honourable member. I wish to make my position quite clear. I am acquainted with this country, and Iknow that there are no engineering difficulties, but other people do not, and it is reasonable that they should get the information asked for. I am quite convinced that this project as a commercial undertaking will be favourably reported upon. But my conviction has nothing to do with any one else here. I shall be perfectly frank with honourable members. I look upon this survey as the beginning of the carrying out of this great project. If I did not believe that it would lead to satisfactory reports ancl estimate's, that it was the first step in the direction of connecting the east and the west by railway, I should not ask any honourable member to have anything to do with the proposal. If I did not believe that the work could be undertaken on a commercial basis, and would meet with the approval of the people of Australia, I would not advocate the spending of a single sixpence on it. But that is no reason why honourable members should think as I do. They are only asked to say, "" We are going to get information, and when it is obtained we shall judge. We are notgoing to prejudge the case from the point of view of the honourable member for Swan. But we shall go this farwe shall get the information, and in doing so we in no way pledge ourselves."" From my point of view the position is altogether different. My belief is that the obtaining of this information will only be the forerunner to the carrying out of this great work. If ever there has been a project brought before the Australian people, which has been most grossly maligned by unjust criticism, it is this one. It has been said in the press of this State that the railway would not pay for axle grease. I would refer honourable members to the report of the late Mr C. Y. O'Connor, Engineer-in-Chief of Western Australia. He reported upon this project with a full sense of responsibility, because under all ordinary circumstances, he might have fairly expected to live to see its completion. He had undertaken giganpended tic works in Western Australia which honourably served, and had been proved , to be right in regard to works of greater 'magnitude and involving far greater risk than this one. Therefore, he knew what he was talking about, and had no motive to serve. I had resigned the Premiership, and had come here to join tine Barton Government, before he made his report; so that it was made free from any influence I might be supposed to have had upon him had I remained there. His opinion was that the line would not pay immediately, but that the loss would be slight, in fact, that in ten years it would pay. He had carried out the great Fremantle Harbor works at a cost of £1,500,000. one said that that undertaking would never pay, but at the present time it is not only paying all working expenses, but also providing for interest and sinking fund. He had also carried out the great Coolgardie water scheme, and without his assistance and knowledge it could not at that time have been done, for my Government were fortified in undertaking that work by confidence we had in his ability and ledge - What is the result Every one said that it would be a pall hanging over the country; that it would everybody. But for the half-year ending 30th June, it paid not only penses, but also the interest on a capital expenditure of £2,600,000. I cite these facts to show that Mr O'Connor was able and reliable man. He had had expethe croaker. rience of great works, first in New. Zea- - Sir JOHN FORREST land, and then in Western Australia. built all our railways, harbour works, water schemes. In a lengthy report which, unfortunately, I have not with me, pointed out exactly what he believed. verdict was, that after ten years the will be a paying concern, and that even that interval there will not be very much way. loss. I predict that it will pay within three years of its construction, I believe that it will pay even sooner, but I fix the period at three years. If I did believe in this project I would not advocate it. I believe that it is necessary, not in the material interests of this country, also in the interests of the Federation of Australia.",54
365,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the object of this trial survey to prove whether the late Mr O'Connor was right or wrong?,55
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-No .,55
367,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If his report can be deupon, why does the right honourable he member wish us to spend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 ?",55
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We require a survey to be made in order to obtain information, so as to satisfy the House as to what the railway will cost. Mr. O'Connor had not been over the whole of the ground. In my opinion, his estimate is not very f ar wrong 3 but South Australia, which is another party to this project, says that she will not even authorize the building of the railway until a survey is made and proper estimates are formed, in order that she may know exactly the position.",55
369,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Coul d not that be done by Every Western Australia?,55
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have become accustomed to the croaking of some Victorians. I have been accustomed to men like the honourable and learned member for Indi all my life. I have had to fight them, and I am ready to do it again. I used to call them ""little Australians"" and ""croakers.""",55

376,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How did he know what Western Australia wanted ? Sir JOHN FORREST,-We h a d ' the', reports and the statistics from Mr Coghlan and others, and the outlook seemed then very dark for Western Australia. The opposition of my honourable friends to this - project is only a murmur compared with the opposition I had to overcome in regard to many great works carried out in Western Australia. In Western Australia my opponents said, "" Every one will be ruined, and the whole piace will collapse "" ; but there has been no collapse; we seem to have flourished. Those who croaked most about the impending ruin cannot be found now. They have quite forgotten what they said. And so it will be with the honourable and learned member for Indi and the honourable member for Bourke. In a few years' time when they see thousands of persons going backwards and forwards, and hear of Victorians reaping the reward of their industry on the gold-fields and on the lands of the West, they will conveniently forget that they ever opposed the construction of this railway.",55
377,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When we see that we shall admit that we were wrong. Sir JOHN FORREST,-The honourable member is like one of the apostles mentioned in the Scriptures, who would not believe until he had seen. It must be remembered that the proposed railway is one to connect the eastern and western States of a great continent, and that it will pass through a temperate clime. The construction of such a' railway could not be said to be a retrograde step; it must be a step in advance, a step in the direction of .union and progress. Five Commissioners, who were engineers, and who represented the States of Victoria, Queensland, S'outh Australia, New South Wales, and Western Australia visited the last-named State, the gold-fields, Eucla, and Port Augusta. They - had before them the reports of the surveyors . who imade an examination of the country which the proposed line would traverse, and the report of the late Mr O'Connor, and they reported that the railway, if constructed, would pay at the end of ten years. It is not expected of engineers, who are hard, business men, that they should indulge in flights of imagination. They are rightly very careful in their estimates,.""",56
378,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They will all be out of their positions ten years hence.,56
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The reputation of a public servant is more to him than his position. If his good name is taken from him, he becomes a very poor .man indeed. My own opinion is that the railwaywould pay after three years; but the secretary to the Commissioners, Mr Gwynneth, who has had large experience as a contractor's engineer, estimated that, instead of a loss of ,£2*49,435 in the first ten years, which' is the estimate of the Commissioners, there would be a profit of .£173,850 if the shorter route through the Gawler Ranges were taken.  worse track.",56
380,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that it is the better route.  because I have been over it.,56
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have been over the shorter route through the Gawler Ranges.  dozen times.,56
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was closely observing the country when I crossed over it, though' it is now thirty-four - years ago. The Commissioners estimate that, after ten years, the profit from the line will be £18,219 per annum, but Mr Gwynneth estimates it at £72,515 per annum.",56
383,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that making allowance for interest and working expenses ?,56
384,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is making allowance for everything. I am not now in a position of responsibility in regard to Western Australia, but I have not the slightest doubt that any reasonable proposal made by the Government of the Commonwealth to the Government of that State will' be fairly considerea. The people of Western Australia do not wish to take any advantage of the Commonwealth. Western Australia has been most generous in the matter throughout. We know that South Australia will do nothing, but Western Australia has offe'red to indemnify her for any loss that she may sustain, for, I think, ten years after the construction of the line. Even if there were a loss, it ought not to be taken unduly into consideration, when weighed in the balance with the great advantage which would accrue from the cementing together of the peoples of Australia in a firm Federation. What is the loss - of a few pounds compared with the achievement of such an object as that ? There ""has been no more unjust or untrue criticism levelled at any project than that which has been levelled at this. It has been published of me personally in a Melbourne newspaper that I . wish to force a gigantic, fraud on the people of Australia. In the first place, I have no power to force anything upon the people of Australia.",56
385,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In what newspaper wei= those words published?,57
386,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall not give the name of the newspaper, but they were hard words to apply to one who has never done anything to cause him to be ashamed to hold up his head. I hurl them back at the writer of the article. untrue, unjust, and disgraceful words. Would it suit me personally to associate myself with' anything which would bring disaster upon my State or upon the Commonwealth? It would not. transcontinental railways are not as much . to me as is my honour. have been associated hitherto with successf u l enterprises, and would I knowingly now associate myself with a project which would be likely to.be a burden on the people of. Australia? I repudiate the idea. would be altogether contrary to my interests to do anything of the kind. words were not fair, they were not honest, and they should not have been used in regard to a public man who, whatever may be his faults in the opinion of his opponents, has always been credited with a desire to do what was right. I ask honourable members who are opposed to this small expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , and who seem to have pre-judged the case because they are unwilling to wait for the information which we wish to give to them, if its cost is their only objection to the construction of the proposed railway? If so, the sooner they say so the better, because then we shall know how we stand.",57
387,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The cost is a very great , objection to the proposal.",57
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What other jection can there be?,57
389,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the proposed way compete with the coasting vessels?,57
390,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I hope so. Otherwise it might not pay.,57
391,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That may be a reason the opposition to the proposal.,57
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope not; but it must be remembered that it duty to open, up this great continent, and to make it prosperous. I have an object in asking if the cost of the proposed railway is the only objection to its construction. There is no other objection that I can think of. Are honourable members afraid of losing a few pounds on a railway which will bind Australia together in a manner in which it cannot otherwise be bound ? Are those who hold the cost to be an objection prepared to allow a private company fo undertake the enterprise, and to run it for all time under the conditions on which the railways of the States are run, or do they wish to leave the country through which the line would pass in the They were occupation of the kangaroos and native dogs? I hope that the honourable and learned member for Indi, who, I see, is taking notes, will refer to this matter when he speaks. I am not a company monger, Fifty nor do I know of any company willing to undertake this work; but I believe that a Furthermore, I private combination would construct the railway if it were granted a monopoly.",57
393,Mr HUMECOOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If it is such a good thing, why do not the States construct the It line? Those Sir JOHN FORREST - I believe that a private company would construct the line, if it were granted a monopoly, and were relieved from taxation for a long term of years.",57
394,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If it were also allowed to charge what it liked?,57
395,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; I do not contemplate any such condition. I suggest that it should be required to carry passengers and goods at rates similar to those prevailing upon the Government railways. I have never advocated the construction of the line on account of the character of the country through which it would pass. The land is, no doubt, capable of improvement and development, but if that were the only prospect before us, I should not support it. My obadvocacy is based upon the fact that the great western State would be brought into raildirect communication with the rest of Australia. If the country through which the railway would pass is as bad as it is represented to be by a Melbourne newspaper, no one need have any compunction about giving for away large areas of it to any company that might be willing to construct the line, nor need they hesitate to' give them the most excellent terms for a hundred, or even is our a thousand, years; This newspaper states, with reference to the country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, thatOut of the i,ioo miles of railway which it proposed to construct at Federal expense, very nearly, if not quite, 1,000 miles is to run through territory which has no appreciable chance of being inhabited for generations, if ever at all. If that were true, the country would be of enjoy very little value to any one; but the state of ment is not correct. The whole of the country from Port Augusta, through the And Gawler Ranges, past Fowler's Bay and essential Eucla, right on to Kalgoorlie, would be were suitable for pastoral settlement when water protection supplies are made available. Mr HUME ' COOK - How much permadom nent water is available along the route of proposed line?",57
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no doubt that water, could be made available along the whole length of the line.",58
397,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does that apply to both routes ?,58
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know the northern route, but I have travelled over a large part of the southern route, and am well. acquainted with it.",58
399,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I understood that efforts had been made to obtain water for years past, and that they had failed.",58
400,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . Water has been obtained by sinking wells on the limestone tableland. Brackish water has been struck at a depth of 500 feet.  try is already settled, and the settlers there were not driven out during the drought period.",58
401,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , the country, as far as the head of the Australian Bight, is already settled. Western Australia is prepared to leave the determination of the route, the gauge of the line, and everything else to the Commonwealth Parliament. The State Legislature passed an Act, the preamble of which is so well written, and represents so clearly the objects in view, that I shall read it to honourable members. The Act was assented on the 29th September, 1903, and the preamble reads as follows:Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia, being desirous of securing closer union, and the benefits of mutual protection and defence, and being desirous also of enjoying the advantages of freedom of trade, commerce, and reciprocal intercourse, have, by the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, formed one federal and indissoluble Commonwealth : And wKereas, in furtherance of these objects, power has been conferred upon the Parliament of the is now Commonwealth to make laws for the construction and extension of railways in any State with the consent of such State : And whereas, on the faith of the early construction of a railway to connect the Western and Eastern portions of the Commonwealth, by means whereof they could the full benefits of such union, the people Western Australia did agree to the said Constitution, and to form part of the Commonwealth. whereas, to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealth to execute and maintain those provisions of the Constitution which intended to confirm the people of this portion of the Commonwealth in that assurance of and defence, and the advantages of postal and commercial intercourse, and of freeof trade by land and'by sea, which are the enjoyed By members of the Commonwealth elsewhere, it is desirable to authorize such Parliament to construct a railway as aforesaid. . . .",58
402,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is not one word of official warrant for that preamble?,58
403,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not agree with the honourable member, and his assertion is not justified.",58
404,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I say that there is no official warrant for the statements contained in the preamble.,58
405,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why does not the honourable member remain quiet until I have finished ? The second section of the Act from which I have been quoting reads as follows: Subject to section six hereof, the Commonwealth Parliament may make laws for the construction and maintenance (1) Of a railway from Kalgoorlie to the eastern boundary of Western Australia, commencing at the termination of the existing railway system of the State at Kalgoorlie, and proceeding thence to the said boundary by such route as the Commonwealth Parliament may determine, and (2) Of a railway from the Port of Eucla running due north to a point intersecting the route of the railway aforesaid. The latter part of the section refers to a small railway from Eucla, which might bS required for construction purposes. Then there is provision for empowering the Commonwealth to acquire land, and another important section which shows the bona fides of the' Western Australian Government. It indicates their willingness to incur a very large expenditure, which will probably amount to £750,000. It is provided thatNot later than the time when the Commonwealth Parliament commences the construction of the first-mentioned railway, the State of Western Australia will commence the construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, on the same conditions as to gauge and rails as those laid down by the Commonwealth Parliament in connection with the work undertaken by it , and shall complete the same by the time the Commonwealth has completed the railway aforesaid. Then it is enacted that the Act shall be say that ? void unless the Commonwealth Parliament shall have agreed to, and shall have comlike it. menced, the construction of the railways within five years from the passing of the Act.",58
406,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is really an Act to permit the Commonwealth to conwhilst. struct the line.,59
407,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; but the honourable and learned member cannot have failed to notice that the Western Australian Government undertake to alter the their own railways in order to make their gauge uniform with that adopted by the Commonwealth Government. That would probably involve the alteration of of railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle from the present 3-ft. to - the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, and a very large expenditure, amounting to at least £ 7 5 0 would have to be incurred in effecting the necessary changes in connection with sta-. tion buildings and sidings, and in widening the permanent way. Therefore, whilst the Commonwealth are asked to undertake the survey and construction of the proposed line, they must not forget that Westto ern Australia is willing to incur an immense' expenditure in order to secure a direct uninterrupted means of communication from Fremantle to Port Augusta.",59
408,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What is the reason of the limitation as to time in section 6 ?,59
409,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The reason is that the Western Australian Government cannot consent to have the matter ""hung up"" for ever. They have undertaken to change the gauge of their line from Fremantle Kalgoorlie, and they cannot allow matters to stand in abeyance for more than five years. At present all alterations and ditions on that line are at a standstill, they must remain so until the Western tralian Government are in a position know what the Commonwealth Parliament tralia. intends to do.",59
410,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They will become anbe conferred upon the sister noyed, and construct the railway themselves.",59
411,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Personally , think that five yeais is too long a time allow.",59
412,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That Act is a threat to the Commonwealth that if it does not undertake the construction of the line within a certain time it will not be permitted to do so at all. ',59
413,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely the honourable and learned member does not mean to,59
414,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It looks very much,59
415,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Doesno t the honourable and learned member see that some limitation as to time is necessary, because the matter remains in abeyance no improvements can be carried out upon the existing line from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie.",59
416,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What is to happen if the Commonwealth does not commence! the gauge of work within five years ?,59
417,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I cannot say what Western Australia will do; but probably she will despair of Federation con387 miles ferring any benefit upon her.,59
418,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Probably she will 6-in. gauge secede from the Union !,59
419,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt she , 0 0 0 would have very good cause for dissatisfaction. In this matter, Western Australia has not acted the part of the dog-in-themanger. Her Legislature leaves the whole questions of route and gauge to the Commonwealth Parliament, and undertakes to alter 387 miles of existing line, in order make its gauge uniform with that of the railway constructed by the Commonwealth. and I do not think that any one can argue that in anything Western Australia has done in this matter she has shown any narrow or - parochial spirit. All through the negotiations she has. acted in a Federal spirit, not in her own interests only, but also in the in terests of the whole of Australia. If honourable members compare the action of that State with that of South Australia, they will probably come to the conclusion that Western to Australia has some great benefit to gain to make her so urgent in her advocacy of the railway, whilst the sister State is so apaadthetic. The more the matter is looked into, and however, the more clearly it will be seen Austhat the contrary is the case, and that the to greater advantage will lie with South AusNo advantage will be gained by Western Australia that will not also State. Even in connection with the construcI tion of the railway itself, South Austo tralia will gain more largely, because if the Gawler Range route is adopted, large quantities of railway material will probably be landed at Streaky Bay, Denial Bay,. Fowler's Bay, and Eucla. Western Australia cannot, deliver her railway mathe terial to similar advantage. single spike can be driven on the Western Australian side, it. will have to be carried for 387 miles from Fremantle to K a goorlie. Then, again, a great portion the traffic which now goes to Fremantle will probably be diverted over the new line to South. Australia and other States, and will not' benefit the coastal settlements Western Australia, which at present enjoy the whole of the trade with the gold-fields.",59
420,Mr HIGGINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Did the right honourable gentleman say that, to the people of Perth ? of",60
421,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes; ; and I of told them that notwithstanding that at first sight it. might, appear that the proposed way would operate against their interests, in, means of a sea voyage. my opinion it was certain that, where man travelled now a hundred would travel when it was constructed, and that for every ton of goods that now passed in or. out the, State, hundreds of tons would be warded, r further, represented to them that if they adopted a broad, liberal,, patriotic view of this question,, they would gain , rather than lose by 'their action. I . think that that is. a perfectly sound position to take upj and I thoroughly believe that the respect. people of Western Australia, as a whole, will benefit' by the establishment of direct and' rapid, means of communication the western State and the larger centres of population, in. the east, and by the encourthe agement which will be given to trade and commerce with all parts of the Common-, wealth. The honourable and learned, member for Northern: Melbourne at once sees that, on the face of it, the proposal does not appear to be largely in the interests o the people of Perth and Fremantle ;- but on reflection he must agree with me broader and wider view which. I have, indicated is. the sounder and nobler one to adopt. I think I have already said that. I feel a State. responsibility in this, matter, because I took a very prominent paifc in the Federal paign,,, and in recommending the people of Western, Australia to join the Union. I that it is, my duty to, do all that I can to several occasions. make the Union satisfactory to the people of the State of which I am a. representaand tive.. But my hands are tied. We. have no means to do anything. There is no means of communication between Western Austramore, lia and the eastern States, except the route. There has been no true realization of Federation, so far as the people of Western Australia are concerned.' They realise inconvenient side of it, when a request, Before a for a post-office is refused, or when; a proposed telephone extension has to be re1 ferred to Melbourne for decision. On the lpther hand, if we had a railway running of daily between the east and the west, and hundreds of people travelling toand f r o upon it,. Federation would then be a reality to all parts, of the Commonwealth. If no of railway existed between Melbourne and Sydney, betweenSydney and Brisbane, and between Melbourne and Adelaide, we should have these States wholly apart, and their peoples knowing scarcely anything one another. Such a condition affairs' would, be. almost beyond endurance. The representatives of Western Ausrailtralia cannot reach, their homes except by As I . have alone ready said, that state of affairs very materially interferes with the representa tion of Western Australia, in the Federal of Legislature, because but. few men can afford forto leave, their homes and. their business for. many months in order, to. devote their and whole time to their parliamentary duties.

424,Mr WEBSTEH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The railway journey would annihilate the representatives of that,60
425,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"- It would do camnothing of the kind. I have had some experience of travelling; long; distances by feel rail.

Federation a sham. I distinctly say once more that I should not have advocated Federation had I thought that this state' of isolation would continue indefinitely. But it cannot remain as it is. The people of Western Australia will never rest content while it lasts. The only thing that makes them apparently contentis .the hope that the existing position may soon be brought to an end.

That State might as we'll be an island in mid-ocean as a State separated from the rest of the Union by many hundreds of miles of unoccupied country, and without railway communication with the other parts of the Commonwealth. Was it ever intended that Western Australia should depend upon its own resources for its defence? it provided in the Constitution that the Commonwealth shall protect every State from invasion when, as long as the present state of affairs continues, we cannot defend Western Australia, or send a single man to protect it ?",60
426,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Captai n Mahan says that a naval base,61
427,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am speaking of the Constitution.,61
428,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the right honourable member should listen to what Captain Mahan says,61
429,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable and .learned member should not interrupt me. The Commonwealth, has taken to "" protect every State against invasion,"" and unless every effort is to be made to carry out that obligation, those words in the Constitution must be idle and meaningless. even say that those .words are worse than meaningless, .for they are fraudulent, if they do not mean what they say. In my opinion, however, they do .mean what they It :makes say. I believe that the people of Australia are on my side-that they are on the side of Western Australia. I have never addressed a public meeting on this guestion in any part of Australia without'receiving encouragement for the views I have expressed in regard to it. On one occasion I addressed a public-meeting in South Australia, consisting of over 1,000 persons, a large majority of whom, I was told, were hostile to the project; but I never was better received in my lif e than when I was advocating before that meeting the construction of this railway. The same remark will apply to the feeling in Victoria. The Why did honourable and learned member for Indi Union? believes that his constituents are opposed to Australia the construction of the line, but I very much doubt if they are. T am prepared to prove the sincerity of my belief by going to his constituency and asking for the support of his constituents, even with the eloquence of the honourable and learned member against me. The people of Australia are not mere timeservers ; they are not going to break their word, or disregard the written Constitution to which they have agreed. They - have undertaken to protect each State from invasion, and they, must - set about - the work of putting themselves in a position to do so. Why was Mr ISAACS - But the construction of this line is not provided for in the Constitution ?",61
430,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The people of Australia desire a Federation that is not a sham. They want something real. They believe more in the importance of Western Australia than does the honourable and learned member for Indi.,61
431,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oh , no !",61
432,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The people, of the rest of the Commonwealth know that Western Australia has been a good friend of Australia, and carried them safely over a period of distress, and helped them when they needed assistance. They are not ungrateful. I rely, upon the people of Australia to a larger extent than I rely on some under- of their representatives. I am quite certain that the people of Victoria, and, indeed, of - all Australia, will adhere to the understanding arrived at in regard to this matter, and will adhere to the spirit of I would the Constitution. They .know that a moral understanding exists that (the - line - shall be constructed, .and they will see that it is carried out. Who are our opponents ? rHave :they ever done anything for this country? .Let them stand before us in a row, and point to any great work that any one of them has carried out-to one monument that reflects to their credit?",61
433,Mr HIGGINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They are sitting behind the right honourable member.,62
434,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not speaking of any honourable member of this House in any personal sense, but I assert that our opponents are merely the ""do-nothings."" The pessimists and/ the croakers of former days in Western Australia cannot be found now, because all the works which they opposed and decried have been successful. They have subsided, although many of them would now take credit for the construction of works which they did so much to prevent. I would say to the people who are opposed to this undertaking that they may delay this great work, but not for long. It is not a paltry little railway to run through one solitary town or district, but a line which is going to connect - the eastern and western sides of Australia, and bind the people of the Commonwealth together. They may be able to delay the work, but it will not be for very long, for I firmly believe that Federation and broad-mindedness will, in the near future, in this and all other great national matters, conquer and subdue the "" little Australians,"" the pessimists and the parochial ists.",62
435,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA," I think we can all very heartily congratulate my right honourable friend, who has just resumed his seat, on the genuineness with which he advocates this project. I believe that no honourable member could throw more personal fervour into his advocacy of any proposal than the Tight honourable member has thrown into this, but I regret, for his sake, that I feel compelled to oppose the motion. I am sorry that my right honourable friend refers to those who, like myself, believe that as trustees of the money of the people whom we represent, we are not justified in looking at an expenditure of, £5,000,000 as a mere nothing",62
436,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It ,£5,000,000. Our opponents always add a million, but never think of taking one off.",62
437,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"£5,000,00 0 has constantly been referred to in this House as the probable cost of the railway. But let us take it at £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; a million is in the period named. nothing to the right honourable member.",62
438,Mr MCCAY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At present we are concerned with a proposal to spend only £20,000.",62
439,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If there is to be a survey, is it to be made with the genuine intention to proceed with Che work, should it be favourably reported upon?",62
440,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the construction of a line always follow the making of a survey? How many surveys of projected lines have been made in Victoria without the work of construction following?,62
441,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I agree with the honourable member's suggestion that surveys ought not to be made unless it is intended to proceed with the actual work, should the report of the surveyors be favourable.",62
442,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not my suggestion.,62
443,Mr MCCAY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The object of the proposed survey is to obtain necessary information.,62
444,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My honourable and learned friend will surely agree that if we secure the necessary information, it should be with the honest intention to proceed with the work provided that the information proves favourable.",62
445,Mr MCCAY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If the information turns out to be favourable.,62
446,Mr ISAACS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Howeve r roseate the report might be, I hold that we are not in a position to spend £4,000,000 or ,£5,000,000 in the near future. On that ground alone, I am prepared to object to the proposal. Whatever may be the eventual prospects of this giganticwork-and it is a gigantic work-howeve r desirable it may be, and I admit it is desirable that at some time or other the iron band of union should exist between east and west- I think that at present we are not at all in a position to spend out of our revenue, or to borrow with advantage on' the credit of the Commonwealth, the huge sum of £4,000,000 or ,£5,000,000 necessary to make this railway. When we look at the Act of Parliament which has been forcibly brought under our notice by the right honourable member for Swan, we find that it is to expire in 1908. We are told, in effect by Western Australia, "" If you is not do not undertake this work by 1908, you are _ not to do it at all."" That is the limit. I , for one, am not prepared to say that Australia is. by some means, to raise £4,000,000 or .£5,000,000, and to expend it in making a railway withWhat the distant future may bring is another matter; but I am not prepared to say that even £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is in our present condition a mere trifle. I do not know that any one will dispute the proposition that, in the future, population will require and justify the construction of the line. I am not in a position to offer any opinion on that phase of the question, but I do say, that whatever the future may bring forth, the present is not the time for us to embark on such a great undertaking. If we are not prepared to enter upon it within a reasonable time, then we have no right now to expend £ 2 0 , 0 9 0, because by the time we should be able to undertake the enterprise, conditions might have materially altered for the better or the worse- I hope and believe for the better. We are told by the right honourable member for Swan that, after all only a few pounds are involved, and he wishes to know why "" these croakers"" should object to the expenditure of a few pounds. That is a very light way to talk of a large sum of money. If we were to propose the expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 on some projects, I am sure that we should be told that it was not a small sum. It seems to me that to expend ,£20,000 in the way proposed would be to throw it away. I deny that it was any part of the bargain between Western Australia and the rest of the' Commonwealth that this railway should be constructed. I never heard of it as a bargain, but I do not deny that it was a laudable desire and ambition on the part of Western Australiaand a desire that I can heartily reciprocate - that the eastern and western States should be united by easier and more facile means of communication than at present exist. T>he question is whether we can afford at the present time to provide that means of communication, or whether the prospects now justify it, or will do so within the immediate future. I do not think it is an answer for the right honourable member to say that, if the only objection be the cost, we should allow a private company to do the work. That is a most fallacious argument. If the Commonwealth or any State is going to say that because a project, however inviting it may look in the future, is not one which the financial condition of the Commonwealth or of the State concerned will' justify at the present moment, it is therefore to be handed over to a private company as a monopoly, we shall find ourselves at no great distance of time in a very perilous position. If that position were taken up, we should fetter our hands in a way from which we could not hope afterwards to free ourselves. I do not think that that argument is a sound one, however alluring it may be for the moment. I cast my mind back, and recall a time in our history when Brisbane was not connected with Adelaide. We see that they are connected today, but it requires time and patience - to give effect to these undertakings. We must wait, in my judgment, for some further development of our population and territory before we can justify the expenditure of the very large sum of money we are now aske""d to expend. I should like to have heard the present Minister of Trade and Customs upon this subject, and should have been pleased if he had followed the right honourable member for Swan. I know that his views, if expressed, would not be found to be in accord with those which have been announced by the right honourable member for Swan. I think it is wrong that the right honourable gentleman should refer in the way he has done to those of us who, in Victoria and in other States, feel that they cannot support this proposal, which, if it mean's anything at all, is only the, thin .end of the wedge for the largest expenditure of money proposed since the Commonwealth came into existence. I take this opportunity of saying that, whatever may be our desire for closer union and quicker communication , with Western Australia, well disposed as we all are to that State as to the other States of the Commonwealth, we feel regret that the circumstances of the Commonwealth today do not justify us in supporting the proposal of the Government.",62
447,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA," I do not propose to take up much .time in dealing with this matter, but it is strange to me to hear the right honourable member for Swan put so much force into his arguments in the endeavour *to impress the Committee with the splendid thing it will be for this Parliament to embark upon railway construction at this particular time and in this particular locality. The right honourable member has given us to understand that this is not a matter of convenience or of advantage to the people of Western Australia. He holds that it will be of enormous benefit to the people of the Commonwealth if this railway is constructed at their expense, but to my mind the project will be of benefit only to the people of Western Australia. The right honourable gentleman said that he would tell us what an eminent engineering authority, to whom the question was referred, had to say with respect to the railway, and the country through which it is proposed to be constructed. I regret that the right honourable gentleman did not quote the opinion of Mr C. Y. O'Connor, the authority to whom he referred.",63
448,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think .the right honourable member for Swan said that Mr. O'Connor had not been through most of the country, and he did not regard that gentleman as an authority. M i . KENNEDY - He has not been .through it, and, strange to say, we can find no one who admits that he has been through the country, or knows anything about it.",64
449,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Henc e the necessity for further inquiry. Mr .KENNEDY - The right honourable .member for Swan has, I believe, been through the country, but even he cannot speak authoritatively concerning it.",64
450,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Honourable members will not take the right honourable gentleman's word on the subject.,64
451,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Y e t we have estimates submitted as to the probable cost of the railway.. I am surprised right honourable member for Swan did not quote Mr O'Connor's views, after telling the Committee that he proposed to do so. On the very best information available to date, Mr O'Connor writes in this way in paragraph 2 of his reportIn an undertaking of this magnitude, traversing n;ooo miles of country, which is mostly uninhabited, uncultivated, and waterless, although there are no engineering difficulties to contend with, there is necessarily a good deal of uncertainty as to its probable cost. It is not to'me a matter of surprise to find that a State Government should be most anxious that some authority other than itself and its taxpayers should embark in such a national work as this-becaus e a national work it surely is, as we understand national works here, that is to say, works in connection with which there can be no possible hope that they will pay, or that there will be a justification for the expenditure involved in them.",64
452,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is merely the honourable member's opinion.,64
453,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If this undertaking is to be such a wonderfully good thing commercially and generally for the-development of 'Western Australia, how is it that - the Government of that State is so anxious that somebody else should embark in the construction of the railway and control the enterprise ?",64
454,Sir JOH NFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have explained that only half the line would run through their territory.,64
455,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I take objection to the proposal, on the ground of the underlying principle with regard to the Commonwealth embarking in railway construction at all. The conditions under which we can embark upon railway construction, as laid down in the Constitution, are clear and distinct. A first essential is the authority of the States through which the railways proposed to be constructed must pass. Up to the present time, no assent has - been given by one of the States concerned in this proposed railway. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - There is consent to the survey.",64
456,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am reminded of the wiles of the artful trapper, endeavouring to snare the last remnants of the warrigal. All the skill and ingenuity of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and his successor in office have been applied with the utmost ability in a vain attempt to get the Premier of South Australia to say something definite on this subject. that .the Sir JOHN FORREST - To keep his word, in fact.",64
457,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , not to keep his word, but to keep the word of, or some promise made by, a predecessor in office.",64
458,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He was a member of the same Ministry.,64
459,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That does not matter. Even the valiant right honourable gentleman is not going to side-track me on this occasion.,64
460,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member contend that a Minister is not bound by a promise given by the Premier of a Government of which he was a member?,64
461,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I propose to tell the Committee exactly what the position is with regard to the correspondence .which appears to go back to 1900, and which was initiated by Sir Edmund Barton when leading the first Federal Administration. We have been reminded that three Governments have favoured this proposal, and have introduced it to this House.",64
462,Mr BOVNTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Fou r Prime Ministers have supported it .,64
463,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Le t us say four. Three of them never succeeded in reaching anything definite with regard to their proposals.  would not' allow a Prime Minister to do so on one occasion.,65
464,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I propose to-night, to show' why I . think we have gone far enough, so far as action by the present Administration is concerned. I propose to put this matter from my point of .view. It is a strange feature in connection with the subject that, with the exception of the right honourable member for Swan, the only ardent and enthusiastic supporter of this proposal is the right honourable gentleman who at pre'sent occupies the position of Prime Minister. That is an extraordinary position. I should like some little information, which I have no doubt is available if we could get the benefit of it, to explain how it is that the position which an honourable member may occupy in this Chamber, or the party he happens to support, should have some peculiar influence upon the attitude he is likely to assume with regard to this proposal. I should be delighted if some of the honourable gentlemen,' who were recently sitting in this corner, and some who were in Opposition, and who have now been elevated to the Treasury bench, would explain how the judgments which they previously formed have been influenced by the atmosphere of Ministerial responsibility.",65
465,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-To whom does the honourable member refer?,65
466,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"To the Minister of Trade and Customs, for instance. honourable member has always posed as an economist of the first water, and I hare always looked to him for light and leading in matters of economy.",65
467,Mr MCLEAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member will be quite right if he sticks to that.,65
468,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should like to have some information to show what has influenced honourable gentlemen. Even from the honourable gentleman who is in charge of this matter to-night, we have heard nothing very definite in the way of justification for the. position the Government are taking up. Not, perhaps, from anything on record, but from the general trend of his views politically, and his actions in Parliament, the Minister of Defence led me to believe that he was opposed to any proposal of this sort, practically committing the Federal Parliament to an expenditure of £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",65
469,Mr MCCAY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This does not commit Parliament ; it is intended only to secure information.,65
470,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is the first step in the affirmation of a principle. We are being asked to establish a precedent that is going to influence us for all time.,65
471,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Remembe r that the present is a Coalition Government.,65
472,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Coalitions are responsible for a great deal. We saw one effect of a coalition this evening, when a division took place in this chamber. Certain honourable members have gone into alliance with others, and on the very first opportunity those who held out the olive branch to them were deserted by their sworn friends. Are we to have a repetition of fihe same kind of thing on this side of the House?",65
473,Mr HIGGINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,65
474,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If so, I am made only tihe more chary of these coalitions. In one vote this evening, we saw sworn allies running away from their brethren-in-arms. ' Mr MCCAY - They ran away from their own bridge ' Mr KENNEDY - Surely that kind of thing is not going to happen on this side of the House on this question? This is why I am most, anxious, with the honourable member for Indi, to know what really is the opinion of the Ministers of Trade and Customs and Defence. I bad some little That hope that the Minister of Home Affairs, who introduced the subject this evening, would exhibit a desire to proceed on more economical lines than appears to be the case It did, however, seem to me that the honourable gentleman's heart was not in this matter. I honestly believe that the right honourable member for Swan could, have stated a much better case in support of the proposal than did the Minister of Home Affairs. I have been for some time diverted from the delightful correspondence that bas taken place between the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of South and Western Australia. I find that a letter passed from Sir Edmund Barton to the Premier of South Australia, in 1903, referring to correspondence which took place in 1901. It would appear that a period of .two years had been allowed to elapse before f he attack on this subject was renewed. Sir Edmund Barton wrote, in 1903:I have the honour to invite your attention to the correspondence on the subject of the transcontinental railway that passed between us in igoi, and particularly to your letter of the 31st July of that year, in which you enclosed a communication from Mr Holder, then Premier of South Australia, dated ist February, 1900. That, I assume, is the historic letter referred to in which the Premier of South Australia made a promise that he would put no obstacles in the way of future negotiations with regard to the construction of this line. But, so far as. I understand, he certainly did not pledge his Parliament in any particular way.",65
475,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He said, "" I underdeparted take.""",66
476,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We shall deal with the letter later on. Then the Premier of given during a South Australia replied to this effect:In reply to your letter of the igth inst., I have the honour to inform you, as I have previously informed the Honourable the Premier of Western Australia, that it would not only be unjustifiable, but useless to submit to Parliament a Bil l for the construction of this railway (of which this State's share of the cost would amount to a very large sum) without being in a position to give Parliament information as to the cost of the scheme. That was in 1903. Then we have that able exponent of the English language, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, coming on the scene in his capacity as Prime Minister. In a very long letter, addressed to the Premier of South Australia, the honourable and learned member made every effort to pin down the former to something definite, but he absolutely failed to do so: The honourable and learned member even made an appeal, which is evidence that there was no intention, at . that time on the part of the Commonwealth Parliament, so far as he was concerned as Prime Minister, to embark on any cost whatever until it' was known exactly what the position of the Commonwealth wasuntil the assent of both States had been given to the proposal. This is the appeal he made in a letter under date 16th October, 1903 :The approximate cost of the work is expressly set out in the reports of the Board of Engineersin-Chief, dated T2th March and 27th July, 190.1, which has been presented to the Federal Parliament. That Board consisted, as you are aware, of the best authorities on railway construction to be found in Australia. Its members were nominated by the several States, including South Australia. They devoted much time to the consideration of their subject, and their estimate may be taken to be the most definite that could be obtained until the line is marked out. That is the pointed reply of the Prime Minister to the Premier of South Australia. The letter proceededThe request for further information comes unexpectedly at this stage, when all the knowledge that could be expected prior to a detailed examination of the route has already been acquired. Even that would .piob'aly alter the sum quoted, but very slightly, if at all. To make a complete survey might cost ,£20,000, and before asking the Commonwealth Parliament to approve of this expenditure, it is only reasonable that the consent necessary under sub-section 34 of'section 51 of the Constitution should be obtained. Why is it that as Prime Minister he never from that principle ? He refused, and never did submit to this House a proposal to spend one single shilling even on survey until that consent, which was not his reign as Prime Minister, was obtained.",66
477,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He never repudiated the consent given.,66
478,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Bu the never got the consent which was laid down as a stipulation. The letter went onYour Government and Parliament have much better information now as to the probable cost of the work than when Mr Holder's promise to the Government of Western Australia was made in 1900, and I should be glad if you could see your way to consider this sufficient for present purposes, and at the earliest date pass an Act authorizing the Federal Parliament to proceed with the woTk. This has already been done by the Legislature of Western Australia,",66
479,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is all right.,66
480,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What I want th-; Committee to note is that, having made this request to the Premier of South Australia, the honourable and learned member for Bal ; larat, as Prime Minister, refused, and never did submit to the House a proposal to spend one single shilling.",66
481,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Prime Minister did so, before his Government went out of office.",66
482,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Certainl y not.,66
483,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This same message was laid on the table.,66
484,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But it was never dealt with in Committee.,66
485,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member may remember that I .submitted the motion, which was opposed by the other side for the reason that there was a political crisis. But the message and the Bill were before the House.",66
486,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But that was as far as we got.,67
487,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The proposal of the line. Government was made.,67
488,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This brings me to May, 1904, when, apparently, there been a change of Government, and the following telegram was sent on the 7th, by the then Prime Minister to the Premier of South that promise. Australia:Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway under with him. consideration. Shall be glad to be advised whether, in event Commonwealth Parliament favourably considering question, you w pared to pass Act authorizing Federal authority to proceed with work of construction. are aware, this has already been done by lature of Western Australia. Greatly obliged if you will favour with early reply. The reply to that telegram is to this effect:- Replying your wire 7th instant, Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta railway, I advised your predecessor on 22nd February that if it was considered necessary for the State to pass an Act to give the Federal Government power to make the proposed survey, we would be agreeable to ask Parliament when next assembled to pass a short measure with that object. I do not suppose you intend to ask your Parliament to pass legislation providing for the construction until survey is made and some reliable estimate prepared .of probable cost.",67
489,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is right.,67
490,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Honourable members latter, will observe the diplomacy and tact with which the leader of the Government South Australia evades the point which was put to him point blank; he does not answer the question, but simply dodge's it.",67
491,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He wanted more information.,67
492,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is a subsequent message from the Prime Minister, which is bility. as follows:- Your wire 10th instant, Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway. Shall be kindly advise me disposition of your Government towards question of authorizing construcit tion. The possession of your views upon specific point will be of considerable value to Government in considering question of survey. Will you kindly favour me early reply? The reply to that is to this effect: Replying your wire n t h , Kalgoorlie Port Augusta railway, when survey is made reliable estimates of probable cost are prepared, we should be pleased to advise you as what action we shall then ask the State Parliaman, ment to take. The Premier of South Australia was beginning to make up his mind in a certain direction, but he had certainly decided that he was not going to commit his Parliament or people in the slightest degree to this",67
493,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He repudiated the promise made by the present Speaker when had Premier of South Australia.,67
494,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Premier of South Australia says that he is not tied by,67
495,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We do not agree,67
496,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is a matter of opinion; and we know we are tied by noi l l be prething but Acts of Parliament. As you Sir JOHN FORREST - That may be a LegisVictorian, but it is not a British idea.",67
497,Mr HIGGINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the honourable member for Moira not tied by the caucus?,67
498,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I ' do not acknowledge any caucus. The Premier of South Australia goes o n : The question of making survey has already been decided by your predecessors in office. Unless you intend to repudiate their obligations you need no further information in order to justify you in asking your Parliament to provide necessary funds for that purpose. Honourable members will see the ingenuity of this gentleman, who refuses to be tied himself in any way, or committed to anything in particular, but who attempts to impress the Prime Minister with the idea that the by some decision of his predecessor in office, was committed to a survey. That, of however, is not correct.",67
499,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The message was laid on the table by the Government.,67
500,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the Government desire to expend money for any particular purpose, they must get the authority of 1 Parliament, and then take the responsi",67

502,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I contend that before is justifiable to spend one shilling on a this survey, there must be the consent of the States through which the line will pass.",67
503,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that is rather a narrow view'.,67
504,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The view is not so and wide as the line, of course. It was comand mencing to dawn on the Prime Minister that to he was dealing with rather an astute gentleand he sent the following telegram :Regret you appear unwilling to intimate probable attitude of your Government towards Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway until iafter considerable expense that survey willnecessitate will have been incurred. May I take it that unless survey discloses facts not now known, involving very substantial increase on present estimates of cost, you will advise your Parliament pass Bill conferring necessary authority on Commonwealth to construct line, in accordance with promise of South Australian Government when Mr Holder was Premier? You will readily perceive that Federal Parliament may naturally .be reluctant to authorize substantial preliminary expenditure unless they have some assurance that such expenditure will not be rendered resultless by your subsequent unwillingness to act in accordance with promise referred to. In reference to latter part of your gram. The question of adopting or modifying the policy of our predecessors is a matter for this Government to determine. The latter portion is in exact agreement with the position I took up in justification of the attitude of Mr Jenkins. The honourable member for Bland, who was thep. Prime Minister, said that he-was not tied by the' determination of his predecessors, except in so far .as the policy of his Government determined he should go. It will be seen, that the attitude of the then Prime Minister was that the:Government should not move at all, and although they did submit a proposal to the House to spend money on the survey, he intimated to the Premier of South Australia .that the Commonwealth Parliament could not be asked to authorize the until the assent of the Australian Parliament had been obtained. I"" contend that we are in exactly the same position today. I venture to say that the honourable member for B.land should, in fairness, and in consequence of that undertaking, conveyed to the Premier of Sout'h Australia, oppose the expenditure of even one shilling on a survey, until the consent of South Australia is obtained.",67
505,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Premier of South Australia expressed to me months ago the opinion that there would be no opposition. Mr KENNEDY:-What is the use of coming here; and saying what the opinion of the man in the street is, when we 'have an official statement from the Premier of South Australia?",68
506,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member mean in reference to the survey, or the railway?",68
507,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am dealing with the survey. The reply to that query was this:- ' Replying to yours of 13th, I have nothing to add to mine of 12th inst., further than to state that survey and reliable estimates are always prepared before we ask Parliament by Act to sanction, the construction of any line of railway. We have in the telegrams and correspondence which passed between the Prime Minister-and the Premier of South Australia, a clear indication that the Premier of South Australia refused point blank, in the first instance, to acknowledge any obligation to be bound by any promise made by his predecessor with regard to the construction of the line. Even should the report be favourable, we have no intimation telefrom him that be will ask the South Australian Parliament to consent to the construction of theline.",68
508,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We take that risk.,68
509,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I venture to say that we cannot, under the Constitution, take that risk. The first absolute essential before we spend any money is to obtain the assent of the Parliaments of the States through which the line is to be constructed. What right havewe to spend money upon a survey? Is it. not part and parcel of the expenditure debited to the construction of the line ?",68
510,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member is now dealing with the railway, not with the survey. expenditure Mr HIGGINS - We certainly cannot South construct the railway unless South Australia assents.",68
511,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; and I go further, and say that we should not be justified in spending money on a survey until we have authority to construct the line. What is the position of the people of Western Australia? There is a tendency on the part of some persons to rush to their friends when they have a ""good thing""- instead of taking advantage of it themselves. They seem to be anxious to hand it over to the first man they meet in the street. Go into any of our trading marts, and you will meet many persons who have "" good things "" to dispose of. Go to the Stock Exchange amongst our mining community. There are always men who have ""good things"" to dispose of. Go to our stock saleyards. There are persons there who have the "" cheapest and finest"" stock in Australia to sell; but if you take. the stock at their price you are "" left "" every time. I agree with the man who once gave a piece of advice to the respected ' Judge of our Insolvency Court in Victoria, as regards accepting these ""good things"" from friends. After the man's case had been heard, and' his certificategranted, he said, "" Take this from me, your Honour. If a friend comes to you with a ' good thing,' club him; knock him down."" That is the position the Commonwealth Parliament should take today with respect, to this ""good thing."" . The best thing the Commonwealth Parliament can do is, to say most emphatically and conclusively to Western Australia, "" If this is such a ' good thing ' take the whole benefit of it to yourselves.""",68
512,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-Han d it over to a private company.,69
513,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , I have always been opposed to the construction of railways by private enterprise in Australia. I have always been an advocate for the State ownership of railways. If there is warrant for the construction of a railway, the State can construct it, and work it as economically; and as much in the interests of the people concerned, as any private company can.",69
514,Mr HIGGINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member must be a Socialist. He should come over here.,69
515,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is not a man on God's earth who is not a Socialist to some extent. I have no dread of the word "" Socialism."" - I have no fear of being called a "" Socialist."" There are various interpretations of the word. Where is - the man who is not a Socialist to some extent, as we understand Socialism in the every-day sense of the word? He is not to be found.",69
516,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable and learned member for Werriwa says he is not a Socialist.,69
517,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the honourable and learned member for Werriwa takes advantage of our postal facilities, and other Government agencies. What is the use of trotting out that .bogy ? If there is to be no loss, why does not Western Australia"" construct the line? If there is to be a loss, what proportion of it is Western Australia prepared to pay ? The late Prime Minister made an inquiry on this subject in a telegram dated 6th May, 1904. He telegraphed to the Premier of Western AustraliaRepresentations made to me, feeling of members of Federal Parliament towards proposal favours belief that opposition would be materially lessened if your Government indicated willingness contribute stated proportion of loss, if any, during the first ten years. As'matter under consideration of Cabinet, early reply desired. That was a line of inquiry for which the late Prime Minister is entitled to great credit. It showed a desire on his part to deal with a business matter in a business-like way. But what do we find on the part of the Premier of Western Australia? We find the same astuteness and - slipperiness displayed again.",69
518,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There was no slipperiness about him.,69
519,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That may be, but the astuteness is there. He was jasked point blank to state what proportion of the loss his State was prepared to bear-1 0 per cent., 20 per cent., or one-half, as the case might be. He was requested to make specific proposals as to what proportion of the loss his State would bear over and above the per capita share. What was his reply ? His telegram is dated 18th May. Therefore he had given due consideration to the subject. He had taken twelve days to reply.",69
520,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He might have been away.,69
521,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the Premiers of States do not usually go away from telegraphic communication.,69
522,Mr HIGGINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I happen to know that he was away in a distant part of the country at the time, and that' he had to consult his colleagues and others.",69
523,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is evident he did not reply without giving due consideration to a matter of such importance. ' What Avas his reply ? On condition that Commonwealth is allowed a free hand as to route and gauge, of railway; this State will be prepared for ten years after line constructed, to bear a share of any loss in excess of our contribution on a population basis. It would be premature to fix ,exact proportion we are prepared to pay at this stage, but I am confident that it will be liberal, and satisfy the Federal Parliament of our sincerity in this connection, and our belief that the work will soon be a paying one. He was asked to name a fixed proportion in clear and definite terms. He evaded that question, and answered in general terms that his State was prepared to pay a share under certain conditions. That illustrates the absurdity of relying on promises of this kind unless they are made officially as between recognised governing authorities or corporations. What would have been the value of such a promise made at that time? The then Premier of Western. Australia has gone out of office. He was honest, and if he had remained in power it would have been all right. But, as is proved in the case of South Australia, his successor could act at his own' sweet will as to how far would respect the promise of his predecesber sor. In face of what has actually in South Australia",69
524,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ver y discreditable. . Mr KENNEDY - That may or may Perth not be so, but there are the facts, and that is what we have to deal with. Therefore, I urge that this Parliament is not justiaccess fied in spending one shilling of money, even on a survey, until the assent of States through which the line will pass has been obtained. Then will be the time to talk of the merits and demerits of line, and the basis upon which tests are made. There is no fixity of route yet. Then we have Mr O'Connor basing his estimates on money borrowed at 3 per cent. How can any man think of going into markets of the world today and borrowing money at 3 per cent, on even gilt-edged securities ?",70
525,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member need not go further than the survey. He need not apply Kyabram prinney, ciples on that point.",70
526,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable memtravelling ber is not justified in accusing me of being goorlie. a Kyabramite. Why does not the State which is going to get the whole benefit from rate. the line, go to the expense of the survey, and then come with a clear case on reliable authority, and ask this Parliament to obtain the consent of South Australia to the construction of the line? If there is to be any development, will not Western Australia derive the benefit? Who else is asking for the construction of this line day?",70
527,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That does not prove that the benefit will be all one way.,70
528,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The right honourable member has to prove that those who are not asking for the construction of the railway, and will have to find the greater portion the money, or accept a liability, will derive some benefit. What an absurdity it is talk about the graziers or producers of toria or New South Wales sending by land for 1,100 miles, when there would be sea carriage parallel with the railway !",70
529,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would' not be do? parallel.,70
530,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Surely the right I honourable member does not think that he talking to an assembly of lunatics, submits a proposal of that sort. We have some sane men in our midst he Sir JOHN FoRREST.^-The honourable memdoes not know the facts. It has to be occurred brought back 400 miles.",70
531,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is because of the rabid conservatism of the people of and Fremantle. Instead of allowing the miners on the gold-fields to get direct communication to the seaboard, and cheaper to the eastern States, they compel a them to go to Perth and Fremantle. The the right honourable member talks about the advantages which the eastern States would derive from the construction of this railthe way. We might have a few wealthy persons, to whom occasionally the saving of a day would be a matter of consideration, and who, under such circumstances, might take advantage of a railway journey of three the days from Adelaide, or four days from Melbourne, or five days from Sydney.",70
532,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It will not take sd long as that.,70
533,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It spoils a day now to get from Melbourne to Adelaide or Sydand the engineer, to whom the right honourable member has referred, gives 36 hours as the time likely to be occupied in between Port Augusta and Kal",70
534,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a very slow,70
535,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It may be slow.,70
536,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The distance is only 1,100 miles, and the train could travel at the rate of 40 miles an hour.",70
537,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the statement of a very able authority, and I am toprepared to accept it until I can get something better. The right honourable member talks about the great advantages which the producers in the eastern States would derive from a railway traversing this uninhabited and waterless country, by getting produce carried more cheaply by land than by sea. But why do not the legislators of Western of Australia do their duty .to the people of its great mining centres, in which there are, I to admit, many and profitable consumers of Vicour produce, and give them direct commuproduce nication to the seaboard?",70
538,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable 1 member think he knows better than they,70
539,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the opinion have expressed, and it has been expressed is here; too, by an honourable member reprewhen he senting the gold-fields.",70
540,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who was thrown out on that very a'ccount.,70

542,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think that the honourable member should bring in local politics.,71
543,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not bringing in local politics. But when this issue is raised, and the right honourable member has quoted western authorities, surely he cannot take exception to me when I meet him on his own ground.",71
544,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member does not know much about the matter?,71
545,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is a discredited authority . 1,71
546,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the statement has also been made in the Parliament of Western Australia.,71
547,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In Parliament there are always partizans.,71
548,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not questioning that view. If the honourable member for Perth says that this gentleman is a discredited authority, I am prepared to accept his assurance. But, would it not be to the material advantage of the miners in Kal goorlie and Coolgardie if they had direct communication with Esperance, instead of having to go round by Perth and Fremantle ?",71
549,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They do not wish to go to Esperance.,71
550,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course they do not, because it might affect the vested interests of Perth and Fremantle.",71
551,Sir JOHN IFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would cost nearly a million of money to make that railway.,71
552,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We have the same thing in Victoria, and I venture to say in every other State of the Commonwealth. On the eastern and western coasts of Victoria our railways compete with water carriage. Expensive railways, constructed from Melbourne ' to western districts, are starved, so to speak, and their services are starved because they are brought into competition with water carriage. Will any one who is acquainted with the cost of produce, perishable or otherwise, argue for a moment that it can be carried as cheaply by railway as by water? That should, I think, settle for all time the question of the great advantage which the producers in the eastern States would derive from the construction of a railway to Kalgoorlie.",71
553,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thei r produce would not be carried by water altogether. There would be first a railway journey, next a water journey, and then another railway journey.",71
554,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not necessarily. But take Melbourne as a centre.,71
555,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The gold-fields are 400 miles closer than Fremantle. The produce has now to go to Fremantle, and come back to the gold-fields.",71
556,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware of those facts. But take Melbourne as a shipping port, and say there is a line from the goldfields of Western Australia to the nearest seaport, which is unquestionably on its south coast, and a line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie",71
557,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A line from Esperance would cost £1,000,000 to construct. The honourable member wants us to spend that, I suppose?",71
558,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is not so much as £5,000,000.",71
559,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That line would have been constructed long ago if circumstances had justified its construction.,71
560,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am now dealing with the alternative proposal of spending £1,000,000 on one line, as against spending £5,000,000 on the other line.",71
561,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, if the honourable member pleases.",71
562,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall take that sum for the present time, and deal later on with the estimates, and see how they have been arrived at. Will any sane man argue for a moment, that, under the conditions I have stated, it would be possible to send produce from Melbourne as cheaply by railway to Kalgoorlie as by ship to Esperance, and thence by railway to Kalgoorlie ?",71
563,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no railway from Esperance, though.",71
564,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I know that there is not; but I have submitted a proposition.,71
565,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It would cost £1,000,000 by the time the harbour was made.",71
566,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The cost of this Transcontinental Railway is given by this authority at £4,400,000 . But that estimate includes no provision for contingencies.",71
567,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ver y much more than is necessary for water, though.",71
568,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The estimate includes no provision for' interest during the period of construction.,71
569,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes ; I think there is some interest included.,72
570,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall be delighted to have it pointed out to me from his report.,72
571,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think he does mention interest.,72
572,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He does mention interest, and he states what the 3 per cent, interest will amount to, provided that the line be made within a certain period.",72

574,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No interest is inboat fare worse ? cluded in this sum of £4,400,000. But, taking the sum total, his estimates amount to practically £5,000,000, and are the assumption that the money would be obtained at 3 per cent. No one will venture to say, for a moment, that it could be obtained at that rate today, even with edged securities. Then, with regard to estimates of revenue, what does he He states the number' of passengers velling per week, and he calmly assumes that if the railway were constructed, one of them would travel by railway instead of by boat.",72
575,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not all of them ,72
576,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; he says The average number of passengers each way per week, between Fremantle States, for the last three years, has been about 400, and it has been fairly uniform for each of the three years. Counting both journ,eys, this way means 800 passengers, per week, viz., over a year, the majority of whom reside upon, or are connected with the gold-fields, and would is not more than half consequently probably go by overland railway in order to save time and to keep in touch their, business, unless it involved considerable extra expense. Mr O'Connor then deals with the question of stock traffic. I wish to again illustrate the position in that regard. In Victoria, when stock conditions are very favourable Queensland, we hare one of the largest stock markets to be found in Australia. seasons of the year a proportion of the fat stock coming into our market come from north of New South Wales, the south-west of Queensland, and even from the Northern Territory of South Australia. Would any stock-owner attempt to send any stock by train for more than 200 miles to our stock market? Only an absolute necessity such as the saving of stock from starvacost tion will impel a stock-owner to allow stock to be. more than twenty-four hours in a train. And no man will leave stock in a railway truck for that length of pay ?^ time. What an absurdity it is, then, to talk about sending fat stock into Kalgoorlie !",72
577,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They send fat stock long distances by train in New South Wales.,72
578,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They do under certain conditions, but where stock have been more than twenty-four hours in a truck, I venture to say that the owner has known beforehand that he could paddock them to",72
579,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do not stock carried on a,72
580,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,When stock fare worse on a boat than they do in a railway based on truck they go overboard.,72
581,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does not that count?,72
582,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course it does. giltIt accounts for the stock not being his trucked on the railways. It is besay? yond my comprehension how any sane traman can talk about getting a revenue from the carriage of live stock by raileveryway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. With regard to perishable produce, the position is practically the same. The only revenue that would be obtainable from traffic over the railway would be from the carriage of passengers and mails.",72
583,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is and the eastern too pessimistic.,72
584,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How is the railfrom Melbourne to Sydney - a 40,000 line only 600 miles in length, which the distance from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, leaving with out of account the distance from Adelaide to Port Augusta-to be regarded as a commercial undertaking? It must be remembered that in Melbourne and Sydney we have two cities with a population of about 500,000 each, while the intervening country in isclosely settled throughout, and devoted, fat to farming and pastoral pursuits. Yet, At notwithstanding these enormous terminal populations, which should insure a large rethe venue from the carriage of passengers and mails, and the enormous traffic to be picked up at intermediate stations, due to the agricultural and pastoral pursuits followed in the intervening country, that line today, fat after having been open for traffic over twenty years, barely pays interest on the of itsconstruction? That being so, I ask what hope is there that a line connecting a town like Adelaide with the fat mining centres of Western Australia will",72
585,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wester n Australia is the best market in the world for farm produce.,73
586,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The whole population of the State is only about 250,000.",73
587,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There will be millions of people there in a few years.,73
588,Mr LIDDELL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It will be the most ,prosperous State of them all.",73
589,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Undoubtedly ; and when it has a population of millions the construction of the proposed railway may be justified. But why should wespend money now to make a line across 600 miles of what, according to Mr O'Connor, is uninhabited, uncultivated, and waterless country ? I understand that on the southern coast of Western Australia there is a fair shelter for steamers of moderate draught; but how is it that there is not even pastoral settlement there?",73
590,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Because there is neither water nor feed for stock.,73
591,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Me n have gone from the settled districts of Victoria to the Ord River, and the Cambridge Gulf country; but surely they would have taken up the country on the south coast, which is so much nearer, if it were of any value. The' representatives of Western Australia speak of the great .advantages which the eastern States will derive from the construction of the proposed Transcontinental Railway-; but if the country through which it would pass is so good, why has not its proximity to the sea coast brought about its development? The reasons are that the limestone' crops out on the surface; that, according to the information available, the rainfall is only about five inches per annum; and that the country will not keep a rabbit. No matter how many railways were constructed there, that country would never support settlement, unless Nature became more bountiful.",73
592,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Million s of acres along the route' of the proposed line have been applied for, but the land is being withheld for settlement until' the construction of the proposed line is authorized.",73
593,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I see there the hand of the gambler and the land shark again.,73
594,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The applications1 speak of have been made by pastoralists.,73
595,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"PastoTalist s are as human, and just as likely to gamble in land, as are other people. Why was not this land taken up twenty years ago, if it is good land? Why was it not taken up rapidly as the country in the more remote north-western parts of Western Australia, irrigation works. or as rapidly as the dry country in western New South Wales and Queensland? That country is practically waterless for great portions of the year; but it gives good pasture for stock, and the pastoralists who took it up, have been able to make provision for the conservation of water in it. But, although bores have been put down to a depth of 500 feet along the route of the proposed line, no water has been obtained.",73
596,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes ; the operations have been very successful.,73
597,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The water is salt.,73
598,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It certainly would not pay to condense salt water for stock. The country I speak of has not been settled, because it is unfit for settlement, and has no possibilities of development. I hope that before the discussion closes, other reasons beyorid those given by the Government for the introduction of the Bill, will be advanced in support of this proposal to spend £20,000 without the consent of the States, whioh is required by the Constitution, on an undertaking of this kind. If the construction of a transcontinental line would be such a good thing for Western Australia as those who represent that State allege that it would be, surely so prosperous and wealthy a community could afford to spend £20,000 in surveying the route.",73
599,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The people of Western Australia have treated the people of the eastern States very well.,73
600,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If they could have obtained better conditions in other markets, the people of Western Australia would not have hesitated to obtain their supplies elsewhere.",73
601,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No . We are patriotic.,73
602,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wester n Australia has been peopled by Victorians and New South Welshmen; but those who have gone there are only human, and if they could have got better treatment elsewhere, they would not have dealt with the traders and produce merchants of the eastern. States. I should not have attempted to traverse the possibilities of the line, had it not been for I the insistence of the right honourable member for Swan upon his view of the position ; I should have been content to rest my case on the undesirableness of the precedent wthich it is sought to establish'.",73
603,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It may be awkward for as the honourable member when we come to deal with proposals for Commonwealth,73
604,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall be prepared to deal with all such questions as they arise. I was twitted by some honourable members opposite as to my position in connection with this proposal, but I told them at the time that I should be able to explain my position, if I were given an opportunity to do so. As I have some further remarks to make, and the hour is late, I ask the Minister of Home Affairs to allow the debate to be adjourned. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.38 p.m.",74
