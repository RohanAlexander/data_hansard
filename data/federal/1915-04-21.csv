9,Mr TUDOR,DREDGER FOR WESTERN,"Te n or twelve days ago, a cablegram to that effect from the Secretary of State was received by the Prime Minister.

12,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,At the first investigation the charee was made that Captain AUSTRALIA. Brown had been drunk. Can the Minister say whether the subsequent investigation proved bhat this was not the case?,5
13,Mr JENSEN,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,The medical officer who attended Captain Brown stated distinctly that he was not drunk at the time. EXPORTATION OF HIDES .,5
14,Mr RODGERS,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"In order to preserve supplies to the Defence Department, the Government have placed a prohibition on the exportation of hides- a course with, which we all agree; but as there are many hides, particularly those taken from fallen stock during the period of drought, which are unsuitable to the requirements of the Defence Department, will the Minister of Trade and Customs take steps to have the embargo so modified as to give to those particular hides the benefit of sale in the world's market?",5
15,Mr TUDOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"T he honourable member has said the exportation of hides was prohibited on defence grounds: but as I understand that out of every thousand hides purchased, even of the proper weight for soles and uppers as required for defence purposes, only about 200 are found to be of any use after tanning, I shall be pleased to have an inquiry into what the honourable member asks. At present, in order to get the requisite number, the Defence Department has to purchase five times as many hides as it requires. MORPHETVILLETRAINING CAMP. KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A",5
16,Mr YATES,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"Has the attention of the Assistant Minister of Defence been drawn to a recent report in the press to the effect that a man who was found in possession of 300 lbs. of tea, 180 lbs. of sugar, and 34 tins of jam, alleged to have been stolen from the Morphetville Training Camp, was acquitted? What action does the Minister propose to take, in order to bring the culprit to justice ?",6
17,Mr JENSEN,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"I have not seen the statement in the press, and know nothing of the matter, but I shall have inquiries made. MAIL CONTRACTS.",6
18,Mr ATKINSON,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"Is the Post and Telegraph Department considering the matter of granting some relief to people who have contracted for carrying mails in country districts, but who find that, owing to the high price of fodder, they are losing money over their contracts?",6
19,Mr SPENCE,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"The Department is considering every case on its merits, and is going as far as it can in the direction of giving assistance.",6
20,Mr MCGRATH,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"I have received from Mr Oxenham, the Secretary to the Postmaster-General's Department, the following letter: The only fair and reasonable course which, it is considered, the Department can take in this matter is to consent to reduce either the frequency or alter the mode of conveyance, as may best suit the circumstances of the case, and to make a less proportionate reduction in the amount of the subsidy .where the circumstances warrant such reduction. I ask the Postmaster-General whether the intention of the Government is not to give valued mail contractors any increases, but to reduce mail services to the people in the growers districts concerned ?",6
21,Mr SPENCE,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,I am sure that the honourable member will see that after tenbrings ders have been let under a public contract system the Department cannot give in creases. SOCIALISTS INSYDNEY .,6

24,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"Is it true, as reported in the press, that there has been some difficulty with the employees in connection with the plate-layer at the western end of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway with reference to the amount of work to he done daily by the plate-layer, and if the statement is true, will the Minister of Home Affairs take the House into his confidence in regard to the matter?",6
25,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"The r e has been some complaint to the effect that more work might be done, but as the Engineerin-Chief is now in Kalgoorlie inquiring into the matter, it would be as well to await his return. RICE FOR POULTRY .",6
26,Mr BURCHELL,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"In connection with a proposal that has emanated from Western Australia to use rice as food for poultry, owing to the shortage of wheat, maize, and oats. I would like to ascertain from the Minister of Trade and Customs the quantity of rice which was imported during the last twelve months, the value of the same, and the amount of duty paid; and I would also like to know whether any step has been taken to remit the duty, or to give any rebate to the poultry growers in Western Australia in order to enable them to continue their poultry farming?",6
27,Mr TUDOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"T he honourable member having written to me, notifying me of his intention to ask this question, I have obtained the following information: In 1913, 557,359 centals of uncleaned rice, at £222,913, were imported-chiefl y from India and Java. The Australian production is small, and usually retain the yield for their own consumption owing to lack of transport facilities in districts suitable for rice. Duty of 3s. 4d. per central added to cost the landed price of uncleaned rice to about 13s. 4d. per central-o r 1 3-5d. per lb. Compared with maize at 7s. per bushel, or l j d . per lb., or wheat at 8s. 6d. per bushel, or 1 2-3d. per lb., rice in the husk at 1 3-5d. per lb. is not an economical poultry food, but at 1 l-5d. per lb. (i.e., minus duty of 3s. 4d. per central) uncleaned rice would be almost as cheap a? maize or wheat now that abundant to regreen-stuff is available. The residue from cleaned rice contains good food, but is a dear food unless the is very low owing to the large proportion of husk. W it h regard to the latter portion of the question, that relating to the remission of the duty, I may add that the Government have considered this matter, and have decided that they cannot advise that the request be granted at the present time. I hope that the item on the Tariff will shortly be discussed. DEFENCE SUPPLIES.",6
28,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"H as the Defence Department taken any precautions with a view of protecting the foodstuffs supplied to our soldiers in the field as far as weight is concerned, and has it found, for instance, that tins of jam contain three ounces less than they are supposed to contain ; and that there is similar shortage in regard to other foodstuffs)",7
29,Mr JENSEN,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"When the Defence Department makes contracts for the delivery or purchase of jams, it always buys the jams in accordance with the quantity contained in each t in . That condition is specifically noted in the contract. INTER - STA TE COMMISSION AND THE TARIFF .",7
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,Will the Minister of Trade and Customs state whether he can hold out any hope that when considering the Tariff members will haven ^ e r e of the Inter-State Commission available?,7
31,Mr TUDOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"I expected to have a progress report, dealing with a small set of items in the Tariff, in my possession today. Of course, I should have to peruse the report before laying it on the table of the House. I do not think that the Inter-State Commission will be able to make available a report on a very large number of items before the House has an opportunity of dealing with the Tariff.",7
32,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,Does not the Minister consider that every member of the House ought to be placed in possession of the report of the Inter-State Commission as soon as the Minister himself receives it ?,7
33,Mr TUDOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,I think the Minister in charge of the Department is entitled to peruse the report before presenting it to Parliament.,7
34,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,Will the Minister say what public good can be served by his withholding such a report from Parliament- a report which cannot be changed before Parliament is given an opportunity of seeing it?,7
35,Mr TUDOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,T he report will not be withheld from Parliament. It will be laid on the table as soon as I have had an opportunity of looking through it .,7
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"I should like to ask the Minister whether the report of the Inter-State Commission is addressed to him personally, and whether he can put forward any possible excuse for keeping the report from Parliament for one moment %",7
37,Mr FISHER,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,The Minister has not said that he will keep it from Parliament.,7
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,But the Minister may take several weeks in perusing the report.,7
39,Mr T ODOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"The Inter-State Commission Act provides that the report shall be laid on the table of the House within one month of its presentation. I certainly would not hold up the report, but, the document being addressed to me, I do think that I have the right to look through it before I lay it on the table.  all the facts as well as you ?",7
40,Mr TUDOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"Honourable members will get all the facts. I have today laid on the table between 1,000 and 2,000 pages of evidence taken by the P to r Inter-State Commission.

43,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"I should like to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that not only in the Constitution, but under the Inter-State Commission Act , the Commission is charged with the duty of investigating matters which, in its opinion, are in the public interest, and its report would not necessarily be made to the Minister at all. The only matters referred to in the Act amongst which the Tariff could be included are those mentioned in paragraph I of section 16, "" Other matters referred to the Commission by either Blouse of the Parliament, by resolution, for investigation."" I ask the Minister whether that does not give honourable members the right to have that information as soon as the report is presented by the Commission? Mr TUDOR, - The report will be laid before Parliament as soon as it is presented. Does the honourable member wish me to lay on the table an envelope addressed to me without my having broken the seal ? I say that I have the right to open any communication addressed to mo before I place it on the table of the House.",7
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,Has the Minister any idea whether the report of the Commission will deal with the items in the order in which they appear in the Tariff?,8
45,Mr TUDOR,COMPENSATI ON TO CAPTAI N,"T he Chairman of the Inter-State Commission informed me last week of a report upon a series of items which are scattered throughout the Tariff, but principally towards the end.

50,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONESIN COUNTR Y,"In view of the substantial losses incurred by the telephone branch of the Postal Department, will the Postmaster-General consider the matter of making universal use of the small pole in country construction, and adopting the system of constructing the lines by local labour? In Victoria, the cost has been reduced by over 100 per cent, by the adoption of this system.",8
51,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONESIN COUNTR Y,"The policy of the Department is to have the construction work done as cheaply as possible, having due regard ,to efficiency. Efficient results are necessary, otherwise the subscribers complain. In some places the poles can be used. The policy is governed by the locality.",8
52,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONESIN COUNTR Y,"Is the Postmaster General aware that this system of construction has been tested in Victoria? I understand it is not general throughout the the Commonwealth; but I know that its adoption has reduced the cost of construction by one half. I should like to know whether the Postmaster-General will see that the system is made general, because there is no doubt that it would save the franking of men and poles for hundreds of miles.",8

Payments have been made to the States on or about the 15th of each month, the first payment having been made in December. The amount paid to each State monthly represents one-twelfth of the total amount to be advanced to the State. £350,000 and £100,000 included in above total were advanced to Victoria and South Australia respectively in November, 1914, but those amounts will be deducted from the instalments due to those States in a future month. 3. The nature of the securities to be given by the States will be in the form of Treasury bills. Each monthly instalment will be repayable by the State two years after the date at which such instalment was paid to the State. The rate of interest to be charged will be that which, including all charges, it costs the Commonwealth to raise money for its own purposes. The loan raised by the British Government is repayable between 1st March, 1925, and 1st March, 1928. The price of the issue was 95 per cent., and the rate of interest 3b per cent. It is estimated that the rate of interest, including amortization, to be paid by the Commonwealth will be about 4-J per cent. In the meantime the States will be charged at this rate, but. it has been agreed with them that an adjustment will be made later. ESTIMATES , 1914-15. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 16th A p r i l , vide page 2416): THE PARLIAMENT. Division 1 (The Senate), £7,914. Upon which Mr FINLAYSON had movedThat the item "" Clerk of the Senate, £1,000."" be reduced by £100.",11
70,Mr FINLAYSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Brisbane) [3.45] The discussion which ensued upon my amendment on the last sitting day afforded me considerable gratification. I was very glad that so many honourable members expressed their sympathy with the object I had in view, altliough they complained somewhat of the method by which I purposed reaching it . of the Opposition was good enough to suggest that the effort might well have been made on some other item. 3,900,000 It is quite sufficient for my pur2,600,000 pose to point out that I took action on the very first item in the Estimates in connection with which provision was made for an increase of salary. ' I submitted ray £18,000,000 amendment with the intention that, if carried, it should be an instruction to the Government, as I stated at the time, that during the continuance of the war no in 1,975,000 crements should be granted to any officer 1,183,335 in receipt of a salary of over £300 per 416,665 annum. H ad I waited for a later item, as suggested by the Leader of the Opposi£7,950,000 tion, I might have been charged that I was specially singling out an officer for a reduction of salary. I was particularly anxious to avoid anything of the kind. I said on Friday that I had no particular individual in view, and that my proposal was intended to be of the most general character. I was therefore sorry to hear several honourable members introduce in dividuals into the discussion. I hope that, if the matter is to be further debated, we shall not deal with individuals otlier than any who may be directly concerned in the item actually dealt with. I am not at all concerned with the question as to whether or not the Clerk of the Senate is entitled to an increase of £ 1 0 0 per annum, but I am much concerned with the proposal that highly-salaried officials shall be granted increases at the present time. This is not a time when, in the interests of the people and of the finances, salaries should be increased. Salaries are not being increased outside, save'in the case of men who can prove that their wages are insufficient to meet the increased cost of living. That argument does not apply to the officials to whom my amendment extends, since I do uot propose that increments should be held back, save in the case of officers receiving salaries of over £300 per annum. The Leader of the Opposition asked why I singled out those who were in receipt of £300 per annum and over, ancl said that I might prevent an officer from receiving an increase of £ 5 or £ 1 0 per annum to which he was entitled. If I made the amount £ 3 1 0 , or £510, or £ 9 0 1 per annum, the same argument would apply. A line had to be drawn somewhere, and I drew it at what I thought was a fair point, because £300 a year gives an ordinary individual a fair chance of carrying on honestly and comfortably, notwithstanding the present The Leader extraordinary price of goods. I regret that the suggestion was made from my own side of the chamber bhat I was thus seeking to set up a £300-per-annum standard of living. I made no such suggestion, and no such construction can be placed on any statement that I made. It has been urged that the carrying of my amendment might lead to reprisals by the Senate-that the Senate might interfere with the Estimates for the House of Representatives. I was surprised that the Leader of the Opposition in this House - which , under the Constitution, is particularly charged with the care of the finances-should have suggested that the Senate might deal with us in that way. I am not going to be intimidated by anything that the Senate may or may not do, and I hope that if we come to the conclusion that a certain course is right, no considerations as to what the Senate may do will deter us from following that course.",12
71,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The Senate is a powerful body.,13
72,Mr FINLAYSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I hope that we shall be powerful enough to keep it in its place, and later on, if necessary, to send it about its business. Honourable memprevailing. bers may laugh, but I do not recognise the Senate as an Upper House, and I beemployment. lieve that a second House is an anomaly and quite an unnecessary part of our governmental institutions. That being I. am prepared to vote tomorrow for abolition. No statement regarding opinions or intentions of the Senate in regard to this matter will have any effect on me. I was astounded to hear the Prime Minister say that this increasealthough it has not been voted by Parceases liament-is being paid. If that is so, why are we asked to consider the Estisent mates, because I presume that the i crease does uot stand alone in that time respect? No fewer than ten officers the Senate are receiving increases, four of them draw salaries exceeding per annum. Are the increases heing paid in every one of those cases?",13
73,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The Leader of the Opposition has explained what occurred.,13
74,Mr FINLAYSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I cannot underbroke stand how an increase can be paid before the appropriation of Parliament. If the presiding officers of Parliament have the increases. right to pay what salaries they choose, it is useless to ask us to review the mates. The Prime Minister suggested that I have moved the reduction in order f u l services that they render. to meet the war expenditure. What I said was that, as there is a heavy warexpenditure to face, we should economize in every direction, and should - not pay out money unnecessarily. According to the right honourable gentleman, the .increases proposed to be given total only about £6,000, but I question the accuracy of the figures. They do not present the whole truth. On page 94 of the Estimates there is a list of eighty-nine officers, about whom no particulars are given, whose increases amount to £70,000; on page 103 a list of 20S additional officers with increases of £67,000; on page 110 of 137 additional officers with an increase of £37,3S0; and on page 124 an increase of £651,000. I do not think that officers in any branches of the Public Service should be given increases at the present time. We cannot shut our eyes to what is happening outside. Members are overwhelmed with letters and besieged with interviewers, asking their assistance in obtaining employment. One has only to read the newspapers and to make a few inquiries to know of the distress that is",13

But when the war we shall have a war debt of from £25,000,000 to £30,000,000, and at prewe are faced with unemployment n - and distress. This is therefore not a for increasing the salaries of highlyof paid officials. I know that the present and Estimates were taken over by Ministers £300 from their predecessors.",13

My proposal is not the reduction of salaries, but the suspension of increments for a short period. The honourable member for Barrier has suggested that this Parliament should f o l low the example of the K in g in abolishing intoxicating liquors from the refreshment room, merely for the sake of the example. In the matter of salaries it is hardly necessary for the Commonwealth to set an example, because I am certain that no commercial house is increasing salaries at the present time, and the Government of Queensland suspended the payment of increments to the public servants of the State because of the extraordinary expenditure which had to he met this year.",13
79,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Owing to the war?,14
80,Mr FINLAYSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Yes .,14
81,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The war does not cost the States one penny. Mr FINLAYSON"" - That is so, but the Government of Queensland feels it necessary to reduce expenditure because of the drought and for other causes, and it wishes to throw the responsibility for what it is doing on the war. When times of stress come it is generally the men at the bottom who suffer. In my opinion it is they who should have more consideration; it is the men at the top who should make a sacrifice. The statement made by the Prime Minister that the Estimates are framed hy the Public Service Commissioner, who determines what increments shall be paid, and that the Treasurer provides the money, hut that the next Estimates will be revised by him, cuts the ground fro m beneath my feet. It is a strange thing that the Public Service Commissioner has hitherto been able to demand from the Treasurer the payment of a certain sum for the remuneration of the Public Service, but if the Prime Minister next year gives effect to his promises, I think that the public interest will be effectively protected.",14

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",14
84,Mr THOMAS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Barrier) [ 4 . 4 1 - I move That the item ""Clerk of the Senate, £1,000,"" be reduced by £1. ' ' ' As I said on Friday, I was not in sympathy with the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane to reduce this salary by £100 as an intimation to the Government that no salary above £300 per annum should be increased during the continuance of the war. But I am not in favour of increasing the salary of the Clerk of the Senate by £ 1 0 0 . There seems to be a principle at stake in this particular item. I understand that, during the term of office of the last Government, the President of the Senate demanded that the Clerk of the Senate should be paid exactly the same salary as that received by the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Now I am not in favour of the principle of equal pay, unless tliere is equal capacity, equal experience, and equal work-unless , of course, the principle could be made general, every person in Australia receiving exactly the same salary, and rendering to the community right to his utmost capacity the service of which he is capable. When such a state of affairs comes about, there will be a happy time in Australia, but I do not think that it will come about in our time. In the meantime, if we are not prepared to follow on those lines, we must, in fixing salaries, take into consideration a man's capacity for work, the work he has to do, and the experience he possesses. I have no desire to pit one House of Legislature against another. The people of Australia by a referendum have decided on the adoption of the bi-cameral system of legislation, though, by the way, I may say that, with the honourable member for Brisbane, I hope that the time will come when we shall have only one Chamber.",14

I have always been i favour of having a single chamber of legislature, but that system has not come about, and as long as we have two Chambers, our duty is to work them as of amicably as possible. The position taken up by the President of the Senate i manding that the Clerk of the Senate should be paid a salary equal to that paid to the Clerk of the House of Representawho, tives, is very unfair to this House. Every man is anxious to receive as much salary as he can get, and if one officer is to get only the same salary as that paid to another oflicer, who has a great deal less work to do, he will naturally be anxious to get the position where there is less work to be done. If I could get exactly the same salary by being Clerk of the Senate, I would ask to be sent to the Senate, because there is not so much work to do in that Chamber.",14
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Do not your remarks apply to members of Parliament?,15

89,Sir JOHN PORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Do you advocate that course?,15
90,Mr THOMAS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"No ; I leave senators to advocate it . Undoubtedly the Clerk of the House of Representatives has more work to do. He works longer hours and has more worry than has the Clerk .of the Senate. In this House we have heated debates, whereas in the Senate everything is done calmly and smoothly. The fact that three different parties have control of the fixing of the salaries which appear on the Estimates brings about a great anomaly. The Public Service Commistion sioner fixes the salaries for the Public Service, Ministers fix the of heads of Departments and a few others, and the Speaker and President fix the salaries of the officers connected with Parliament. We have considerable anomalies in the Estimates before us. salary of the Secretary to the Treasury, the House. who looks after the finances and advises Treasurer, is £900 a . year; of the Senate, one would imagine, canHowever, I not have as much responsibility and work to do as the Secretary to the Trean sury has to undertake, is to receive a salary of £1,000. The Secretary to the yet Defence Department, who has to do a great deal of work, and has a great deal responsibility, is paid a salary of £900 , which is also the salary paid to the Secn deretary of the Home Affairs Department, Colonel Miller, who rendered great and distinct services in South Africa , and according to his friends, is a born organizer and a great administrator, and who has been intrusted by three Ministers of Home Affairs-on e Liberal and two Labour-wit h the task of going to the Federal Capital with a fairly free hand to lay th© foundations of that city. Yet the Clerk of the Senate is to receive a salary of £1,000. The salaries paid to our various commandants are shown in the Estimates in a lump sum, b ut I understand that that of the commandant in Victoria is £ 7 7 5 . ' I cannot say whether all the commandants ar© paid exactly the same, but certainly uo commandant, except perhaps in New South Wales, would receive a salary greater than that paid to the commandant in Victoria. A State particularly during this war, has a great deal of responsibility, yet he is paid a salary of only £ 7 7 5 , while the Clerk of the Senate, whose is already £900, is to have an increase of £ 1 0 0 . And so I might go on. The Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales is in receipt of a salary of £850 , and the Deputy Postmaster-General in Victoria is paid a salary of £ 8 0 0 , while other Deputy Postmasters-General receive smaller salaries. We hear a great deal about the Post Office. We can have Commissions, and we can talk in Parliament as much as we like, but a grein deal of the successful running of the Post Offioe depends on the Deputy Postmasters-General, yet Parliament says that the salaries paid to these officers are quite sufficient, and, according to the informawe received on Friday last, unless the Cl©rk of the Senate is paid a salary salaries of £1,000, the Senate is going on strike. The Chief Electoral Officer has a great deal to do, and has a great deal of responsibility, and he does his work very well. At any rate, we have no reason to The complain. We have all been returned to",15
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Do you mean to insinuate that the Chief Electoral Officer favours any one?,16
92,Mr THOMAS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"No . He is a very honorablo man, and does his work very well. I say that we have no reason to complain, seeing that we are here. At any rate, his salary is only £700.",16
93,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,It is not enough.,16
94,Mr THOMAS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"He has to work long hours during an election; he has no long recess. In New South Wales, the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly is paid a salary of £1,000, but the salary paid the Clerk of the Legislative Council only £ 7 4 0 . I understand that in Vicallow toria the Clerk of the Legislative Council is paid a salary of £1,000, and salary of the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly is only £900, but I understand that the latter is also paid £ 1 0 0 a year Clerk of Parliaments. I quite agree with the honourable member for Indi that the work of the Clerk of Parliaments is of a very skilled character, and requires special knowledge, because, if errors made in the wording or punctuation of our Statutes, there might result endless litigation. The clerks of our Parliament are competent and courteous officers, and I have not a word to say against them. One of the principal duties of the Clerk is to be responsible for a Bill leaving Chamber in exactly the form Parliareduction ment has decided upon. That work is done by the Clerk of the House, in the Statute originated. Nine out of of our Bills originate in this chamber, and consequently the Clerk of this House has nine times as much responsibility i that way as the Clerk of the Senate. will support it . When the Estimates were being introduced last year by the right honourable member for Parramatta, I asked why in creases had been given to the clerks i this House, when a number of other responsible officials in the Commonwealth increments. Service were kept on the £900 mark 'i The right honourable member replied that he did not know why that policy was followed. I am not here to ask that the salaries of highly-paid officials should further raised. Like the honourable ber for Brisbane, I rather stand for those who are lower paid, but I recognise those in high and responsible positions would naturally feel that their work was not being properly appreciated if we fused them the increments which were given to other highly-paid officers. I have in mind the position bf the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, We have excellent administrators in Papua and the Northern Territory, but. nevertheless, the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs has to carry a great deal of responsibility; yet we say that £ 9 0 0 is a sufficient salary for him, but the Clerk of the Senate must be paid £1,000, or something serious will happen. I intend to give the Committee an opportunity of voting on this item. U n less we are prepared to adopt the principle of giving to all officers in a class to equal pay, irrespective of capacity, exis perience and age, I am not willing to that the salaries of the officials in this chamber and the Senate should necesthat the sarily be on an equality.  two previous speakers gave to new memas bers some insight into the past history of Federal Administration; but it amazes me to find that, after fourteen years, we are only now discovering that the salaries of our public servants are framed on were an unscientific basis. Why was this not discovered years ago? I quite agree that the salaries are most unscientifically regulated, but whether the proposed reduction be £ 1 or £ 1 0 0, whether it be to enforce a reduction or to suspend an expected increase in salary, on printhe ciple, I am not prepared to vote for any of salaries unless a similar reduction is applied to myself. If honorwhich able members will propose a motion ten whereby the emoluments of members of Parliament are subjected to a similar reduction as is proposed to be applied to n the salaries of servants of Parliament, I",16

If a l i m i tation of expenditure be necessary I will rebe the first to agree to an equivalent reduction in my own emoluments, as it iB proposed to apply to the salaries of those in our employ. It is not reasonable or fair that salary reductions in any division of the Commonwealth Service should be advocated whilst honourable members are immune. Therefore, I hope the amendment will be defeated.",16
97,Mr MATHEWS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Melbourne Ports) [4.30] - I have received several communications from persons who desire me to vote against any proposed increases to high salaries, but it is not my intention to do that. When the Victorian Parliament sat in this building, the then Clerk of Parliaments practically owned the Parliament. The authorities were constantly casting round to find 'some excuse for in creasing the Clerk's salary, but the work he did was so little, although he did it with a great amount of show, that, ultimately, they could find no other excuse than to pay him £100 a year for the supervision of the gardeus. Por several - years after the establishment Federation the Clerk of the Senate was Clerk of Parliaments. I can remember when it was first contended that the Clerk of this House, and the Clerk of the Senate, occupying positions of equal responsibility, ought to be on an equality in every sense; aud it is not long ago that that policy was given effect to. I remember contending at the time that the Clerk of this House was entitled to just as high a salary as the Clerk of the Senate. Having taken that stand then, I am only acting consistently now in saying that the Clerk of the Senate should be in every respect on the same level as the Clerk of the House of Representatives. I hold no brief for the tall poppies; although, i u some circles, I am myself considered a tall poppy. It should be remembered that we might do an injustice.to many men by refusing increments during the present year. For instance, there are public servants who this year must retire, and if their salaries are reduced, so must their pensions be, seeing that a pension is always based on the salary received.",17

It is a fact that, quite irrespective of party, the members of another place seem to regard themselves as more "" b l u e blooded "" than we are, and, on that account, claim certain conveniences and privileges that we do not enjoy.

Mr Laird SMITH"" (Denison) [4.48]. - I sincerely hope that this motion will not be carried; and I desire to briefly explain why I voted as I did in the division just taken. The gentlemen whose salaries are under consideration have to undergo a special training for their work, and largely in the Commonwealth Service it is the position, and not the man, that is classified. If any officer f a it h full y and ably, as these officers admittedly do, carry out the duties that their positions demand, they are entitled to the salary proposed in the Estimates.",17

104,The CHAIRMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I think that the motion is not in order. The Committee have already decided that the salary shall not be reduced by £ i ; and honourable members would stultify themselves if .a motion to reduce the salary by a larger amount were proposed and carried.,18

It is set down at £500 , but in reality the Chairman draws only £300 for his work in the chair, since, under the Act dealing with the allowances of members, his salary as a private member goes back to the original one of £400 per annum. I do not wish to make any comparisons between the position of the Chairman of Committees and that of the Speaker, but I may be allowed to make one or two suggestions. I do not intend again to occupy the position of Chairman of Committees, and I therefore think I shall be in order i u asking the Committee to give some consideration to this matter. r . The Speaker has a net salary of £900 per the aunum, and his services are undoubtedly ? of that value to the House. We require as Speaker an individual of wide experience and knowledge of the rules of to debate and of the Standing Orders. But the Chairman of Committees requires an of equally thorough knowledge of parliaI am aware that Mr Speaker has, outside the chamber, old other duties that require attention; but, even taking into consideration the addit is tional duties falling upon him , I think . there is too great a discrepancy between his beallowance and that of the Ohairman of proCommittees. The Chairman of Commithas a position quite as responsible as that of Mr Speaker, while he is in the chair. He has to give his decisions upon his own responsibility, and, so f ar as thp strain ""of the work is concerned, I think it be admitted that he has to be on duty and quite as lon» as Mr Speaker, and under be recircumstances that are frequently even more trying than when the House itself is discussing a general proposition. The Chairman, eveu when he is not in the chair, has still to be on duty, since he never knows when he may be called to his position; and he has also to be ready to relieve Mr Speaker. I think, upon consideration, the Treasurer, who alone has the power in this matter to give my proposition any direct shape, will recognise that we have here an anomaly that requires to be adjusted.

112,Mr FOWLER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Perth) [ 5 . 0 ] - I have a few observations to make regarding the expenditure on the historic memorials of representative men, which, I think, is developing to an absurd situation. I have a keen appreciation of art, but I do not think any of us can examine, with any degree of satisfaction the alleged portraits in the Queen's H all . I remember on one occasion discussing one of them with a leading member of this House, under the impression that it was a painting of a totally different individual. some are certainly recognisable, barely one of them can be described as a work of art. The best of them display a certain amount of fine brushwork; but portraiture is a class of painting that is exceedingly difficult. As a matter of fact, there are only some half-dozen portrait painters of any eminence in the world at the present time. While I have every desire to encourage youthful aspirants for fame as portrait painters in Australia, I submit that the fact that a person can depict a landscape fairly well on a piece of canvas is by no means an assurance that he or she is equal to the task of handing down to posterity the features - and the character, as shown in the features-of representative men in Australia. Nearly all of these alleged portrait paintings are, in that respect, lamentable failures. Dealing with them upon a strictly business-like footing, the price in every case is excessive and absurd. We pay £250 for each of these pictures, the value of which, in several cases, consists almost entirely of the frame. There is one portrait painting of high qualitythat of the late Sir Henry Parkes. That, in my opinion, as well as in the opinion of critics, who, perhaps, know more of these matters than I do, is the only genuine piece of portrait-painting that we have in the collection. Honourable members will notice that it is not very large, but it gives us all that we require. It gives us the head, the face, and features the character of the individual portrayed. Why should we pay about £ 1 0 0 more than we need to in order that posterity may be assured that the present Prime Minister had a pair of fairly good legs, and that they were encased in the (Miscellaneous), orthodox trousers? It is neither necessary nor desirable. A three-quarterlength portrait is £ 1 00 cheaper than a full-length one. True, it would deprive us of about eighteen inches of trousers in the painting; but I submit that all that is required is a picture of the head and shoulders, and that can be obtained at a much less figure, and would be far more satisfactory, than those huge expanses of canvas depicting the altogether unbecoming and inartistic habiliments of these days. We - are apparently committed to a portrait of every Prime Minister, President, Speaker, and Governor General who may happen, for however brief a period, and While in however uninteresting a way, to hold office.",19
113,Mr JH CATTS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,W h e r e shall we find room for them?,19
114,Mr FOWLER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"What a heritage the country will have acquired 100 years hence! The destination of many of these pictures will , I am afraid, be the cheap sale or the bonfire. The original understanding was that we should have historical memorials of representative men. I would not for the world insinuate that the portraits we already possess are not those of representative men, but if we continue on the lines now being followed, we shall certainly spend a considerable sum on the portraits of men who will be in no way representative. In view of the facts, and of the apparent impossibility of securing anything like decent portraits in oils, I suggest to the Treasurer, who, I know, desires economy, that our object would be achieved by photographic representations of our public men, done, perhaps, in sepia. We should thus get better and more f a it h f u l likenesses and more artistic productions than many of those that have been imposed on the Commonwealth at such high rates compared with their quality.",19
115,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wide Bay - P r i m e Minister and Treasurer) [ 5 . 1 0 ] - I do not agree with the criticism of the honourable member for Perth, because I consider that the portraits to which he has referred are equal to anything that could be got in the Old Country for the same money. It is one of the features of Australian criticism that it regards everything done in this country as inferior to work done elsewhere.",20
116,Mr FOWLER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"My remarks contained, no such insinuation. Some of the portraits to which reference has been made were painted outside Australia.",20
117,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I had no wish to do the honourable member an injustice. As to the artistic quality of these paintings, I am not in a position to express an opinion, but I have visited on more than one occasion some of the most famous, picture galleries in the world, and I have the advantage of acquaintance those who know something art. There are in the older countries of the world galleries whose, collections consist almost wholly of masterpieces; but, taking ordinary collections, my individual opinion is that, picture for picture, the portraits that have been referred to are equal to any that will be found elsewhere.  Sir George Reid ?",20

119,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I do not think that we should say that. The efforts of Australian painters should be encouraged by the Governments and civic authorities of this country. Without the encouragement of art, a people become mere drudges, and lack ideas of an elevating character.",20
120,Mr FOWLEE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I have never suggested the discouragement of art.,20
121,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The honourable member said that it would astonish an ordinary-minded person to be taken into the Queen's H all and asked to consider the portraits there as works of art. I do not agree with the lionorable member. I think that the portraits are works of art. They have been passed by gentlemen who were intrusted with the choosing of pictures for our best galleries.  gentleman's portrait is a good one.,20
122,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Thos e who know me will not accuse me of personal vanity. The standing for that portrait was a bore and a trouble to me. It may be that the wrong men may be painted, and, in a small way, thus acquire immortality, but future generations will be glad to have the pictures, and the amount that they cost does not weigh by comparison.",20
123,Mr KELLY,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wentworth) [5.15] -. I made two discoveries during the Prime Minister's speech; that he is not a judge of art, and that he is modest. He was rather unfair to the honourable member for Perth in suggesting that that honourable member's remarks were in the nature of crying stinking fish. I do not know a better Australian, nor one keener to preserve the credit of Australia and with Australians. I suggest to the Prime M i nabout ister that an Australian who is engaged in perfecting his art at some art centre outside the country is still an Australian. The right honourable gentleman seemed to suggest that such a man is not an Australian, and, therefore, not an inherent genius. Mr Lambert, who painted the portrait of Sir George Reid, is one of the most gifted artists that this country has produced, aud though he is now living in London, he is still an Australian. It is to be remembered that every one does not make so good a subject for the portrait painter as does the Prime Minister.  ber say that the portrait of Sir George Reid was a good one ?",20
124,Mr KELLY,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"It showed distinct cleverness. I suggest that we may confuse the coming generation that is expected to look with admiration and awe on the representations of our noble selves, by making the collection too large.' I am with the Prime Minister in desiring to see his own portrait adorning our gallery, and I think that the portraits of all our Prime Ministers, whatever may be our views regarding their personal fitness from a purely artistic stand-point, should be painted. But with all respect to the occupants of the chair here and in another place, I am afraid that the portraits of Prime Ministers, although comparatively numerous, would be altogether swamped by the portraits of the less important Presidents of the Senate and Speakers of the House of Representatives. the first President and the first Speaker, I think that we need not immortalize our Presidents and Speakers in this way.

125,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Swan) [5.19]. - I do not propose to deal with the financial position set forth in these Estimates, and in the important statement read by the Treasurer on the 14th instant, but I wish to make one or two remarks concerning what was said in that statement about the Commonwealth Bank. The in formation given in regard to the Commonwealth Bank is very interesting, but that in this important Ministerial statement, covering the financial position of the Commonwealth, dealing with the assistance the Commonwealth has been able to render to the States, and that which the Imperial Government have been able to give to us, and giving information in regard to the note issue and the advances made to the States from funds connected* therewith, we should have two whole pages devoted to details of the Commonwealth Bank is something more than one would have expected, and more than was necessary. The Commonwealth Bank having been established under Statute, the Governor of the Bank has always taken the stand-and prided himself on it-that he would not give any information if he did not care to do so; but, judging by the information that he has given to the present Treasurer, he now seems to have departed from that attitude. This information is very interesting; but I wish to deal with one paragraph only, a paragraph that has no doubt been supplied to the Treasurer by the Governor, and which says The Savings Bank in London was established primarily for the benefit of Australians tending Australians, and generally to assist emigrants leaving England for Australia, and has been almost exclusively made use of in this respect. Other persons are not encouraged to deposit with the Savings Bank Department in London, and several suggestions that the bank should receive deposits from the public throughout G-reat Britain have been declined. At, the time of its°establishment the British Post Office Savings Bank was consulted in the matter, and took no exception whatever to the estabExcept lishment of this portion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank of London, and the fiiendliest reciprocal arrangements still exist with the British Post Office Savings Bank, and also with the New Zealand Post Ofiice Savings Bank throughout that Dominion. 1 say that the statement contained in this Office), paragraph is not accurate. I know that this is strong language to use in regard to such a matter, but from my own knowledge the statement is inaccurate, and should not have been put forward in the way in which it has been put forward. Honourable members are no doubt aware that the Savings Bank branch in London was established with a great flourish of trumpets; I am not sure that the K in g was not present; at any rate, there was a great function, 'and Sir George Reid, after a great speech, placed £ 1 0 0 of his money in the Savings Bank as its first depositor. I have not looked up the speech delivered by Sir George Reid, but my memory serves me well enough to know that there was no mention of any limitation of the activities of the Bank. It was not said that the Bank was only for the special purpose mentioned in the paragraph I have read, and that it would be made use of exclusively for that purpose, or that the Bank did not wish to receive deposits from the public of Great Britain . Already in this chamber I have protested against the Commonwealth entering into the Savings Bank business of London, trying to gethold of some of the savings of British people with small means in order to bring the money to Australia; because I maintain that Great Britain , with its great obligations and responsibilities, should be entitled to retain these funds for its own purposes, and we should not attempt to get them away from Great Britain, l t was not said at the time that it was not intended to do this. Holding the views that I do upon this point, I was altogether opposed to the Commonwealth establishing a branch of the Savings Bank in London; and when I was Treasurer, having looked into the matter, I found that there was no authority by or in- law to establish any branch of the Savings Bank beyond Australia. The At torney-General, Sir William Irvine, when consulted on the point, emphatically advised that there was no power under the Statute to establish a Commonwealth Savings Bank in London, and I thereupon informed the Governor of the Bank to this effect, but that gentleman was very reluctant to give up his idea. He even sent to me a solicitor's opinion, controverting that of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, but I told him that the thing could not be done. The Governor of the Commonwealth never, though he knew my opinion upon the matter of taking away the savings of the people of Great Britain from the field in which they should be controlled, hinted to me, in all the conversations I had with him, that by establishing the Commonwealth Savings Bank in London he intended to deal with no business other than for the benefit of Australians, or intending Australians, and that he had no intention of doing other than obtaining as much money as he could through the Savings Bank branch in London. However, during last year the present Treasurer in troduced a Bill which gave the power to establish a branch of the Savings Bank in London, and overcame the difficulty that I had detected. There was no need to establish a Commonwealth Savings Bank in London "" primarily for the benefit of Australians or intending Australians, and generally to assist emigrants leaving England for Australia,"" as the Commonwealth Bank could deal with all those matters without having any Savings Bank provisions, and even before the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank our High Commissioner aid the business. The reason advanced in this document could not, .therefore, have been the true reason for the establishment of a Savings Bank in London. An other matter that proves that intention was to get money in order to carry on the business of the Commonwealth Bank, and to make money for it, is the fact that a rate of interest was given on deposits higher than the I m perial Government paid through its post offices.",21
126,Mr RILEV,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,That would be a good thing for the poor people.,22
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"To give the poor people ten times more interest would be good for them; but the point I make is that the idea in establishing this Savings Bank in London was the securing of funds for the Commonwealth Bank, because if the intention was only to establish it , as mentioned in the document, "" for the benefit of Australians or intending Australians, and generally to assist emigrants leaving England for Australia "" - for which purpose it has been said it has been almost exclusively made use of-wh y then should a higher rate of interest be paid than was given by the British General Post Ofiice ? I mention this matter now Bank in order to reiterate what I have said all along, namely, that it was not a friendly action to take-in fact, the action of the Commonwealth Bank in entering the British arena in order to get deposits for its Savings Bank branch at a time when Australia was borrowing all its loan money from the Old Country, and generally was under great obligations to it , was about the meanest action I have heard of. I maintain that the Commonwealth Government had np right to enter into competition with the British Government, and offer a higher price for money than the Post Ofiice of the ""United Kingdom was paying.",22
128,Mr HANNAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Judgin g by the scandals connected with Savings Banks in England a little while ago, it was necessary for some one to establish something.",22
129,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The honourable member's views are not the same as mine. He does not think it mean and contemptible to go to the Mother Country and attempt to divert the savings of the. people from the field in which they should be applied, when Australia is still going to the British money-market, and is still under obligations to Great B r it a in ; but, in my opinion, the offer of a higher rate of interest in order to secure this money was a most unfriendly and mean action on our the part. I was ashamed of the step we had taken-on e of the most ungrateful things I had ever heard of. But, now, why have we this change that has taken nlace in regard to the attitude of the Savings Bank in London as disclosed by this document before us? The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who knew the views I .held, never mentioned to me any limitation as to the operations of the branch, yet now when, owing to this terrible war, we are getting under greater obligations to the Old Country, he says that he has declined to receive deposits from the public throughout Great Britain . That is the first I have heard of this attitude, and I bring the matter forward today because, from my knowledge of the affairs of the Commonwealth Bank, I know that the statement that the Savings Bank in London was established primarily for the reasons stated in this document, is inaccurate. Seeing that we had a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in London, which can do all the business the Savings Bank branch could do in the matter of assisting Australians, or in tending Australians, and seeing that the High Commissioner could do all the work even without the Commonwealth Bank, there was no need for us to establish a branch of the Savings Bank in London, and our action in doing so is not only unnecessary, but ungrateful and unwarranted. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the British Government came into the Australian arena and endeavoured to get use of the savings of the people here, or did some such improper act, we would be disgusted and annoyed ; honourable members opposite would be rampant with rage; they would consider the act as most improper on the part of the Old Country ; but, apparently, there is nothing improper or unfriendly when we do the same thing, and without any necessity for doing it . It is not necessary to give higher rates of interest in order to attract deposits, if we are not going to receive them. So far as my knowledge goes, the statement is inaccurate, and ought not to have been placed before Parliament in that form.",22
130,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [5.26] - The right honourable member for Swan has referred to the statement of the Governor of the Bank as inaccurate; he practically said that it was wilfully inaccurate.,23

132,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"In my opinion it is not inaccurate. It is a statement of fact, and will be verified when the opportunity is given. It is quite true that the right honourable member was against the establishment of a branch of the Savings Bank in London; be did his best to prevent its establishment, and would have stopped its continuance if he could.",23

134,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"In that respect the right honourable gentleman is quite consistent, but he is not sound in his arguments. To say that when a country has passed a banking law which permits any other country to establish a banking in stitution, it is contemptible and mean to take advantage of that law, is surely not sound reasoning. Imagine the little Commonwealth Savings Bank in London, established to assist men and women of small means, many of whom are contemplating coming to this country, by enabling them to have their money transmitted without cost, and to earn interest from the day of deposit, interrupting or : endangering the financial affairs in London, which is the clearing centre of the world, dealing with, perhaps, billions of exchange in a year!",23
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Do not forget the higher rates.,23
136,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Highe r rates are common in London. I recollect that banks in London paid 6 per cent, on deposits when consols were only bringing about £ 2 18s. It is not the policy of the Government of Great Britain to prevent people who are doing business legitimately paying whatever rates of interest they can afford; if such a policy had been adopted England would not be the great country it is.",23

138,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"There was no intention of establishing a savings bank in London' for the purpose of raising loan money, and any Treasurer who would attempt to do that would ultimately fail, because he would not obtain his money as cheaply by dribs and drabs in that fashion as if he borrowed it directly. The right honourable member for Swan will see that the Savings Bank is ancillary to the Commonwealth Bank in London, and I do not think that any harm will result. The right honourable gentleman opposed the establishment of a savings bank branch in London, but the branch is lawfully established now. There is provision in the original Act which gave the Governor of the Bank, with the consent of the Treasurer, power to establish branches of the Bank in any place in Aus- outside Australia, but, because the words "" and Savings Bank "" were not included, the London hranch of the Savings Bank was considered to be unlawfully established.",23

153,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Angas) [5.46] - I desire saw to direct the attention of the Treasurer fco a few points I had in mind when sneakI was not able, at the moment, to lay my fingers on the figures which I wished to bring under notice. The Treasurer, I am sure, will give me credit for assuming with him, in any criticism I may offer, the absolute solvency in every respect of ihe Commonwealth. My idea is that in all war finance we must be particularly caref u l , because we have double obligationsone obligation to Australia, and another as to the Mother Country, which, in this crisis is largely helping the Dominion. In believe that before peace is restored the cirMother Country will be helping to an even greater extent to facilitate our financial operations; and facilitating finance is a mighty different thing from coming It and is only through the Mother Country, during war, that we can get was opthe best terms in financing on our There is no doubt of the capacity of the Mother Country to do that, or of the security that say Australia can offer. In regard to the one financial position of the United Kingdom, I find that, in Mr Lloyd George's statement, on the 17th November, he estimated the total cost of the war for the financial Mr Asquith, speaking on the 1st March, said that the war expenditure for the financial year ending the 31st March was estimated at £362,000,000. The burden of that can be very easily borne, because, as the Chancellor pointed out in his financial statement of the 17th November, the approximate national income of Great Britain was £2,300,000,000. that amount there were figures, which he did not give, but upon which he probably based the statement that we could, for a period of five years, finance the war. At any rate, it is a fact that over £200,000,000 per annum is received by capitalists from public and semi-public investments abroad, leaving out of account altogether the interest or profits derived from private investments.",24
154,Mr FISHEK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I think the figure is much higher.,25
155,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,That is not an official estimate; but I think I read those particulars in the Edinburgh Review two or three months ago.  admitted later that he had underestimated.,25
156,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"That may be, but I am now dealing with another matter, namely, the fact that the actual interest received in England every year from public and semi-public investments abroad is over £200,000,000, and of this 95$ per cent, is unaffected by the war. Owing to the presence of our Fleet, the ocean is free to us, and this interest comes from countries that are under uo obligation of neutrality, and are not prevented by the war from sending that financial stream which sets in the direction of the TJnited Kingdom. It is also something to be proud of, when we find, from the last trade figures, that while the total external trade of the United Kingdom in 1913 was £1,404,000,000, it had shrunk to only £1,223,000,000 after eight or nine months of war. As Mr LLOYD George said, in November, it is very reassuring that 97 per cent, of the 20,000,000 odd tonnage of our shipping was sailing the ocean unaffected by the war at that date. Let me now come to the question of the gold reserve. I ask the Treasurer to see that he exercises that caution which is apparent in the figures of the Bank of England and of the Treasury at Home, and in the practice also of the principal Continental banks. Mr . Asquith stated on the 14th November, 1914, in the House of Commons, that foreign exchanges were working perfectly satisfactorily, and that the gold reserve of the Bank of England on the 2nd July was £40,000,000. On the 7th August that reserve had shrunk to £27,000,000; and there was, of course, at that time a tremendous nervous slump. I remember Besides that, within a week, some of the leading stocks of the Stock Exchange shrunk in value by £600,000,000, but within a month there was a great restoration of confidence.",25
157,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The same occurred here.,25
158,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I cannot say as to that; but on the 7th August those gold reserves were £27,000,000; and at the time of Mr . Asquith's speech, on the 14th November, they had increased to £69,500,000. I am now referring, of course, to the Bank of England reserves, and there were also the central gold reserves of the Treasury, £80,000,000, or, as Mr Asquith put it , about double the amount before the war. Evidently, therefore, the Imperial Treasurer, tlirough the Bank of England, was strengthening his gold reserves, and at the same time using them. I shall now show the position of the German Bank and the Bank of France, with the observation that our Imperial finance is not only strong, but the better for commerce, because the reserves are used fairly freely, as Mr Lloyd George told us in his speech about two months ago. Nevertheless, caution was necessary in view of the necessity of larger imports which might have to be faced later on.",25
159,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,A r e we not cautious?,25
160,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I merely say that, comparatively, we do not seem to be. Of course, the German Reichsbank cannot be held up as an example to be followed in every particular, 'because the authorities there are not using their gold as are the British bankers. On the 31st December last, the total gold in the German bank was £104,640,000. A year ago that gold was £58,498,000, and this shows that they are doing all they can to increase the reserve. The actual note issue on that date was £252,000,000, but the statutory reserve showed 59 per cent., of which 41 per - cent, was gold, the 59 per cent, being made up of gold and certain approved securities which must be held. The only change made by the war was that the number of acceptors of the securities was reduced by three to one, and a 5 per cent, tax on the issue over the gold or cash deposits of the bank was temporarily suspended. There is a 5 per cent. tax on the volume exceeding a certain reserve, which is kept within' purely healthy limits in time of peace; and this, a3 I say, was suspended, leading practically to the doubling of the total volume of the note issue within a few months. As to the Bank of France, it has been stated by the Paris correspondent of the Economist, after a very exhaustive esamination of the position, that the value of the note issue, through the care of the gold reserve, has been brilliantl y maintained. In the case of the Bank of England, on the 13th January this year, the gold was £69,360,000, and the notes £35,174,000; and to those figures must be added some others. To the notes issued by the Issue Department, and, therefore, held by the public, must be added the volume of the currency notes outstanding and redeemable at the bank by an arrangement made on the 3rd or 4th August between Mr Lloyd George and some of the banking officials. This arrangement was made on the advice of experts whom Mr Lloyd George properly called to his aid the moment the war broke out, he not being a specialist in such matters. By addine these currency notes, we get a total issue by the Bank and by'the Treasury of £72,400,000. Let me push the matter further. The Banning Department held £53,000,000 of notes. I suppose that in Australia h a l f ' the issue is held by the banks, and the rest is in circulation.",25
161,Mr FISHEU,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Quite r i g h t ; that is a fair statement of the case.,26
162,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I find that, adding to the £72,000,000 of notes issued by the Bank of England and the Treasury notes still in circulation, the £53,000,000 held by the Banking Department, we get a total,, for which the bank and the Government are responsible, of £125,400,000, and against that there is held £90,000,000 in gold. That is altogether a different proportion against current liabilities of the sort from that observed in connection with our note issue. We are apparently only commencing to largely increase the volume. As it was, some financiers at Home said that such a state of affairs was not perfectly sound financing; but I think they were rather captious.",26
163,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,And others say that it was a first-class arrangement.,26
164,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"- I am talking of the position at Home, and not yet of the position here. I refer to the Imperial figunss and the figures of the German banks to show that, rightly or wrongly, since the war began there has been a large in crease in the gold reserves against current liabilities, principally in the shape of notes. If we deduct the amount borrowed from the banks here, we have a reserve, according to some figures whicn appeared in the press, of about 30 per cent.",26
165,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Oh , dear, no!",26
166,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I think I am right. I am referring to figures that I read in the newspapers, and they seemed to me to be fairly correct.",26
167,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The only publication to read in this connection is the Gazette.,26
168,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I did not see the Gazette, but it does not seem to me that the figures I saw are wrong. I assume the newspapers really took the figures from the Gazette. At any rate, what I read on the 3rd March was that the issue was £25^232,000-and I do not think that is out in any way-whil e the gold held was £10,133,000. At that time the Treasurer had borrowed, approximately, £3,500,000 from the banks to strengthen the gold reserve.",26
169,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"It was not borrowed, but handed over by an arrangement.",26
170,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I do not care what terminology the honourable gentleman uses. I am not condemning the arrangement, but only urging caution, and pointing out that if we deduct the money obtained from the banks under this reciprocal arrangements-o r whatever we may choose to call it - from the £10,133,000 held on account of the note issue, we have a net basis that could not be taken from us by the banks if the war were to end tomorrow.",26
171,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Now I understand you.,26
172,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"We have a net basis of £6,633,000, which, in relation to a note issue of about £25,000,000, represents, not 40 per cent., but a little over 30 per cent, at the best.",26
173,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The honourable member left a wrong impression on my mind, and I think on the mind of honourable members. I understand now that he is speaking of when the war is over.",26
174,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Of course, as last week I more than once said, and also of the position now. The whole burden of my remarks is that the arrangement is one under which the Treasurer must give this money back to the banks when the war is over, and I say that it is not a sound system to base the note issue, to any substantial extent, on gold which is absolutely at call, and may be taken in the bulk.",26
175,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"If I make an arrangement that the money should not be taken for some years, will that suit the honourable member?",27
176,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I believe we are perfectly sound, but, at the same time, I do not think that this represents a perfectly safe basis for the Treasurer.",27
177,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I think I could make an arrangement tomorrow that would relieve the honourable member's feelings in the matter.,27
178,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I do not regard it as sound to altogether trust to this as a basis for the note issue. The Treasurer mentioned the great aid which he said had been given at Home by the Commonwealth Bank. I do not know what the right honourable gentleman has to say about a paragraph that appeared in the Argus yesterday, to the effect that the Commonwealth Bank was one of several which had come to an arrangement to facilitate the operations of the Government by not cashing certain demands within a certain time.",27
179,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I do not think it is true.,27
180,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I do not know whether it is true or not, but I can understand that the Bank may have helped men who, at the moment the war broke out, required cash at once. B ut the aid given by the Bank in local and Imperial finance was infinitesimal. What was the trouble that had to be faced? There was a demand for small currency. Some thought the Bank of England notes too large, and others thought that a note currency would be too small, and an arrangement was made for the temporary issue of 10s. and £ 1 notes. Within a month or so the' volume of these notes was comparatively small - There was a rush for temporary accommodation, and, the issue in proportion to the reserve began at first to increase, although it afterwards decreased. The volume of our notes at present is trifling compared with the power of the Commonwealth to meet them. The chief object in view was to keep trade going, and the operations that were Imperial in their magnitude as well as in the security behind them were in connection with the acceptance houses. Every the TJnited Kingdom imports an average of about £2,000,000 worth of food and raw material, comprising six or seven chief commodities, in order to keep its industries and its people going. The moment war broke out the acceptance houses had obligations for three months, to the extent of about £350,000,000, and as all financing was disturbed-al l relations with debtors abroad and remittances were stopped for the time being-unles s the acceptance houses could be induced to cash these paper obligations, the imports of the TJnited Kingdom could not be kept up. It is one of the most striking features of the heroic efforts of the I m perial Government that they at once came to the aid of these acceptance houses, through the Bank of England, and undertook contingent responsibilities to the exteut of about 60 per cent, of the obligations incurred. It is operations of that kind about which we should speak in connection with I m perial finance rather than such questions as that of whether the Commonwealth Bank helped a few Australians in London, who, when the war broke out, were unable, perhaps, to cash their drafts or cheques at the ordinary banks. Before resuming my seat, I wish to refer the Treasurer to a short quotation from a speech made by Mr Lloyd George, which is somewhat pertinent to the point that I wish to impress upon him. Speaking in the first or second week of February last, Mr Lloyd George pointed out that the strength of the Imperial Government for financing was its gold reserve, and the fact also that the TJnited Kingdom, unlike the Continental banks, was not afraid to use that gold for purposes of commerce. He warned his hearers, however, that there was a time coming when they might have to be more cautious. What he said in this respect will apply also to Australia. We experienced a bad season last year, and if next season we cannot export as largely as we do in average years, there will be a very great difficulty in meeting, at all events, our imports. We shall certainly have to import more largely, and, in the circumstances I have just mentioned, there may be some difficulty in financing tliese imnorts. Mr Lloyd George, speaking of the British gold reserve, saidday It is true that we have never had such a strain put upon it as during the last few months, and very likely it will be considerably increased during the course of the next six or twelve months, when our purchases abroad are very much heavier than they ever were before and when our sales to other countries are considerably less. These are the conditions that confront the great Imperial Government, to 'whose financial strength I made a short reference at the outset of my remarks. In conclusion, I ask the Treasurer, if he in creases the volume of the note issue as a means of financing the exceptional obligations of the country, to take care that the gold reserve is not brought near the 25 per cent, margin, and to see that it does not consist of gold held in large sums, such as the £10,000,000, at call.",27
181,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [ 6 . 9 ] - I have stated many times, both i h the House and in Committee, that there is no intention on the part of the Government to reduce the gold reserve to 25 per cent., but that, on the contrary, we shall maintain a working margin of about one-third. The Commonwealth would have had a larger gold reserve than it has at the present moment if we had required the last two monthly instalments of the banks' loan to be placed in the gold reserve. It was my own view, however, that this was not necessaryi and we have left the gold with the banks without any attendant disadvantage to the Commonwealth. I should have pleased the honourable member for Angas, no doubt, if I had allowed these amounts to go into the gold reserve in the Commonwealth Treasury instead of allowing the gold to remain with the banks.",28
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"But to get that additional gold reserve from the hanks, would not the Treasurer have been forced to issue additional notes?",28
183,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The honourable member is aware of the differential proportions, and will not forget that I am dealing now with the question of percentages. In effect, if we had not adopted this course, we should have strengthened our gold reserve in proportion to the amount that we have left with the banks. I do not think there is the slightest need to be apprehensive about the present note issue or its prospective increase. fimincier of any standing with whom I have had to deal has put before me any view of serious danger. I promise honourable members opposite, however, that when such a situation arises I w i ll take steps to apprise them of it . think it is wise to discuss the matter; but I wish now to say that any honourable member, whether he is a member of the Opposition or a supporter of the Government, who wishes to ascertain the whole of the facts, may obtain them from the Treasury. If I were to speak every day for a month, I could not give honourable members all the details, and I think this is the better course to pursue.",28
184,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Will the Treasurer tell us what proportion of the £10,000,000 arranged for with the banks has been lodged in gold?",28
185,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"£3,000,000 , as shown in my statement.",28
186,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"H as there been no in crease since that statement was made? Is the amount today £3,000,000?",28
187,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"That is so. The next monthly instalment will come in as usual. I rose chiefly, however, to say that the whole Parliament will be taken into the confidence of the Government in respect of this and all big financial matters. What is more, we have no objection to securing the assistance of the whole of the best minds in Australia in dealing with these financial matters during the war crisis. No financial crisis has yet arisen, nor is there any prospect of one if I am properly advised, and I am speaking now of advice other than that of the officers of the Department. I appeal to honourable members not to make statements concerning these matters without first asking me for the whole of the particulars relating to them. I can say no more in this regard. It is not known to the general public that the Commonwealth is in a singularly good position in another respect. It is stated that the Commonwealth has great debts. As a matter of fact, however, it has no debts. On the transferred properties we have, of course, to pay interest to the States; but all the investments of our note trust funds are bringing in interest amounting approximately to from 3^ per cent, to 4 per cent, or a little more. Mr JosEPn COOK - But every note is No a promise to pay.",28
188,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I hope the right honourable member will grasp the point I am seeking to make. We have an annual in come from the investment of our Trust Funds that is not paid into the ConsoliI do not dated Revenue. It is a separate and distinct Trust Fund which is accumulating. On the other' hand, we are debiting ourselves with interest on the money expended out of these funds on public works, although uot one penny is paid by way of interest to any outside person or body.",28
189,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,What is to be done with that accumulation ? What is to be its destination ?,29
190,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,It is to pay off the national debt of Australia.,29
191,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,What does the accumulation now represent?,29
192,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Roughl y speaking. £600,000.",29
193,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The Treasurer said a moment ago that we had no national debt. He now says that this accumulation is to pay off the national debt.,29
194,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I excluded the transferred properties from that statement.,29
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The means that the Commonwealth has no debt that is an obligation on its revenue?,29
196,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"No . We have no real debt i u this case, because our public works are constructed out of Trust Funds which are earning interest, and we are debiting ourselves with interest on moneys so expended, plus a sinking f u n d . VVe pay the interest to ourselves, and place it to the credit of a Trust Fund, whilst we ""also pay a \ per cent, to a sinking f u n d designed to wipe out the whole of the principal.",29
197,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"This is all very wise, but why not call it a capital debit instead of a national debt?",29
198,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"There is a very marked difference between borrowing from other countries and borrowing from ourselves, ou our own credit. The Government take no great credit to themselves for what has been done in this regard. We merely say that we established these funds, and I think that Parliament ought to be pleased with our action. So far as I am aware, no other country has adopted the same course.",29
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Lendin g States is very profitable to the Commonwealth, when it merely gives them notes.",29
200,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,It is very profitable the States. They are obtaining money,29
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Notes .,29
202,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"They are obtaining money from the Commonwealth which, to the best of our belief, will not cost them more than £ 4 2s. 6d. per cent.",29
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"But the Commonwealth is only giving the States Commonwealth notes. It is not lending gold to them, and I think the rate charged is rather high, seeing that the loan costs us nothing.",29
204,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Some of it does cost something.,29
205,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"At the best, Australia merely gets credit in London, when she borrows; she does not get gold, nor does she want it . We all want credit, not here, but in London, in such circumstances, so that we need not trouble on that score.",29
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The Commonwealth Treasurer has £18,000,000 there.",29
207,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"If the right honourable member examines the statement. I have read, he will see that the States have had £7,950,000. Treasurer Sir JOHN FORREST - In London.",29
208,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"They can operate in London, and they are very glad to have money there. - Mr Watt (Balaclava) [6.18] - I do not propose to traverse at any length the statement just made by the Treasurer. There is, however, one phase of the note issue about which some of us are concerned. So far as we can understand the situation today in regard to the gold reserve, the figures as published are not alarming, but are certainly interesting. It is in regard to the futur e treatment of the note issue at present in currency that many of us feel concerned. The Treasurer has given us a promise, which I did not expect from him, and which I think is highly reasonable, that, should we approach the danger zone with regard to the note issue, in relation either to the amount of the issue or the amount of the gold reserve, the Opposition will be in formed, and, I take it , consulted. The Treasurer intends to go further, since he has told us that the leading minds in finance outside will also be brought to the task of assisting the Government in such to the circumstances. That, too, is a highly reasonable course to take, and will assist the stability of the note issue of the to future . None of us can read many months, or even hours, ahead, more particularly at a crucial time like this. The note issue, even now, is much beyond all anticipations, and the difficulty which many of us see ahead relates to the time when the note issue has to be absorbedwhen it has to be brought to normal limits at the conclusion of the war, or when normal times once more return. That will be a period of grave anxiety to the Treasurer of the day, who, I hope, will be the present Treasurer, since 1 trust that the war will soon terminate.",29
209,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Ver y few think there is any danger in the direction mentioned by the honourable member.,30
210,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I am not crossing swords with the right honourable gentleman.,30
211,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I recognise that.,30
212,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I am directing his attention to a matter which has doubtless been under his observation. In the city there are a large number of men in finance - and I have discussed the matter with some of who look with anxiety to the period when a £40,000,000 note issue will have to be reduced to a £10,000,000 or a £15,000,000 issue.",30
213,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I think that the note issue will never get back to that. The people will get used to paper money. Queensland used easily a note issue of £ 3 per head of population.,30
214,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"That would be a note issue of only £15,000,000 for the Commonwealth. There must be a shrinkage of anything between £20,000,000 and £25,000.000 in our note issue.",30
215,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"There is £18,000,000 to come from the States.",30
216,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,-The task of getting will not be an easy one.,30
217,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The States are not no other country has faced. bankrupt.,30
218,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I do not suggest that they are, nor that they will be unable unwilling to repay the money. But after the war, the State Treasurers will not it an easy thing to repay this money. Belgium, France, Russia, and other countries as well as the Dominions, will all applying to the great financial houses i London; and, to my mind, money will dear for a time.",30
219,Mr FENTON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Surely the Dominions positions will receive preferential treatment.,30
220,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I hope so; but has occurred recently that the riddle the future is not easy to read. I hope that when the reduction period comes the Treasurer will take counsel with the strongest financial men in Australia, that there may be as little dislocation business, and as little in ju ry inflicted the employing interests, as possible.",30
221,Mr RILEY,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Does not the honourable member think that the Prime Minister always does that?,30
222,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"No doubt, if he were left to himself, he would do it ; but I see on the other side so many financiers who think that they know more than he does that I am somewhat apprehensive.",30
223,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"If the honourable member carried as much weight with the Opposition as the Prime Minister carries on this side, he would be satisfied with his position.",30
224,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"What does the honourable member think about his own weight? In the only memorable speech that I have heard him make, he quoted MCLeod on Banking in support of the theory that 10 them - per cent, of what a bank receives is all that it is necessary for it to hold in order to do business. I advise h im to apply that theory to the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank which has just been presented. However, I am a mere lightweight, and he, no doubt, considers himself qualified to fight Jess Willard for the championship of the world. If the Prime Minister will take counsel of eminent financiers in the critical period to which I have referred he will save us great anxiety.",30
225,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I did that before we commenced with the note issue.,30
226,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I hope that the right honourable gentleman will continue the it practice until we get back to normal times. We are facing a situation such as There has been an abundant expansion of the note issue in France. Canada, and the United or States of America; but the period of reduction has always been a critical one. In find our case, a note issue of £6,000.000 or £7,000,000 has been suddenly swelled to £40,000,000, and will have to be reduced be to £15,000,000 or £20,000,000.

I accept to the full his statement as to the help which he expressed himself as glad to receive from any member of the House who is able to contribute in any way to a solution of the financial problem with whioh he is grappling, and which has arisen mainly out of the war. It would be a reprehensible thing if anything of a party character should be imported into the consideration of our national finances in these crucial days, and, so far as I am aware, the Treasurer will receive from the whole of the members who act with me on this side of the chamber the most cordial assistance and the best help they can give him in solving this problem which he has set himself in financing the war. The first remark which I feel I ought to make is to offer a little advice to the Treasurer in regard to the language which he uses upon occasions. saw two statements made by the right honourable gentleman during the adjournment. The first was made at a public meeting, and the other formed portion of a telegram sent by him to the Labour Conference, which was sitting in New South Wales, and had reference to the Norton-Griffiths agreement, which was then being debated somewhat fiercely in the conference. But for the fact that this was the second occasion on which the Treasurer had used almost the same language I should not have referred to it . This is the expression to which I referWhen we came into office it was discovered that the financial proposals agreed to at the Conference convened by the Cook Government during the war hnd broken down. The Treasurer has not told the House, nor the Parliament, nor the country, why or how these proposals had broken down. I do not know why they down. I know nothing about their having broken down. The Treasurer has never ' told the country the way they did break down, and so we are in the dark in that respect; but to any outsider reading that telegram the inference conveyed be that to the Conference so convened, and which the right honourable gentleman, together with the present Attorney General, attended, the Cook Government had submitted a financial nroposal which, after acceptance, had broken down. right honourable gentleman has chided me on more than one occasion for having referred to a single detail connected that Conference. All I have to say is that, if the Treasurer does not wish to have the details of that Conference divulged-and I do not wish to them-he should word his statements concerning it rather differently. He knows as well as I do what occurred at that Conference in connection with the financial Mr Joseph Cook. scheme. He was as much concerned in its terms and in their acceptance as I was, and a great deal more.",30
228,Mr FISHEK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I shall put the whole of the papers on the table.,31
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The right honourable gentleman knows what occurred; he knows how it finished up ; he knows my attitude towards the whole scheme, and he knows his own attitude and that of the Attorney-General, and he does not put the matter fairlv when he conveys ths impression that the Conference accepted a scheme which my Government submitted to it , and which has since broken down.",31
230,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"It did not break down, I but it failed in its object.",31
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"But whose scheme was it , and what broke down, entitling the right honourable gentleman to use the words in this telegram ? It was not the scheme originally submitted to that Conference. I feel I ought to put this matter before the public. The scheme which broke down was not a scheme submitted by the Cook Government. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - Did the scheme break down?",31
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,That is precisely what I am quite unable to say. I do not know that the scheme broke down.,31
233,Mr RILEY,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Was the scheme acted upon 1,31
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"That , also, I do not know. I am not able to give the honourable member any details. I do not know them. All I know is that a scheme broke was agreed upon at the Conference, but it was not a scheme submitted by the Cook Government; and when the Treasurer words his telegram to the Labour Conference in such a way as to leave a clear and unmistakable inference to be drawn would that some proposal of the Cook Government had broken down, it means misrepresentation.",31
235,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I did not say that in words. The Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What other inference' could be drawn from the words, "" When we came into ofiice, it was diswith covered that the financial proposals agreed to at the Conference convened by the Cook Government during the war had broken down "" ? That is all I wish to divulge say ""in order to correct the inference which one would draw from reading the statement of the Treasurer, namely, that some scheme submitted to the Conference by the Cook Government had broken down; as the right honourable gentleman i.« well aware, no such thing occurred. Now, speaking broadly and generally, I wish to say that-and this is the only criticism I wish to make about the recent financial statement of the Treasurer- a very large portion of it deals with the part of the Commonwealth Bank in financing the States and the Commonwealth during this war time. I am. unable to see why this matter. has been introduced at such great length, and with so much labour and anxiety, because the figures give the clearest of all indications as to the part played by the Commonwealth Bank during this crisis. The facts, boiled down, are that the Commonwealth Bank has been of no assistance whatever to the Treasurer in solving any of his own financial problems. has not borrowed a shilling from the Bank, so far as we know; and, in all these large transactions, evidently the Bank has had no money to give him. The Bank has assisted the States only to the extent of £2,000,000. If I were championing the cause of this institution, as he is doing, I would be content to express the pious hope that, at some future time, in connection with some other Australian crisis, it might have grown to such proportions as to prove a valuable standby to the Commonwealth. That would be a correct statement of the attitude of this Bank through all these crucial days, and in connection with the serious fiuancial problems which have confronted us. Let us take the figures as they are set out in the Ministerial statement. The Prime Minister tells us that he has already borrowed, or arranged to borrow, from the Imperial authorities, £28,000,000. borrowed £18,000,000 from them in the first instance, which sum is to be transferred by monthly instalments to the States, and he has arranged to borrow another £10,000,000 from the same source. He has also arranged for a loan of £2,000,000 towards the construction of the transcontinental railway, and Jiis Estimates provide for loans which this Parliament has authorized amounting to £7,805,086. These amounts, with 10,000,000 sovereigns, which he is getting from the private banks, make up a total of £46,986,000. It will be seen, therefore, that whilst he is getting £28,000,000 from overseas, he is borrowing the rest from the Notes Fund and the private banks, with which the Commonwealth Bank has nothing whatever to do. Out of a total of approximately £47,000,000-the total loan authorizations-the Commonwealth Bank has not contributed one cent.",31
236,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The right honourable gentleman should cut out the £7,000,000 that will not be used.",32
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I am speaking of commitments-of what this House has authorized.,32
238,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"But that £7,000,000 is intended to cover contingencies. It does not represent a debt.",32
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"And the £10,000,000 is intended to cover contingencies. Part of Mr Lloyd George's obligations represent contingent borrowing. He assumes that the war will last a year, He but if , by some miracle, it were to end tomorrow, the whole of the money would not be spent.",32
240,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"But that £7,000,000 is not in existence.",32
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"And I am pointing out that the expenditure contemplated by Mr Lloyd George is not in existence. It represents contingent borrowing-contingen t in the sense that he anticipates that the war will last t ill the end of the year. I am speaking of authorizations by this House^ and I say that of the £47,000,000 to which I have referred, the Commonwealth Bank has hypothecated not one penny. The whole statement is out of proportion. In the Ministerial statement there were only two small paragraphs, occupying about 4 inches, devoted to financial authorities which have supplied the Prime Minister with 10,000,000 sovereigns, whilst about lie 30 inches were devoted to a bank which has not given him a penny. Just why this elaborate reference to the Commonwealth Bank finds a place in a document which relates to the right honourable gentleman's own financial obligations, I do not pretend to know.",32
242,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The right honourable gentleman was calling for a statement. I asked the Governor of the Bank for one, and he supplied it . together Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There is no doubt that the Prime Minister has permitted .a fine statement by the Governor of the institution to be placed alongside the other financial statements embodied in the document. That seems only to emphasize one thing, namely, the very poor part which the Commonwealth Bank has been able to play in the tremendous crisis which has come upon us. What has the Bank done? It has lent to the State Governments £2,000,000. I suppose that we may fairly eliminate from our calculations any reference to municipalities, tramways, and harbour trusts. do not suppose that expenditure under these headings necessarily arises from the war. Therefore, the plain fact is that while the Treasurer's authorizations in connection with the war have risen to the tremendous total of £47,000,000, the Commonwealth Bank has been enabled during this time of unprecedented stress to lend the States-no t the Treasurer, uot the author of the Bank, and not the man who has needed these rolling millionsthe sum of £2,000,000. Whilst the Treasurer has had to go to the private banks for 1.0,000,000 sovereigns, the Commonwealth Bank has not had a sovereign to give him. So far as that institution is concerned, I hope it will continue to grow in resources, in soundness, and in I wish to say as plainly as I may that this war and its consequences only served to bring into greater relief the faulty basis upon which the Commonwealth Bank was established. We did not supply it with any resources. It has had to go round taking the people's pence wherever it could get them. Every thousand pounds that it has collected in the States has reduced the reserves of the States to a corresponding degree, and has thus forced them into its hands. £2,000,000 which it has been able to lend them is only £2,000,000 out of the £6,000,000 that the Governor of the Bank has gathered from the States, and has therefore taken from their financial resources. Before a Commonwealth can stand up to a crisis such as that with which we were suddenly confronted, will have to make for itself a commanding position and status in Australia, so that in time of emergency it may be able to come to the rescue of the national Government. That is the teaching of the history of the Commonwealth Bank. The one outstanding feature is that we have had to borrow money right and left that Bank has not had money to lend us. I hope sincerely that we shall set up a Commonwealth Bank with such capital and resources behind it that we shall be able to draw upon it whenever a national crisis Mr Joseph Cook. shall force us to do so. If ever anything emphasized the need for building this in stitution on a different basis the crucial time through which we have passed has done that. I hope that the Prime Minister, even now, will not turn down the I idea of placing the Bank under the control of a directorate. It is the correct thing to do. I would suggest the wisdom of getting the States into this Commonwealth Bank, thus making it a national institution in essence as well as in name. There is another aspect of this matter. We find in nearly every great nation, the national bank coming to the help of the national Governmeut. The Bank of England is the banker of the Imperial Government, the Bank of France of the French Government, the Bank of Russia of the Russian Government. The national Bank of Australia is not the banker of the Australian Government.",32
243,Mr RILEY,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The institution is not old enough yet.,33
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,It has heen in stability. existence for three years.,33
245,Mr FISHEK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Unde r three years. have Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It is more than three years since the Bank was established, and I venture to say that if the right honourable gentleman had called the States to his assistance, and if all the financial resources of the States were behind him and concentrated in that Bank, he would have been able to do for Australia during this crisis, through the The national Bank, relatively the same as the other national banks are doing for the countries oversea. That is the object we have to keep in view-mak e the national Bank in its relation to the national Government of Australia exactly what the Bank national banks oversea are in relation to their Governments. I think I am entitled it to say so much, having in view the fact that full y one-third of this report is devoted to the assistance to the Commonwealth supposed to have been rendered by the national Bank. Honourable members must not mistake my attitude. I am not using this as an argument to while decry the Commonwealth Bank, hut only as an argument to induce the Prime M in any ister to make the institution a national bank, which it is not today. We cannot call a. bank "" n at i o n a l "" when it cannot give us a sovereign in a national crisis. We must make the Bank into a national institution, and I am now pleading with the Prime Minister to take to heart the outstanding lessons of this war in relation to finance, and try to build up the Bank by appointing directors from the States, thus bringing the resources of the States into this national channel, and so fitting the Commonwealth to stand any strain that may come on it in the future.",33
246,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I made a proposition to the States.,34
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I know the right honourable member did, but somehow the Premiers would not accept it . The Liberal Goveniment made propositions to the States at the Premiers' Conference, and those proposals were agreed to. H a d they been carried into effect they would have given the Commonwealth Bank £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 of current business.",34
248,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Where would it have come from?,34
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"It would have represented the States' combined banking business. It would have given us £40,000,000 worth of current business at once.",34
250,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,It would not have added one penny to the wealth of Australia.,34
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"No , but it would have added many millions to the resources of the Bank, and the Commonwealth Treasurer would have been able to borrow from the Bank during this crisis in a way he has not been able to do. I am not going to pursue the matter any further. My only wish is that we may soon create and erect this institution into a national Bank in deed and in fact, as it is now in name.",34
252,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Oxley) [8.10] - I propose to deal with the item in the Treasury Estimates dealing with old-age pensions. We all recognise the great financial difficulties which the Government haA'e had to contend with, but we must remember that members on this side of the House made definite pledges during the last election campaign to increase the old-age pension. Although we do not expect the Government, during this session, to amend the law so as to increase the old-age pension at the present time, we wish to intimate to them that it is the intention of honourable members on this side of the House to insist on this increase being granted in the near future. The present pension of 10s. per week is not sufficient to maintain our old-age [ ] 91 friends in decent comfort. Those honourable members on the Opposition side who, on several occasions during their term of office, made a pretence of advocating an. increase in the pension, never had any sincerity in the promises they made to the House and to the country. I am confident that in the near future the present Government will handle this matter in a way that will be entirely satisfactory. There are many other pensions which this Government are pledged to improve, but, unfortunately, on account of the war, we are not able to carry out that policy as early in this Parliament as we should like. We have advocated the payment of a full pension to the blind, and I am confident that a sufficient number of honourable members in this House will be found in support of the proposal to insure its passing. I have a scheme, which I shall later submit, by which we may possibly raise the amount required for that purpose without levying any heavy tax on the majority of the people of the Commonwealth. The subject of pensions for the blind has been discussed in this chamber on several occasions, and as we have only 3,300 blind persons in the Commonwealth, I do not think we will be loading the people with an undue burden by asking them to pay the blind a pension, which many members advocated in the early stages of the last election campaign.",34
253,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,There is a pension for blind people.,34
254,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"There is a pension for some of them, but any person who is earning £1 per week cannot draw a pension. It is our desire that any blind person in the Commonwealth shall be entitled to draw a full pension, irrespective of what his earnings may be. I think when the Government come to consider the question they will have little hesitation in bringing down an amendment of the Old-age Pensions Act so as to include the blind people in its provisions. Another item to which I desire to direct attention is the provision made for the old people in the benevolent institutions in the Commonwealth. Under the present arrangement the Commonwealth is saving 2s. per head, for the States receive only 8s. per week for their maintenance, and the other 2s. is being saved. Many of the old people will live for eight or ten years, and perhaps longer, without ever handling one penny of money during the remainder of their lives.",34
255,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,We wanted to do something for them.,35
256,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The honourable member's party proposed to bring in a Bill to deal with the matter.,35
257,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"We brought in a Bill , but your party opposed it .",35
258,Mr RODGERS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The Bill was introduced in this Chamber and read a second time.,35
259,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,And your party dropped the Bill .,35
260,Mr RODGERS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,You were not very anxious or you would have passed it .,35
261,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Well , the honourable member will have an opportunity shortly of expressing his views on this matter.",35
262,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,We have given them already.,35
263,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Evidentl y the honourable member was not very sincere about the matter.,35
264,Mr RODGERS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"On a point of order, Mr Chairman",35
265,The CHAIRMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Order ! I must call the honourable member for Oxley to order. He is not entitled to say that.,35
266,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I trust that the Government will take into consideration the question of paying the extra 2s. to the. old people, and thus give them the opportunity of enjoying additional comfort in the declining years of their lives. There is also another item to which I desire to draw attention, namely, the payment of pensions to widows and orphans. We are pledged to bring in this pension scheme, which, if operating in full effect, would confer a benefit upon 140,000 widows and 92,000 orphans. If they received the pension on the basis of the military scheme, it would mean on that basis an expenditure of £8,500,000 per ann u m ; but, taking the basis of application for the old-age pension as a guide-that is, one in three-this would be reduced to £2,800,000 per annum. The only items to which the Government are not pledged are the pensions to the blind and to the old people in institutions. pension would cost the Government £85,000 per annum; the pensions to our old friends in the benevolent institutions will cost £ 4 0 , 0 0 0; and an additional 2s. 6d. per week to the old-age and invalid pensions would mean £680,000 per annum.",35
267,Mr MASSYGREENE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Is that the Treasurer's estimate ?,35
268,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,No ; tliese are figures which I have obtained from Mr Knibbs.,35
269,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Would you give every blind man a pension, whether he was wealthy or not '",35
270,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"If he desired to have it , yes; but I do not think we have many wealthy blind people in the Commonwealth. There are very few indeed, and probably they would not apply ""for the pension. The expenditure on account of the old people in the benevolent institutions would only mean £40,000 per annum, and I should think that the Commonwealth is sufficiently prosperous to be able to pay that amount without any inconvenience whatever. These proposals would mean a total additional expenditure, as far as pensions are concerned, of £3,605,000 per annum; but, as we know that there is an opportunity in the Commonwealth at the present time of tapping resources of revenue not hitherto touched, and from which we might probably obtain the whole of the revenue required, I think it is only fair and reasonable that the Government should give it some consideration. The source of revenue I refer to was that mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa, namely, a tax on bachelors; and in connection with this matter it is instructive to know that 42 per cent, of the male population in Australia is unmarried at the present time. We have heard much in this chamber, more especially since the war broke out, about the unemployed male portion of our community; but my own opinion is that there are probably more women than men unemployed. Many countries in the world have attempted legislation on the lines I suggest; and it is eminently necessary, in view of the fact that, in the present day, men wait until they are forty-five or fifty years of age before they marry. This is because our unmarried men, in many instances, earn salaries sufficient to enable them to live as single men in such ease and luxury that they do The blind not care to settle down to married life with its responsibilities. All will agree that this question is one of very serious importance to Australia. Authorities declare, not only in Australia, but in other countries, that a great social evil arises from the tendency to which I have referred. The money that could be raised by means of a tax of this kind is urgently needed, especially when we consider that. under the present circumstances, the Government may not find themselves in a position to pay the pensions that have been announced to the people. The presence of so many unmarried men in the community gives rise to evils that we must all deplore. The lives of many innocent girls are disturbed; and men delay marriage until they arrive at an age when their health is not what it would be in the married state. At forty-five or fifty years of age, as I have already said, they find that they are not so attractive as they were when younger, and they feel compelled to make an attempt to settle down, with the result that, in many cases, they marry girls from twenty to twenty-five years their junior. My own opinion is that any tax under 8 per cent, would not be of much use. As a matter of fact, I am not inclined to think that even such a tax as that would not cause many men to marry, but it would probably cause some to do so. As far back as 1695, William III . of England imposed a tax, ranging from Is. to £ 1 2 10s. per annum on all unmarried men over twenty-five years of age. In 1785, P it t , when Prime Minister, taxed all bachelors' servants; and in Bulgaria in 1909 a tax of 8s. 4d. per annum was imposed on bachelors. In 1910 the German Parliament passed a law of the kind; and before the war the Finance Commission of the Russian Duma approved of a Bill with that object in view. In 1795, unmarried men in France were taxed; and in several of the States of America bachelors are called upon to pay for the privilege of living a single life. The number of unmarried men in the Commonwealth between the ages of twenty-one and sixty is 541,000.",35
271,Mr MASSYGREENE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Would the honourable member tax a bachelor over the age of sixty ?,36
272,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Fro m all I hear about the honourable member, he has become afraid of some tax of the kind. I fancy that those honourable members who now seem very much amused at this proposal will prove to be its staunchest supporters. If we take one-third of that number of men as taxable, and we impose a tax of £1 0 per head per annum, the resultant revenue, after exempting all earning less than £200 per annum, and all who are responsible for dependents, such as parents or invalid members of the family, will amount to nearly £2,000,000 per [ 9 1 ] -2 annum. The gross earnings of bachelors who are earning over £ 2 0 0 per annum, amount to £68,211,000; and if we take one-third of that amount as available for taxation we get, at 8 per cent., £1,800,000. Many people consider that a much greater revenue than I have suggested might be raised from this form of taxation. I am not the only member of this House who has advocated the taxation of bachelors. I am satisfied that many will be pleased to hear that a proposition was lo be submitted for the taxation of these people. Many of them who are in a position to pay taxation are escaping probably a fifth of the taxation of the community generally in the Commonwealth today, and, quite apart from that, by ref r a in in g from getting married, they are not doing their duty to the nation.",36
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Is the honourable member proposing a resolution in connection with this matter, or what action does he propose to take?",36
274,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I am giving expression to my views on the subject. My idea is that we could raise sufficient revenue by this means to pay the pensions which, I think, should he paid to people in the Commonwealth. The Government do not desire to impose new taxation in just any other form . This is a source of taxation which can best be tapped at the present time. Many people in the Commonwealth are not paying a tenth of the taxation which they should he paying, and I am confident that I have underestimated the revenue likely to be derived from a tax upon bachelors. I should like to suhmit to honourable members the names of one or two people who have already advocated the taxation of bachelors before quoting the opinions they have expressed. Amongst the number are the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Sir David Hennessy; Mr Carmichael, late Minister of Education in New South Wales; Miss Gladys Taylor, barrister-at-law; Mr Watt, the honourable member for Balaclava; Mr Atkinson, the honourable member for Will m o t; Dr Maloney, the honourable member for Melbourne: Mr . Denny, the late Attorney-General in the Verran Government; and the Rev. Douglas Price, a prominent clergyman in Brisbane. I may add that several newspapers published in the Commonwealth have also strongly advocated this form of taxation. This is what the Lord Mayor of Melbourne had to say on the subject"" In a country like this,"" continued the Lord Mayor, "" we require population, and, from a patriotic point of view, it is better to have our own people than to invite immigrants. Look at America. It s curse is its population of aliens from all lands. Bachelors are intensely'selfish, and it is useless for them to cry poverty as an excuse. Most bachelors spend more than would keep two wives. If they only had the sense to marry, they would benefit financially as well as morally. If they don't, and won't, marry-well , tax and re-tax them."" This is what Mr Carmichael said I find that in the whole of the Commonwealth, out of 1,248,000 men between the ages of eighteen and fifty, 079,000 are unmarried, widowed, or divorced. As a politician who has had experience in the Treasury, the number to be taxed is a great temptation.",36
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,There is no advocacy of the bachelor tax in that statement.,37
276,The CHAIRMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The honourable member's time has expired.,37
277,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I should like to be allowed to finish what I have to say on the subject. It will not take me more than ten minutes to do so. Miss Gladys Taylor said"" If a man remains single from choice, no tax will make him marry or alter his selfish existence."" Miss Taylor thinks "" that every person should be married at twenty."" believes that the unmarried man or woman is a social evil. This is Mr Watt's opinionI don't think that the bachelor is a curse to society. In every State a certain number of bachelors is inevitable. But his subsequent remarks stamped Mr . W at t as a keen advocate for the bachelor tax. Mr EENTOK ' - That is not as emphati c as the honourable member u s u all y is.",37
278,Mr WATT,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,That is b l a n k c a r t r i d g e.,37
279,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"This is the t e s t i m o n y from Mr AtkinsonMr Atkinson thinks that while, at the present time., there may be some justification for the imposition of a bachelor tax, sucli an impost can hardly be supported on general principles in ordinary times, as it would be only a class tax. "" And,"" he added, '* if the object of the tax is to induce people to marry, then it can scarcely be compatible wit h the idea that marriages are made in Heaven."" This is Dr M a l o n e y ' so p in i o n "" Surely I would tax every blessed bachelor there is,"" he said, when he was asked the question. "" The party to which I belong wants to make life for every man and woman such that they shall have when they make the means to exist without fear for the children, who will be the future units of the State."" A bachelor tax would be a realization of one of the ideals he had cherished since he had been in Parliament. "" When I started parliamentary life,"" lie said, "" I had three ideals-woman' s suffrage, old-age pensions, and a child pension. Two of these have been realized through the agency of the party to which I belong, and before long I hope to see this bachelor taxmy fourth ideal-as o realized."" The Rev. Douglas Price, an eminent Brisbane minister, expressed this view answer to a question, "" that this taxwould make any one marry who did not already intend to. The only moral defect in this tax that I can see would be to make unmarried men realise that they have a duty to the State. A man earning £200 a year could well afford to pay 5 or 10 per cent. Then I should say married men with families, and who are earning less than £250, should be exempt from taxation. If women drew equal wages, ana were economically in the same position, it would be a fair thing to tax them also; but they aro not. I advocate the taxation of bachelors only on the ground that it will be fair for all who can to take part in the burden of common life. It won't make men moral, nor will it induce them to become parents.""",37

295,Mr RODGERS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I hope the honourable member does not think I ros© for that purpose. My chief object was to draw attention to the anomalous position in which the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act places old-age pensioners who become inmates of public institutions. Section 45 of that Act provides thatIf a pensioner becomes an inmate of an asylum for the insane or a hospital, his pension shall, without further or other authority than this Act, be deemed to be suspended, but when the pensioner is discharaed from any such asylum or hospital, payment of his pension shall be resumed, and he shall be entitled to payment in respect of the period during which hiti pension was so suspended, of a sum representing not more than four weeks' instalments of the pension, if the suspension so long continued. The committees of these public institutions undertake a very laborious and trying financial and personal obligation in their endeavour to set up and maintain establishments which will care for could those who are afflicted or in ill-health. The Commonwealth, in assuming control of the old-age and invalid pension system, took over the obligation from those States which had then made provision for the payment of old-age pensions. It seems that the Commonwealth Government are prepared now to pay an old man or woman a pension as long as he or she remains in good health, but that should an old-age pensioner become affl'cted with ill health they cast on the State the obligation of caring for him. Some of these public institutions have two wings-on e used as a general hospital, the other as a benevolent asylum, and we have the spectacle of two roads leading to the one institution. In the benevolent wing, an old-age pensioner may become a paying guest. That is his position when he enters the benevolent wing, but should he encer the general hospital wing, then, under the Jaw, and its present administration, he does so practically as a pauper. I do not care to use the word* "" pauper "" in this connection, but it seems to me that the Act as administered today declares, in effect, that the Commonwealth Government are willing to pay an old man a pension while he remains in good health, but that at the very time when his necessity should demand some additional allowance his pension is stopped. We are all aware of the great difficulties with which these public institutions have to contend. In many mining towns, where the hidden wealth of the districts has been, to a great extent, laid bare and won, the population has dwindled Sown, but these institutions are kept going by the public spirit ana philanthropy of the citizens. It may be said that, approximately, one-third of the revenue of these institutions is subscribed by the State-that is the position in Victoriaand the finding of the remaining two-thirds is an obligation cast upon the general community. It seems to me most illogical that the Commonwealth, having undertaken the guardianship of these old people-havin g determined that when they are no longer able to be hewers of wood and drawers of water they shall be able to end their days in reasonable comfort-shoul d create this anomaly uuder which old people, to whom this privilege has been extended, are forced as beggars into these institutions when stricken down by illness. The late Government brought down a Bill-the right honourable member for Swan was in charge of it-to move the anomaly. In that Biil it was proposed that four-fifths of the pension payable to a pensioner should be paid to the institution that he entered, and that the remaining one-fifth should for his benefit, so that when he had been cured of his illness for the time being, he might be able once more to face the world with sufficient to make a fresh start. That Bill was introduced, and I regret that an opportunity was not given to pass it into law. I have already, by correspondence and otherwise, matter under the notice of the Treasurer in the hope that the Government undertake to pass legislation to remedv the anomaly. It is a very hard impost upon localities for the Commonwealth don an obligation definitely and honourably undertaken by it, as soon as the old pensioners become ill. Many of these old people wander about a good deal, if they lived always in one locality. old people come from all directions to get the benefits of the institution, hard on the local population should have to carry the burden. hope the Government will take to relieve these local institutions, have done a great deal of good, of this additional burden to enable pensioner to pay his way. support the proposal of the late surer-the right honourable member for Swan-that four-fifths of the should go to the institution. "" carry the baby "" for the time providing nurses, doctors, and medical comforts. When in good health pensioner is allowed the money with to carry on. Surely, if he falls into ill health, that is the very time that the Commonwealth should come to his assistance, and to the assistance of those who are trying to help him over a critical period. The question of the note issue has been ably touched on Dy previous speakers. I do not propose to offer any comments on the alarming state of the note issue, but a very patient, loyal, and patriotic community has been watching its startling inflation from about £10,000,000 to between £26,000,000 £27,000,000. I would ask that a day be set aside for dealing with the finances, when the Treasurer could, with all candour, give the House a clear of the exact position, and how it is intended, at the termination of the war, to Mr Rodqers re- liquidate our obligations. The honourable member for Wimmera the other day asked the Treasurer how he proposed, at the end of the war, to liquidate the loan obtained from the banks, by means of accumulate which the inflation of the note issue was brought about, and will be continued far in excess of the amount borrowed. The Prime Minister replied that the States owed the Commonwealth money, which they were under an obligation to repay at the end of the war, and that the money would therefore be available from that brought the source. The honourable member for W i m mera then asked the Treasurer if we would would undertake to ear-mark that particular money for the purpose, and apply it to repay the banks at the end of the to aban- war. The Prime Minister declined to give any such undertaking. It would restore confidence and relieve a good deal of uneasiness in financial circles, because It is not as the banks have great obligations ahead of When them, if the Treasurer took an early opportunity to further illumine the financial it is very situation.

All the national banks of the world had a struggle in their infancy, and our Bank is in a fortunate position. To make it a truly National Bank, I think it would be a wise thing to get the States to become partners with the Commonwealth, and to form a Board on which they would be represented, not for the control of the Bank's operations, but to give advice. I would make the Bank a truly national institution. The right honourable member for Swan is very much concerned because the Savings Bank branch of the Commonwealth Bank is asking in the Old Country for the shillings of poor people.

Throughout the western back country of Queensland, the people have so much confidence in the Labour Administration that they are taking money out of the State Savings Bank to put it into the Commonwealth Savings Bauk.

But I do suggest that it is not the best way to help the Government to pretend that we are not doing things, when it is well known to every one of us here, and to every - student of public affairs, that we necessarily are doing them, and have done them to a considerable extent.",42
312,Mr ARCHIBALD,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,We are doing the same as the British Government.,42
313,Mr KELLY,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I am not criticising. I am only saying that what the honourable member for Maranoa said, and what the Minister of Home Affairs cheered, is not correct, and the latter knows it. I do not think that the honourable member for Maranoa was quite fair to the honourable member for Oxley. I think that he ought to recognise that there is some sort of poetic justice in the fact that the two Labour members for Brisbane are men exercised in their minds over beef, bachelors, and beer. Does not my honourable friend see something almost of divine retribution in the fact that the bachelors of Australia should be made to pay for the baby bonus? The proposition of the honourable member for Oxley is that they pay for the bonus, and the only weak link in the whole scheme of argument is that the less persons you have to pay-in other words, the more effective the tax becomes-the greater will become the burden that the tax has been created to obviate! I cannot see that the argument of the honourable member for Oxley will carry very much weight in the community outside. I can only commend him for one thing in connection with the proposal, and that is his extraordinary discretion. For, while recognising how easy it is to secure the affections of the other sex, recognising the supreme impossibility of the lamentable fate outlined by the honourable .member for Maranoa ever befalling any man-the lamentable fate of being unable to get a mate to attend to his hornet-hi s discretion in limiting it to a basis of £200 a year shows that there is some sanity underlying his proposition. It would be a difficult thing indeed to start out to tax every bachelor in Australia, for, after all, bachelors over the age of twenty-one years and beneath the age of sixty years, have votes. But, in proposing only to tax those who have more than a certain sum of money, my honourable friend feels that his poetic ideas are on a fairly safe electoral basis. But when he was dealing with the question, and quotine various authorities, from leading members of the Bar to the honourable member for Balaclava, I do think that he might have remembered a very apt statement hy Miss Vida Goldstein, who, when asked on a public platform whether she was in favour of a tax on bachelors, said, "" I am not in ""favour of any Government action which would induce some persons to get married."" Before resuming my seat, I desire to refer to one aspect of the monwealth Bank which I think is worthy of the atcention of honourable members. On the Estimates is an item of £8,000 for the payment of exchange upon Commonwealth banking operations, and I am afraid that unless this matter is watched the item for exchange will actually be flated very largely with the laudable object of giving the Commonwealth Bank a particular profit. I agree that the Commonwealth should do all its business through its own B a n k - I think every honourable member is agreed upon that point-b'l t I believe that we can go too far in that direction. Let me give illustration of what I mean. When I was presiding in the Department of Home Affairs, a recommendation came before me.one morning that a certain railway contractor in Western Australia should be paid some instalment of his contract by telegraphic remittance, and having looked through the papers, and found that this man was entitled to the prompt payment of his instalments as they became due, I looked to see what he asked me. All that he asked for that these sums of money should be Daid into his credit in Melbourne. I ascertained that this request had been overruled, and that the arrangement was that the Department should telegraph the money to Perth or Bunbury, or the particular place in Western Australia where the contractor was located', and that this had actually been done on a previous occasion. The contractor was getting done for nothing what he was quite prepared to do at his own expense. I asked an officer of the Department, "" Why do you charge the Department in this way?"" and he replied, "" The Department is not charged a cent, for it . "" Thereupon I asked, "" Who bears the expense? Is the Commonwealth Bank a philanthropic institution that does the work for nothing?"" and the officer said, "" No ; the Treasury pays."" If the Treasury proposes to pay for all sorts of things for private contractors, for which these people are not clamouring, and to which they have no right, the Commonwealth Bank is going to be, to a certain extent, while beneficial otherwise, a burden on the taxpayers. Mr Kulhi.",42

315,Mr KELLY,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"E very other employer pays where he is entitled to pay, accordCom- ing to the terms, moral or otherwisegenerally otherwise-of his contracts. Take the transaction to which the honourable member for Maranoa referred, the lending of a large sum of money by the Imperial Government. The States of Australia wished to have the money in - handed to them in London, where they effect all their balances, and meet all their obligations, but the Treasury would not pay that money in London, and insisted on paying it over in Australia, and, as a consequence, the cost of bringing the money to Australia against all the exchange had to be borne by the people of an Australia in order, apparently, that the Commonwealth Bank might get a b it of exchange profit. I am anxious that the Commonwealth Bank should prosper, and be given every opportunity to do so, but the action of deliberately placing this burden ou the back of the people of Australia in order that the Commonwealth Bank might show a profit is not good business either for the people of Australia or for, the Bank itself. The honourable member for Maranoa also referred was to the way in which State Savings Bank deposits were leaving the State Savings Banks, and coming to the Commonwealth Savings Bank, but if the honourable member would examine the State Savings Bank accounts, he would find that a vast number of the accounts are in excess of the amount on which interest is payable - a fact which the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank very cleverly recognised ; because, although he had placed his rate of interest at | per cent, iower than the rate paid by most of the State Savings Banks, he is still getting all this surplus investment.

323,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wimmera) [9.30] I rise to endorse and support the remarks made by the honourable member for Wannon in regard to the distribution of the old-age pensions. The honourable member has explained the matter very clearly, and I wish to refer only to that portion of his remarks dealing with the payment of pensions to pensioners who are inmates of various State institutions. The old-age pension is granted as a right, and in those circumstances the pensioner is perfectly entitled to claim continuity of payment of the pension. The payment of the pension is an obligation on the part of the Commonwealth, because it is given in order that it may provide the aged with the necessary sustenance of l if e ; and, on the other hand, if a pensioner goes into a State institution and is cured, I consider that there is an obligation on his part to pay portion of his pension to that in stitution. A stipulation in accordance with a proposal made by the righ t honourable member for Swan when he was Treasurer, to the effect that a certain portion of his pension should be paid to the institution in which a pensioner is being treated would be quite fair. We are all agreed that the various State institutions are doing some of the best work it is possible for any public bodies to do. Some of the best service that can be given by - citizens is given to the direction and management of hospitals and other public institutions. The skill of our doctors, the devotion of our nurses, the equipment of the institutions for the performance of operations, and the general attention to patients, are the best that money can procure. Therefore, as the Commonwealth has undertaken the obligation of paying the old-age pension, and on that ground the payment of the pension should be continuous, when occasion arises for a pensioner to enter a State institution to be medically treated, the stipulation should be laid down that a portion of his of the pension should be paid to the hospital authorities. That is a logical position that should receive sympathetic consideration from the Treasurer. I am sorry that the right honourable gentleman is not in the chamber during this debate upon' the Treasury Estimates, because I would like to offer a few observations on some of his statements about the drought which has afflicted the Commonwealth during the last eighteen months. I have no desire to pose as a pessimist, or to circulate statements which may have a deleterious effect on the credit of Australia. I can quite understand the optimistic attitude taken up by the Treasurer and his desire to preserve the credit of the Commonwealth by every expression of optimism to which he has given utterance on more than one occasion; but I think the Commonwealth is sufficiently sound financially, and has sufficient recuperative powers, to stand on a statement of the position as it actually is. No good can accrue at any time from a mis-statement of our productive position. I do not say that in certain directions the drought with which we have bsen afflicted during the past twelve months caused such a tremendous loss of stock as did the drought of 1902. The fact is that in our grazing areas the drought is still in evidence. . We have not had sufficient rain to sustain the growth of feed which is necessary to the maintenance of the stock that has so far heen saved. The only reason why the present drought has not in flicted greater loss upon us in the matter of stock than did the drought of 1902 is that our pastoralists were in a better position to withstand it . That has been due entirely to the productive power of the Commonwealth, and to the splendid action on the part of our financial institutions, which enabled our graziers to maintain, as far as they possibly can, their flocks by the purchase of artificial fodder. It is difficult to secure accurate statistics as to the stock losses which have recently been suffered. But I gather from Mr Knibbs' Year-Book that, in 1S90, we had 97,000,000 sheep, that in 1900 the number had dropped te 70,000,000, and that in 1905 it had again risen to 74,000,000. Reference to the figures supplied upon page 291 of the publication I have mentioned w i ll show that during the year 1902 we suffered a loss of 18,000,000 sheep. I am very glad to say that, so far, we have not sustained quite such a severe loss during the present drought, and for the reason I have stated. But we are by no means "" out of the wood,"" although I hope that the drought has broken sufficiently to enable our pastoralists to maintain the flocks which they have so far saved. Our patriotic stockraisers realized that it was their duty if possible-eve n if it cost them their last shilling-to preserve their flocks as an asset to Australia.",44
324,Mr RODGERS,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Thei r own organizations helped wonderfully.,45
325,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"That is so. I believe that in Victoria, South Australia, and ""Western Australia the drought which we have experienced during the past twelve months was much more universal and severe than was the drought of 1902. From Mr Knibbs' publication I gather that in 1900-01 there were only 1,517,000 tons of hay in Australia, whereas in 1913 we started with more than double that quantity, namely, 3,217,000 tons. 3902 the highest price realized for chaff in the northern parts of Victoria was about £ 6 10s. per ton, whereas at the present time it is being sold for £ 1 2 and £ 1 3 per ton. It is obvious, therefore, that, although when the present drought started we had more than twice the amount of hay that was held in stock in 1902, our supplies must have been reduced to a lower level than has ever been touched before. The people who have suffered mostly as the result of the drought during the past eighteen months have been the graziers and agriculturists, and they have been met with an increase of the land tax to the extent of full y one-third of original rate. The price of fodder would not be as high as it is if , prior to journment of this Parliament, in December last, the Minister of Trade and Customs had suspended the fodder duties, just as he did the wheat duties. We should then have been in a position to import large quantities from New Zealand and South America. As a ""Protectionist, I am not an advocate of suspending Customs duties on commodities as soon as a shortage is experienced. But I venture to say that the duty upon wheat was suspended last December because of the pressure which was brought to bear in the great central cities of Australia. The Government are open to a very serious charge on account of their unsympathetic attitude towards the great agricultural and pastoral interests of Australia.  is losing sight of the fact that the Commonwealth offered to import direct for the States.",45

327,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Ha d the Government imported the fodder the pastoralists would have had to pay the duty.,45
328,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The Government in formed the States that if they would in timate what their requirements were likely to be, or the quantity which they were prepared to handle, the Commonwealth would import that quantity for them. But had the duties upon fodder been suspended at the time the duty upon In wheat was remitted, the States would have been able to make large importations from New Zealand and elsewhere.",45
329,Mr BURCHELL,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Do you advocate a revision of the duty?,45
330,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"This is an extreme situation, and when the Government took the extreme step of removing the duty on wheat, it was equally necessary to take the same step in regard to fodder.  enterprise importing wheat because of the duty being taken off?",45
331,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wheat was not available for importation, except from a distant country; but I know that, if nethe cessary, 100.000 tons of fodder could have been imported from New Zealand. I the admade inquiries from the Trade Commissioner for New Zealand, and I ascertninpd that fodder could have been imported from New Zealand at just about the same price as that at which it was selling here at that time, namely, £ 5 10s. per to n ; but it could not have been imported sold at that price if the duty was paid. Here is another view of the matter: The Commonwealth asked all the States to agree, and to communicate tneir requirecause ments to the Minister of Trade and Cussury Department. toms, who would then import fodder in their behalf. But we know that it is almost impossible to get the States into line on any question, especially when l is one of pressing importance. There are six States, and sometimes it takes to get them to come to an agreement on one question. For fifteen years we have been trying to get them into line in rethe gard to the State debts.  ing for greater powers for the Commonremarks wealth.",45
332,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"When the time arrives, I shall be prepared to ask people to give greater powers in certain directions to the Commonwealth. the duty on fodder been removed at that particular time, it would at least have been possible for any one State to have undertaken the importation of fodder country: from other countries.",46
333,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,How much would that have saved the country?,46
334,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"On e pound per ton. If 50,000 or 100,000 tons of fodder had been imported from New Zealand at that time, we could have obtained our chaff £ 3 or £ 4 per ton less than we are paying for it now, and it would have had the effect of keeping down the price throughout the Commonwealth. As was the case with wheat, a large proportion of the chaff was held by large capitalists, and we may be sure that the price was systematically regulated in accordance with the supply in hand.",46
335,Mr FENTON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Was freight available?,46
336,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,It would have been available through the Union Company.  chaff now?,46
337,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"In my district, the price is from £ 1 2 to £ 1 3 per ton. To show that the Minister of Trade and Customs realized that the policy he had failed to adopt in December was the policy he should have adopted, we have his statement at the eleventh hour that he would allow anybody to import into the Commonwealth, and there would be a refund of the duty paid as soon as Parliament met and gave the necessary authority.",46
338,The CHAIRMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Order ! I have and allowed the honourable gentleman considerable latitude, as I did not desire to curtail the debate; but I ask him not to elaborate that matter any further, bei t is in no way related to the Trea",46
339,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I regarded this matter as one affecting the administration of the Government, and I understand that t the Treasury Department is the one which will have to refund the duty in connection years with the importation of chaff.",46
340,The CHAIRMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The honourable member will not be in order in pursuing subject. He is now dealing distinctly with a matter that relates to the Customs askDepartment, and I ask him to defer his u n t i l the Estimates for that Department are reached.",46
341,Mr SAMPSON,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"In order to comthe plete my remarks, may I be allowed to read this letter from the Minister of Had Trade and Customs, in reply to certain representations fro m the agricultural districts, from cab-drivers, and others using horse-feed extensively throughout the W it h reference to the question of refunding duties on certain classes of fodder, I beg to inform you that since it was arramed for the refund of duty paid on importations of bran, pollard, and oaten straw by State Governments, it has been decided to treat importations of such fodders by private individuals in the same way. That letter was written on the 5th March of this year. Had there been sympathetic administration or a desire to deal sympathetically with the pastoral and agricultural interests of Australia, the decisions contained in that letter would have been arrived at in December when the Government decided to suspend the duty on wheat. I have no desire to go into the question of the losses of horses and cattle on account of the drought, but should there he a breaking up of the drought I do not despair of the recuperative power of Australia enabling us to regain the position we have always occupied as the chief sheep and cattle breeders of the world. I have made these remarks in order to show that, in my opinion, when we were faced with a visitation such as the drought, it was the duty of the Prime Minister to place before the people the facts of the case, and not make a misstatement which would assuredly look worse, when the financial interests of the Commonwealth cabled to the financial interests at Home and laid before them the position that actually existed.",46
342,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Eden Monaro) [9.54] - I think the Committee is entitled to a statement from the Treasurer in answer to questions which have been raised to-night. A statement was made by the honourable member for Wentworth that on £18,000,000 which had been borrowed from London, exchange was paid to bolster up the Commonwealth Bank, instead of paying the money in London, as asked by the States. If that statement is correct, the transaction is outrageous, and we ought to have an explanation from the Government. Then the honourable member for Oxley informed the Committee that unless the Government take a certain course of action regarding an increase in the pensions, members on the Ministerial side will take steps to force the hands of the Government.",47
343,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Are you not going to assist us?,47
344,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I do not desire the assistance of the honourable member, who, to-night, with his tongue in his cheek, accused honourable members on this side of insincerity. He should be one of the last members in the House to speak in that manner, for if there is insincerity on the subject of pensions, it is not on this side. It is all very well for the honourable member to make these statements, but he should have shown us his earnestness in the matter. Let the Government say that they will adopt a common-sense attitude by taking up the Bill brought forward by the right honourable member for Swan last session. Country hospitals are being defrauded nf what is their due right, simply on account of the inaction of the Government. The honourable member for Oxley has been talking about a tax on bachelors; but why did not he say something about some of the bachelors who are loafing at the city street corners? Why does not the Government send these men to the front? I know this is not the time to raise a controversy, and, instead of talking about taxing bachelors, it is up to Treasurer to give some answer to the statement made this evening.",47
345,Mr SHARPE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Are we to consult honourable member as to what we do ?,47
346,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"If the honourable member for Oxley charges me with insincerity, he will get some small change. We would be cowards in this House if we did not say what we think. If the honourable member for Oxley talks about quarrelling, he will be sorry that he came into the fight.",47
347,The CHAIRMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Order , order!",47
348,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Surely the Minister sitting at the table has told the Prime Minister what was said in this House about bolstering up the Commonwealth Bank by exchange on money sent from London, and surely he is going to answer the statement at once. I am one of those who believe in the Commonwealth Bank. It is a very big institution. It should be the greatest institution of this country, and I refuse to allow gentlemen on that side of the House to insinuate, or make out, that we are opposed to the Commonwealth Bank simply because we exercise our right of criticism. I ask the Treasurer what he has to say with regard to suggestions for a directorate. I have nothing to say against Mr Denison Miller, hut he has powers that should be shared by men from the different States. What has the Treasurer to say to that? There appears to be an impression that because we criticise the Bank we are opposed to it. The statement made to-night will be viewed with a great deal of alarm in this country, and I again ask the Treasurer if he intends to say anything about it . Is the Treasurer prepared to give an answer to the charge by the honourable member for Wentworth?",47
349,Mr EISHEE,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,What is the charge 1,47
350,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,That exchange was paid on a large sum of money for the purpose of bolstering up the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank. Surely the other Ministers sitting at the table heard that.,47
351,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,They did not hear it that way.,47
352,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Well , the statement was made, and I repeat it the was a very serious charge. I hope it is not true. If it is true, it is a public scandal, and a very serious reflection on the Treasurer. I would be loth indeed to the believe that the Treasurer would be guilty of such a grave indiscretion. Why should criticism in this Houso be treated as a burlesque? Surely there is not a desire to treat u serious discussion in this way, and turn Parliament into a circus. The Leader of the Opposition said to the Minister today that we did not want to start fighting here, but that we would help the Government all we could. That is a proper spirit. 1 do not want to fight, and I ask honourable members not to charge us with insincerity. I again ask the Treasurer to make.a statement to the House with regard to the charge, for I would be very much surprised if it were true.",47
353,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.01 - The honourable member for Eden-Monaro need not get excited about the matter. If the honourable member for Wentworth made a statement of the character attributed to him by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro since I came into the House, then the honourable member for Wentworth does not know what he is talking about. That is the best way of putting it .",48
354,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I pleased to hear that.,48
355,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,I understand that the statement was not made in the way in which the honourable member has put it . It related to the exchange regarding the State loans.,48
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,That is what said.,48
357,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"But this has nothing: to do with the Commonwealth Bank, for the Commonwealth Bank does not get the exchange at all. I have seen to that. They get the ordinary hanking commission that they would get by dealing with money of that kind, and the Commonwealth is entitled to the balance on exchange when it is for us, as we would be called upon to pay when it is against us. At the present time the exchange is in ' favour of Australia. Mr AUSTIN. CHAPMAN - The: ment was that you were asked to pay. money in London and declined to pay it unless the Commonwealth Bank got the benefit of the exchange.",48
358,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The statement might have been made like that; but if it was it was not correct. The agreement was that it was to be paid in London and in Australia.,48
359,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,And the memorandum of the Imperial Government said the same thing practically.,48
360,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"The arrangement was that the States- I am speaking now of the agreement-were to get in London, even when the exchange was in their favour, what money they required for material for public works. (But' the statement that this is done for the benefit of the Bank is just one of those insidious statements that are always being made, the suggestion heing that the Bank is getting the exchange in order to bolster itself up. Le t honourable members be bigger than that. This is our own institution, and if we were to do all that is said, in order to help the Bank, it would be done with Commonwealth money.",48
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,What is the Commonwealth Bank doing in the matter? Is it getting anything out of the business?,48
362,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,The Bank is getting nothing but what it would get as a trading institution in the way of business.,48
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Then it is getting something ? am very Mr FISHER - It is only getting the same amount that any other Bank would get.,48
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,Then- it is getting something 1,48
365,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"What nonsense! Does the honourable member say that when he he buys a pound of cheese at a shop, bhat shop gets an advantage ? If that is the paltry position to be taken up, it is not worth meeting.",48
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Parramatta) [10.7] - The Prime Minister has told us a lot of things, and simulated much indignation. A f t e r telling the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to be quiet, he finished up with his usual tactics, and sat down without telling us anything. Why does not the Tight honourable gentleman tell us precisely the part the Commonwealth Bank has played in connection with this £18,000,000 loan? What is the state- Bank doing, and what is it receiving for it? Is it doing anything in the way of acting as agent?",48
367,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Yes . certainly. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The right honourable gentleman never told us so. If the Bank IB doing anything, presumably, like every other Bank, it is paid for what it does.",48
368,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Yes . Mr JOSE PH COOK - I did not hear the statement of the honourable member for Wentworth, but the matter can easily be brought to issue. According to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. the statement of the honourable member for Wentworth was that the Government, in stead of making this money available as requested by the States for their purposes in London) insisted on the business being brought here, to the detriment of the States. Either that is a fact or it is not. Either the States could have saved some money had the business been arranged in Loudon, or they could not. The Prime Minister could settle the matter in two minutes without becoming indignant.",48
369,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) flO.9] - The exchange in favour of Australia at the present time is 25s. or 30s., and naturally the States wished to have all the money in London; but the place in which to finance the matter is in Australia. I admire the w it and wisdom of the States; and, doubtless, if the exchanges were against them, they would wish the business to be done in Australia. A sensible, straightforward, business like arrangement was made with the States, and the money they required for material for their public works purposes could be got in London. Sir JOHN FORREST/Swan) [10.10]. - I wish to refer very briefly to the matter of old-age pensions. The late Government, in the session before last, introduced a measure to give further consideration to the pensioners, and to place them on such a footing that they would be relieved from the stigma of pauperism when they had to enter hospitals and benevolent asylums.",49
