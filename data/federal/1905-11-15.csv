Since we met this afternoon, after an adjournment of an hour and a half, we have been given notice of the intention to move a new standing order to prevent the moving of motions such as that which I am now discussing, which gives me encouragement to more thoroughly debate this question, in order to place before the public the true popjtion of affairs.",13

25,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," I think this is a convenient stage at which to raise a general debate upon the very important departure made by this Bill ordinary trade mark legislation of the Empire. The union label is American in its origin, and was first proposed, before the Alien Immigration Rethat striction Act came into operation there, a means of inducing the public to buy goods made by white labour. It was subsequently VII . diverted from that object to build up and strengthen trade unions at the expense the other sections of the community, and as far as possible to force employers manufacturers to comply with the demands of trade unions, irrespective of whether those demands were legitimate or otherral wise. A most exhaustive inquiry has been made into the whole question. The ment of Labour of the United States, sided over by Mr Carroll D. Wright, one of the bi-monthly bulletins published a few years ago, gave a most exhaustive statement of the reasons urged in favour of and in opposition to the union label. He also reproduced samples of the label.",14
26,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I wish to know, sir, whether the honourable member is in order in discussing the general question on the amendment before the Committee?

35,Mr GLYNN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," I think that the of Attorney-General should have moved at the outset the postponement of this clause, and because the Bill has been recast since it came from the Senate, and even the amendments foreshadowed by the Attorney-Genehave been reframed. That being so, this clause, in the ordinary course of events, Departshould be postponed until we see what prewill be the terminology of Part VII . The in Attorney-General has for a third time recast the proposals of the Government, and in the circumstances we do not know what will be the effect of passing this clause. The 5*7° honourable and learned gentleman was apparently looking for some suggestion from the Opposition.",14
36,Mr WATKINS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,He suggested at the outset that the clause should be postponed,15
37,Mr GLYNN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable and learned gentleman merely said that he was willing to postpone the clause. That is not leadership. When amendments necessitate the postponement of a clause the Minister in charge of the Bill should ask for that postponement. I am prepared to discuss this clause or the general provisions of the Bill,15
38,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G, I should be prepared to agree to a postponement of the clause if an undertaking - were given that the gagging standing order which has been foreshadowed will not be adopted until the union label provisions of the Bill have been thoroughly debated. I distinctly object to the postponement of this clause until a standing order to stifle debate has been passed.,15

40,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," I intend the Committee to discuss the question of trade marks now, and, as far as I can, to prevent debate upon it being stifled.",15
41,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I shall reserve what I have to say in that connection until we are discussing particular clauses of the Bill.,15
42,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The purposes for which trade union labels have been used differ very considerably from those for which they were first introduced. I hold in my hand a copy of a report issued by the Washington Department of Labour. It seems to me a very fair report, inasmuch as it presents the arguments for both sides with great amplitude.",15
43,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Fro m what publication is the honourable and learned member about to quote?,15
44,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Fro m the Bulletin of the Department of Labour for March, 1898. '",15
45,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Who is. the author of the article which it contains?,15
46,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Mr John Graham Brooks.,15
47,Mr SKENE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,He is a good Socialist.,15
48,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I believe that he is a Socialist. The following is the inscription on the union label issued by the rity of the Cigar Makers' International Union of America in September, 1880: This certifies that the cigars contained in this box have been made By"" a first-class workman, a - member of the Cigar - Makers' International Union of America, an organization devoted to the advancement of the moral, 'material, and intellectual welfare of the c r a f t; therefore we recommend these cigars to all smokers throughout the world. All infringements upon this label will be punished according to law. President, Cigar Makers' International Union of America. Then the forms of other labels which differ in some respects from the particular sample I have quoted are given. As showing the extent to which these labels, are used, Mr Brooks points out that since 1891 they have been taken up by printers, bakers, woodworkers, iron moulders, broommakers, coopers, photographers, shoemakers, custom tailors-that is, tailors who make to order - mattrass-makers, hore.eshoers, brewers, egg inspectors, and barbers. He says:Labels are found even upon coal carts, indicating that union men only are employed in distributing coal. I It is interesting to note the conditions upon which employers are permitted to use these labels. We know very well that if a Government could be found which was more p'liant and treacherous to its (professed principles than is the present Government, it might conceivably go to the full length desired by the labour unions in this particular regard. Each individual cigar manufacturer in America has a contract with the trade unions. Some of the conditions of that contract are decidedly interesting. One of them is that no union shall be allowed to furnish a label for cigars made in whole ' or in part by machinery. There we have a revival of the ancient, ignorant prejudice against machinery. It is a sine qua non that in this particular industry machinery shall not be used. Again we find thatManufacturers operating more than one shop shall not be allowed the use of the union label unless all shops operated by such manufacturers are strictly union shops. We also find thatNo brands of cigars made in both union and non-union shops shall be allowed to bear the union label. The United Hatters of America also have a similar contract regarding the use of their label.",15
49,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Fro m what page is the authohonorable and learned member quoting?,15
50,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Fro m page 200 .and succeeding pages. I find thatAny manufacturer using bats any part of was made in a foul shop shall not be entitled the use of the label. I believe that the word "" f o u l "" in that connection means a non-union shop.",16
51,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Oh , no.",16
52,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Surely the AttorneyAct General does not contend that non-union shops can use the label ? The article tinuesLabels shall not be furnished to any buying seconds, knockdowns, or hats to be finished outside the factory where they are made, unless a voucher is presented to the label secretary filled out and signed by the steward of either the finishing or making departments. There are various other provisons which are designed to prevent an employer from using a union label without the consent of the union concerned. The garment-makers have similar rules. For exampleThe label can only be used on garments made for strictly union firms. These facts show that the emp^'ers cannot use the labels without binding; themselves to certain conditions which the unionists desire. At a later stage I shall emphasize some of the other conditions inserted in these agreements. The reasons alleged for the use of the union label are that it will insure better pay and improved conditions to the workers. In this connection, Mr. Brooks writesUpon its theoretic side the label stands, primarily, for "" better pay and for improved conditions of^ labour."" When these clauses were inserted in the Bill at the instance 'of Senator Pearce, he claimed, in much the same way, that the label was intended as an Instrument to secure better pay and improved conditions to the working classes. But it is not a fact that the label, of necessity, stands for better pay and improved conditions. It may do so in one or two cases in America, but it does not do so in all cases. ' Even if it did, there is no justification for extending its use to Australia. In Victoria, we have about forty wages boards, whose decisions apply to unionists and non-unionists alike. They are all treated""'in the same way.",16
53,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,In certain places.,16
54,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member knows that the number of men who are employed outside those places is a mere bagatelle. In New South Wales, every industry is liable to be brought under the eperation of the Arbitration Act. In South Australia, there is a Labour Government in power, and in Queensland a semi-Labour which Ministry hold office. Therefore, the arguto ment in favour of the wage-elevating tendency of these labels cannot be urged in Australia, because Here conditions are insisted upon which apply alike to unionists and non-unionists. Last year, we passed an which was intended to regulate wages and generally to improve the conditions of conlabour, to employ the language of Mr. Brooks. It is sometimes claimed that the person label stands for good work. In this conin the rough nexion, Mr Brooks writes: The aim is moreover to make the label in this instance stand for excellence of workmanship, restoring something of the ideal of the craft guilds in their better days. That this has not been done more generally with the label is clearly a weakness, especially if appeal is to be made to a larger purchasing public. . . A sort of minimum quality is, however, set, as will be seen in the following extract from their constitution. which states that a label shall not be applied to cigars sold for less than $20 a thousand, or about i d . each. Mr Brooks goes on to say: In the case or the hatters, it is even more difficult to trace any relation whatever between .the label and quality or improved conditions. Many shops conspicuous for the high character of their product, wages, and entire circumstances under which the labourer works, have never used the label, nor is there any likelihood of their so doing. Therefore, the use of the union label is no guarantee of excellence, of quality, or of good workmanship. It is merely a guarantee that the manufacturer has obtained the sanction of a trade union. In Australia, tKe guarantee, as regards pay and labour conditions, is conferred under various Acts passed.by this Parliament, or by the States Legislatures. Mr Brooks then proceeds to discuss the real reason for the use of these labels. Upon page 205, he says :Its practical and immediate purpose is, of course, to strengthen the union. The labelis the chosen symbol of work done under union con. ditions. Again, on page 207, he writes: Nowhere better than among the ""hatters can the matter of fact side of the label be seen. It is like the strike or the boycottI ask honourable members to notice that an instrument of warfare. The published literature of the Hatters' Union is filled with evidence on this point. No printed matter upon this subject is so wholly frank as to the primary objects to be sought through the label. It is, of course, assumed that the mere fact of labour organization implies of itself higher wages and better surroundings; otherwise there is singularly little pretence that quality of work, for example, or sanitation, enters into their calculation. It is an instrument of warfare, like the strike or the boycott. In Victoria, since 1890, we are supposed, under the beneficent influences of the Labour Party, to have abolished strikes under our Factories Act, with its attendant Wages Boards system.",16
55,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The Factories Act does not prevent strikes.,17
56,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It has done more in that direction than has the Arbitration Act in New South Wales. Another object aimed at by the use of union labels is pointed out by Mr Brooks, upon pages 209 and 212. He says:If the pressure of competition is too great there is naturally no thought of any end except to induce the employer to maintain a strictly union shop, and thus insure the payment of members' dues. This awakes an echo of the Arbitration! Act, during the discussion upon which measure so much stress was laid upon the necessity of unionists paying their dues. Further, Mr Brooks saysThis contract gives the officials of the union much help in doing their own work, as it becomes the interest of the manufacturer to see to it that his workmen fulfil the conditions (paying dues, &c.) which the unions set. This is indeed the real influence which the advocates of the label seek to advance. When we recollect that some of the unions have been and are political associations, and that a bitter resistance was offered to the attempt made-to divest the unions of their political character, we shall recognise the advantage of a provision which enable?, the union officials to enforce the payment of contributions to the party warchest. The label lis used not only as an instrument of warfare, such as the strike or boycott, but also as a means by which the party funds can be kept up. It is also availed of with the object of increasing the membership of the unions and of ousting from employment men who decline to become unionists. The union label system of boycott is used directly and indirectly. In the first place, agitation is set up by which it is sought to secure the sole use of goods tearing the union' label, and men are urged to boycott articles which are not made by unionists. Another method employed is to insure that the label shall be used only by those manufacturers who have entered into contracts with the unions. Such contracts invariably contain a clause providing that every man employed in the factory shall be a unionist, of that the manufacturer shall dismiss any man who is not a unionist at the. request of the union officials. I would direct attention to a case which was tried before the Supreme Court Bench of Massachusetts, which the Attorney-General will agree with me is a high tribunal.",17
57,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Fro m what publication is the honourable and learned member proposing to quote ?,17
58,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Fro m the CorporaHons Auxiliary Company Bulletin. The case to which I refer was that of Michael T. Berry v. Jerry E. Donovan, which is briefly stated as follows: On January 24th, 1902, and during the three years and eleven months next preceding that date, the plaintiff was a shoemaker employed by the firm of Hazen B. Goodrich and Co., at Haverhill, Mass., under a contract terminable at will . The defendant was the representative of a national organization of shoe workers called the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union. A contract between Hazen B. Goodrich and Co. and said Union was executed on the tenth day of January, 1902- a copy of which contract is on pages 20 and 21 of the bill of exceptions. This contract provided, among other things, that the firm of Hazen B. Goodrich and Co. ""agrees to hire as shoe workers only members of the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union, in good standing, and further agrees not to retain any shoe worker in his (their) employment after receiving notice from the Union that such shoe worker is objectionable to the Union, either on account of his being in arrears for dues, or disobedience of the Union Bules or Laws, or from any other cause."" That provision is wide enough to cover an objection on the part of the union officials to the colour of a man's hair.",17
59,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Can the honourable and learned member connect this case with the trade union labels ?,17
60,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Yes . I am prepared to show that it is absolutely connected, because it relates to a contract affecting the use of the union label which was entered linto between the firm of boot manufacturers referred to and the secretarv of the Bootworkers' Union. The clause to which I have referred contains one of the an conditions with which the manufacturer had to comply in return for the right to use the union iabel. The consideration! he was required to give for the"" right to use the label was an undertaking to dispense with any man that Mr Donovan did not like. The report proceeds""-Between the time of the execution of said contract between Hazen B. Goodrich and Co. and the union, _and the hereinafter mentioned discharge of the plaintiff from his employment by said firm, the defendant called on Hazen B. Goodrich and Co. on several occasions, and demanded that they discharge the plaintiff from their employment because he would not join the union. Mr Berry, the working bootmaker, who had to earn his living by the sweat of his brow, declined, for reasons best known to himself, to 'become a member of the Bootworkers' Union. It is further statedThe plaintiff's employers were satisfied the plaintiff as a workman and as a man, and, notwithstanding the terms of the contract which they had entered into with the union, would have retained him in their employment but for the aforesaid demand of the defendant. Both the plaintiff and'his employers were able and desirous of continuing the relation of employer and employ^ that existed between them, but because of the defendant's demands, the said firm, on the twenty-fourth day of January, 1902, discharged the plaintiff from his employment by them. It is further stated that at the time of his discharge Mr Berry's actual earnings amounted to $17, or about £ 3 ios. a week. That fact in itself is sufficient to show that he was not being sweated, and that he was giving satisfaction to his employers. But the terms of the contract with the bootmakers' union were of such a character that the manufacturer could not use the union label unless he discharged any man who was not a member of the union, or whom the secretary or officials of the union did not like. That is to say, the union had every control over the employees in the factory, and could wreak their vengeance upon any workman who might incur their resentment. That is one method by which the use of the union label has been sought to be extended in the United States.",17
61,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,What happened to the man?,18
62,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"He secured a verdict against the union, and has' been endeavourCourt ing ever since to collect the money.",18
63,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Where is that stated?,18
64,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That is my statenot. ment. I have particulars of a similar case in Hartford, Connecticut. this is not a reported case, but I have had forwarded to me a copy of the writ issued at the Circuit Court of Hartford, under authority of the Chief Justice States of America. This was a case in which Martin Lawlor and other members the Bootmakers' Union were comply with the judgment which was entered against them in an action arising of a boycott, conducted by means of the union label, against Dietrich E . Loewe and Martin Fuchs. A. verdict was given against the union as a whole, and against the members of the union, for a very large sum of money; and the plaintiffs have been endeavouring ever since to recover it .",18
65,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Will the honourable and learned member give the source of that information ?,18
66,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I shall give the honwith orable and learned gentleman a copy of the writ to which I have referred, and if he challenges its genuineness, or thinks that I am making a false statement, I can only say that I shaM be prepared to make a donation °f £ 5 to any charity in his electorate upon his proving that my information is not correct.",18
67,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I suppose that I am to go to America in order to find out whether or not the writ is authentic?,18
68,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The Attorney-General can easily ascertain whether the copy I am reading is genuine or not. I have seen a printed copy of the writ.

The persons united in said combination, known as the American Federation of Labour, including the persons in said sub-combination known as the United Hatters of North America, constintly employ more than one thousand agents in the States and Territories of the United States, to push, enforce, and carry into effect all boycotts declared by the said members, including those in aid of the combined scheme, purpose and effort hereinafter stated, to force all the manufacturers of f u r hats in the United States, including the plaintiffs, to unionize their factories, by restraining and destroying theirinterState trade and commerce, as hereinafter stated, all of which said agents act under the immediate supervision and personal direction of one Samuel Compers, who is chief agent of the said combination of persons for said purpose, and of each of the said sub-combinations and the said agents make monthly reports of their doings, in pushing and enforcing and causing to be pushed and enforced said boycotts, and publish the same monthly in said paper known as the American Federationist, of which he is the editor, appointed by the said members, which said paper in connection with said statement or summary, is declared to be the authorized and official mouthpiece of each of said sub-combinations, including the said United Hatters of"" North America. Said statement is declared by the defendants to be a faithfu l record of the doings of said agents, and each of said statements, made during the period covered by the acts of the defendants against the plaintiffs herein stated, contains the announcement to the members of said combination and the public, that all boycotts declared by them are being by them and their agents pushed, enforced and observed. 15. Said combination of persons, collectively known as The American Federation of Labour, of which the defendants are members, was by the defendants and their other members, formed for the purpose, among others, of facilitating the declaration and successful maintenance of boycotts, by and for saTd combination of persons known as the United Halters of North America, acting, through the said Federation of Labour and its other component parts or members, and it and its component parts have frequently declared boycotts, at the request of the defendants, against the business and product of various hat manufacturers, and have vigorously prosecuted the same by and through the powerful machinery at their command as aforesaid, in carrying out their general scheme herein stated, to the great damage and loss of business of said manufacturers, and particularly during the years 1901 and 1902, they declared, prosecuted, and waged, at the request of the defendants and their agents, a boycott against the hats made by and the business of H . H . Roelofs and Co., of Philadelphia, Pa., until by causing them great damage and loss of business, they coerced them into yielding to the demand of the defendants and their agents, that the said factory of said Roelofs and Co. be unionized, as termed by the defendants, and into agreeing to employ, and employing exclusively, members of their said combination in the making and finishing departments of said factory, and in large measure, surrendering to the defendants and their agents, the control of said factory and business, all of which was well known to the plaintiffs, their customers, wholesale dealers, and the public, and was, by the defendants, and their agents, widely proclaimed through all their agencies above mentioned, in connection with their acts against the plaintiffs, as hereinafter . set forth, for the purpose of intimidating and coercing said wholesale dealers and^ their customers, from buying the hats of the plaintiffs, by creating 'in their minds the fear that the defendants, would invoke and put into operation against them,, all said powerful"" means, measures, and machinery, if they should handle the hats of the plaintiffs.",19
79,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Thes e are merely ' assertions made by the plaintiffs.,20
80,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The Attorney-General overlooks my statement that a verdict was given for the plaintiffs.,20
81,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Where is the proof of that? The honourable and learned member appears unable to give the source of his information.,20
82,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The Attorney-General can verify or disprove my statements without expense to himself. The writ con1 tinues16. The defendants, together with the other persons united with them in said combination known as the United Hatters of North America, have been for many years, and now are, engaged in a combined scheme and effort to force all manufacturers of fur hats in the United States, including the plaintiffs, against their will and their previous policy of carrying on their business, to organize their workmen in the departments of making and finishing, in each of their factories, into an organization, to be part and parcel of the said combination known as the United Hatters of North America, or as the defendants and their confederates term it, 'to unionize their shops with the intent thereby lo control the employment of labour in and the operation of said factories, and to subject the same to the direction and control of persons other than the owners of the same, in a manner extremely onerous and distasteful to such owners, and to carry out such scheme, effort, and purpose, by restraining and destroying the inter-State trade and commerce of such manufacturers, by means of intimidation of and threats made to such manufacturers and their customers in the several States, of boycotting them, their product, and their customers, using there for all the powerful means at their command as aforesaid, until such time as from the damage and loss of business resulting therefrom, the said manufacturers should yield to the said demand to unionize their factories 18. To carry, out said scheme and purpose, the defendants have appointed, and employed, and do steadily employ, certain special agents to act in their behalf, with full and express authority from them, and the other members of said combination, and under explicit instructions from them, to use every means in their power, to compel all such manufacturers of hats to so unionize their factories, and each and all of the defendants in this suit, did the several acts hereinafter stated, either by themselves or their agents, by them thereto full y authorized. 19. On or about March ist, 1901, in pursuance of said general scheme and purpose, the defendants and the other members of said combination, The United Hatters of North America, through their agents, the said John A. Loffitt, Martin Lawler, John P. Maher, and Charles J. Barrett, who acted for themselves and the other defendants, demanded of the plaintiffs that they should unionize tlieir said factory, in the making and finishing departments, and also thereby acquire the right to use and use, the said union label, subject to the right of the defendants to recall ihe same at pleasure, in all hats made by ' them, and then notified the plaintiffs that if they failed to yield to said demand, the defendants and all the other members of the said combination known as the United Halters of North America, would resort to their said usual and well-known methods to compel them so to do. After several conferences, and in April, igoi, the plaintiffs replied to the said demand of the defendants as follows :"" Firmly believing that we are acting for the best interests of our firm, for the best interests of those whom we employ, and for the best interests of Danbury, by operating an independent or open factory, we hereby notify you that we decline to have our shop unionized, and, if attacked, shall use all lawful meafis lo protect our business interests."" The plaintiffs were then employing many union and non-union men, and their said factory was running smoothly and satisfactorily both to the plaintiffs and their employees. The defendants, their confederates and agents, deferred the execution of their said threat against the plaintiffs until the conclusion of their attack made in pursuance of the same general scheme and purpose against H . H . Roelofs and Co. which resulted in the surrender of Roelofs and Co., on July 15th, 1902, except that the defendants, their confederates and agents in November, 1901, caused the said American Federation of Labour to declare a boycott against any dealer or dealers who should handle the product of the plaintiffs. If will thus be seen that it is a boycott against not only a manufacturer, but any retailer who handles goods that are not made by union labour. . Mr KING OMALLEY - I am prepared to nccepF the challenge thrown out by the honourable and learned member as to the issue of the writ to which he has referred.",20
83,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member must imagine that this is a circus.,21
84,Mr KING OMALLEY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I think that the alleged writ is a fake.,21
85,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The statement goes on to show that the union declared a boycott against Messrs. Loewe and Company, and sought to intimidate dealers in. and purchasers of hats by raising a prejudice against all poods made by that have here a long, extract from a circular issued by the San Francisco Labour Council, which is a fair indication of the wav in which, not merely the manufacturer bat the innocent retailer who handles any non-union goods, is boycotted. The circular is as follows : - San Francisco, 3rd July, 1933. To whom it may concernAt a special meeting of the San Francisco Labour Council held on the above date, the hat jobbing concern known as Triest and Co., 116 Sansome-street, San Francisco, was declared unfair for persistently patronizing the unfair hat manufacturing concern of D. E. Loewe and Co., Danbury, Connecticut, where the union halters have been on strike, for union conditions, since 20th August, 1902.",21
86,Mr CROUCH,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That was a strike; it had nothing, to do with the question of the union label. Mn ROBINSON - At the outset a threat was made to boycott the firm, ancl when they declared that they would conduct their businesss as they thought fit. that threat was carried into effect, and the unionists were asked to go out on' strike. The circular continuesTriest and Co. will be retained on the unfair list as long as they handle the product of this unfair hat manufacturing concern. Union men do not usually patronize retail stores who buy from unfair jobbing houses or manufacturers. Under these circumstances, all friends of organized labour, and those desiring the patronage of organized workers, will not buy goods from Triest and Co., 116 Sansome-street, San Francisco. I have here another precious document issued by the same bodySan Francisco, 14th'July, 1903. Gentlemen,-We beg leave to call your attention to the following products whicE are on the unfair list of the American Federation of Labour. We do this in order that you refrain from handling these goods, as the patronage of the firms named below is taken by the organized workers as an evidence of a desire to patronize those who are opposed to the interests of organized labour. The declaration of unfairness regarding the firms mentioned is full y sanctioned, and will be supported to the fullest degree by the San Francisco Labour Council. It will thus be seen that in the first place the San Francisco Labour Council issued a circular pointing out that different firms, had acted unfairly, and should not be patronised. They' 'then published a list, setting out that the persons named therein did not work under the union labour conditions, and that, if retailers wished to secure the patronage of union men, they firm. I should sell only goods produced by union labour. The plaintiffs issued a writ, furnished security to the extent of $150, and secured a verdict, and proceedings have been going' on since to collect the amount of the judgment. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why cannot they collect the amount of the judgment?",21
87,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If the honourable member imagines that the unionists of America are as well off as he is, he is labouring under a misapprehension.",22
88,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,But some of the unions have a little money.,22
89,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have shown the means adopted by trade unionists in America to enforce union labour conditions. It is distinctly stipulated that an employer must dismiss a man who is a non-unionist, or is otherwise objectionable to a union. That is the direct method adopted. Then there is the indirect method of urging all sympathizers and members of unions to buy only goods bearing union labels, and of issuing a black list of firms who handle goods that are not made by unionists. If , for instance, a, well-known honourable member who carries on business not many hundred yards from this House, offered for sale any goods that were made by non-unionists, an attempt would be made by means of the union label to boycott him. Mr John Graham Brooks, the author of the excellent article to which I have referred, has absolutely proved his statement.",22
90,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,He states that the union label has been recognised in twenty-eight States.,22
91,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"We shall see about that. I take the following from page 213 of the Bulletin of the Department of Labour, to which I have already referred:The growth of the union label is steady and sure. It is the backbone of some of our unions, and a great aid to"" them all. Label leagues are being instituted in many places, both on local ancl State lines, and are doing good work. There are many more industries which can adopt union labels, and which, no doubt, will in the course of lime. From reports made to headquarters during the year from the various unions, continued and increasing interest is being taken in their welfare. That all unions should boom the union label of each other is important, for to build up and strengthen any one union strengthens all others. While we may be working at different callings, our interests tire intertwined. Upon the growth and activity of unionism generally in any city depends the stability and power of the particular union in which any one of use'may hold a card. Hence the importance of furthering union labels of sister onions. By helping them we help ourselves, and all help each other. r The following resolutions were also adopted at this convention :Whereas the National Union of the United Brewery Workmen has adopted a union label for use on all packages containing union-made beer, ale, and porter, and also a union showcard for display in all saloons, which sell union products exclusively; be it Resolved that this sixteenth annual convention of the American Federation of Labour endorse the said label and show-card, and urges all members of the American .Federation of Labour to demand Ih'e label and the show-card. Whereas we recognise in the union label the mainstay of trade unions, and that the best, most far-reaching, and most earnest way of educating and advocating the union labels is through the organization of active label leagues; therefore Resolved, that the American Federation of Labour recognise this form of organization, impress upon the minds of delegates in reporting to their constituents the necessity of organizing and maintaining label leagues, and that this body instruct the newly elected officers to grant charters to local, district, and State label leagues. It was declared by the convention that it was not only the duty of unionists to refrain from purchasing the products of non-union labour, but - to induce their wives and families to use onty union products. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thes e are the slanderers of the States.",22
92,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I .am referring to resolutions passed by the American Federation of Labour, which were designed to force unionists and their families to buy only union goods, and to deal with those who handle union goods alone. Mr Brooks shows, further, that in one year over $3,000 were spent by a branch of the Cigar-makers' Union in Bostonto push the union goods and to boycott those of non-union manufacture. The demand made for a union label for Australia cannot be due to a desire to improve wage conditions, because the industries to which the union label provisions of the Billf would apply in the first instance are under the control of Wages Boards or Conciliation and Arbitration Courts. The label is desired merely as a means to boycott, and to build up unions by forcing men into their ranks. It is sought as a means to drive out of employment those who will not join the unions-. The object of Part VII . is somewhat similar to that of the preference to unionists provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; but in some respects there is a difference. With the assistance of several members of the present Government, including the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Postmaster-General, and the Vice-President of the Executive CrJuncil, honourable members now in Opposition succeeded in surrounding the provision for preference to unionists with so many safeguards that the Labour Party declared that for all practical purposes it would be a dead letter. The proposal now before us is one to secure preference to unionists by a more insidious method. It is a proposal to legalize boycotting, to put it into everyday use as an ordinary means of industrialwarfare; to allow organized bodies to decry those who desire to manage their own business in a way that seems best to themselves. It is a proposal to enable the unions not only to boycott manufacturers and retailers, but to force men into their ranks whether they desire to join them or not. There are many trades in Australia which are subject to Wages Boards and Conciliation and Arbitration Courts, and it is therefore evident that the union label is to be used chiefly as an instrument of oppression. can give local illustrations showing that the chief object of the unions is to force men into organizations of a political or semi political character. Their primary object is not to better the labour conditions of Australia, but to strengthen their fighting political bodies. I propose to refer to the position of two trades out of forty that are subject to the Victorian Factories Act.",22
93,Mr CROUCH,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Is the honourable member aware that there was a charge of libel contained in' the writ to which he referred a few minutes ago, and in respect of which the judgment may have been given?",23
94,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I think that I shall be able to prove that my statement is absolutely correct. The butcherring trade has been under the provisions of the Factories Act in Victoria for seven or eight years past. All the men who are engaged in that trade in the city, suburbs, and the large centres of population, work the same number of hours, and receive the same rate of pay, so that, as far as that (industry is concerned, sweating is non-existent. Yet what do we find? I hold in my hand a mated reprint of certann statements which were authorities published in the Age ancl Argus during March of the present year. The article ditions to which I refer 6s headed "" The Butcherlaw, ing Trade,"" "" Listing Union Shops,"" "" Imin portant Action Proposed,"" and readsThe executive of the employers' union in the butchering industry has resolved upon an important step in order to secure for certain shops ignore the custom of those purchasers who sympathize with the aims and objects of trades unionism. The union is endeavouring to prepare a list of shops that are said to be absolutely faithfu l to trades union conditions,"" with the view to recommending unionists to make their purchases at these establishments, to the exclusion, of course, of other butchers who are not included on the roll. That is to say, to the disadvantage of men who pay the same wages and who comply with all the conditions laid down by the Wages Board, but who do not employ union labour exclusively. The circular issued by the Victorian Amalgamated Butchers' Unioni to various master butchers is as follows :ist February, 190,5. In response to numerous inquiries from individuals and organizations in your district as to what shops wherein fair conditions of labour are observed, or what are known as union shops, we have decided to publish lists for distribution throughout the whole of the district, recommending such Shops to the public for patronage, I as being shops wherein fair conditions of labour are observed, and where the persons cmployed are members of the Butchers' Union. We are desirous of placing your name on the list, according to above conditions, and await your reply on ,or before ist March, when it is intended to print the list for publication. C. H . ANDERSON, Secretary. If ever there was a deliberate attempt to boycott and intimidate employers, that was one. This union wrote to employers, all of whom were paying the wages fixed by the Wages Board, saying, in effect, ""We intend to publish a list of those who employ only unionists, and to recommend our people to deal solely with them. If you desire our custom, you must let us include your name on the list as employers of unionists only."" The inference is that, if they did not employ unionists Only, their names would not appear upon the list, and the influence of the unions would be used to boycott their goods. The secretary of the Master Butchers' Association wrote a very short letter to the press ita regard to this matter, in which he says The circular letter addressed by the AmalgaButchers' Union to various master butchers will explain the way in which the Trades Hall are tricking shopkeepers into establishing themselves as union shops. The conof labour in the trade are regulated by and no other authority is recognised. If any case unfair or illegal conditions are imposed there is ample remedy under the Shops and Factories Act. Further comment is unnecessary. 1 This association therefore urges the trade to the attempt as being thoroughly, unBritish, and opposed to the best interests of the general community. Yours truly, P. J. KENT, Secretary. Mr TUD'OR - Is not that, the man who has. dismissed every representative of workers on the Wages Board in his employ",23
95,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I do not know. Mr. Anderson made the following defence: Before sending out any lists, we thought the That fairest course lo pursue would be to notify would be, master butchers what was intended, so as any men who were employed an opportunity becoming members. If that is not am unmistakable hint, I do Not not know what is. A somewhat similar antee dodge was worked in connection with the quality of bakers' trade. The baking industry one of the first brought under the operation of the Factories Act in 1896. On the 5th May last, at the Trades Hall Council, Large, the bakers' representative, intiduced mated that a large number of copies of a tions. "" white liist,"" showing the bakers who adhered to union rates, had beeni printed, and Act affords that guarantee. he asked all unionists to deal only with those on the list. We can best judge the probable effect of the legislation posed by observing what has been its result ' in other countries. In the United States men who may not be .unionists. we know the purposes to which the union label has been put. There it has been used as a means of intimidation cott, to oppress people and to drive from their employment. In the Berry v. Donovan, in which a demand made by unionists for the dismissal of non-unionist named Berry- a demand to which the employer yielded- judgment given for the plaintiff, on 21st June, 1905. The Chief Justice, uponi that occasion, said that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, because he had beeni dismissed on account of the boycotting tactics pursued by union.",24
96,Mr CROUCH,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That is a criminal act '""Victoria.",24
97,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,It has nothing whatever do with the union label.,24
98,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Eve n the Attorneyof General, despite his twistings, cannot cape from the judgment of the Chief tice, who saidThe evidence tended to show that the sole ground for the demand was that the plaintiff was not a member of a Union.",24
99,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Hear , hear 1 Mr ROBJNSON. Evidently that meets with the Attorney-General's, approval. repeat that we can only judge of the bable effect of this legislation by sults in America. Though an attempt might not be made in Australia to deliberlabel ately force a man out of his employment, yet an indirect boycott could be produced the by an effort to patronize goods made by ? union labour only. Unionists could abstain from dealing with those manufacturers who did not employ union labour solely. form of boycott could, and established here. It' is to give the only method by which the use of of the union label could be made general. even the Attorney-General will contend that the use of that label affords, any guarthe quality of the goods. The of an article is determined by the was material supplied by the employer.",24
100,Mr CROUCH,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"In some trades it would Mr be a guarantee that the goods, were prounder wholesome and sanitary condi' Mr ROBINSON - No . The Factories The only guarantee afforded by the label is that perof sons who purchase goods to which it is proattached will assist to build up a particular union, and to force out of employment It is purely a coercive measure, and one which is intended for the purposes, of boycott only. and boyThat being so, I contend that it men should not meet with favourable concase of sideration at the hands of honourable was members. I do not intend to discuss a the constitutional aspect of this question. I have read with great care the opinion exwas pressed by Mr L . F. Cussen, to which I referred yesterday, to the effect that the union label proposals, are ultra vires of the Federal Constitution, and I think that it is a great pity that the Government should be the prepared to put our manufacturers to the expense of testing the constitutionality of in our legislation upon this question, instead of having the matter threshed out beforeto hand. The weight of constitutional testimony is against the union label provisions the Bill, so far as the Federal authority esis concerned, but there can be no doubt 'that Justhe States Governments have the power to legislate in this regard if they so desire. I do riot agree with many of the claims of the manufacturers of Victoria, but if they have any fighting capacity, as I believe they' have, they will take early steps to test the Validity of the provisions of the Bill, and I I trust that they will be successful in upsetproting them. I hope that every honourable its remember will debate this question on its merits, and that those who favour the union clauses will endeavour to show us why we should legalize a means of boycotting manufacturers, producers, and retailers, and also why we should practically reverse the decision at which we arrived in connection with t'he preference clause of the Arbitration Act. We know very well that if a change of Government had not taken place, the Treasurer, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and probably the Postmaster-General would have been found voting against the provisions referred to, but under present conditions they have to do as they are told.",24
101,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G, I should not have considered it necessary to again address the Committee upon this question but for the anxiety displayed by the Government to stifle all discussion.,25
102,Mr WILSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I think we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],25
103,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"As this may be the last opportunity that will be presented to us to discuss the serious results that may ensue from the passing of the trade union label provisions of the Bill, I wish to explain as fully as possible the evil consequences that have followed the adoption of similar measures in the United States. I can quite understand the anxiety of the Government to prevent this matter from being discussed, without hindrance, by the applica1 tion of the gag. They fully realise the disastrous possibilities of their action, and they wish to keep the public in ignorance. The honourable and learned member for Wannon demonstrated that a universal system of boycott had been adopted by the militant trade unions Of the United States, and I should like to know for what purpose the proposed legislation is designed unless it is to extend the operation of a similar boycott to Australia. If there are any other reasons I shall be glad to hear them. Honourable members of the Labour Party sit silent and do nothing but pull the strings which 'operate Mie marionette who is working for them at the table.",25
104,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"^I must ask the honourable member to strictly confine himself to the question before the Chair, which has nothing, whatever to do with the relations which exist between the Government and the Labour Party.",25
105,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If I am not in order in referring to the unfortunate position of 'the Government, I shall proceed to indicate the evil results which will inevitably follow the passing of legislation such as that now before us. I propose to quote from the American Federationist, the official magazine of the American Federation of Labour. This publication may be relied upon for a true indication of what is happening in industrial circles in the United States. After a reference to the union label as entirely American in its origin and use, we find the following statement:While trade uniois exist in other countries, and are especially powerful and influential in Great Britain, it is only in America that this unique sign of skilled and sufficiently paid labour is in recognised use. The further statement is madeThe reasons for the adoption of the union label are many and varied; but it came about principally on account of the greal influx of immigration, which brought to us a horde of cheap and unskilled labourers, who, by reason of their low standard of life, created a competition which would, of necessity, either have driven the American labourer from the field or compelled him to seek protective measures.",25
106,Mr CROUCH,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Surely the honourable member agrees with that.,25
107,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Yes ; the difficulty which the union label was intended to meet was a real one, and if I had been in America I should have attempted to deal with it ; but I hope in a less dangerous way.

I ask honourable members whether any of these conditions exist here at the present time. Can poorly-paid contract immigrants be introduced into this country ? Do we have sweating shops and colonized classes representing too low a standard of living for our citizens to adopt? Have we not our Arbitration Courts, our Wages Boards, and our factory laws?

After stating the difficulties with which the union label had to contend in America, the article continuesBut as the storm adds vigour and sturdiness to the tree which survives it, so have these trials added strength and vigor to the union label. That little seed which a few zealous cigar makers planted on the Pacific Slope has grown to be a mighty tree. It is almost a pity for the sturdiness of the Australian union label' that honourable 1 members should seek to hedge it about with all the safeguards which are conferred by honourable a legislative enactment. In America the thing stood upon its merits and prospered, because there was no reason why it should not do so. Here, where there is no reason why it should prosper, the Government propose to make it prosper by Act of Parliament. In America, 1 need scarcely remind honourable members, labour is very well organized. All over the country there are paid delegates, who furnish their official newspaper with the results of their labours. I propose to read a few extracts from their reports, with a view to showing that the union label is a live thing in the United States, and that it is being used to foster the system of boycott. The organizer in Arkansas writesNo strikes or locks-out to report. There has been some improvement in working conditions. Good work is being done for the union labels, and all boycotts published by the American F e'derationist are observed. I am quoting from the American Federation, ist, the official journal of the Federal Labour Unions of the United States. In that journal a black list is published, under the heading, -"" We don't patronize,"" and it statesUnion working men and working women and sympathizers with labour have refused to purchase articles produced by the following firms Labour papers please note changes from month to month, and copy. The names of the boycotted firms appear under different headings. The first of these headings has reference to foods and kindred products. Under it is published a list of the firms dealing in beer, bread, cigars, flour and meal, meats, oysters, tobacco, and whisky, which do not employ union labour exclusively.",28
151,Mr CROUCH,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Does the honourable member imagine that that system will come into operation in Australia?,29
152,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I am assured by the honourable member for Bland that it is already existent here.,29

I find that the list to which I have referred also includes printing-houses, publications, bookbinders, and newspapers'. The boycott of certain newspapers suggests to my mind the queswhether the Australian labour journals if they had the power, boycott all one other newspapers. We know that when the Party hold their conventions the of the 'g,reat daily newsan papers are denied admittance. The proceedings are carried on upon Star Chamber I lines, and the delegates deny the right any newspaper, except their own official orga,n, to report their discussions.

The honourable member for Neware incastle has just handed me a newspaper, and has asked me whether I have ever seen one containing so many drink adverthe tisements. The publication referred to is the Australasian Traveller, the journal of Commercial. Travellers' Association. It is perfectly natural that hotel keepers should ceradvertise in such a newspaper, for the that they largely depend on comtravellers for their incomes.",30
180,Mr WATKINS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is not a labour i86 Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.],30
181,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"No , but it is almost as bad, and I wish the honourable member had 1 handed me a labour paper so that I could read its liquor advertisements. I had a copy of the journal issued by the operatives employed in the Australian printing trade. Unfortunately, I cannot lay my hand upon it at the moment, ancl.I shall not be able to quote from it ; but I may mention that the hope was expressed that no half measures would be adopted in regard to the application of the union label provisions. I shall take care that the article is referred to by some other honourable member. The black list from which I have quoted also contains the names of a number of hardware and machinery firms, which have no doubt had the temerity to give non-unionists an opportunity to earn a living. The American Federationist contains a long list of firms dealing with hardware and machinery, wood, leather, and rubber, watches and jewellery, and miscellaneous goods, which have been boycotted by the aid of the union label. We do not know what offences they had committed, but they might have done anything, from employing one non-unionist amongst 10,000 hands, to sweating their employees. Then there is what is called a "" fair notice,"" the general clearance which an employer gets after he has been whipped by the boycott. Here is one dated Washington, D.C., 2'5th June, 1902To all affiliated unions : A satisfactory settlement of the differences isting between W. J. Yarbrough and Sons, of Richmond, Va., and the Tobacco Workers International Union, having been reached, whereby, the said firm now operates a union establishment, the same is removed from our list "" We don't patronise"" and placed upon our Fair List. Secretaries are requested to read this notice at union meetings, and labour and reform press please copy. The only fault committed by that firm was in daring to give non-unionists an opportunity to earn an honest livelihood. Here is another such notice, of the same dateAt the request of the unions interested, and after due investigation and attempt at settlement, the following concern has been declared unfair : Philadelphia Bulletin, Philactelphia, Pa. Secretaries are requested to read this notice union meetings, and labour and reform press please copy. In one case, a firm had dared to employ, perhaps, one non-unionist amongst the hundreds of persons in its employment, and was consequently boycotted throughout Marks Bill. the length and breadth of the States. In the other case, a newspaper which had, perhaps, kept some poor devil from starvation by giving him employment in defiance of the unions, was declared ""unfair,"" and was to be starved into submission, to be declared "" fair "" only when it had sacrificed the employee who had trusted to it, and had thrown him out on the world to starve.",31
182,Mr SPENCE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Those are imaginary statements, which are not supported by the facts.",31
183,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is obvious from the statements I have read that the onky crime in one case was the employment of a certain number of non-unionists, though how many is not stated. It was only when those men were driven out of employment or into unionism that the employer was declared ""fair."" The unionists play on the selfishness of the employers, and compel them to sacrifice the undoubted rights of the employees. I cannot congratulate them on their methods. In addition to the boycott list, there is a "" f a ir l is t "" in this newspaper, with which I do not propose to deal. I have here another official labour newspaper, the Coast Seamen's Journalthe organ of the International Seamen's Union of America. This copy is dated 5th April, 1905. It is "" A journal of seamen by seamen for seamen."". Its aim is ""The brotherhood of the sea,"" while its motto is "" Justice by organization."" It has a black-list, headed, "" We don't patronize ""a thoroughly understood heading, which apex- pears above every black-list published in the American labour papers. It means that no unionist is permitted to buy goods which are supplied by the firms named. In this newspaper the black-list fills up an entire column, and deals with every class of business, supplying every known article of human consumption or wear. On the other side of the page isi a list of what are described as "" fair "" offices. Throughout the paper are references to the union label, and advertisers recommend nothing that does not bear that label. Buyer9 are warned to insist on getting goods marked with the Label, and to take no others. It is clear from the information which I have placed before the Committee that organized boycotting is at taking place in the United States, and that the main instrument of the boycott is the union label. If we pass these proposals the same system will inevitably be adopted here, and I ask honourable members to consider what that will mean to the Commonwealth. The average country storekeeper, who makes his purchases from the great considered business houses of the cities, doesi not know, and hardly cares, whether the goods which - main in abeyance until next session. he. stocks are made by union or non-union labour. He buys them because he thinks that they will sell well, and he tries give the best value he can, consistent with fair profit. What would such a man do if a strong league were formed in his neighlegal bourhood, and it were decided goods branded with the union label should be purchased by unionists, their wives, and children? Eventually, the storekeepers would find that if they had two articles sale, into the composition of one of which there entered 100 per cent, of union labour, a union label? and into the composition of the other only 99J per cent., the latter would be refused Canadian Bill. by all unionists. As the boycoft spread, the political bosses would decree that no unionist must buy of any storekeeper whose store contained any article not made wholly by union labour. In Australia we use a large quantity of imported goods, and not even so energetic a prohibitionist as the Attorneyhappened Genera!) would assert that all the requirements of Australia could be made locally. A Mr. But under the boycott they would have to be regarded be made locally, not by our manhood and womanhood, but by that small section which the intelligence of the belongs to unions. The union label could Commons that it was not not be applied to goods which are not made in Australia. Thus prejudice would be created against those goods, and they would be shut out from this market. It means that we shall have, within a brief period, to endeavour to make in Australia all the goods that we now import, and port because it pays us to do so. I am not dealing with this phase of the question from the fiscal stand-point. must recognise that if we are suddenly to completely stop our import trade, the cost to the consumer must be enormously creased.

190,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I feel that I should be in a better position if, at the next elecimtion campaign, I could assurei my constituents that the Attorney-General utilized the vast forces at his command to obtain A ll parties a copy of that Bill . 1",32

193,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,It is not.,32
194,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable and gentleman allows no one to meddle' with it. He insists upon every honourable have member giving way to his right to coerce to' the the proceedings of the Committee.,32
195,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member must discuss the see his question before the Chair.,32
196,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am pointing out that, had the Attorney-General looked up the i88 Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] important precedent to which I refer, he might have been induced to postpone the consideration of Part VII . of the Bill to another session. Union label provisions were introduced in a .Canadian Trade Marks Bill, and were declared to be unconstitutional, amidst such harmless surroundings.",32
197,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Where , and when?",33
198,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"My natural diffidence prevents me from acting as the mentor of an honourable and learned gentleman, who should have looked up these facts for himself before introducing the Bill. Does the honourable and learned gentleman deny that the inclusion of union label provisions in a Trade Marks Bill introduced into the Canadian Legislature, was held to be unconstitutional ?",33
199,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I have not heard of it.,33
200,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If the honourable member were prepared to deny everything of which he had not heard, he would be reachto deny three-fourths of the proceedings of this House. I merely wish to know whether it would be competent for him to introduce a Biill dealing separately with the question of the union label? I was assured by a gentleman who interviewed him on a previous occasion that his recollection was that the honourable and learned gentleman informed him that it would not be possible for him to do so.",33
201,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Who said so?,33
202,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I was informed privately of this, but at once replied that I did not think the honourable and learned gentleman could have made such a statement. I am glad to hear that the Attorney-General has this power.",33
203,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"What I say is that the onlysions power which we have to deal with the question-if we have it at all-is that ferred upon us by the constitutional proviGovernment. sion in regard to trade marks, and that it would be just as legal to deal with a trade union mark in a separate Bill as it would be to deal with it in a Bill relating to trade marks generally.",33
204,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Then the Attorney-Genethe ral could introduce a separate Bill dealing with the trade union label?,33
205,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It could be done, but we are dealing with a Trade Marks Bill we may also deal with that question. could introduce a Tariff, and have a sepaoffice. rate Bill for every item. Marks Bill,",33
206,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,We have dealt with the questions of the sugar bounty and the sugar excise in separate Bills.,33
207,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member must understand that it would be illegal to deal with the two matters in the one Bill.,33
208,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I hold that it is wrong to include union label provisions in a Bill relating to trade marks. If the Minister were to separate the two proposals, we should be able to address ourselves shortly and sharply to the questions at issue; we should have a chance to differentiate between that which we desire to fight and that which we db not wish to oppose. The delay that has taken place in the consideration of this measure has been due as much to the fact that it deals with two different questions as to the want of tact displayed by the Attorney-General. Another point to which I desire to refer is that, on glancing at the amendments which have been circulated, one cannot help being struck by the fact that some of them .are similar to amendments circulated in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. That necessarily brings the controversial characteristics of the two propositions into something like harmony. In my opinion, there is a similarity between the two measures. It is because certain provisions were inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that the proposals in reference to the union label have been submitted to this House. As honourable members are aware, 'certain safeguards were included in that measure with the object of preventing members of trades unions, whose funds were devoted to political purposes, from enjoying a preference over non. unionists. It was only after those provihad been carried that these union label proposals were first heard of. The Trade conMarks Bill was introduced by the Watson Its members did not think it necessary to include in that Bill ' any proposals in reference to the use of union labels. But as soon as it became clear that the political organizations of the Labour Party would not benefit one iota from passing of the Arbitration Act, owing to the insertion of the safeguards just referred to, one of its members proposed that the' union label principle when should be embodied in this Bill. ' It was inserted in the measure only a day beWe fore the Watson Government resigned from To me, it is quite evident that the insertion of certain political safeguards in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is very closely connected with the sudden appearance of the union label provisions. That is a point which I hope will ""be made abundantly clear before this discussion is concluded. I can quite understand the Government suggesting the use of the "" gag "" to prevent us from discussing such a miserable conspiracy.",33
209,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is a pity that they do not "" gag "" the honourable member.",34
210,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"A similar spirit to that exhibited by the honourable member for Capricornia was displayed by members of the Labour Party when the proposal to extend a preference to unionists was under consideration. I hope that on the present occasion the same determination will be exhibited by the Opposition to make the meaning of this legislation perfectly clear. - Hitherto, it has been the practice of Governments to allow their supporters absolute freedom to re-nffirm the votes which they have previously recorded upon any question.",34
211,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member is not now discussing the question.,34
212,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am pointing out the necessity which exists for extending to supporters of the Government the same freedom of action that has been extended to the supporters of previous Administrations. The Government consists of gentlemen who entertain different views upon this question. For instance, there is the Attorney-General, who is always in his element in preparing political bridges for his friends. Although he has built a bridge to office, I do not envy him his position. At the present time, there are three members of the Government in the Chamber who voted in favour of the Labour Party's conspiracy upon the Conciliation ancl Arbitration Bill.",34
213,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I rise to a point of order. I ask that the honourable member should withdraw the word "" conspiracy."" He has had an enormous amount of latitude extended to him, and I think that the use of such a word is a cruel insult to a great body of men.",34
214,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If it be a cruel insult to ""a great body of men,"" including the Attorney-General, I withdraw the expression. There are three members of ,the Government who, when the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was under consideration, constructed a political bridge, namely, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of Home Affairs.",34
215,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,- I would point out to the honourable member that his remarks have no relevance whatever to the motion before the Chair.,34
216,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I was merely pointing out that every Government has extended to its supporters absolute liberty of action in regard to any question upon which they have previously registered an opinion.,34
217,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member must see that he is now discussing whether certain proposals which are embodied in this Bill ought to be treated by the Government as an open question. That matter is in no way connected with the amendment before the .Chair. I must ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to that amendment.,34
218,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I bow to your ruling, sir, but I was not aware that my remarks were irregular.",34
219,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I beg to call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.],34
220,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"In these union label proposals a principle is involved which, in my opinion, constitutes an additional reason why ""the Government should abandon them. The Bill contains a clause which sets out that a registrable trade mark shall not contain certain things. The use of the word "" Royal,"" or of the Royal Arms is prohibited.",34
221,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"On a point of order, I would ask you, sir, in the interests of public business, to restrain the honourable member from referring to matters that are not relevant to the subject under discussion. The question is whether the words "" trade union "" shall be included in clause 1 3. We have not reached any other clause, much less any amendment, and the honourable member is-entirely out of order. His action is resulting in a sheer was.te of public time.",34
222,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I should like your ruling, sir, as to whether the Attorney-General is in order in accusing me of wasting the public time.",34
223,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"On the point of order, it appears to me that the honourable member for Wentworth is perfectly in order in discussing the question whether other clauses of the Bill relating to trade marks also T Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] apply to union labels. It seems to me that his remarks are quite relevant.",34
224,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The discussion must be confined to the motion now before the Chair, namely, whether the words "" trade union "" shall, or shall not, be omitted. No discussion beyond these limits can be permitted.",35
225,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Perhaps I was not discreet in mentioning any particular clause. I should have referred to the principle embodied in one part of the Bill, and not in the other. The matter to which I have referred is well worthy of the attention of the Attorney-General, who would do well if he gave his consideration to it, instead of lecturing honourable members. clusion, I desire to point out that the people of Australia are looking forward anxiously to the decision of the Committee. tests against the union label provisions have been received from persons engaged in all branches of trade in all parts of the Commonwealth. There has been no call for s-uch legislation. Upon the one hand we have had emphatic protests against the proposal, and upon the other hand absolute silence. No honourable member can say that he was sent here to support the union label provisions. Even the Labour Party have never included in its platform any such proposals. The Attorney-General has received no mandate from his constituents in favour of the legislation now proposed. This is one of the most controversial measures that has yet been presented to Parliament, and I can only once more express the hope that the Government will refrain from any attempt to gag the Committee or to prevent honourable members from expressing, in the most complete way. the reasons for their objections to provisions which should never have been included in this Bill.",35
226,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," No one knows, better than the Attorney-General that there is the widest difference between a Trade Marks Bill pure and simple and a measure embracing provisions relating to trade union labels. The honourable and learned gentleman has a keen intellect, but I cannot credit him with the possession of high principle.",35
227,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I do not ask the honourable member to give me credit for anything.,35
228,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I can assure-the Minister that I would not give him a high character.,35
229,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I should be very sorry the honourable member did. Marks Bill.,35
230,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It if. not worthy of the Attorney-General-o r it is worthy of him, according to the way in which his conduct is viewed-to attempt to deceive the public as to the true nature of the provisions made for' the use of trade union labels. He knows full Swell that ithe articles to which trade union labels are to be affixed will not be the property of the unions, whereas those who register trade marks must have a proprietary interest in the goods to which they are to be attached. It has been urged that we are refusing to extend to unionists the same rights that we would! grant to corporations or individual traders; but we are not doing anything of In con- the kind. If union workmen care to work upon co-operatiive lines and manufacture goods for themselves, they will be entitled, Pro- to register any trade mark that will comply with the conditions of the Bill. The union label provisions of Part VIL are altogether foreign to a Trade Marks Bill. This measure which, without the trade union label clauses, might be of great use to the community, is being employed merely as a means for giving effect to those provisions. I join issue with those who say that the application of a union label' to goods is a guarantee of their quality. It is no guarantee, and the labels are not intended to be used to insure good quality. 1 Honourable members who belong to unions, or who believe strongly in unionism, contend that the statement that an article has been made by unionists is equivalent to the statement that it has been made by good workmen. But outside of unions, there are workmen as good as any unionists, and I am not sure that, man for man. the workmen outside unions will not be found better than the unionists.",35
231,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," The honourable member must confine his remarks to the amendment, and not discuss the merits or demerits of unionism.",35
232,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"How can I discuss the amendment, if I am to be precluded from dealing with the object of providing in the Bill for trade union labels? I say that such labels will not guarantee the qualitv of the goods to which they are attached. If that remark is not in order, I should like to know how I can discuss the very amendment? There are good men outside unions, and often men who are not unionists if are better than those who are. If we are going to adopt the trade union label principle, we should provide for it by a separate Bill . It has been suggested that the unions occupy the place which, was formerly occupied by the trade guilds; but in olden days, before a man coui'd become a member of a guild, he had to prove himself a good workman, ancl hence the fact that work had been done by a member of a guild, was a guarantee of its excellence. The object of the trade union label, however, is, not to guarantee the quality of the goods to which it is attached, but to provide a means of forcing men into unions against their will. Whilst this may be necessary in America, though I doubt if it is, it is unnecessary in Australia. In New South Wales and Western Australia we have Arbitration Courts, ancl in Victoria, Wages Boards, to provide fair conditions of labour and just rates of wages, with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as an additional safeguard. Therefore, the union label is altogether unnecessary. The real object of the label is to provide a means of establishing a boycott which will force non-unionists into unions, which I look upon as un-British. It is extraordinary that, whilst in Russia the working classes are striving to escape from bureaucratic tyranny, in Australia, the Labour Party, and those whom they are supporting, aare seeking to deprive the workers of their freedom, and to compel them to do what they do not wish to 'do. I shall resist such attempts with all the strength I possess. When the Arbitration Bill was before us,""honourable members on this side inserted in it provisions to protect non-unionists from injury by it. No legislation should be passed by this Parliament injuring any section of the community, ancl, certainly, the majority should not be made to suffer for the good of the minority. We, who object to the trade union labels, are charged with desiring to see goods sold under fraudulent descriptions; but that is not our desire. We hold that goods should be placed on the market under true 'descriptions, and there can be no better guarantee of the quality of an article than the name of the maker on its label, because if its quality is not good, he will be the first to suffer. But certain men, belonging to unions, are doing all they can to increase the membership of these bodies, perhaps in the interests of the workers at large, though, I think, chiefly in their own interests, in order to gain larger support. If a man refuses to become a member of a union why should he, or the goods which he produces, be boycotted? Why should the public be prevented in this way from purchasing his goods? On what ground should we be justified in passing legislation that would make it difficult for men to secure employment? I feel strongly upon this question, and will do my best to prevent the passing of such legislation. But for the union label provisions this measure would have been passed before now. Sheafs of amendments have, been circulated by the Attorney-General, and these serve to indicate that he is not satisfied in his own mind as to the possible effect of the union label proposal. The statements made in Committee this afternoon, in regard to the effect of the union label in the United States, have been challenged. It is easy for one to challenge a sfatement with which he does nof agree, but we know that by means of the union label great injury has been done to many people in the United States. 1 After a perusal of the Journal of the Federation of Labour-the largest labour federation, I believe, in the world-on e is forced to the conclusion that the boycott effected by means of the union label in the United States is very severe. We read of men having been ruined because of their refusal to employ unionists, or to place a union label upon their goods. The improvements which have been made during the last fifty years in the conditions of labour have been secured, not by the passing of restrictive measures, but by the development of freedom in every direction.",35
233,Mr BROWN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The working men have had to fight all along the line for the freedom they enjoy.,36
234,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The fight has hitherto been along the lines of freedom, but today the honourable member is fighting for restriction.",36
235,Mr BROWN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Every reform advocated by the worker has been denounced as a restriction of Freedom.,36
236,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I have made no such accusation; but the honourable member must recognise that the union label movement is a restrictive one.,36
237,Mr CULPIN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is not correct.,36
238,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is true that men will not be compelled by law to place union labels on their goods, but the unions themselves will force them to do so.",36
239,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That has not been done.,36
240,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is the history of the movement in America.,36
241,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member is in error.,37
242,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"What is the use of passing a Jaw with regard to the union label unless the use of that label can be made compulsory ? The Labour Party do not intend that these provisions, if passed, shall remain a dead letter. They will counsel the unionists to take advantage of them to increase the membership of their organizations. I oppose restrictive proposals of this kind just as I should oppose a proposal to compel a man to place a non-union label on his goods.",37
243,Mr FRAZER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,We should not object to that.,37
244,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,On e honourable member said that the Opposition were endeavouring to take from the workers that which we were prepared to give to others.,37
245,Mr FRAZER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is a fact.,37
246,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I beg the 'honourable member's pardon. Any man may register a trade mark in respect of the goods .that he produces, but what right should a man have to place a trade mark upon goods that he does not produce? We should not enable one section of the community to boycott another. When a storekeeper offers, for sale goods not bearing a union label, the order - goes forth that unionists shall not purchase them; that they are to deal only at those stores where goods bearing the union label can be obtained ",37
247,Mr BAMFORD,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Rot ! ,37
248,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member knows that that will be the effect of the passing of the union label provisions of this Bill. Orders will be given to unionists not to purchase goods that do not bear the union label.,37
249,Mr BAMFORD,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,How many unionists are there in the honourable member's electorate?,37
250,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,There are some unions connected with the mining industry in my electorate.,37
251,Mr MCDONALD,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If there were a number of unionists in the honourable member's, electorate, he would be very anxious to see the union labour clauses passed.",37
252,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I should not. The interjection of the honourable member shows that if there were only a few unionists in the electorates represented by the members of the Labour Party, they would not desire these clauses to be passed. anxiety in regard to these provisions is due to the fact that there is a lairge number of unionists among their constituents. That is why they are prepared to accept proposals which they themselves believe to be wrong. I have had' the courage to tell the unionists what I believe is best for them; I have not advised them that such proposals as these will be of any service to them. I have said, and still say, that we find in the unions men who are as good as are those outside their ranks; but I will not admit that unionists are better than non-unionists. I object to coercive measures. I wish to give every man the fullest liberty. Let every man have the right to put a trade mark upon his own goods, but do not let us pass a law which, by means of outside pressure, will force men to place labels on their goods which they do not desire to use. We believe that it would be wrong to compel men by law to use s.uch labels, and yet it is proposed to place in-the hands of one section of the community an 'instrument that will enable them to force manufacturers anti others to follow a course which they would not otherwise pursue. I am against trade union labels in even' shape and form.",37
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," In view of what has gone before, I do not feel that I should unduly prolong my remarks, but I should like to make a few observations at this stage regarding the proposals now before the Committee. My first observation is that it is strange to find that the Labour Party now consider this question one of urgency. One looks in vain for any mention of union label proposals in their political programme. They certainly find no place in their State or Federal platforms. When those programmes were framed, the question wap. either one of which they had not the slightest knowledge, or for which they bad the most supreme contempt. They did not take the trouble to place it on their programme or to discuss it at any of their conferences.",37
254,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,It was discussed at the Inter-State Conference held in Sydney four years ago.,37
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,And placed on the programme? ',37
256,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,A resolution was carried in favour of it .,37
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable Their member's interjection shows most conclusively how little the Labour Party thought of this proposal four years ago. They deliberately discussed it at their conference, but did not consider it of sufficient importance to warrant its being placed in any of their programmes.",37
258,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member must know that every resolution carried is not embodied in the programme of the. Labour Party. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am quite aware of that. Only those which are considered to be of a more urgent and important character are incorporated in that programme. At that time, therefore, the party regarded the proposed union label.as one of the flotsam and jetsam-of their political doings. They did not consider it entitled to a place in their programme of legislative action. It is well known that the party divide their programme into two parts. They have what is known as their fighting platform, and their general platform, but in neither of these did the union label find a place. I am glad to see you, sir, again in the chair. During the past twenty-four hours we have scarcely known who has been our Chairman. The occupants of that office have glided in and out of the chair, after giving the most diverse and contradictory rulings, and we have seen their faces no more. I am glad indeed to get back to our old authority and our old Chairman. Coming to a later period, we all remember that some time ago a Commonwealth Labour Government came into power. During the tenure of their office., did anybody hear of a proposal such as this? Did anybody hear any mention of trade union labels? Mir. THOMAS - The provision in regard to that matter was inserted in the Bill in the Senate.",38
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Was Senator Pearce a member of the Government? I heard what he said. am speaking of the Watson Administration, and I say that they did not include in their programme any proposal in reference to the use of the union label. They took no action to give legislative effect to it . Evidently at that time they regarded other matters as of greater importance. This question has now become suddenly urgent. Certainly it is not because of any popular demand for it. No petitions have been presented to the House claiming that use of the union label should be sanctioned either as a right or as a privilege. Conseunion quently, we have to look underneath these trade mark? proposals to ascertain their true inwardness, and to realise why they have so suddenly become urgent. They were not included in the programme of the Labour Government ['73] l some months ago; neither did they find a place in the programme of the Deakin Government. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat had no time for this subject at the last general election, when he announced so confidently, and with so much brilliancy, his urgent measures of practical reform, including his preferential trade * proposals, most of which have suddenly been relegated to the par1 liamentary dust-heap. Immediately he came into office, ancl was afforded an opportunity to give legislative effect to his pre-sessional programme, he found every excuse for relegating the measures he had outlined to the lumber room where Ministers heap up their musty tomes. But at the elections preferential trade was his great rallying-cry, and it altogether precluded the possibility of considering such matters as trade union labels. One looks in vain for the slightest pretence of authority or of justification for these proposals, particularly when an urgent and practical programme is awaiting attention at ths hands of this House. The honourable member for Bland has reiterated a remark which I venture to say is as specious an observation as has ever been made by him or by any other honourable member. He claims that the innocent function of these proposals is to prevent fraud, and he characterizes as pirates and the friends of fraud all and sundry who oppose this ' Bill .",38
260,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is not what he said.,38
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The Attorney General knows nothing about the matter.,38
262,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I heard what he said.,38
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable and learned gentleman could not have I am referring not merely to the remarks made by the honourable member for Bland ini this House, but to numberless utterances of his outside-to criticisms of myself, for example. He declares that the object of these provisions is to prevent fraud-to prevent the pirating of something which presumably Why ? belongs to the trade unions. Before there can be any piracy, I maintain that there must be some kind of ownership. Does the the honourable member sures t that the same kind of ownership attaches to a trade label as exists in connection with a",38
264,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Why'not ?,38
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"To my mind, the distinction is very clear. Provision is made in the Copyright Bill that when an artist has painted a picture and is paid for his work, his ownership in that picture absolutely ceases. The work becomes the property of the individual who has purchased it . Clearly that is what happens in respect of the employment of union labour. When that labour has been paid for, it becomes absolutely the property of the employer. The employee has no longer any interest in the goods which he has produced. How, then, can it be urged that there is any fraud or piracy in respect of goods which a man does not own ? I refer to this matter merely to brush aside the cobweb which the honourable member for Bland is seeking to wrap around these proposals. May I suggest to him that he and his party occupy a very peculiar position in regard to this Bill ? A number of new clauses have been brought down by the Attorney General, and we have the assurance of the honourable member for Bland that he has had nothing whatever to do with them. Is it accidental that they are so favourable to the honourable member and the whole of his party that they can be given an unqualified and silent support ?",38
266,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Wai t till the clauses are under discussion, and the honourable member will then see whether we are giving them a silent support.",39
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Does the honourable member suggest that we can discuss this matter as freely upon a single clause as can be done in the course of a general debate? The Attorney-General has submitted thirty-three new clauses, and about sixty-two sub-clauses. He has tacked them on to another Bijj , to the purposes of which they are absolutely foreign.",39
268,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss amendments which are not before the Committee.,39
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,They are before the Committee.,39
270,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I can assure the honourable member ""that they - are not.",39

272,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Not upon this clause.,39
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Yes . It was for that very reason the Attorney-General agreed to postpone the consideration of this clause.,39
274,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"As ""a matter of personal explanation, I wish to say that this afternoon I distinctly stated that I desired to postpone this portion of the Bill, so that when the other - clauses were reached we might have a general debate upon them. When the honourable and learned member for Wannon was speaking, I pointed out that it would be very inconvenient to discuss this question upon my amendment for the excision of two words, and that I should not attempt to debate it until we reached Part VII . of the Bill.",39
275,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"B y way of personal explanation, I wish also to sav it is quite true that the Attorney-General intimated his desire that honourable members should discuss this question upon Part VII . of the Bill . But he omitted to inform the Committee of the reason why I refused to follow that course, namely, that if the new standing order framed by the Government were boought into operation before we reached Part VII . of the Bill , honourable members upon this side of the House would have no opportunity of discussing the union , label provisions. The standing order in question is intended to suppress debate.",39
276,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I think that the honourable - and learned member is exceeding the limits of a personal explanation.,39
277,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I informed the Attorney-General that if he would give an undertaking that the standing order to which I have referred would not be enforced until we had dealt with Part VII . of the Bill , I would agree to the general debate taking place upon that portion of the measure.",39
278,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I would point out to the Committee that understandings of the character indicated cannot possibly be regarded by the occupant of the chair.,39
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,But they are so regarded.,39
280,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I understand that 'the Attorney-General has given notice of certain amendments and new clauses, and it would be utterly irregular, for me to allow those matters to be discussed before they were properly before the Committee.",39
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am bound to say that the Attorney-General has stated something to-night entirelv different from what he said"" last evening on the same matter.",39
282,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Las t night I made a proposal which was not accepted, and therefore I am entirely free. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Attorney General is guilty of the most contemptible. quibble; there is no other name for it .",39
283,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I would ask the honourable member not to use expressions of that k in d ; they can only provoke disorder.,39
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I regret to have to speak so stronglv. but I must say that the action of the Attorney-General in bluffing, and twisting and contorting everything he touches is enough to provoke stronger language still. It was distinctly understood last night that we were to discuss the union label proposals generally, when clause 3 was under consideration. The Attorney-General himself distinctly stated across the table that he desired to postpone the clause, so that we might have a general debate upon it..",40
285,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I venture to say that Hansard will prove that I am right, and the honourable member is wrong.",40
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It may be that the Attorney-General has revised the report of his statement, in which case I should be prepared to find that his statement was borne out.",40
287,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have not altered even one letter of the report. I suppose this is the best the honourable member can do. He is a defeated' man. He has been completely bowled out, and is savage in consequence.",40
288,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Will the honourable member for Parramatta proceed to discuss the clause?,40
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Will you, sir, kindly keep this small pettifogging Napofeon quiet?",40
290,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I rise to a point of order. The term ""pettifogging. "" is not a good one to employ with regard to any person, and when applied to a lawyer is highly disorderly. It bears a very bad construction indeed"", and I hope that the honourable member for Parramatta will withdraw it .",40
291,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am sure that the honourable member for Parramatfa will with, draw his remark.",40
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am bound to say that my remark was a severe reflection upon Napoleon, and, upon reconsideration, I desire to withdraw it.",40
293,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,It could not be a severe reflection on any one.,40
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,We are told by the Attorney-General that we have been defeated in regard to a proposal which we are not supposed to discuss until tomorrow. No one knows better than the Attorney-General that it is out of order to anticipate debate. I look forward to the discussion tomorrow without the slightest apprehension. The Attorney-General claims that he' has [i73]- 2 already turned our flank. We shall see tomorrow whether the liberal professions for so many years past on the part of the Attorney-General and the liberal protestations on the part of the honourable member for Bland,40
295,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member is again departing from the question before the Chair.,40
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I shall urge, before I sit down, that the proposed amendment in this clause should not be agreed to, for the simple reason that the proposals to which it relates ought not to receive the sanction of the Committee. I wish to take a cursory glance at some of the amendments brought before us by the Attorney-General, as to which it was arranged last night that there should be a general debate at this stage. My position with regard to the union label provisions is simply this: I have all'my life had a deep sympathy with trades organizatons. I would not. willing!v do anything that I thought would he detrimental to them. I would not weaken their natural and legitimate force, prestige, on, influence one iota. But the more I study these proposals, the more I am convinced that they would aim a blow at the genuine trade unionism of Australia, and therefore I oppose them.",40
297,Mr BROWN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Ain d yet the Employers' Federation is opposing the Bill .,40
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I know nothing about the Employers' Federation. I should think the Employers' Federation, as well as the Eimployes' Federation, might very well oppose proposals of this kind, seeing that they can produce no good to either of them, but will inevitably create external f ricttan in the ranks of both parties. They must create strife. They are intended to be used for the purpose of coercing men into joining the labour organization. I do not think any honourable member can dispute that. The union; labels will be used for the purpose of increasing the membership of the unions. The moment such political means are employed to bolster up the unions, a blow will be struck ' at the rationale of trade unionism, as we have understood it for years past. Honourable members who profess to know exactly how the undom label provisions will operate will not help us with even so much as a sentence.",40
299,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Giv e us a chance.,40
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I would sit down instantly if the honourable member would undertake to explain the bearing of the union label provisions upon unions generally.,40
301,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I shall have something to say before they are disposed of.,41
302,Mr JOSEPH COQK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"This us the point at which the honourable member should give us the benefit of his wise counsels. He has always been a good, loyal trade unionist, and I shall be very glad to bear how he expects the union label provisions to operate in favour of unionism. I admit frankly that the trade organizations are for the most part in favour of the provisions for trade union labels, but I back my judgment against theirs. I may be wrong, but until it can be shown that I am wrong I prefer to exercise my own discretion. As far as I can see, these provisions can result only in the development of class hatred, of which we have already had enough in Australia. Strangely, enough, the keenest class hatred has 'been developed in - those countries where union labels have been used. If any one desires to see this feeling developed to perfection, he Vill find it in the United States, ancl, in proportion as union labels are used for coercive purposes by trade organizations, so bitterness and class hatred will be engendered. I think that that is an incontestable fact, and. I challenge proof to the contrary. Good feeling cannot exist between employers and employees so long as tyranny is exercised by either side. I have fought many battles against capitalistic tyranny, but I have not the slightest intension to escape from that tyranny by setting up another kind of class tyranny.  is working very hard for the capitalist.",41
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member talks at random. He has suddenly made a bolt round, and has become a convert to political unionism. He has had to fight political unionism before today.  unionist for twenty-five years.",41
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am not talking about trade unionism, but of political trade unionism, which is a very different thing. As I look abroad over the industrial arena, I see no hope of betterment for unionists so long as political unionism holds sway. Whatever advantages they are enjoying today have been gained by their trade organizations, not by their political organizations. I challenge any honourable member to show that the large body of working men are a bit better off for having descended into politics, and adopted the means for socializing the industries, of the community which have been adopted in so many parts of the globe. My observations lead me to believe that since they have become politicians first, and trade unionists only incidentally, they have not bettered their condition. The Attorney General has placed before us a schedule of amendments to be moved by him, in substitution for amendments previously circulated, dealing wjith no fewer than thirty-three clauses, and s,ixty-six sub-clauses. We have been informed that the provisions of Part VII . were inserted in the Senate by Senator Pearce, a well-known and highly-respected member of the Labour Party; but the Attorney-General intends to move their omission, and to substitute for them a larger number of clauses, of wider range, and of a different character. Surely we should hear from the leader of the Labour Party why he is so meekly and docilely accepting these amendments. He may pretend that they are in substance the same as the original clauses, but in reality they are as different as chalk is from cheese. I have heard it suggested that the aim of the new provisions is to render the proposals of Senator Pearce innocuous; but, in my opinion, they want looking into very closely. I regard them as entirely foreign to the subject-matter of the Bill, and, as such, they should have been dealt with in a separate measure, though I do not wish to raise any point of order in regard to them. There is nothing cognate to a Trade Mark Bill in a trade union label. A trade mark is used to designate quality and ownership. It can be given away, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of. A trade union label, however, can be owned only in the sense of being possessed. Those who own it cannot give it away, or transfer it, or sell it, or dispose of it, nor can ""they use it ; while the person who ma.y use it may not own it. That is a serious anomaly! My statement, however, is borne out by the new clause 75 which the Attorney General proposes to insert, which saysUpon the registration of a union trade mark the union by which it is registered shall be deemed to be the proprietor thereof, and shall be entitled to prevent the unauthorized application of the mark. While proposed new clause 76 provides, thatThe application of a union trade mark to shall be deemed to be unauthorized, unless by the employerNot by the employees-the ownersfor whom the goods are made or manufactured, ' or by a member of the union by direction the employer, applied. There is another matter which I think worth considering. It is intended to conout fer ownership upon those who register a union trade mark. ownership in the results of labour which in it. has been paid for, which pass out of the control and possession of the labourer the control and possession of the employer. Therefore there can be no fraud, such has been alluded to by the honourable ber for Bland. These trade union are so radically different from trade marks that the provisions dealing with .ought not to find a place in the Bill Attorney-General also provides for the tration of two Government brands, which, I think, can be termed trade union labels only by a stretch of the imagination. - are a brand which the Government may put on the goods of a corporation which have examined, tested, and standardized, and a Commonwealth brand which is indicate that the goods, to which it is plied have been manufactured in accordargument ance with the social conditions of monwealth as a whole.",41
305,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member may not discuss those proposals mow.,42
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am arguing mark. that these proposals ought not to find place in this Bill . I am referring schedule of amendments which the Attorunion ney-General has circulated, and in respect of which he seeks to amend this clause.",42
307,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The Attorney-Genapplied eral has moved the omission of with a view to the insertion of others, and I take it that the honourable member for Parramatta will recognise that we cannot, at this stage, discuss any further course muneration which the Attorney-General may intend pursue. If those words be omitted, will be competent for the honourable learned gentleman not to move"" to fill the blank. I have allowed the honourable member to refer in general terms to certain amendments which have been circulated, but ' I must ask him not at this stage bate them in detail.",42
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"May I point out, sir, that it is practically impossible to goods refrain from referring to the provisions of it is the Bill, as a justification for my opposition to the amendment now before us ? Part VII . , to which it relates, deals with the union label, and the amendment now of before the Chair has been moved so that that division may correctly describe the clauses coming within it. I am pointing that the proposed new clauses contain something totally foreign to, the But there can be no Bill , and that they should not find a place 1",42
309,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It has been laid into clown over and over again that, on a motion for the omission of certain words, the as Committee is not justified in discussing in memdetail a projected amendment to fill the marks blank proposed to be created. The question to Be debated is whether or not certain them words shall be omitted. As the amend. The ment deals with the heading to Part VII . regisof the Bill, I have allowed a reference to be made to the whole of the clauses coming within that division; but I do not think These it is competent for the honourable member to go beyond the Bill , and discuss certain they amendments which have been circulated.",42
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I merely wish to to refer to the amendments which have apbeen circulated in order to give point to my that that now before the Chair the Comshould not be made. The Attorney-General's proposals are entirely new. They provide for at least two Government brands ancl three trade union labels. Then there is to be a Commonwealth trade The provision in regard to the a latter gives a very important indication of to the something which should be fatal to the label proposals. Sub-clause 2 of proposed new clause 78? provides that before the Commonwealth trade mark can be to goods, a resolution shall be certain words passed by both HousesThat the conditions as to the remuneration of labour are fair and reasonable in respect of goods which are manufactured in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as"" to the reof labour prescribed, required, or to provided in relation to the goods by an init dustrial law or order, or an industrial agreeand ment, under an industrial law. up I venture to say that that clause shows the absolute non-necessity for a trade union label in Australia. A trade union label cannot be affixed to goods until there has to debeen placed upon them a Government brand as to wages, conditions, and everything else that indicates the social status of the work, in accordance with the decision of the industrial Courts of the country. Whatever excuse there may be for trade , union labels in the United States, there clearly can be none in Australia, since we are already doing this work, and doing it in an infinitely better way, by means of the various industrial Courts that have been set up. In Victoria there are Wages Boards; in New South Wales and in Western Australia, compulsory arbitration prevails; whilst in South Australia, a Conciliation Court .has been set up, although I believe that, for some reason or other, it has never been availed of. We have thus a. chain of industrial Courts extending, over Australia, and the Commonwealth trade mark cannot be affixed goods unless those tribunals have previously declared what the social, status of the work associated with them is to be. Why do we need to duplicate this machinery ? Whatever excuse there may be for a . union label in the United States, where fierce individualism is the order of the day - wher e the people do not believe in compulsory arbitration-ther e is no necessity for it here, where the conditions of the workers are arbitraril v fixed by governmental machinery. That is another reason why the union label provisions of the Bill should not be passed. I do not find much trace of brotherhood in these proposals. proposed new clause 78* provides that unions, as distinct from each other, may own these labels. Notwithstanding that the labour conditions in relation to two unions and the social status of the workers 1 in those unions may be similar, only one of those unions, and that the one which happens to get in first, may possess a trade union label.",42
311,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Is there anything to prevent the other from registering a union label?,43
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Yes . The clause provides that one union may not register a mark or label which so nearly resembles the registered trade mark of another as to be calculated to deceive.,43
313,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Coul d two employers in the same industry register similar labels?,43
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The interjection made by the honourable member shows the distinction betiween - a trade union label and a trade mark. Twp men may own the same trade mark. This Bill will! give them absolute ownership, and the right to dispose or sell. One may assign his trade mark to the other; but a union cannot assign its union label to another organization, notwithstanding that the labour con-' ditions and the social status of the workers in both unions may be the same.",43
315,Mr MAHON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I wish to know, Mr Chairman, whether the honourable member is in ordfer in making repeated reference to the inability of unions to sell or transfer their union labels?",43
316,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"OurStandingOrder s provide that honourable members shall not be guilty of tedious repetition, ancl those who transgress that rule must suffer the penalty. I think that honourable members would assist me by refraining from interjections, which probably lead the honourable to member to deal with matters which he would not otherwise discuss. I must ask the honourable member once more not to discuss amendments that are not before the Chair.",43
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have no de-' sire, Mr Chairman, but to deal with the matter fairly, and keep within the scope of your ruling. I shall make only one other remark as to the schedule of amendments that has been circulated by the Attorney General. Two of the proposed new clauses appear to have a, distinct fiscal bearing, although, in my judgment, they should have The no such colouring. For instance, it is provided that goods bearing a label which is anything like a colourable imitation of any Australian label, shaill not be imported from abroad. What is more natural than for a trade organization in Canada- a place within the Empire, and one with which we are seeking to cultivate closer relations-to have a label of its own, which may contain some of the colours that are employed in labels rn Australia.",43
318,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The use of the same colours would not necessarilv make any label a colourable imitation of another.,43
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member will find many instances in which it has been held that trade marks have been infringed., even because of the colours which they contained. In that case, there could be no free intercourse between one part of the Empire and another, so far as the products of labour are concerned. I have now said nearly all that I wished to say, but not with that detail which I anticipated in the light of_ the clear understanding with the Attorney-General, which was arrived at last night. The honourable and learned gentleman has receded from his attitude of last evening. He asserts that since then things have altered in his favour. He declares that he has spiked our guns, turned our flank, and done all sorts of things. Seeing that he is so strong, surely he might, at least, be merciful. However, he is exacting his pound of flesh. I hope that it will do him good, but I do not think that! it will. My experience is that a Minister in charge of a Bill never gains anything by the adoption of the course which is being followed by the Attorney-General. This Chamber is not a law court, as the honourable and learned gentleman will find before this Bill is passed. I suggest that he should' not import into this House the practices of a 'cute police-court lawyer. I do not suggest that he is merely that he is something very much more. Atf the same time, he possesses that 'cuteness which"" would make him an equally good policecourt lawyer, and it is of the .exercise of those qualities in this House that I complain. He has deliberately gone back upon the understanding that he arrived at with me last night, and by so doing has prevented me from discussing this question in detail.",43
320,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," I cannot understand the anxiety of two or three members of the Opposition. They pretend that in connection with this proposal there has been something approaching a conspiracy of silence on the part of honourable members upon this side of the House. Under the circumstances, it is perhaps well td recall the stages through which this measure has passed. Upon the second reading of the Bill, I spoke at some length, and in the course of my remarks I dealt with quite a number of the arguments which the deputy leader of the Opposition has seen fit to reproduce this evening. Since that time what has occurred? The consideration of the Bill was not resumed until yesterday, and the only stage at which it was possible to debate this general question was upon the motion, that the Chairman should leave the chair. Those of us who are not concerned in retarding legislation-wh o are anxious that some work should be performed by the Parliamentwould have been in the highest degree foolish if we had joined in the discussion of the "" stone-walling "" motion which was submitted' yesterday. As members of the Opposition are aware, there will be an Marks Bill. 5 99 r opportunity to discuss the union label provisions of the Bill when the clauses embodying them are reached. When we come fo Part VII . of the measure, the whole policy and the details contained in the proposal for the registration and protection of trade union marks can be discussed upon the first clause. Consequently, it is mere ; pretence of the shallowest character for honourable members opposite to declare that if the present debate had not taken place, they, would have been precluded from considering the general principle involved.",44
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I prefer to take the Attorney-General's opinion on that point.,44
322,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have not-heard the Attorney-General say anything so foolish as that we could not deal with the whole question upon Part VII . of the Bill. The honourable member for Parramatta is too 'cute a politician to induce me to believe that he is not aware that upon clause 73 of the Bill, in its original form, as well as upon the amendments ""outlined by the Attorney-General, there is ample opportunity to discuss every phase of the general question of whether union trade marks should or should not be registered.",44
323,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,It is part of the game.,44
324,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member for Yarra is quite correct. It is part of the game to affect that an attempt is being made to gag the Opposition! and to prevent them from fully and freely expressing their opinions. I suppose that there are some few people in the Commonwealth who will believe them.,44
325,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,What is the object of the motion which is to be submitted tomorrow ?,44
326,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That motion will be discussed tomorrow, and I shall be quite prepared to say a few words in support of it. The honourable member for Parramatta has observed that it is a curious fact that the men at the head of the trade union movement in Australia have not taken any steps to endorse the principle of the union label, or, rather, that ,the political Labour Party have not done so. At the conference that was held .at Ballarat in 1891, which he will no doubt recollect",44
327,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member for Parramatta was not piesent at that gathering.,44
328,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I was underlie impression that he was.,44
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I was never in Ballarat until about a year 'ago.,44
330,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"At any rate, the honourable member was a trade union representative at that time, and he wilL doubtless remember the conference to which I refer At that gathering a proposal in favour of the adoption of the union label was carried. At a conference of the Political Labour Party which was held some three years asp a similar proposition was carried.",45
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Why was it not emistence bodied in the programme of the party? immense advantage.,45
332,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I was under the impression that it was not necessary ro special legislation, because the protection of the State would be extended to the material made up. body which possessed a trade union label, or a trade union mark, equally with the owner of a trade mark as we ordinarily understand the term. It was only recently useless. that I found there was a large volume of opinion as to the improbability, under isting laws, of successful registration, consequent protection, being secured for uniani labels. The deputy leader of the Opposition failed to see the benefit would accrue to any union from the recogwell nition of a trade mark. I do not know that that is the only aspect of the que*tiim that we should regard.",45
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is the main asground pect, I think.",45
334,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Wit h all deference to the honourable member's opinion, [ do not agree with him. We have a right to follow the lines of justice and equity irrespective of who is likely to benefit by our action. But, assuming that the honourable member's contention is correct, I say that, to a trade union whose members are determined to give the public good workmanship, and are at the same time willing to be guided by reason and justice in the exernition cise of the right to use a union label, nothing but good can result. As soon the public have an opportunity to identify the products with which the union is ciated, so soon will they begin to inquire for such goods, in the knowledge that they are made under fair conditions, that they are produced by good workmen, and that they can therefore be safely purchased.",45
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Not necessarily.,45
336,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am not going to make any wild assertions to the effect that every case benefit will accrue to the union. There will be found amongst trade unionunion ists, as amongst other classes of the community, certain men who are inclined to overstep proper bounds, and who will posiment sibly alienate public sympathy in connection with the label with which they are associated. But in the great majority of cases - wher e a reasonable degree of judgment and discretion are exercised as to the conditions and terms of employment-the products put forward by members of unions in conjunction with their employers will meet with public appreciation, and the exof the label cannot fail to be of",45
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable enact member has omitted something which is very important, namely, the quality of the",45
338,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The material may be of the best, and bad workmanship may convert it into something that is absolutely",45
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"A suit of clothes exmay be thoroughly well made in every way, and and. yet the cloth may be poor.",45
340,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"On the other hand, good cloth badly made up may be of little that value. The honourable member knows very that, as a rule, the best men get the best work to do. In fact, there is a kind of natural affinity between the skilled work1 man and high quality goods. I do not my support of the trade union label proposal upon the benefit that is likely to accrue to the unionists concerned. With me it is not a matter, so far as the action of the State is concerned, as to whether individuals or unionists are to receive any particular benefit from the operation of the law. What justification would there be for our passing a Trade Marks Bill at all, if the only object were to benefit those who who registered trade marks? The very existence of a Trade Marks Bill is a recogof the fact that something of the kind is necessary to protect the public as against fraud. The community realise the advantage to be gained by recognising assoproperty in signs, symbols, and brands known as trade marks. My support of the trade union labels is based upon my belief that general benefit must result if the public are enabled to readjly identify goods manufactured by any particular individual,"" whether a® an employer or employee . 1",45
341,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Surely a man who was in inclined to go in for fraud would make a special point of securing the use of a label in order to cover his fraud?,45
342,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I ""do not think that is likelly to happen very often. The attachof a trade mark does not afford any guarantee as to the value of a commodity, but it assists the public to recognise the products of manufacturers who put a fair quality of goods upon the market. That is the theoretic principle underlying the provision for the registration of trade marks. I wish to emphasize the point that it is essential that we should render the same treatment to those members of the community who happen to be trade unionists that we extend to those who are not unionists.",45
343,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,And vice versa.,46
344,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Exactlv . - Mr JOHNSON - I am glad that the honourable member makes that admission.,46
345,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"At present, the man who counterfeits a bank-note is punished. The forger is put in gaol. ' If a man counterfeits a trade mark or label of an individual employer he is properly liable to punishment for pretending to the public that that which he puts on the market is something other than it really is. He is perhaps not liable to be sent to gaol, but is open to be mulcted in heavy damages. Now, those who oppose us on this question advance the extraordinary argument that if a man counterfeit a label belonging to a trade union-somethin g which is in existence as the result of their own s k ill ; something which they have designed, and which"" has become their property by right of user--.no t a finger should be stirred to punish the fraud.",46
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Rubbish .,46
347,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That is what has been said by. Honourable members who claim to be opposing class legislation. That is what honourable members have referred to when they have said: "" We are not a class Legislature. We believe in treating every member of the community in a like manner and putting all on an equal footing."" The honourable member for Parramatta, with his usual ingenuity, attempted to drag a red herring across the trail. He said that I had tried to"" put cobwebs round this particular question. Let us examine the case which he put to honourable members a few minutes ago. He said that a man who painted a picture and sold it to a customer ceased to have any proprietary interest in it ; and that, similarly, if an ordinary trade unionist sold his labour to his employer he would have no further interest tn the product of his work. That is one of those truisms from which no one can dissent. But how can it be held to meet the position which I take up? I did not say that a man should continue to have a proprietary interest in the"" product of his labour after he has been paid for his work. My contention was something quite distinct from that. I said that if workmen, as individuals, or associated in unions, created something apart from their labour by the adoption of a sign, symbol, brand, or special design, they should be protected. At present, the common law permits of the adoption and use of a'design, but so far as I know it affords no remedy against those who may infringe it .",46
348,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I showed that the law in America did afford a remedy in such cases. Mr 'WATSON - That is another point. I contend that the honourable member for Parramatta is deliberately evading the question at issue, when he says that a man having sold his labour has no further interest, or part in it, and, therefore, cannot appear, before the public as the owner, and register a trade mark.",46
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I said nothing of the kind.,46
350,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I took down the words used by ihe honourable member.,46
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I was replying to the honourable member's allegation of fraud.,46
352,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"As to my statement about fraud, I ask any fair-minded person-""which , of course, excludes those who have become so infatuated on this subject that they are incapable of making anything Hke a just estimate-if it would be anything but fraud for a man to issue a label informing the public that his goods were union-made when they were not unionmade.",46
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That would be fraud. Who defends such action?,46
354,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If , in the exercise of my common law rights, I design a label, and arrange with my employer to have it fixed on his goods, is it not fraud for some other person to colorably imitate it, and thus lead the public - to believe that his goods were made by me, when they were not made by me?",46
355,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Certainly .,46
356,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Then why not use the powers of the State to punish the wrongdoer? Why not insure that the person who is guilty of such fraud shall suffer at the hands of the law, just as the person who infringes an ordinary trade mark suffers ?",46
357,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"There is a remedy now against such fraud, if persons care to register their labels.",47
358,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is contended that these are not trade marks, and should not be registered,'and therefore the pirate who infringes them is to be allowed to go scot free.",47
359,Mr ROEINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That does not follow.,47
360,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"is the honourable and learned member, and those who are acting with him, prepared to indicate what steps they would take to punish the wrongdoer?",47
361,Mr ROBINSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,There is a remedy now.,47
362,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If there is now a remedy, why has there been so much outcry against the Bill?",47
363,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Because it legalizes boycotting.,47
364,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member has been such a short time in life, and such a much shorter time in Australia, that he has not that practical' acquaintance with affairs which other honourable members; possess, and consequently frequently amuses us with displays of economic ignorance. If honourable members are prepared to protect the owner of a union trade mark or label, they should indicate how they are prepared to do so. If , as the honourable and learned member for Wannon says, redress for the infringement of such a label is obtainable at present, what is the cause of the agitation against the Bill ? What does the sure propose to do? It proposes to allow the registration of union trade marks. The mere registration is in itself of no advantage. It cannot be that to which objection is taken. But theeffect of regisof tration will be to provide an economical and speedy means of redress against, not the infringement of the right of a union to put goods on the market, or of an employer to put goods on the market, but the use of a colorable imitation of a registered label.",47
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Does the honourable member assert that the trade union label is not used for other than its ostensible Corangamite. purposes ?,47
366,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable memduty ber alludes to the boycotting which has been practised; but he was associated with buy. trade unions long enough to know that is useless to try to persuade the public that trade unions never boycott, without union label, or with it .",47
367,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Employer s also boycott.,47
368,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,;Yes . Some honourable members have seen a copy of the black list circulated amongst the pastoralists of Western Queensland. I have seen black lists circulated in respect to other callings. I do not say that an employer who boycotts is necessarily wrong in doing so.,47
369,Mr WILSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,We say that he is.,47
370,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,""" We,"" in this instance, does not mean a great deal. A boycott is often justifiable. Years ago, as a trade unionist, I joined in one or two boycotts, although there was no union label in existence then.",47
371,Mr WILSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member ought to be :ashamed to make the admission.,47
372,Mr CHANTER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The British Medical Association boycotts.,47
373,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Unde r the circumstances, I take a pride in making the statement. The members of the union to which I belonged.found it necessary fo boycott certain persons who were sweating their employees, and competing unjustly against fair employers. I was not at the time working for any of those affected. I was in a newspaper office, and it was only in jobbing offices that sweating occurred. What other weapon had the members of the union against the sweating and improper employment of children which was then taking place in such offices? There was no mea- Arbitration Court in existence, no wages board, and no legal means of remedving the evils to which I have alluded. The only method of obtaining compliance with a fair standard of living and wages, and seeing that justice was done to fair employers, was to compel those who patronized these establishments to insist orl compliance with fair conditions. In England a vast Anglican Church organization is at the present time engaged in a boycott of goods made by sweated labour.",47
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,More power to them.,47
375,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am replying to the argument of the honourable member for I honour those in the church and in society, who feel it their to inquire as to'the conditions under - which are produced the goods which they The principle of bovcotting is alit ready approved by the good sense of the community, where sufficient reason is shown. a During the last month or two, while the Bill has been laid aside, awaiting the public discussion of the clauses, it has been subjected to a tirade of abuse throughout Australia, because of the motives which are said to underlie these provisions, and because of what has been, saild to be the effect of the union label in America. In the Argus some little time ago appeared a. collection of decisions by some of the State Courts of the United States of America, and at least one letter, and probably a number, appeared over the signature of Mr Walpole, the secretary of the Employers' Federation.",47
376,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The man that marriage is a luxury?,48
377,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,He publicly denied having made that statement.,48
378,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"There are those who are prepared to prove that he made it, and I have repeated it outside.",48
379,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"There is no risk in doing that. One can always tell a lie about a man. - Mr WATSON - In the communications to which I refer, a number of American decisions were quoted in regard to the use of the union label for boycotting. I should like to say, however, that there is no necessary connection between the use of - the union label and boycotting. If unionists are suffering an injustice, and are strong enough, they will use the weapon of the boycott, whether they have the union label or not. That is only human nature,",48
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,IS the honourable member quite sure that boycotting takes place in America only where there is sweatlabel. ing?,48
381,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member evidently wishes me to pretend that the trade unionists of America are akin to an archangel, and' never do anything wrong. We know that every class of the community acts unjustly occasionally. When the coal miners; of Lithgow returned the honorbeen able member to Parliament, they showed strange mental aberration. Such exceptions, however, only prove the general rule. honourable member for Wentworth last night showed his disingenuousness by reading - number of reports from union organizers, - which the trade union label and the need for popularizing it, and the boycotts the American Federationist, were dealt - with. By artfully joining ""together those tions of the reports in which the two jects were referred to, the honourable ber strove to create the idea in the public mind that it was admitted in them that union label is being used as an instrument for boycotting. I defy him, however, to cite d. passage in any of the reports which would justify any such assumption to any fair-minded man.",48
382,Mr KELLY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,We will have a full-dress debate on the subject tomorrow.,48
383,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Since the honourable member's party were dispossessed of the Treasury benches a few months ago, they have been prepared for a full-dress debate on every conceivable occasion, and on everv subject under the sun. who said Mr JOHNSON - Does not the honourable member wish that he was in the same position ?",48
384,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I admit that one has a . certain freedom of action when in Opposition which is rather congenial; but we cannot all live the ideal life. In regard to the statements made by the Employers' Federation, and the articles which have appeared in the Argus, a number of decisions of the States Courts of the United States-tribu nals which are not to be confused with the Federal Courts-were quoted, ostensibly as bearing upon the legality of the trade union label. But, viewing them as a layman, it seems to me that in ..nearly every instance those decisions have nothing whatever lo do with the union label - per se. In nearly every case the question for decision w?s whether or not a municipal council was entitled under the law to insist, as a condition antecedent to the acceptance of certain supplies, that they should bear the union That is-quite a different question from that of whether or not a union label is in itself legal. A union label might be amply justified, and yet it might be illegal for a municipal council to say that it should be applied to all goods supplied for its various services. In these circumstances, it will be recognised that an importance has attached to that aspect of the question a that it does not deserve. An effort has been made to produce in the minds of The casual readers the impression that these decisions against the application of the a union label in the way I have described in affected the validity of the label itself, and consequently vitiated any suggestion for its of legal adoption. The honourable and learned member for Wannon, by way of interjecportion, said a little while ago that, in his subopinion-and as he is a member of the legal memprofession-1 pay ' some'deference to his opinion on points of this kind-no t only the was there a proprietary right in a trade unionlabel existing in common law, quite apart from any specific legislation on the subject, but that a remedy would lie at common law against any infringement of that right. As a layman, I am inclined to believe from what I have read of the law and history of trade marks, that that is quite possible. But, after all, it is only a question of which road should be taken in order to approach a certain goal, and the honourable and learned member may very well consider in that contingency the advisableness of affording those who have designed, or are about to design, trade marks, a speedy and economical means of redress, in the shape of the provision relating to workers' trade marks.",48
385,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Many of those who oppose the principle contend today that there is no such remedy, their view being that workers' trade marks are not trade marks.",49
386,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I was about to say that the contention of many of the opponents of the principle is that no such remedy exists, inasmuch as union labels are not trade marks.",49
387,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"In the absence specific legislation,, great expense might be involved in determining the question.",49
388,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have always believed that, where it is possible for us to do so, if is advisable, in order to cheapen law, to place any 'such' question beyond doubt. It has been suggested to me that the honourable and learned member for Wannon should not object to the Government proposal, because in his view it amounts merely to a codification of the existing law. Mr ' ROBINSON - It goes a good deal further.",49
389,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"We have been, told that a union label cannot be held, in any circumstances, to be a trade mark. We have heard the honourable member for Parramatta express the opinion that unless^ ownership of the goods to which the union label is attached can be proved, that label cannot be a trade mark. I admit that there seems to be a considerable difference of opinion on the part of the legal authorities I have been able to consult.",49
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I confess that have not consulted any.,49
391,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have read a good many of the decisions bearing upon this auestion. I have not been able to find anv decision of the Federal Court; but there seems to be a difference of opinion on the part of the various States Courts of the United States upon the question of whether or not a trade union label is properly a trade mark. Speaking with the diffidence of a layman, it seems to me that the term ""trade mark,"" in its ancient significance, must be held to include any sign, symbol, or brand attached to goods the subject of trade. I fail to see how any mark which is used in trade can be held to be other than a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution. Coming to an objection raised by the honourable member for Parramatta to the Government proposition, I propose to quote a decision given by the State Court of New York in 1888. As I have said, I can find no Federal decision.",49
392,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The reason is that the matter does not come within the Federal law.,49
393,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That is so. Under the Constitution of the United States, the Federal authorities have power to deal only with trade marks as relating to trade with foreign countries, and among the States, That being so, union mark legislation has of been confined to States Legislatures.",49
394,Mr HIGGINS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The decisions of the States Courts are final as to States laws and trade marks laws come within that category.,49
395,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"There being no appeal from the States Courts in regard to this question, we find that the views expressed by them are somewhat conflicting. In part reply to the point taken by the honourable member for Parramatta, I propose to read the decision of the State Court of New York in ' the case of Strasser v. Moonelis (1.888) 23 Jones and S., 197-203, which related to the application of the Oigar-makers' International Union for the protection of their label, Mr Justice Dugro saidThe defendant's counsel, on the argument and in his brief, lays great stress on the fact that the label (of the Cigar-makers' International Union) presented Tff this case does not come within the settled definition of a trade-mark, as he claims it to be. It is needless to discuss this phase of the case, for the right to the exclusive use of thislabel may be sustained, although it fail to be a trade-mark in the precise definition of the term as heretofore used. I That is a phrase which I invite honourable members to consider in conjunction with the history of trade marks.",49
396,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That is to say, in the general acceptation of the term.",49
397,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The learned Judge said that the label might be sustained, although it failed to be a trade mark in ordinary acceptation of the term. is the point. He continued: For whether we call the property right, I believe the plaintiffs have in the label, mark, or by another name, is a matter of import. It is a right entitled to the protection of a court of equity on the same principle upon which courts have based their right to protect trade-marks and goodwill. By reason of the principle governing ordinary trade marks, there is vested in the owner of 'a trade union label a property right which should be protected.",49
398,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,But the Court did not pretend to recognise a union label as a trade mark.,50
399,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It did. It said that it was immaterial whether or not it was described as a trade mark; the same property right governed it that governed an ordinary trade mark. It held that the right of ownership existed, and that, after all, is the important question to be determined. The learned Judge went oh to say thatTt needs no deep study to perceive that the labourer has the same valuable interest in the goodwill of his labour as a manufacturer has the goodwill of his trade.",50
400,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Unde r this. Bill ownerhave property rights nevertheless. ship of a trade mark, on the part of a , union, is impossible. The mark must be but used by an employer. Mir. WATSON - This is a case in point. In this instance the employer affixed the other. label to his goods, but the union itself in owned the label.",50
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable ber is showing how shadowy is. the ownership under this Bill.,50
402,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I do not quite recognise the relevancy of the interjection.,50
403,Mr CONROY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"A union, might not be 1 allowed to use a label.",50
404,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is purely a matter of arrangement. The honourable and learned member is aware that a very large number of trade marks are used by arrangement. For instance, I know of traders in New South Wales-and I suppose that the position in the other States, is the same - wh o do not manufacture, but arrange to have their trade marks affixed by the manufacturers.",50
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"But whatever arrangement may be, ithe mark is transferable or assignable.",50
406,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I do not see that that affects the question of whether a person trusionthe ought to be protected in the use of such a That mark. I propose to make one other quotation, as. it seems to me to be necessary to which place it on record, in view of what has a tradebeen said in opposition to this proposal. slight In the case of Hetterman Bros, and Co. versus Powers dealt with in the State Court as that of Kentucky in 1897, Justice Hazelrigg said: Moreover, it is urged that the plaintiffs do not come into court with clean hands. . . that the label (of the Cigar-makers' International Union) itself cannot be approved either in law or morals as it denounces cigars other than union-made ones as inferior and unwholesome, and the product of filthy tenement houses, or made by coolies and convicts. And first we may admit that the label is not used as a trade-mark in the ordinary sense of that word. Again, the learned Judge uses the term "" in the ordinary sense of that word ""It is not a brand put on the goods of the owner to separate or distinguish them from the goods of others, but we cannot agree on that account that it does not represent a valuable right whichmay be the subject of legal protection. Why may not the-e engaged in skilful employment so designate the result of their labour as to entitle them to the fruits of their skill, where it is admittedly a source of pecuniary profit to them? in And this though they may not own the property itself? They are not, it is true, ""in business"" for themselves in the ordinary sense, but they They may not select a label and be protected in its use apart from its connection with some commodity, they not only select it in this instance-they apply it to the property, and it does not at all matter that the tangible property is that of an. . . The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer that larger sense in which the word "" business"" has come to be used by statesmen and legislamemtors. . . . The learned Chancellor belowt I may say, by the way, that this, was an appeal casein an exhaustive opinion, reviewing all the authorities, among other things said, and we can say it no more clearly:-""Henc e it is indisputable that the employ^, whose skilled labour in the production of a particular commodity creates a demand for the same that secures for him higher remunerative wages, has as definite a property right to the exclusive use of a particular label, sign, symbol, brand, or device adopted by him to distinguish and characterize said commodity as the product of his skilled labour, as the merchant or owner has to the exclusive use of his adopted trade-mark on his goods."" I desire honourable members of the Opposition to specially note fh'e concluding words the of this learned Judge. He said: On the whole case, therefore, we are of opinion that the law may be justly invoked by organized labour to protect from piracy and .inThe honourable member for Parramat'ta objected to my applyingsuch a term to those who might infringe a union trade mark. Here, however, I find the Chief Justice of Kentucky applying it, although at the time. I used it, I had not seen his judgment.",50
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If the honourable member can establish the fact that the are identical, he is quite justified in using that term.",51
408,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The cases are similar in every respect. The Chief Justice of Kensure. tucky saidOn the whole case, therefore, we are of opinion that the law may be justly invoked by organized labour to protect from piracy and intrusion the sent stage. fruits of its skill and handiwork, and that brain and muscle may be the subject of trade law rules as well as tangible property. In those three or four lines the learned Judge has summed up the whole position for which I contend. As a matter of principle we have a right to protect the designer and owner of a union label against fraud or piracy.",51
409,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Is the Chief Justice of Kentucky an elected Judge?,51
410,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"=-I do not know whether he is elected or not. The . CHAIRMAN - I would point out that interruptions and conversations across the table are highly disorderly. I have already drawn attention to that fact, and I again ask honourable members to refrain from interrupting, otherwise I shall be compelled to enforce the Standing' Orders.",51
411,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I might point out to the honourable member for Bland that the case which he has quoted is one of those upon which the opponents of the Bill rely. .,51
412,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Tba t decision was given by an elected Judge. ' Mr WATSON - The honourable member for Lang must recollect that there is no Judge who"" can be relied upon by the other side, who does not occupy his office under similar conditions. Personally, I do not approve of elected Judges. That, however^ is another question. The complaint has been made that not one word has been uttered by members of' the Labour Party in regard to the amendments suggested by the Attorney-General. I should like to remind members of the Opposition that we had not much opportunity of referring, to those amendments. Yesterday, the honourable member for Parramatta and his friends exercised their right of speech to the exclusion practically 6T every other honourable member.",51
413,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member could have spoken if he had wished to do so.,51
414,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The deputy leader of the Opposition and his friends yesterday monopolized the time of the Committee to the exclusion of those who might have been cases disposed to say something upon the amendments, but who were not prepared to participate in a movement which was intended to block the progress of the mea",51

420,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member for Dalley joined with me to apply the "" g a g "" in New South Wales, but he will ' admit that it was never applied unfairly. I do not think that honourable members need entertain the slightest fear-whateve r standing orders may be adopted in the meantime - that they will be denied' a reasonable opportunity to discuss the details of this Bill . As far as I am concerned, I shall be no party to blocking debate.",51
421,Mr LONSDALE,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,We all know what the honourable member will do.,51
422,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member has had no bad experience of me in that connection.' I do not wish to detain the Committee further than to reply to the statement of the honourable member for Par-, ramatta, that our present industrial legislation is sufficient for all practical purposes. He declared that the machinery we have already set up insures that reasonable conditions of labour shall prevail throughout the Commonwealth. T say that his statement argues a very insufficient knowledge of the actual condition of affairs in Australia. Is not the honourable member aware that in several of the States there is no industrial legislation of this character?",51
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,In what States?,52
424,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,In Tasmania Queensland.,52
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,It has been promised in Queensland.,52
426,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The enactment of legislation of that character in Tasmania seems far off, and in South Australia the law is not effective.",52
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It may be made effective, because a labour Government is in power there.",52
428,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,But I would remind the honourable member that in South Australia there is a Legislative Council-jus t as there is in Queensland and Tasmaniawhich has proved strong enough for many years to block legislation which has been approved by the general body of the electors.,52
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I know that the people of the country have just proved that they are behind the South Australian Labour Ministry.,52
430,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member ought to know that the Legislative Council in that State has simply snapped its fingers at the electors. It has shown, in regard to the suffrage proposals of the Government, that it does not care a dump for the opinions of the people. Only two electors out of every seven have a vote for the second Chamber there.",52
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Surely the Labour Ministry will rectify that state of things.,52
432,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"But the honourable member knows what a tedious task it was to effect a change in New South Wales, when the Government of which he was a member attempted to fight the Legislative Council of that State, which is a nominee body, and which is, therefore, more amenable to reason than is an elective body. In reply to his statement, I wish to remark that it is a moot point as to how far Commonwealth legislation may be invoked to settle disturbance's of an industrial character.",52
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Does the honourable member suggest that there is no-constitutional doubt as to the validity of this legislation?,52
434,Mr WATSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If a bad state of affairs exists, I do not think we shall advance very much by submitting to the opinion of those who urge that we can do nothing. If a constitutional doubt exists as to our powers, surely that is an argument why we should endeavour to accomplish something for those who stand in need of our assistance. The condition of things industrially throughout. and Australia requires considerable amendment. I trust that honourable members will not be led away by the suggestion of the deputy leader of the Opposition, that the indus- trial legislation already in force is sufficient to cope with this evil. There is still room for improvement in the social conditions of the people; there is still room for the community to exercise a steady and insistent pressure upon its members concerning their responsibility one to the other. In the interests of simple justice, I trust that this Committee will render those who are associated together in trade unions the same treatment that it is proposed to apply under this Bill to employers and other in1 dividuals, who may register ordinary trade marks. Mr. JOSEPH COOK .(Parramatta) - I should like to appeal to the Attorney General to report progress. I think he will agree that we have had a very informative discussion, and one which will certainly prove helpful to us at a later - stage. I r i ' view of the long sitting that we have had, I think it is only proper that he should report progress.",52
435,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - It is true that' we have had a very long and, what the honourable member has been pleased to call, informative debate. It has certainly informed us upon one point, namely, that'we have been sitting here for thirty hours without having passed a single line of the Bill. I appeal to honourable members to say whether the work that we have accomplished is sufficient to warrant our reporting progress.",52
436,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G, I trust that the Attorney-General will not persist in the attitude which he has assumed towards the deputy leader of the Opposition. The request preferred to him was a most reasonable one.,52
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The Prime Minister today gave me a definite promise that he would adjourn early.,52
438,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,He informed me absolutely to the contrary.,52
439,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"If the Attorney-' General will only look round at the haggard features, and recumbent forms of honourable members, especially those on the Government side of the House, his feelings of humanity should cause him to yield to the representations made in favour of an adjournment of the debate. Honourable members on the Ministerial side cannot much longer stand the heavy strain that is being imposed upon them.",52
440,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is not our fault.,53
441,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It has been brought about by the want of tact and judgment of the Attorney-General in not accepting the very fair offer made by the deputy leader of the Opposition last evening. As the Attorney-General does not seem disposed to consent lo an adjournmentat this stage, I . shall be compelled to proceed with my speech. I have a great amount of mater.ial to draw upon, and shall probably occupy a considerable time. If any evidence were wanting to show how completely the Government are under the control of an irresponsible section of honourable members, it has been afforded by the action of Ministers in bringing forward proposals of this character, which members of the Ministry have expressed themselves hostile to, and which they must know cannot fail to t>e' hurtful to the community. The speech of the leader of the Labour Party, although it occupied a considerable time, and was certainly'informative in some respects, was not convincing. Towards the conclusion, of h:s speech the honourable member referred to made a quotation from a judgment given by a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in Kentuckv. l t is notorious that many of the elected Judges of America are corrupt, and the importance of their decisions must be discounted by the knowledge of that fact.",53
442,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is not a fair statement. The judgment referred to was given by the highest court of appeal in the country.,53
443,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I was not speaking of that particular court. I was referring to the United States Judges generally, who are elected by popular favour- a system wtrch must necessarily lead to corruption, and to practices which would not be countenanced in this community. Therefore, any decisions given by them for or against proposals such as those now before us must lose a large amount of the weight that under ordinary circumstances would attach to them. It is proposed to extend the provisions of the Bill now before us to workers for wages who are in no sense the proprietors of the particular goods produced by their work. It seems to me that this exceeds all reasonable bounds. labour organizations are not trading corporations in any sense of the term. The members work for wages, and the result of their labour becomes the property of their employers. Although an employer may be entitled, to register a trade mark for the purpose of enabling his goods to be distinguished from those manufactured by his trade rivals, the same principle cannot be extended to his employees. If a trade union were to manufacture goods, and trade upon its own account, it would have a legitimate claim to the use of a distinctive label or trade mark, because ownership would be established, together with the accompanying right to secure protection against other manufacturers with whom the - union might be brought into competition - Under existing conditions, however, it cannot be claimed that the employees of any manufacturer have a proprietary interest in the goods produced. The right of ownership might be established to a certain extent if the employees were allowed to share, even to a small extent, in the profits of the enterprise; but so long as they occupy the position of mere employees, they can have no interest in the concern beyond such as may attach to the performance of their work, and the receipt of their wages. The primary purpose of trade marks is.to enable certain goods to be distinguished from others, and to protect the manufacturers against fraud on, the part of their rivals. It must be remembered, however, that a trade mark in no sense affords any guarantee as to quality. The honourable member for Bland supported the trade union label provisions on the ground that if such labels were applied to goods, they would guarantee the public against the purchase of inferior articles. I would point out, however, that a trade mark does not necessarily protect the public in that regard. The person who receives protection from a trade mark is the owner, manufacturer, or seller of the goods to which it applies, but it gives no guarantee of quality. Thus, the union label or trade mark may be applied to goods of the most inferior and shoddiest description._^How, then, can it be claimed that the public will benefit by distinguishing articles* made by union or organized labour from articles made by other labour? If the union trade mark guaranteed the quality of the goods to which it was applied; there might be some reason for agreeing to the provisions of Part VII . , though I do not The say that there would be a justification for doing so. Part VII . , however, is a mockery, a delusion, and a snare, if it is contended that the union label will protect the public, and no one knows it better than does the honourable member for Bland. The real purpose of those provisions is to legalize coercion by means of the boycott, and to prevent the public from exercising freedom of choice in the purchase of goods. They aim, too, at preventing emoloyers from employing those whom they think it to their interest to employ, and at giving the unions power to interfere in the management of the business of manufacturers. We know, from reading, what has occurred in the United States and in Canada in connection with, the use of the union label. Even although its use has not been legalized in those countries, we know to what extent it has been found possible to make it available for purposes of intimidation. The trade and labour journals of America teem with instances in which boycotts have been established, employers harassed .and worried means of the union label. asked to legalize the use of fchese labels. But if they have proved so disastrous to the commercial and industrial life of America, and such an engine of tyranny and oppression where they have not been 1 legalized, is it not reasonable to assume that if legalized they will be used with even greater severity, and with more oppressive results and consequences? In my speech on the second reading of the Bill , I mentioned in detail some of the cases which have occurred in America, and I refer honourable members who wish to refresh their minds on the subject to the official report of it. The leader of the Labour Party told us that the union label is not necessarily connected with boycotting. do not think that any one has claimed that it is. But will he say that it cannot, and will not, be used to make boycotting more effective? As a matter of fact, he practically admitted that it will be so used.",53
444,Mr BAMFORD,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member has discovered another windmill.,54
445,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member wili, in time, get too close to the arms of the windmill, and will be injured by their revolution. The honourable member for Bland contended that a man who is a unionist should receive the same treatment that is given to a non-unionist, and in replv to an interiection had to agree to the converse case. The members of the Opposition have been contending all along that all men have the same rights, and .should be given equal opportunities. The purpose of Part VII . , however, is to give exclusive privileges to a section of the workers. The provisions of this part of the Bill are more far-reaching, and give greater coercive powers to members of unions, than were proposed to be given under the Arbitration Bill. The powers then proposed to be given were refused by honourable members, and an attempt is now being made to get behind the decision then arrived at. The Bill is. a denial of what the honourable member for Bland says should be a principle of legislation,"" namely, that non-unionists and unionists shall be allowed the same rights. I do not intend to deal with the amendments of which notice has been given, because I understand that it is not competent for us to discuss them at this stage. I should like to point out, however, that trade unionists will not be allowed to use the union label. They will have no right of and proprietorship in it. Tliat will be vested by in employers. The use of a trade mark We are implies ownership of it, and the right to assign, sell, or otherwise dispose of it. I submit, however, that a trade union may not deal in that way with a union mark. Mr KING O'MALLEY - A union mark may be sold and purchased.",54
446,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"A trade union might purchase it, but it may not use it . Furthermore, a trade union label can never be properly prescribed as a trade mark unless it can be shown that the goods to which it is attached are owned, prepared, manufactured, or sold solely by the union as ani organization, and that they areas such separate and distinct in essential particulars from other I goods sold elsewhere. Is it claimed that those conditions can possibly apply to a union label under the provisions of this Bill? I submit that they cannot, .and that therefore the very essence of a trade mark is absent from the proposed union label. I hope that even at this late hour, if the Ministry are not absolutely under the thumb of the Labour Party, they will see their way clear to eliminite the union label provisions from the Bill , and that, if they are really anxious to. proceed with them, they will embody them in a separate measure. The deputy leader of the Opposition has shown very clearly that Part VII . of the Bill contains so mamprovisions, apart altogether from the amendments which have been circulated, that it might well be embodied in a separate measure. The honourable member showed that, if that were done, the way would be cleared for the discussion of the' remaining parts of the Bill , and that it would facilitate, the. passing of a, useful workable Trade Marks Bill this session. It is the desire of every honourable member of the Opposition to assist ini the passing of a useful measure of that character, and the prolonged discussion of this measure has been due to the action of the Government in grafting upon it extraneous provisions having no bearing whatever on trade marks in the ordinary acceptation of the term.",54
447,Mr HUME COCJK,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,What is it that the honourable member desires?,55
448,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I sympathize with the honourable member and other honourable members opposite in the position in which they find themselves. I know that many of the supporters of the Government, in other circircumstances, would be as strongly opposed as I am to the union label provisions of the Bill . We know what are the opinions of certain members of the Ministry in regard to proposals of this kind, and I am surprised to find the Vice-President of the Executive Council giving them his support. Under other conditions the honourable member has been heard to inveigh most loudly against such propositions, and we should have some explanation for this sudden volte face. Some influence must have been at work to induce the honourable gentleman to suddenly become a convert to principles which he has time after time denounced in this House. My references to his attitude are made in the most friendly spirit, but I fear that his constituents may not be satisfied w,ith his sudden change of front. In language less graceful, but more forcible, than that employed by him, the Treasurer has also spoken against proposals of this kind. So far we have been left quite in the dark as to the opinions of many honourable members opposite. There has been a conspiracy of silence.",55
449,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Order ! The honourable member must not make that statement.,55
450,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"At any rate, what had all the external appearance of a conspiracy of silence was broken partly by the honourable member for Bland ; but he did not adduce any argument that would appeal to the intelligence of the Opposition, and induce them to change their opinion. Their close study of the question has led to their opposing the provisions of Part VII . The question of whether or nob we have power under the and Constitution to enforce provisions relating to a union label has also to be considered, and in this connection I propose to read a short extract from a well-recognised authority on trade marks. In dealing with the definition of a trade mark, Kerly defines it asA symbol which is applied or attached to goods offered for sale on the market, so as to distinguish them from similar goods, and to identify them with the particular traderNot trade unionsor with his successors as the owners of a particular business as being made, worked upon, imported, selected, certified, or sold by him or them, or what has been properly 'registered under the Acts as the trade mark of a particular trade. It will be seen that this definition of a trade mark cannot possibly be applied to a trade union label. The conditions governing the use of a union mark do not fit in with any of the conditions laid down by this authority as governing the use and application of trade marks. A claim to the proprietorship of a union label cannot be established by a union; there can be no claim that'the ufiion, in using the label, is the owner, manufacturer, or seller of the goods, or is interested in those goods except in respect to the wages which its members earn in their production. Kay, in the case of Richards v. Butcher, laid.it down thatThe essence of a trade mark is that it is some distinctive thing, which points out that the goods are the goods of A. B. That is One of the distinguishing characteristics laid down by Kerly in his definition. We cannot dissociate the question of proprietorship, in so far as the right to trade in certain goods is concerned, from the question of trade marks. The real object of a trade mark is to protect the manufacturer, or the distributor, or the seller of goods. I now propose to make a brief reference to the latest case tried in the United States, in respect of the use of a unionlabel. I allude to the action of Berry v. Donovan, which was decided in Massachusetts in June last. The plaintiff Berry was a non-union shoemaker, who sued Donovan, an officer of the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union, for damages for procuring his discharge from employment by the firm of Hazen B. Goodrich and Company, at Haverhill, because he was not a member of the union.",55
451,Mr MAUGER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Does not the honourable member think that honourable members have made up their minds as to how they intend to vote upon this question?,56
452,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Possibl y they have. Some people make up their minds quite irrespective of considerations of weal or woe to the general comm'unity. propose to discuss the merits of this case. I would merely call attention to the following passage from the judgment of the Chief Justice:The primary right of the plaintiff to have the benefit of his contract, and to remain undisturbed in the performance of it, is universally recognised. The right to dispose of one's labour as he will, and have the benefit of his lawful contracts, is incident to the freedom of the individual, which lies at the foundation of government in all countries that maintain the principles of civil liberty. Such a right can lawfully be interfered with only by one who is acting in the exercise of an equal or superior right, which comes in conflict with the other. An intentional interference with such a right, without lawful justification, is malicious in law, even if it is from good motives, and without express malice. That judgment embodies a sound principle, which should appeal to the reasoning faculties of honourable members-at least of those who possess any reasoning faculties. When they realise that the real purpose of this Bill is to prevent some men obtaining employment in ordter that a monopoly may be conferred upon others, they will express their strongest disapproval of it. I trust that the arguments which I have adduced will furnish honourable members with food for reflection. I hope that they have not made up their minds to adopt a certain course, irrespective of whether it is wise or just, or in the best interests of the country. I am satisfied that members of the Opposition, in resisting the provisions of this Bill, are rendering the best possible service to the country. The measure is one which is calculated to inflict a serious and permanent injurv upon our social, industrial, political, and commercial life.",56
453,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G," The Committee have now been discussing the general question of trade union labels for over eight hours today, and I think it will be admitted that our attention has been very strictly confined to the specific lines to which' the Attornev-General himself recognisedthat the debate upon this clause should be limited. The only difference between the honourable and learned gentleman and some other honourable members was that he suggested either that the consideration of this particular clause should be postponed until after the separate provisions of Part VII . of the Bill had been dealt with, or that it should be debated in conjunction with them.",56
454,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I do not .know whether honourable members who have spoken upon I do not this clause intend to repeat their speeches upon the other provisions of the Bill .,56
455,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The Attorney-General has no right to assume that unnecessary debate will take place.,56
456,Mr MAUGER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"In the light of what has happened, I think that he has.",56
457,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"To-da y a number of very valuable speeches have been delivered, chiefly by honourable members upon this side of the Chamber. The honourable member for Bland made a very interesting address, the delivery of which occupied a longer period than that occupied by any other speech since the adjournment for dinner. The honourable and learned member for Wannon also made a very valuable contribution, to the debate, although his views, may not have accorded with those entertained by some honourable members opposite. Consequently there seems to be not only an error, but an intentional misapprehension of the facts. The Attorney-General earlier in the evening made some reference to thirty hours",56
458,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I should have said thirty-two hours.,56
459,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is not the first time that the honourable gentleman has said one thing when he ought to have said another. His statement is entirely fallacious, and I think that, in view of the speeches which have been delivered since the>clause came under consideration, art adjournment might very well be granted. I think I might fairly ask at what hour the Attorney-General suggests that the debate should be closed.",56
460,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I should like to see some business done. It is not. a question of hours, but of business.",56
461,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I have always understood that to debate important public questions was to transact business.,56
462,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Hear , hear. That is what we have been wanting for the last few hours.",56
463,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The speeches delivered since the House met this afternoon have not been unreasonably long, but have been seriously directed to the consideration of the Bill. The motion, "" That the Chairman do now leave the chair,"" was moved last night as a protest against honourable members being called upon to transact public business for an unreasonable length of time, and against the refusal of the Government to accept the very generous offer made by members of the Opposition. I do not wish to again adopt that course, so long as we are called upon to transact a reasonable amount of business within reasonable hours. It is proposed in a series of clauses now in the Bill, and in a further series of provisions which it is proposed to substitute for some of those now embodied in the measure, to give power to register under a Trade Marks Bill what are to be called union trade marks. I have several objections to urge to these provisions. In the first place, after further consideration, I have still graver doubts than I entertained on a previous occasion as to ..the constitutionality of the union trade mark proposals. Under the Constitution, which regulates and limits the powers of this Parliament, we are authorized-in section 51, sub-section 18 - to legislate with regard to "" copyrights, patents of inventions and designs, and trade marks."" That provision at once raises the question as to what is the meaning of the two words ""trade marks."" I admit at once that we are not to be bound for all time by the meaning of the words "" trade marks "" at the time the Constitution was passed. If that were the case, the Constitution would become an impossible and inelastic instrument, instead of a reasonable and elastic one, as it ought to be. The furthest we can go - and I think that we shall then be going further than the authorities would allow us - is to say that these - words must be interpreted according to the conditions of the time at which they are being applied. That is to say, that in proposing today to pass a Trade Marks Bill, we should interpret these words according to their current meaning. We are not entitled to assume that in the future they will bear'a more extended meaning, nor are we entitled to assign an arbitrary meaning in order to pretend to give ourselves competence to legislate on matters that would otherwise be beyond the scope of our authority. We cannot by calling a thing a trade mark make it a trade mark, and the most elastic and generous standard I can suggest is that we should recognise the present meaning of the words "" trade mark."" With regard to that, we Mr MCCay. have two sets of authorities at our disposal. In the first place, there is the long course of judicialdecisions in the English and Australian Courts upon Acts and common law rules-al l similar, though not necessarily of an identical character. In the second place, we have a considerable series of decisions in various State Courts of the United States, upon what is popularly known as the union label, in which special consideration has been given to the question whether union labels are trade marks according to the common acceptation of the term. First of all, ns regards the current English and Australian decisions, I think I shall have the concurrence of the Attorney-General when I say that in all cases the Judges, many of them eminent men, who have found it necessary to discuss the essential qualities of trade marks, have held that a trade mark implies ownership. In every text-book, both recent and otherwise, that I have had an opportunity to consult, and in every case to which I have had an opportunity to refer, it has been laid down that ownership of the goods, when they reach the point of being available for sale, accompanies the ownership of trade mark. We find that both in the cases decided at common law and upon the statutory provisions in. this respect-eve n in the Bill itself-trad e marks are not to be assignable except in company with the goods to which they are attached, or with the good-will of the business with which they are associated. Trade mark is one of the attributes of ownership that go along with the business or goods. If that be the essential point in a trade mark, surely it cannot be contended that these union trade marks, as they are called, are trade marks within the ordinary legal acceptation of the term-withi n the ordinary interpretation that the words receive at the hands of pur Courts. More than that, I would go so far as to saythat there is no case in the English or Australian Courts which suggests that union trade marks would be judicially determined to be trade marks, as known to the commercial or legal world.",56
464,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Is there any case in the British Dominions dealing with that?,57
465,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Not with union trade marks. I have already pointed that out. I say that in none of the cases in which we have a definition of trade mark occurring is there such a definition as would include union labels. Of course, it is capable of being argued in a Court of Law that that point has not been submitted for specific consideration, and that if it had been, the definition of trade mark might have been extended to include union labejs. But, after all, that is the argument of desperation. When we find continually, not the same words, but varying words, all containing the same idea, we are bound to say that no definition of trade would include union labels. entitled at least to contend that there is no reasonable probability that the definition would be extended to include them. On the other hand„ we have a series of decisions given in American State Courts. The honourable member for Bland read two or three very interesting extracts from reports of those cases, but the extracts which the honourable gentleman read as supporting his view of the propriety of passing this legislation were as cogent an answer to the suggestion that these union labels are trade marks as anything I have heard. They all said that it was not necessary to say that they were trade marks in order to give the legal protection asked for, In a number of cases the Judges have gone further, and have said that they are not trade marks. In some cases the Judges have said that they could not give them the full protection which a trade mark would give. One of the decisions quoted by the honourable member for Bland was to this effect: "" We can protect trade union labels in exactly the same way that we can protect good-will."" I remind the Attorney General in that connection of the fact that, under English and Australian law, a man's trade description may be protected although it is not a trade mark at all. One must not imitate a man's trade description, whether it is a registered trade mark or not, in such a manner as to deceive people into believing they are buying his goods when they are buying the imitator's goods. But that does not make a trade description a trade mark. From the American cases it would appear that, while the counsel for the imitator has argued every time that the trade union label is not a trade mark, ancl therefore cannot be protected, the Court has answered the argument by' saying, ""Although it is not .a trade mark."" still we can protect it . "" Neither the Attorney-General nor those who think with him can find any course of authorities to support their contention that this is a trade mark. It would be far from sufficient to quote a single case, in which a 2 I casual expression might enable one to draw, as a workable conclusion, the inference that it was supposed to be a trade mark, against a whole series of decisions. This is a matter in which, if there be a divergence between English and American decisions, the English decisions, and not the American decisions, will guide our Courts. This is not a matter in which, because of some marks analogy between our Constitution and the We are American Constitution American cases can be used as a guide, as for example in the great series of important cases recently so much quoted before the High Court, and of which the Attorney-General has some professional, as well as some political, knowledge. In this matter the whole current of English decisions will have the same weight in Australia as the current of English decisions upon the construction of wills, or upon Questions of tort-as to which, especially in connection with some branches of the law of negligence, as the Attorney General knows, and some matters connected with the law of trespass, the current of American decisions has set in a different direction from that of English decisions.",57
466,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I agree to a large extent with' the honourable and learned gentleman in that observation; but he will remember that prominence is given to the American decisions by tihosfe who claimthem as authorities against this being a trade mark.,58
467,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member for Bland quoted some of them in support of his view, and I have pointed out that they do not support the honourable gentleman's view. This is a point on which we cannot be guided by a consideration of the English cases.",58
468,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Because the honourable and learned gentleman said that there was no English case in which it had been held.,58
469,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I sav that the English cases by necessary inference exclude this being called a trade mark, because, wherever a trade mark is defined, their definition prevents this, being included within it. 1 challenge the Attorney-General to quote any single authoritative definition of a trade mark, either in the text-books or in cases in English or Australian Courts which would include a union label. Tf the honourable and learned gentleman will name one case, I shall look it up in the library as soon as I have concluded mv remarks. If there were such a case the Attorney-General would let me hear of it quickly enough.",58
470,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I propose to address myself to the question.,59
471,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The Attorney-General might have named one case, and that would not be considered an irrelevant o r ' disorderly interjection. The point of my remarks is that if a union label is not within the competence of the Federal Legislature under sub-section 18 of section 51 as a trade mark, it is not, in the form proposed by the Government!, applying to trade within a State as well as to trade between a State and foreign countries, within the competence of the Federal Legislature either. I think the Attorney-General will admit that.",59
472,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I have admitted that over and over again.,59
473,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"It is clear that the English and Australian cases exclude these labels from the 1905 definition of a trade mark, and even from the definition of 1900. We are, in my opinion, engaged in an unconstitutional task in this matter. We are proposing to make laws which we have not the power to make. I remember that n very similar question arose some eighteen months ago in connection with the proposal to include State servants under the Arbitration Bill .",59
474,Mr FISHER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,And the honourable and learned gentleman was a member of the Government that passed the Bill containing that provision.,59
475,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I voted against it , - spoke against it .",59
476,Mr FISHER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Not as a member of that Cover nment.,59
477,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"No ; I voted against it, Courtsand then supported the whole measure, behave cause I preferred the measure with blemlative ishes to no measure at all. I never guised my attitude with respect to bitration Bill .  learned gentleman threw one Government out over it .",59
478,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I did learned gentleman did not attempt to throw his own Government out over it .,59
479,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"That is so, because I had before then announced that I intended - support the measure, whether that were included in it or not, just as I announced my intention to support it, whether there was, or was not, a certain amendment ber's speech. made in what was known as clause 48. I referred to the amendment proposed in conit nexion! - with the Arbitration Bill as an illustration to show that it is not desirable that this Parliament should pass laws on the chance of their being constitutional. Amongst our deliberate duties as a Federal Parliament is the duty of keeping as far as we can within the bounds, of the Constitution. Especially in the early years of the Federation, whilst State watchfulness of our proceedings is marked, we have a deliberate duty not to transgress the bounds of the Constitution. I do not mean by that to say that we should refrain from passing laws, because they may possibly be beyond the Constitution. We may approach reasonably near to the limits of our powers in a case of genuine doubt, which can only be decided, as the Judge of a State Court said the other day, "" by the man who has the last say,"" and should not hesitate to exercise our power because, after full argument in a Court of Law, our legislation may be held to be unconstitutional. At least, the burden is on those who support the measure, to satisfy us that there is reasonable likelihood of its being held to be constitutional. We have not had that proof; we did .not get it from the Attorney General in his second-reading speech, and I have read twice every word he then uttered. I noticed the singular fact that he practically confined his remarks in this connection to pointing out that there was something somewhere which was something like what is proposed to be done now. But and he did not use any argument which would justify us in supposing that "" trade mark "" will suddenly be found to have a meaning which it has never been given in the English a meaning that it will, require to to bring this proposal within our legispower. The Constitution was framed disintentionally with limited Federal authority, the Arand was so accepted by the people.",59
480,Mr FISHER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable and learned member will admit that the whole power of dealing with trade marks is delegated to the Commonwealth Parliament.,59
481,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"My point is that this is not a trade mark at all. As to the Attorney-General's criticism of speeches on this side, I ask him whether, up to the present, to at any rate, I have not fairly addressed provision myself to the question?",59
482,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I have no complaint whatever to make about the honourable mem,59
483,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,But I also ask whether is fair to compel me at this hour of the night to address myself to these important matters ?,59

504,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have endeavoured to address myself absolutely to the points at issue. I have spoken briefly, but I think I have said sufficient to make clear my views, the without going into detailed argument in I have laid down the general line of my argument in support of the view that this proposal is unconstitutional. The next point-and it is one equto ally pertinent to the question - is say as to the necessity for a union trade mark. In the United States of have America, ' rightly or wrongly - and I am not prepared to say wrongly-the great be majority of the States have adopted union label Acts. The history of the struggle for better conditions on the part of wage-earners in the United States has developed on very different lines, and in very different ways, from the similar movement in Australia. There is nothing more gratifying in the history of the last century or half-century than the rapid, though certainly not too rapid-in deed in some cases too slow-developmen t of the power of the wage-earning classes, and the results that have been attained in the securing of better and fairer conditions. , . When one looks back, even only half a to the condition of the wage-earners then, and compares it with their condition my today, one cannot but recognise that it has improved enormously, largely, though I and will not say entirely, nor almost entirely, the owing to the energetic and well-directed stateefforts of the wage-earners themselves. In their struggle to develop their own opportunities, and secure to themselves the prois per reward of their own efforts, they are deserving of all commendation and suppoint. port. Any man who sets himself up in opposition to all wise efforts in that behalf, sets himself in opposition not only to a tide which will quickly overwhelm him, but to-justice. It does not follow, howthe honever, that every means proposed by those either personally interested, or, as it were, interested from the outside, is the right means. No one would admit more quickly than honourable members who claim to specially represent those who are struggling upward, that sometimes their proposals have effects which are not expected, and that sometimes they find themselves in a blind alley, from which they have to retrace their steps in order to seek another road.",60
505,Mr FISHER,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"All honour, nevertheless, to those who initiated the lines of progress. The road is strewn with sad memorials of the noble men who did so.",61
506,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I admit that in very many cases, which do not redound to the credit of those who were the cause, the men who have been in the van in great and just industrial movements, have personally suffered. I objeGt to honourable members assuming that they, and they alone, have these honourable aims in view,. I remind them that where I differ from them-and I speak only for myself- I in no way differ as to the aim they have to secure equality of opportunity and justice of treatment for all human beings. Where I differ from them is as to whether the methods they propose will produce the desired effect. However wrong honourable members may think my views, that is a positionwhich may be taken up by any man without exposing him to a charge of injustice or unfairness ; his intellectual view may be questioned, but not his heart or sense of justice. The very classes who confessedly have the same object in view have pursued very different methods in dif-. 1 ferent countries. It may be that those differing methods will all conduce .to the desired result, but, on the other hand,, they may not. In the United States of America the movement of the working classes, or those who, perhaps, may be fairly called the wage-earning classes as a whole, has been kept as far as possible from the Courts. The wage-earners have said, "" We desire to, and we can, work out our own salvation!"" They have said very plainly in many cases, "" We do not trust the Courts; we do not trust the purity of the source from which justice is drawn."" I do not say whether such an attitude is correct or incorrect. believe that, as a general rule, Judges selected by. popular votes for short periods are not as likely to be as efficient Judges and as good lawyers as are those who are appointed during'good behaviour by careful selection. I think that the British and Australian system of choosing Judges is incomparably superior to that which has been pursued for many years in many of the United States of America- a method which, as its application has been diminished from year to year, with consequent improvements, has shown the unwisdom of that system as compared with ours. And I should be very sorry to see the principles of democracy so distorted as to be applied to the popular selection of our Judges, however wise it may be-as I admit that it is wise-that those principles should be applied to the selection of ourselves as deliberative legislators. I want to point out the essential difference between the conditions in the United States and the conditions in Australia, in order to show that any argument as to the desirability or the necessity of this legislation in Australia drawn from the United States analogy, is an utterly false argument; and, therefore, I am compelled to show the essential difference in conditions between the two countries. In the United States of America there are no Courts set-. tling hours of labour, rates of wages, and conditions of employment.  laws in some of the States of the Commonwealth.",61
507,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member's intellect is quick, and he sees ahead to the point at which a slow tongue cannot arrive as quickly as his thoughts can. I am coming to that a little'later, but I cannot say what I wish to say all at once. In the United States, I repeat, there are no courts determining hours of labour, rates of pay, and conditions of employment. As a consequence, the allpowerful influence of the State-the organized community - cannot be used for securing by that particular method satisfactory conditions for wage-eamers; and they have adopted, therefore, what they believe will to a large extent achieve the same result by a different method. They have adopted as a method of securing these results the union label, because, they say, "" our unions will lay down in their bargains with employers conditions as to satisfactory hours, satisfactory rates of remuneration, satisfactory conditions of employment. Con.1 sequently, with our union label on the goods that are made by us, the buyer can be assured that he is buying an article which has been' made under satisfactory conditions."" I say at once, as any fair-minded buyer would do, especially one who is not tied clown to thinking whether he can afford to pay another sixpence or another shilling for an article, that one should take that much trouble in the interests of his fellow-creatures. And we do, I think. All of us, so far as we can, do that. The wage-earners of the United States say- I think with a good deal of reason- "" Give us our union label, and it will ""assure the buyer, without his having fo make personal inquiries, that he is getting an article that is being made under satisfactory conditions."" If it stopped there, and there was nothing else to differentiate the American case from the Australian case, it might be acknowledged that a very strong, if not exactly a conclusive argument, might be drawn from the experience of the United States. But as a matter of fact-and I say this deliberately-the union label, besides being used for what we might call quite legitimate purposes in the United States, is used for other purposes which are not as legitimate or as proper. So that the first thing we learn from the United States experience, without considering the conditions prevailing there, without considering the difference between those conditions and the conditions prevailing here, is that while the union label may be j i valuable weapon, it is also a weapon of a dangerous character; and that while we may be able to get useful .lessons and useful experience from the United States laws, we also get warnings.. But those warnings are apparently to be entirely disregarded.",61
508,Mr WILSON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I beg to draw attention to the state of the Committee. [Quortcm formed.],62
509,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"For a number of years - at least, for the' last fourteen or fifteen years, probably longer, but at any rate, for that time-the ' efforts of the wage earners in Australia have been directed towards securing the exercise of the authority of the State directly in reference to wages, hours, and other conditions of labour.",62
510,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The principal opponents of the union label are also the principal opponents of trade union labour., conciliation ancl arbitration, and Factories Acts. If the honourable member reads the report of the conference held in Adelaide he will find that Mr Bostock ancl Mr Walpole were saying, "" Root out conciliation and arbitration root and branch.""",62
511,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I was always a supporter of wages boards in the State Parliament. I must make a divergence for a little while to discuss, the accuracy of the statement of the honourable member for Yarra. He says, if I understand him aright-and he will perhaps correct me if I have misapprehended him-that excepting myself",62
512,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I say that the principal opponents of the union label are the principal opponents of industrial legislation, such as Conciliation ancl Factories Acts.",62
513,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I do not know what the honourable member means by "" the principal opponents.""",62
514,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The Employers' Federation of Australia, for instance.",62
515,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Of course, the farmers do not count?",62
516,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,Do not count with whom ?,62
517,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The Labour Party.,62
518,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is not correct.,62
519,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That is the view that I take.,62
520,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,That does not make the statement any the less a misrepresentation.,62
521,Mr MCCAJV,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,f t does not make it incorrect either. I draw my inference from the facts which I have observed.,62
522,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,It suits the honourable member to do it ; that is all.,62
523,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I also find that frequently people measure others by their own yard sticks.,62
524,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,The honourable member is giving short measure in this instance.,62
525,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The honourable member w i ll find that I am not, before I have finished. The honourable member for Yarra has said that the great majority of those who are opposed to the union label are also opposed to Conciliation and Arbitration Acts, wages boards, and similar industrial legislation. ",62
526,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I venture to differ from the honourable member. As far as I could, in view of the fact that I must not break the thread of my speech, I have run over the names of all the main opponents of the union label in this House, and I find that more than half of those- I think nearly two-thirds-wh o are opposed to the union label were not opposed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and are members whose careers in the States Parliaments prove that they were not opposed to Wages Boards or Factories Acts, or anything of the kind. If the honourable members who have interjected will take the trouble to obtain a copy of Hansard, and look at names of the members on the back page, and if they will tick off those names of members who are known to be opposed to the union label proposals of the Governa ment, they will find that not one-third them were opposed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.",62
527,Mr HUTCHISON,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,This is only one of the Parliaments.,63
528,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The people whom we Board. represent, and we who represent them, are to be regarded rather than persons who may Victoria ? possibly take a less broad and more onesided view than we who have had an opporI tunity of hearing both sides of the queslabel tion. I think the honourable member will admit that reasonable opportunities have been afforded to him and others to hear the other side. I now come to the point which I was diverted by some interjecwages tions, though only to a kindred matter. I Australia, the wage-earning class-and use that phrase as a conveniently brief to indicate all sections of the communityhave set themselves to work to secure direct conditions of labour prescribed. State control of wages and conditions labour, and for two-thirds of their number - Itfe e Court will they have succeeded. In Victoria, we a system of Wages Boards which is very cellent, as far as it goes. I do not think 1 has been extended to cases to which it might reasonably be made applicable. But we have Wages Boards in a large numthe ber of trades-, with very valuable results. Speaking in general terms, each Wages Board prescribes the wages and conditions for all employees in the trade, . unionists and non-unionists alike. In their case, not only would use of a union label by the union whose members form part of the employees in a trade be unnecessary, but it would be lutely misleading. It would be an attempt to tell the public that, while the places in which the union label was exclusively employed were worka ing under fair conditions', by implication the other places were not so working under fair conditions, and it would be stating that which would not be the truth, because under the Wages Boards unionists and non-unionists alike are getting the benefit of their decisions. Take the case of two factories which were producing same article, and working under the decience, sions of a Wages Board. Suppose that one factory unionlabour was employed, and that in the other non-union labour was emthe ployed. If the factory in which union labour was employed, did use the unionlabel, and its goods went out to the world bearing the union label, there would be false inference drawn that the other facof tory, in which the wages, conditions, and hours of employment were exactly the same, was a sweating factory. In other words, the label would be a means of telling lies about the non-unionists working under the Wages ",63
529,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Yes , I am sorry to say. do not think that the use of the union would cure the sweating in the trades in which it is still practised. In New South Wales there is a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which provides in effect that the from Court may determine what are proper and conditions of labour in practin cally any trade whose differences of opinion I are brought before it. Under the Act the one wage-earners in any industry may go to the Court, and have fair wages and Freof quently- I think I might say usually say :that the have wages and conditions of labour shall exapply not merely to the persons, or even it to the members of the organizations making the application, but to all persons employed in the industry, at any rate, within competitive area, because, after all, it has always appeared to me that the competitive area, is the proper test for the application of the common rule. Consequently, in New South W'ales there is a Court which has the power of prethe scribing that, for unionists and non-unionists alike in an industry, certain rates of pay and certain conditions of labour absoshall be observed. Very often the Court has also directed that tp unionists shall' be given preference; sometimes it has not. There we have the fact that, whether it be unionist or a non-unionist, who is employed, he is to get the rates of pay and the conditions of labour prescribed, and the union label going out from a shop or factory where union labour was employed as a suggestion that there, and there alone, were proper wages being paid and proper conditions of work being observed would the be another falsehood. Again, the inferwhich may or may not be true in the in United States-and I have no doubt that in many cases it is not true-woul d be false in New South Wales in exactly the same way. In Western Australia, the application of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to an industry will affect unionists and non-unionists alike, and will, .consequently, eause it to be untrue to suggest by the use of the union label that, while the goods so marked are being produced under proper conditions of labour, the goods not so marked are notbeing produced under exactly the same conditions.  provide for a non-union label ?",63
530,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,What is it to show ?  under humane conditions.,64
531,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"The laws in operation in Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia show that unionists and non-unionists alike are under the same conditions of labour, and are being paid the same rates of wages. Consequently if there is in the United States some reason for the use of the non-union label, there is no such, reason in those three .States in Australia. It is not fair to assume that any honourable member can address himself closely to so important a question at this hour, and expect that reasonable attention will be given to his remarks. If I am given an opportunity to conclude my remarks under ordinary conditions, I shall undertake not to discuss the general question again, but to confine myself strictly to a discussion of each of the clauses to which I am opposed. question of the union label is the biggest question which has been before Parliament this session. It is of greater importance than the fate of a Government. The country will recover more quickly from the effects of a change of Government' than from the institution of the union label. It was referred to shortly during the second reading debate in connection with other matters, and it has been under the consideration of the House in Committee during one sitting. However the Attorney-General is in an obstinate mood, and he will not. say what he is prepared to do.",64
532,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I have moved the omission of two words, and I cannot get that done.",64
533,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"Will the honourable and learned gentleman, agree to report progress as soon as those three words are omitted ?",64
534,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I am not going to submit to any dictation.,64
535,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am not dictating, but asking a civil question.",64
536,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I shall make no such bargain with the honourable and learned member. He must take the responsibility of his own action.,64
537,Mr MCCAY,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,"I am quite prepared to do that. I have made my last appeal to the honourable and learned gentleman, and it was purely a personal appeal I must continue what I had to say. In Queensland there is no Conciliation and Arbitration Act in force, although there is practically a Labour Government, and the Labour Party are in power. Why have they not passed such a measure, if it is necessary in the interests of the wage-earners of that State? It is presumably because they believe that they are able to secure proper wages and conditions without the aid of such legislation' I now pass to a consideration of the condition of affairs in South Australia. Am I to understand that the Attorney-General is willingto report progress ?",64
538,Mr ISAACS,PROPOSED NEW STANDIN G,I intend to ask the Committee to report progress.,64
