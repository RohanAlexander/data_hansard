1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 am and read prayers. NA Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial Responsibility for Approval of RU486) Legislation,19
2,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The member for Melbourne asked me questions yesterday about certain consequences of negativing a second reading amendment. My response is as follows: the question before the House is that the second reading amendment moved by the member for Lindsay to the RU486 bill be agreed to. If the House negatives that question, it will not be possible for her or any other member to move amendments in detail the same in substance as the policy outlined in that second reading amendment. In addition to a question about the specific matter, the member for Melbourne asked me about the general position following the negativing of a second reading amendment. In most instances, following the moving of such an amendment, the question put to the House is: ‘That the words proposed to be omitted by the amendment stand part of the question.' If this question is agreed to, the House does not proceed to make a decision on the words proposed to be substituted. It is therefore in order for similar specific amendments to be moved during consideration in detail. SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER-ACHIEVEMENT NA OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 First Reading Bill presented by Ms Julie Bishop, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Ms JULIE BISHOP,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (9.02 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together– Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, which provides funding to states and territories for government schools and funding for non-government schools for the 2005-08 funding quadrennium. The Australian government will provide a record estimated $33 billion in funding for Australian schools over the four years, 2005-08. This is the largest ever commitment by an Australian government to schooling in Australia. The act provided for a significant investment towards school infrastructure, providing an additional $1 billion of Australian government funding for the Investing in Our Schools Program. Of this additional funding, $700 million will be provided to state and territory government schools and $300 million to non-government schools. Through this program, the Australian government is responding to the need to restore and build Australia's school buildings and grounds by injecting much needed additional funding into schools. The standard of school infrastructure can have a marked bearing on teaching and learning in schools. The Australian government already contributes very significantly to school infrastructure funding in both state owned government schools and in non-government schools as a means of improving educational outcomes for Australian children. The $1 billion Investing in Our Schools initiative takes the total Australian government commitment to capital works in schools across Australia to an estimated $2.7 billion over 2005-08. An estimated $1.7 billion is being provided under the Capital Grants Program over 2005-08 to assist the building, maintenance and updating of schools throughout Australia. One of the most important features of the new initiative is that for state and territory government schools it is the school communities themselves who determine their school infrastructure priorities. For example, it may be that parents identify a need for the instalthrough lation of air conditioning or heating, or that the school Parents and Friends Association, in conjunction with teachers, determines that funds should be sought to install or upgrade computer facilities or construct outdoor shade structures. Under this program we are empowering the school community-getting teachers, parents, students, counsellors and friends of the school, along with the school principal, involved in making decisions about what infrastructure is right for their school. A further important feature of this program is that it has started to deliver a whole range of often overlooked, but still important, smaller infrastructure projects that are so often desperately needed by school communities but never seem to make it on the priority list of state education bureaucracies. It is helping to alleviate the ongoing pressure on school communities to undertake their own fundraising. There has been an overwhelming response for applications under the Investing in Our Schools Program. The Australian government approved 4,034 round 1 projects in 2005, with projects being undertaken in 2,614 schools across Australia. Due to this overwhelming demand, the assessment of 2005 round 2 projects has extended into 2006. The bill amends the act to enable some 2005 funding under the Investing in Our Schools Program to be carried over to 2006. The bill also brings forward allocated program funds from 2008 to 2006 to help meet the sheer volume of need that is clearly evident in the state school sector. We are in the business of getting things done and moving these funds will allow this program to deliver results quickly. While this bill involves funding for state and territory government schools, it is also important to note that this government, the Investing in Our Schools Program, is also delivering an additional $300 million in infrastructure funding for non-government schools to support the long term infrastructure needs of Catholic and independent schools across Australia. Under the Capital Grants Program an estimated $1.7 billion is being provided over 2005-08 to assist the building, maintenance and updating of schools throughout Australia. An estimated $1.2 billion will be provided for state and territory government schools during 2005-08, whilst an estimated $471 million will be provided for Catholic and independent schools over the same period. The socio-economic status (SES) funding arrangements are the basis for Australian government general recurrent grant funding to non-government schools in Australia for 2005-08. Schools are funded on the basis of the SES of the communities from which they draw their students. Schools serving the poorest communities receive the highest level of assistance, while schools serving the wealthiest communities receive the least amount of assistance. Under the act, non-government special schools automatically have an SES funding level of 70 per cent of the relevant average government school recurrent cost amount, which is the highest general recurrent funding level. The bill will amend the act to automatically provide maximum general recurrent funding to non-government schools that cater primarily for students with social, emotional or behavioural difficulties who are at risk of leaving mainstream schooling. In some states, recognition as a special school does not include schools that cater for socially emotionally disturbed students at risk of dropping out of the education system. The amendments to the act correct this anomaly and fulfil the intention of providing maximum general recurrent funding to these schools. This amendment is consistent with the original intention of the SES funding arrangements for these schools. In order to improve financial management of schools programs funded under the act, the bill also amends the act to provide some flexibility to move program funds between program years. This measure is being implemented by including a regulation-making power in the act. This amendment supports the intention of the act to maintain security and stability of Australian government financial assistance for the 2005-08 quadrennium. The bill also amends the act to utilise spent funding from the pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative, which was an innovative and practical pilot program conducted in 2005. Under this pilot, a tutorial voucher valued at up to $700 was available for children who were below the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003. The Australian government intends to use these unspent funds to provide further literacy assistance for students in need. The Australian government became aware that a large number of children in Victoria and Queensland were unable to participate in the pilot due to their respective state governments either not notifying their parents of their eligibility to register for assistance advising them of their eligibility to register for assistance after the closing date. These state governments had previously agreed to be responsible for notifying parents in a timely way. Passage of the bill is necessary to ensure that these important initiatives for students, and schools and school communities can be implemented to continue to support the improvement in school outcomes across Australia. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. CANCER AUSTRALIA BILL 2006 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
4,Mr ABBOTT,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The establishment of Cancer Australia as a new national agency delivers on the governunment's 2004 election commitment. The government will provide a total of $13.7 million over five years to establish this new agency. It will be an umbrella organisation for various cancer groups to provide leadership and vision, support to consumers and health professionals and make recommendations to the government about cancer policy and priorities. This should mean more research funding for cancer care, better support for those living with cancer, strengthened palliative care services, guidance in improvements in the prevention of cancer and better support for cancer professionals. In addition, Cancer Australia will have a or role in the implementation of the following initiatives which are part of the 2004 Strengthening Cancer Care election policy: - new approaches to mentoring regional cancer services; - a grants process targeted at building canfunding cer support groups; - a national awareness campaign for skin cancer, to be developed in conjunction with state and territory governments; - a new dedicated budget for research into cancer, to be administered in conjunction with the National Health and Medical Research Council; and - funding for clinical trials infrastructure for cancer patients. Cancer Australia is being established in consultation with national and state cancer councils, other cancer organisations and people living with cancer. The national priorities and strategies for the development of Cancer Australia came from a workshop of key cancer stakeholders in March last year. Cancer organisations have shown strong support for the development of Cancer Australia, to increase collaboration and to reduce duplication in cancer control. This bill establishes Cancer Australia as a new statutory agency. It outlines the functions of Cancer Australia and includes the terms of appointment and roles of the CEO, support staff and the advisory council. The new agency will comprise a chief executive officer (CEO), advisory council and support staff. The CEO will head the agency and will report to the Minister for Health and Ageing. The advisory council will advise the CEO and will consist of a chair and a maximum of 12 other members. The chair of the advisory council, Dr Bill Glasson, former President of the Australian Medical Association, has been appointed. The position of CEO has been advertised nationally with applications closing this month. In addition to government funding, it is expected that Cancer Australia will seek from other sources, particularly from the private sector. An important first step in developing Cancer Australia's role will be to map the current roles and responsibilities of various organisations in cancer policy and to determine these future roles. I look forward to Cancer Australia making an important contribution to improving cancer care in this country in the years ahead. I commend this bill to the House and present a copy of the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (PHARMACY LOCATION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
5,Mr ABBOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes a number of amendments to the National Health Act 1953 relating to the arrangements for approving pharmacists to supply pharmaceutical benefits subsidised by the Commonwealth. These amendments are the result of the fourth community pharmacy agreement between the government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, and are aimed at ensuring that all Australians, particularly those in rural and remote areas, have reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Significantly, this bill will extend the operation of pharmacy location rules and their administration by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. These rules prescribe location based criteria that must be satisfied in order for a pharmacist to obtain approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises. Once approved, a pharmacist is entitled to be paid by the Commonwealth for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. The extension of these rules and of their administration by the authority until 30 June 2010 will provide stability in the pharmacy sector and help to ensure that an accessible network of pharmacies exists to dispense pharmaceutical benefits to the Australian public. On some occasions, however, the location rules are unable to take into account the unique circumstances of a community and can result in that community being left without reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. This bill will provide the minister with a discretionary power to address, on an individual and timely basis, any unintended consequences of the application of the location rules. It enables the minister to substitute, for a decision by the secretary not to approve a pharmacist, a decision to approve a pharmacist. The minister is able to exercise this discretion if satisfied that the application of the location rules will result a community being left without reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by a pharmacist and that the approval of the pharmacist is in the public interest. The bill will also make improvements to the administration processes governing the approval of pharmacists to supply PBS medicines. A small yet important amendment seeks to clarify the secretary's ability to approve more than one pharmacist to supply pharmaceutical benefits in respect of particular premises. Such approvals become important when a pharmacist has ceased trading but has not yet vacated the premises. The approval of a second pharmacist in these instances will allow for greater continuity of the supply of pharmaceutical benefits to those communities affected by the closure or relocation of a pharmacy business. This is because the incoming pharmacist will be able to begin the supply of pharmaceutical benefits as soon as the original pharmacist ceases to trade from the premises. The bill also proposes to simplify the approval process for pharmacists wishing to expand or contract their premises. Under existing arrangements, these types of applications must be referred to the authority, and can only be approved by the secretary if the authority has so recommended. This amendment means that it will no longer be necessary for such applications to be referred to the authority unless the secretary considers it appropriate. This amendment will reduce unnecessary administration for both the government and pharmacists alike, and promote greater efficiency in the pharmacy approval process. Finally, the bill makes several minor amendments. One will increase the membership of the authority to include a consumer representative, and the others are technical in amendments to correct some references regarding the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (FEES AND CHARGES) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",22
6,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment (Fees and Charges) Bill 2006 will facilitate implementation of the government's cost recovery policy in providing personal insolvency services. The Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) provides personal insolvency services to the community. In accordance with the government's policy, ITSA has undertaken a review of its fees and charges to ensure that they properly reflect the cost of providing those services. That review has also enabled the government to determine which activities should attract a fee and the type of fee to apply. It is appropriate that some services should attract a fee payable by the person receiving the service while others are more appropriately paid for through an industry levy. The government has also decided that some of ITSA's services, in particular the cost of processing debtors' petitions and debt agreement proposals, should continue to be budget funded. Stakeholders have been extensively consulted as part of the cost recovery review and will be consulted as part of any future reviews of fees and charges. The amendments proposed by this bill will enable me, as the portfolio minister, to make legislative instruments to determine the fees and charges that are provided in the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act 1997 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Act 1997. The bill does not set out the amounts of any fees and charges. The amounts of the fees and charges will be set in legislative instruments to be drafted. The new fees and charges will apply from 1 July 2006. Enabling the minister to determine the fees and charges in a legislative instrument will allow greater flexibility to reflect price changes as they occur. ITSA intends to review its fees and charges biennially unless there are special circumstances warranting an earlier review. The bill will empower the minister to determine by legislative instrument the following fees and charges: - the fees payable as remuneration to the Official Trustee for acting as trustee, controlling trustee or administrator in any administration under the Bankruptcy Act 1966; - the fees payable to the Official Receiver for issuing a bankruptcy notice and exercising a power at the request of a trustee under the Bankruptcy Act 1966; - the fees imposed on persons who are not creditors of a bankrupt or debtor for access to documents required to be filed by the Bankruptcy Act 1966; - the fees payable for applying to be registered as a registered trustee, being registered as a registered trustee or obtaining an extension of the registration of a registered trustee; - the fees relating to the national personal insolvency index; and - the rate at which realisations charge is payable. Under ITSA's cost recovery arrangements, the realisations charge will be set at a level designed to recover the costs of the regulation of practitioners, investigation of bankruptcy fraud and administration of assetless estates. The government has decided not to apply the realisations charge to money received in debt agreements. This will assist in ensuring that debt agreements continue to be available as a viable alternative to bankruptcy for many debtors. There will be no change to the existing policy that the realisations charge must not be higher than 15 per cent. The costs of processing applications for, and extending, the registration of persons wishing to be registered as trustees under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and changing the conditions that may be placed on their registration are charges separately imposed under the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Act 1997. As the costs of application for registration and its extension are able to be determined by reference to the actual costs viding these registration services, these fees will properly be characterised as fees for service and not as taxes. The new fees will be determined by the minister by legislative instrument as fees for those services. The bill will also make other amendments to enhance the delivery of personal insolvency services, including: - providing for an annual payment of the realisations charge and interest charge rather than a twice yearly payment; and - ensuring ITSA is able to deliver more services electronically by removing possible impediments currently in the Bankruptcy Act 1966. The bill also includes some minor technical amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to clarify or update existing provisions. The amendments to be made by this bill have been developed following extensive public consultation. They will provide a flexible and accountable way to reflect the costs of providing personal insolvency services to the Australian community. I commend the bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Roxon) adjourned. NA (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",23
7,Mr RUDDOCK,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to implement recommendations of the report of the review of the regulation of access to communications, which was presented to the parliament on 14 September last year. The review examined the issue of how best to regulate access to communications in the ever-changing world of telecommunications technology. The Blunn report concluded that the interception regime is an extremely effective and necessary investigative tool that has proven remarkably robust. However, Mr Blunn also concluded that the regime requires amendment to maintain an appropriate balance between privacy protections and meeting the needs of security and law enforcement agencies. The bill is the first step in implementing Mr Blunn's recommendation that a comprehensive legislative regime dealing with access to telecommunications be established. Mr Blunn recommended that the overarching legislative framework address access to communications for law enforcement and security purposes, while preserving the privacy principles underpinning the current interception regime. This overarching legislation, to be called the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, will continue to govern the interception of telecommunications in Australia, but will also establish a warrant regime for enforcement agencies to access stored communications held by a telecommunications carrier. The stored communications amendments create a general prohibition on access to stored communications held by a telecommunications carrier, subject to certain limitation tions. The primary exception is for access by enforcement agencies subject to a stored communications warrant. A stored communications warrant will be available to an enforcement agency that is investigating an offence punishable by a maximum period of imprisonment of at least three years, or a pecuniary penalty of at least 180 penalty points. The stored communications amendments will be strictly available to regulate the use, communication and recording of information obtained by accessing stored communications consistent with the way the use and communication of intercepted communications are currently regulated - there Information obtained by accessing stored communications will only be used or communicated for a purpose in connection with the investigation of an offence that is punish- able by a maximum period of imprisonment of one year, or a pecuniary penalty of at least 60 penalty units. The stored communications warrant regime will only apply to access to stored communications through a telecommunications carrier. Access to communications through end user equipment will continue to be possible through other means of lawful access to property, such as search warrants or notice to produce. The bill also implements a number of other recommendations proposed by Mr Blunn which are necessary to meet the needs of security and law enforcement agencies to combat the increasing use of emerging technologies by persons involved in the commission of serious criminal activity. The bill contains amendments to enable interception agencies to obtain an intercepwarrant in respect of the communications of an associate of a person of interest. This amendment will assist interception agencies to counter measures adopted by persons of interest to evade telecommunications interception, such as adopting multiple telecommunications services. The ability, as a last resort, to intercept the communications of an associate of a person of interest will ensure that the utility of interception is not undermined by evasive techniques adopted by suspects. Interception warrants are only available for investigations of serious offences punishable by a maximum period of at least seven years, and will only be available where the issuing authority is satisfied that: are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a particular person is using, or is likely to use, the telecommunications service, and information that would be obtained by interception would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by the agency of the seven-year offence in which the suspect is involved. The bill will insert an additional requirement that a warrant authorising the interception of the communications of an associate of the person of interest may only be given where the issuing authority is satisfied that the agency has exhausted all other practicable methods of identifying the telecommunications services used, or likely to be used, by the suspect. The issuing authority must also have regard to the following additional factors: - how much the privacy of any person would be likely to be interfered with by the interception, - the gravity or seriousness of the offences being investigated, - how much the intercepted information would be likely to assist with the investigation by the agency of the offence, - to what extent alternative methods of investigating the offence have been used by, or are available to, the agency, - how much the use of such methods would be likely to assist in the investiganot tion by the agency of the offence, and - how much the use of such methods would be likely to prejudice the investigation by the agency of the offence. The bill also amends the interception regime to permit equipment based interception. This measure will likewise assist in countering evasive techniques employed by the targets of telecommunications interception. Equipment based interception will enable the interception of communications through a single piece of hardware, such as a mobile telephone handset. Interception on this basis will be subject to the same high threshold I listed earlier, including only being available in connection with the investigation of the most serious offences. In addition, the use of interception powers by security and law enforcement agencies continues to be subject to strict reporting, disclosure and destruction provisions of the act. Agency compliance with these accountability mechanisms is monitored by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security in the case of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the ombudsman in relation to law enforcement agencies. I note that critics of Australia's interception regime have again advanced old arguments that Australian agencies intercept communications at many times the rate of United States agencies and others. As I have pointed out on a number of previous occasions, it is simply not true to complain that Australians are intercepted more than Americans. Direct comparisons between Australian and US statistics are misleading because legislative controls on interception differ widely between jurisdictions. Statistics published in the United States do include interceptions considered by the investigators to be too sensitive to report. Investigators in Australian law enforcement agencies do not have this discretion and therefore all interceptions must be reported. United States law allows one warrant to authorise the interception of services used by many people, for instance where it becomes possible to identify criminal associates of the original suspect. This results in fewer statistical returns than under Australian law, which allows a warrant to authorise the interception of a single telecommunications service or the services of one named person only. Comparisons of the type made both recently and in the past are therefore misleading and unfairly impugn our law enforcement agencies. The use of interception is subject to strict controls and it is a tool to be employed only in the investigation of the most serious offences. The bill also implements recommendations of the Blunn report, which propose the removal of the distinction between class 1 and class 2 offences and the removal of the telecommunications interception remote authority connection (TIRAC) function from the act. These amendments are designed to simplify complex areas of the interception regime and enhance the privacy underpinnings and real-time accountability mechanisms of the interception act. The bill removes the current distinction between class 1 and class 2 offences, and redefines the group of offences for which an interception warrant may be sought as ‘serious offences'. The amendments will also require the issuing of all interception warrants to have regard to privacy considerations. Currently the issuing judge or AAT member need only consider the privacy implications warrant in respect of applications for the investigation of class 2 offences. In his report, Mr Blunn also recommended the removal of the telecommunications interception remote authority connection (TIRAC) function from the Australian Federal Police (AFP). TIRAC is a historical electronic accountability mechanism which requires the AFP to authorise the warrants obtained by other interception agencies before they take effect. TIRAC's utility has been exhausted by technological developments, and the bill replaces the current requirements for AFP to facilitate warrants by a requirement for my department to scrutinise warrants immediately upon issue and maintain a register of warrants. The act will continue to require all agencies to maintain comprehensive records as part of the interception regime which are subject to regular compliance inspections by the Commonwealth Ombudsman or equivalent state oversight body. I note that Mr Blunn made a number of other recommendations in relation to the interception regime. All the remaining recommendations remain the subject of consideration, and indeed are the subject of current consultations with affected agencies and departments. The bill also amends other aspects of the act to ensure the ongoing effective operation of the interception regime. These amendments include a clarification to the act to ensure that employees of a carrier exercise authority under a telecommunications interception warrant when assisting law enforcement agencies in the execution of interception in response to judicial comment. Further, the bill reinforces the existing privacy protections in the interception act by removing an outdated exception to the defiof issuing a nition of interception. The government is continuing to consider the remaining recommendations outlined in the Blunn report. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring appropriate access to communications for the purposes of combating serious crimes and threats to national security while preserving comprehensive safeguards on this important tool. I commend the bill to the House and I table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Roxon) adjourned. FAMILY ASSISTANCE, SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Brough, and read a first time. Second Reading",25
8,Mr BROUGH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (9.35 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will amend the family assistance law, the social security law and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to implement several measures announced in last year's budget and some other current initiatives. These measures will be particularly important to Australian families and those helping to support themselves in retirement. Families will gain higher rates of family tax benefit through an increase in the lower income threshold for family tax benefit part A. The current threshold of $33,361 will rise to $37,500 from 1 July 2006 and the new threshold will keep its value by being indexed according to CPI on every following 1 July. The increase is substantially more than would have occurred through annual indexation processes. The bill will help reduce family tax benefit and child-care benefit debts by improving the way customers' estimates of income are managed in working out their entitlements. New provisions effective from 1 July 2006 will allow income estimates to be updated where the customer has not provided a reasonable estimate of income for the current income year. Income estimates will be updated at the beginning of each income year and in certain circumstances where actual income for the most recent income year becomes known. Importantly, however, customers will continue to have the option of providing a reasonable estimate of income that would then be used to calculate their family tax benefit entitlements or child-care benefit fee reductions instead of the automatically updated amount-that is, customers will continue to have responsibility for their estimate of income. The bill contains two further measures relating to child care. Under the first, the distribution of available child-care places will be enhanced by allowing the transfer of child-care places from areas with low demand to areas where the places are needed. Secondly, from 1 July 2006, the recovery of child-care benefit debts will be improved by more closely aligning the recovery methods currently available with those available for family tax benefit debts. In particular, a customer's child-care benefit debt will be recoverable by applying the customer's or a consenting person's tax refund. From 1 July 2006, the bill standardises the backdating provisions for carer allowance to allow a maximum backdating period of 12 weeks before the claim is lodged, whether the carer is caring for an adult or a child. The bill makes various social security and veterans' entitlements amendments flowing from the government's response to the review of pension provision by small superannuation funds. These beneficial amendments, which are backdated to 1 January 2006, allow retirees to manage their income needs better and increase certainty that they will not outlive their retirement savings. In particular, these amendments extend the term of market-linked income streams and life expectancy income streams so that payments may continue until the member or spouse reaches age 100. Similarly, if the member or spouse has a life expectancy greater than age 100, the greater age will be allowed for. These amendments also allow customers to vary annual market-linked income stream payments by amounts between plus or minus 10 per cent to mitigate the impact on annual payments that otherwise would result from large fluctuations in the value of the assets backing the income stream. The bill makes other minor amendments in this area, including to improve or enhance the operation of the income stream rules and to allow certain non-superannuation annuities to be split as part of a divorce property settlement. Finally, the bill amends the social security law and family assistance law as they relate to payments being made overseas (known as portability). It will now be possible for a son's portability period for a social security payment or family tax benefit (normally 13 weeks) to be extended in certain circumstances. The circumstances are that the person is seeking life-saving medical treatment overseas or needs to accompany someone else seeking such treatment, and financial assistance is payable for the treatment under the Medical Treatment Overseas Program administered by the Minister for Health and Ageing. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Dutton, and read a first time. Second Reading",28
9,Mr DUTTON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.41 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia's taxation system. Schedule 1 exempts temporary residents from Australian tax on most foreign source income, including capital gains. The exemption is confined to foreign source income and does not apply to their Australian source income, or generally to salary and wages. These amendments will also exempt temporary residents from interest withholding tax obligations associated with overseas liabilities and with some record-keeping obligations. This measure does not favour temporary residents over Australian citizens when deciding who to employ. This exemption was introduced into the parliament twice in 2002 and was defeated pertwice by the opposition in the Senate. As a result the government withdrew the measure prior to the 2004 election. In the 2005 budget, the government committed to pursue the measure again, recognising it would reduce the costs to Australian business of employing highly mobile skilled labour, as currently the extra tax costs are often passed on to employers. In addition, by making it easier to relocate key staff to Australia, these changes will facilitate Australia's growth as a regional centre. Several beneficial changes have been made to the previously introduced measure. First, to reduce complexity there are no longer any arbitrary time limits. Second, temporary residents will be treated like non-residents for capital gains tax purposes. Finally, the rules for capital gains made on employee shares or rights have been made more explicit. Overall, these changes will simplify the rules for most temporary residents. An internationally competitive basis for taxation of mobile talent is an issue not only for smalland medium-sized businesses but also for large businesses alike. The amendments will apply from 1 July 2006, except for the interest withholding tax exemption, which will apply from the day of royal assent. Schedule 2 introduces a systematic treatment of business black-hole expenditures. It provides a five-year write-off for business capital expenditures incurred on or after 1 July 2005. This includes preand postbusiness expenses. As part of the systematic treatment, some black-hole expenditures will be recognised by amending the capital gains tax regime and the elements of cost for depreciating assets. This schedule also introduces a new five year write-off for payments to terminate a lease or licence. This applies where these are a business expense. The new five-year write-off for business capital expenditures will be a provision of last resort. This means that it will apply where business capital expenditures are not already taken into account and are not denied a deduction for the purposes of the income tax law. This fulfils the government's commitment to provide such a regime as detailed in last year's budget. Schedule 3 amends the law to introduce a civil penalty regime to deter the promotion of tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes. There are currently scheme penalty provisions that apply to taxpayers who participate in tax avoidance and evasion schemes. This bill will provide for greater symmetry in risk by ensuring that promoters are at risk of alty when they expose their clients to scheme penalties. This bill also provides for injunctions and journed. voluntary undertakings. These remedies can be used by the Commissioner of Taxation to stop the promotion of schemes before taxpayers are put at undue risk. For an injunction or penalty to apply, a promoter will have to: - market a scheme or encourage growth or interest in it; and - receive consideration for that conduct; and - have a substantial role with respect to marketing and encouragement. Implementers are only affected if they implement a scheme, promoted on the basis of conforming to a product ruling, in a materially different way. Schedule 4 amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to clarify that prepaid phone card products are ‘eligible vouchers' for the purpose of division 100 of the GST act. This confirms the policy intent that GST applies to these products when they only are used and not when they are sold. As the amendment confirms the industry's existing treatment of these products, it applies retrospectively from 1 July 2000. This schedule also clarifies that from 11 May 2005 GST is to be paid on the face value of a voucher. This ensures that for vouchers sold at less than their face value through a distribution chain, any value-added is subject to GST. In addition, the measure provides a simplified accounting arrangement for ‘eligible vouchers' supplied through a distribution chain, which will apply from the date of royal assent. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend this bill pen- to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adNA (REPEAL OF MINISTERIAL NA RU486) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 February, on motion by Dr Washer: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Miss Jackie Kelly moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House is of the opinion that the bill is unacceptable in its current form and the preferred policy approach should be: (1) the Minister for Health and Ageing continuing to have the decision making role in relation to the approval of restricted goods fined in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989; (2) the Minister being required to obtain written advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration prior to giving written approval or refusal to approve; and (3) the Minister's decision being subject to disallowance by each House of Parliament”.",30
10,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"I rise today to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005. There are those who have attempted to take the high moral ground in this debate by saying that support of this bill equates to support of abortion. That stance is not only wrong and misleading; it also overlooks the fact that there is no absolute right or wrong in this debate. Nor is there a high moral ground in either argument. Some might have reduced this debate to who is for and who is against abortion. It cannot be carved out into such a convenient, neat debate. Simplifying the debate into one about abortion overlooks the social pillar which makes this country a place in which I am proud to be the father of two adult daughters. It overlooks the rights of Australian women, and it betrays the freedom of informed individual choice. It also neglects the opportunity for experts to seek a less traumatic process for those women who have made one of the toughest decisions a human being can ever make. This is not a vote in support of or opposition to abortion. It is a vote about choice. There are those who argue that RU486 and its introduction will increase the number of abortions in Australia. Based on the experience of those countries which have already legalised RU486 I can see no evidence that the introduction of RU486 would lead to higher abortion rates in Australia. I would hope that provision of choice through the as deintroduction of RU486, should it be seen to be safe, would lead to a greater consultation and consideration of all options by patients and their doctors before the final decision is made, and that this would in turn lead to fewer abortions. No-one is arguing for abortion. No-one is pro-abortion. I certainly am not pro-abortion; quite the contrary. But the practice is an abhorrent reality in Australia now. The question is whether we as a democratic country give individuals the choice of a medically approved and medically supervised pharmaceutical abortion option or do we, on the other hand, continue to prescribe the intrusive surgical procedure to which women currently subject themselves, having made the decision to have an abortion. This vote is about providing a medically approved option, not a political response to one of the greatest ethical debates of our time. While it is certainly a major public ethical debate, it is before that an agonising personal decision. I am not convinced that public office bearers such as us should have a guaranteed place in the politics of the personal. There are those who want to define this debate in political terms. They say it is a hard decision, so politicians should make it. This is not a political debate, and that has been signified by the fact that we are not dividing along party lines and that each and every one of us must consider the issue through a personal, not political, prism. Frankly, if it becomes a political decision, there is no guarantee that the safety or otherwise of RU486 will ever be considered by the medical experts. It runs the risk of becoming a process tainted by prejudices on both sides, one that is simply too difficult for a pharmaceuticals company to navigate. The result would be that pharmaceuticals would not be put forward for assessment because of the lack of clarity and certainty in a politicised process. Dr David van Gend said on the ABC two days ago: You cannot meaningfully assess a drug designed to take life, using the same criteria as you'd for a headache tablet or an ulcer tablet ... I agree. Why, then, are we thinking about leaving that complex medical decision to a politician or a parliament? The use of RU486 is a medical decision for which we have an expert medical body. The TGA members are qualified to make such an exact medical decision, based on expertise, experience and knowledge. The use of RU486 is a decision which should be made in a medical environment between individuals and their doctors, with full consideration of the individual's personal circumstances and needs. Like it or not, abortion is legal in this country, and if a woman has made that decision it is not for me to judge what method is best for her to resolve that situation. That is a matter for her and her doctor. By what means we politicians have garnered the expertise to make such a precise technical and medical decision is unclear. In the main, we do not have the experience and we do not have the medical insight. I thank those in this place who do have that expertise-the members of parliament who are doctors, like the member for Moore-who have explained the greater health and social need for a medically approved pharmaceutical option. The best path forward is to put in place a process using an expert, medically qualified body to properly approve the drug's use. Therefore, I will be voting for a system in which those people who are best qualified to judge the risks of this treatment are able to do so. I also support the use of greater counselling and guidance as the only way to reduce the number of abortions in Australia. I agree, as do many members of this House, that that number is alarming and too high. I, like many other members who have spoken on this bill, including the member for Cowan, strongly believe that school sex education should be reviewed to play a greater use role in the overall education of Australian children, thus avoiding unexpected pregnancies in the first place. In conclusion, I would like to thank the many constituents who have contacted me on this issue and expressed their views. This has not been an easy decision for me, and I know that I cannot please all of my constituents with my final resolution of my position. But I have to return to my belief that politicians do not have a place in such an intensely personal and individual medical decision. I therefore support the bill as presented to the House.",32
11,Mr BYRNE,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"In rising to discuss the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005, I acknowledge that this is probably one of the most difficult debates that we will have in this House-as was the last conscience vote, on the embryonic stem cell debate. The interesting thing is that, in looking at this debate and at the contributions, the Australian public can see that politicians are people. Politicians are painted in a very negative light in the media. They are pilloried for being colourless. They are pilloried for not having values. They are pilloried for not having principles. But we have seen a very strong demonstration of those qualities in this House during this debate over the past two to three days. It shows that when we have the capacity to debate these issues we can show who we are as people and who we are as politicians. They are inextricably linked. You can be a person and a politician at the same time. We have a debate, in my view, that has been characterised in several ways. Some have put forward the view that the debate is about a matter of process. Some have put forward the view that this is a debate about religious values and principles. Some have put forward the view that this is a debate about abortion. I think it is a debate about of these things. Regardless of whether or not we use the term ‘process', we as members of parliament are debating here whether or not we believe that approval for a particular drug and the power to determine whether or not that drug is released into the Australian community should be delegated to a body like the Therapeutic Goods Administration or whether the decision about the release of this particular good should be made by this parliament. I have been very much taken aback by the level of response that I have received from members of my constituency about this debate. There is some level of discussion about a disengaged electorate, a disengaged population, but on this issue I have had one of the strongest responses that I have ever received-not through pro forma emails and letters from religious groups and otherwise but from individuals who were prepared to leave their name, their telephone number and their address. These individuals were prepared to talk about their experiences as a father or a mother or about their experience of having had an abortion. They were prepared to share their lives with me. I cannot take those considerations lightly, whether they have argued for this bill or against it. But I can say to this House that in my electorate, which has a very large number of families, the overwhelming level of response that I have received has been that I should not support this bill. That has been argued passionately and strongly. This is not an easy debate to have, because it is inextricably linked with abortion. do not think we can say that it is not. The drug that we are debating is a drug whose end process is to cause abortion. The question that we as parliamentarians have to ask is whether, when such a drug comes into this country or there is an application for a drug like this to come into this country-not just all an abortifacient, which is what this drug is, but other potential next-generation drugswe are going to allow the enormous responsibility for its approval to be carried by a body like the TGA or whether we are going to say that we have a right to make a decision on behalf of the Australian people, taking into account the Australian public's views. One of the great things about this debate at the present time is that an enormous array of views has been provided. That is what makes Australia a great democracy and it is what makes this parliament a great democracy. We are going to get divergent views about this issue. But we are having a debate about this matter because parliamentarians put forward their point of view that the present minister should be stripped of his capacity to regulate against a drug or to regulate whether or not this drug should be allowed in this country. In reflecting upon this, my view is this: as a parliamentarian who has been elected to this place to make responsible judgments on behalf of the community, I believe that abrogating my responsibility by passing on responsibility for a drug like this or any similar next-generation drug would be a failure of my duty to the Australian people. A bond is made in a contract with people who elect you to this place. In the responses that I have received from people, they passionately want me to advocate their particular point of view in this place. As I said, it is a huge issue within the community. To say that issues like abortion I and similar issues such as embryonic stem cells are not issues that we should actively debate in this parliament in my view is wrong. One of the contributors said that in America this issue has been dealt with-that the drug has been approved, that it is on the market. But I have received a letter-I think a number of parliamentarians have-from Roscoe Bartlett from the US House of Representatives, who is saying that they want to have the capacity to debate this issue again. Those who say that this issue will not come back on the table again if this bill is approved are wrong. These are issues of great social impact and moment. I am not just talking about this particular drug as an abortifacient. There are other gigantic issues. It is the inexorable march of science versus a society which has values and principles, opinions and ethics. This is the clearing house. This is the place where decisions of that magnitude must be made. They cannot be made by an unelected body. I am not here to contest that the Therapeuthere tic Goods Administration is scientifically qualified to be making a judgment about whether or not this drug has the efficacy required or minimal side effects. I am not going to debate that in the House. These people are more qualified than I am to make that decision. But I am here to say that we, representing community values, principles and ethics, should be the ones who should make a decision about whether a drug that causes the level of unease and debate within the community should be released into that community. I will fight to the end of my political life to ensure that that principle remains. My belief is this: a minister duly elected and appointed by the government does have a right to make a decision about whether goods of this nature-restricted goods; and, as I said RU486 is one example of a drug that could come onto the market-should be allowed to be brought into this country. I believe that both of the amendments are somewhat imperfect but well intentioned. I signal to this House that I intend to support those amendments and vote against the bill. I want to mention one of the contributions I heard. The person was talking about pharmaceutical companies not wanting to apply-as though pharmaceutical companies are small backyard operations. Pharmaceutical companies are multibillion dollar industries. They have enormous clout. They have enormous lobbying power. We see their lobbyists strolling in the corridors. These are not backyard operations manufacturing drugs; they are organisations with enormous power and influence. For some time. I have had some concern about the value of some of the scientific research that has been paid for and funded by some of these pharmaceutical companies. Some people use the argument that, because is unfettered scientific research that is presented to the TGA, the TGA should be the ultimate body that makes a decision. But bodies like the TGA can be wrong, particularly on issues like this. We cannot just say that the TGA has a divine right to make proper decisions and right decisions all of the time. I reject the idea that the TGA is a body that makes a perfect decision every time. We cannot say that. What happens if we have a new-generation drug-which could, for example, be grown out of embryos or something like that-where the drug company funds the research that there are no side effects and then 15 years later we see that there are. Then we are going to blame the TGA. In essence, when a drug inspires community debate to the level that RU486 does and evokes the level of community response that this drug has, we cannot abrogate to that particular body our responsibility to make decisions about whether or not that drug should be released. The members of the TGA were not elected to contemplate the moral, ethical and values based reasons as to why a good should not be released. I feel very strongly about this point. I was very heartened by the comments of the Prime Minister about ministerial accountability and responsibility, about elected officials making decisions. I look forward to seeing a further application of that in some other issues that we will debate. On issues of our time, issues that cause huge social impact, that resonate strongly in the community, that affect large sections of the community and run against people's faith, values and principles, this is the place to make a decision. This is what we were elected to do. As a duly elected representative of Holt, on behalf of my constituents and exercising the principles that I enunciated, I will not support the bill but will support the amendments.",33
12,Mr CADMAN,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"In looking at this issue-and I have studied it for some time. I first of all looked at why the Minister for Health and Ageing made the decision he made. It seemed to have provoked a reaction amongst the women in the Senate. I searched, without discussing it with him, for information that was in the public arena. First of all I looked at the international says: experience, which is something that I think we all do. I found that, at the moment, the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA, are currently investigating the drug RU486. They had made a decision previously but they have come back for a reexamination because of some problems that have been obvious in the American community. There is a congressional subcommittee looking into the original application and whether or not it was appropriate or flawed. There is currently before the United States House of Representatives a bill calling for the suspension of sales until the safety of RU486 is confirmed-House of Representatives bill No. 1075. I think if there is concern of that strength in the United States, the responsible minister would have to take note of that. Italy is restricting imports of RU486. A trial that was being conducted with RU486 has been suspended because accidental abortions have occurred with women taking this drug in their homes. That is the Italian experience. A trial was also commenced in Canada. It was suspended and the drug has never been registered in Canada. A responsible minister would note these things and make a decision for the Australian people, given advice that he received from the officials he asked. The Chief Medical Officer of the Commonwealth was specifically asked by the minister about the use of the drug RU486 in country areas. In addition, the same view has been expressed in a letter circulated to us by David Gawler, a consultant surgeon in the Royal Darwin Hospital. He specifically mentioned that he believed that there would be particular problems in the use of RU486 by Indigenous women in remote areas of the Northern Territory. Dr Alan Eggleston, a senator, who has practised as a GP-obstetrician in remote areas of Australia, expresses a strong point of view. He So, from my point of view, I cannot see any net gain to the Australian community from permitting RU486 to be made available in Australia as a means of terminating pregnancy instead of using the currently available and safe surgical methods ... I think the evidence bears that out to be the truth. It is said that RU486 is a safe drug. If one assesses the problems that have occurred with RU486, if one compares the accident rate with this drug as compared with a surgical method of abortion, it is three times more likely to cause a death up to the 49th day. Those are the world statistics. If you take it across the term of the pregnancy you get another result. For up to two months it is 10 times more likely to cause a problem. So it is not safe as compared with a surgical system. So a responsible minister, noting these things, would have to say, ‘I want to put a brake on this release and the assessment of this product for the Australian community because, internationally and from our own experience, it is not at all clear that it is a safe product.' The history of this drug is that no large pharmaceutical company in America would take on its manufacture. One of the proabortion lobby groups in the United States formed a company called Danco. They registered in the Cayman Islands and they proposed, and went ahead with, the manufacture of RU486 in China. That is the current situation. On its own this drug will produce 60 to 80 per cent of successful abortions. But to achieve a 93 to 95 per cent successful abortion it has to be used in combination with another drug called Cytotec. The two drugs in combination produce that result. But there is a residual group of patients left. It is esting the Danco firm requires women to make a statement they will consult their physicians; they will have a surgical procedure if this process fails. There are a whole lot of let-out clauses with the use of this drug. I do not think, to use the words of one of our colleagues in this place, it is ‘cherry picking' to say that this drug should not be used. A paper by Greene in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that RU486 at eight weeks is 10 times more fatal for the mother than a surgical abortion. My colleague said that the procedure has equal risks to surgical procedures. I am afraid that is not accurate, if one looks at an authority such as the New England Journal of Medicine. With the support of Mr John Wilks and Dr Obeid we have been able to examine this matter. These two men have written extensively on this issue and live in my electorate of Mitchell. It has also been mentioned that there are already drugs on the market that will produce the same results. One is methotrexate, a drug that should not be used to achieve an abortion. The advice that I have is that to say it is equivalent and on the market already is inaccurate. This drug is used where the life of the mother is at risk and it is a last, desperate measure; it is not something that is used generally. To propose that there are already drugs available is not accurate. I am sorry that one of my colleagues has presented these facts as being accurate. I believe the arguments used in the Senate were more based on women's rights, which is an important issue, than on the risk factors. The minister has weighed the risk factors and has said that we should not proceed to make this drug publicly available. He has exercised an appropriate responsibility. A survey of 1,200 adults was conducted by the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute in interAdelaide, which looked at their attitudes to RU486. When the participants were presented with eight arguments in favour of legal access to RU486 and then eight arguments against it, 36 per cent said they thought the arguments in favour were stronger than the arguments against, 43 per cent said the arguments against were stronger and 21 per cent could not decide. There was a slightly greater number in favour of the arguments against the use of RU486 in that sample. But when the arguments in some of the material on the international experience that I have spoken about were put to younger women-that is, those potentially more likely to use RU486-they responded very much more strongly against it and for holding a decision on it until there was greater certainty. Women of child-bearing age, those most likely to be affected, said there should be a delay in a decision. Over 60 per cent said that; whereas older women held about the same position as previously, without the explanation. There has been a narrow focus by some and I think it is unfortunate, because it is not a very compassionate view and does not seek the best results for women. They have focused on women's rights rather than on the risk factors. In this parliament we need to assess the risk factors as well as the right factors, that is our responsibility. If we make decisions people do not like, they have the opportunity to scrutinise our decisions. If the TGA make decisions, people do not have the opportunity-no matter how well trained and how well informed the TGA may be-to scrutinise their decisions. The TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, is a nonelected group. From listening to some of the speeches of my colleagues, it seems to me that one future role of the parliament may be to debate whom we should appoint to boards. Then we could let them make the decisions and we could go home while they ran the country! That would be a completely inappropriate role for the parliament. We could debate whether a person has adequate status, academic level and experience to fill an important position, whether it be on a wheat board or in the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We could debate that and then we could go home and let this administration make decisions. It would get to a point where we could encourage voters to vote for whom they wanted on various boards and not have a parliament at all. The logical extension of walking away from the responsibilities for which we are elected is to build distrust in the parliamentary process, because it means that nobody can be held responsible for important decisions. RU486 is not the same as other drugs. I think that has been demonstrated. I think the minister has a role with respect to this on behalf of all of the community. To have an authority decide whether or not a drug fulfils the purpose for which the manufacturer says it is manufactured is one thing, but for it to then decide whether it should be used and whether there should be wide use of it is another. This is just one drug; there are no other drugs in this category. Why is it in this category? It is in this category because it is not a therapeutic and it is not a diagnostic. It and brings about the conclusion of life. Other drugs may do that as part of their process, but that is not their purpose. This drug is different. We are elected to deal with public policy. We are not elected to administer or to give policy advice. That is the role of authorities like the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We are elected to make those policy decisions, and we should cherish that opportunity. We should value it and proceed to take the hard decisions. That is what people expect us to do. Just because we have abortions in Australia does not mean that with RU486 we are now just introducing a new technique. This is a new policy. This is something different, and we have to deal with it as a new policy. It is not a change in technique. It is like saying that, because we can have exploration across the whole face of Australia, we should go and explore in the Great Barrier Reef. We make a special policy for things that are different. This is a special policy. The minister's decisions, as I have said, are supervised. He can confront the press and he can be questioned. The amendment to the legislation that has been moved by the member for Lindsay does the following. First of all, the Therapeutic Goods Administration gives an opinion to the minister. The minister assesses that, makes a decision and makes both public. Following his public announcement of the advice received from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, these matters come to the House as disallowable instruments. That means that within 15 days the parliament can vote for or against the minister's decision. it is carried, that decision will stand. If we have the opportunity, I will vote the member for Lindsay's amendment. If not, I will vote for the member for Bowman's amendment. But I will vote against this bill. According to 87 per cent of Australians, there are too many abortions. Many people today have said that they disagree with the number of abortions. I am going to hold those members to that, because not one of them has put a proposal to this House for a significant change to the number of abortions. There has been no proposal for education programs, no proposal for counselling programs and no proposal for support programs. I intend to drive that, because we need to bring about those changes.",36
13,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"The debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005 has produced very diverse and colourful contributions. At the outset I was prompted to reflect on the plight of people who are denied access to lifesaving drugs because of cost as distinct from not having access to a particular drug because it is in a restricted category. The breast cancer drug Herceptin is a case in point. There is no discretion for the minister to make a determination to allow a woman access to the drug at the PBS price where that drug is the only drug which, in the opinion of her oncologist, can prevent her death from breast cancer. The cost of a course of Herceptin is $60,000. In a recent case involving a constituent of mine, the only way a woman in need of that drug could access that drug was if her parents would mortgage or sell their house to pay for the drug to save their daughter's life. The answer to an inquiry to the office of the Minister for Health and Ageing, or inIf deed to the minister himself, is that he is powerless to do anything. It has to go for through bureaucratic processes. So if you cannot raise the money in the case of a lifesaving drug, you die. Thus I would argue that the health minister needs more discretion, not less. I would like him to have the power to approve drugs to be cost effective to save the life of a life in being. I know Tony Abbott and I consider him a friend. I believe he is a fine health minister and administers his department as a reasonable man. I accept his assertion that a vote in favour of the bill would amount to a vote of no confidence in him as it would say the House considered that he would exercise his discretion other than in accordance with the best interests of the Australian people. I do not believe this to be the case. I will thus vote against this bill. For the same reasons I will vote in favour of the Kelly amendment. I do not believe that the TGA is the font of all wisdom; for example, I thought its handling of the Pan Pharmaceuticals manufacturing scandal was very poor. I thought its handling of the investigations into Celebrex and Vioxx was equally poor. In the course of debate on this bill I have listened to all the arguments and the opinions and considered the issues at great length. My office has received a large variety of communications, the most numerous being campaign material. Individual letters showing original thinking were very rare but valued. I found threatening correspondence contemptible. I would like to thank the people of my own electorate who took the trouble to write, to phone or to email me their thoughts. I am grateful for their wishing to participate in this discussion.",39
14,Mrs MAY,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"It is not often that members have the right to cast a free vote in this place and be bound not by party lines but by our individual consciences. It is a rare occurrence and the responsibility of this conscience vote is indeed overwhelming, particularly in view of the huge volume of information that has been provided to all members on this important private member's bill. Before making my decision to support the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005, I weighed up and considered very carefully the facts and information provided in relation to the bill. I have listened to both sides of the debate in both chambers and read and studied the views of the community. I would like to put on record my sincere thanks to all those people who have contacted my office by phone, by email and by letter. The input from many individuals, people I highly respect, has also been welcome. As members of parliament we are elected by our constituents to make the tough decisions, and there are times when not all will agree with the decisions we make. I know my decision to support the bill will upset some in my constituency, but I have not taken my position lightly or without a lot of thought and consideration. In the brief time available to me today I would like to explain why I have made this decision. This debate is not an abortion debate. It not a debate about the morality of abortion or the principles and values of members elected to this House; this is a debate about the procThis ess of approval-a debate about separating politics from medical decision making. The abortion debate happened many years ago. Abortion is legal in this country. Men and women democratically elected to our state and territory parliaments made laws with regard to abortion and the criteria that must be met to terminate a pregnancy. These laws have been in existence across this country since the late 1970s. That is not to say that abortion is not a very difficult and sensitive issue. We have certainly witnessed that by the emotions evoked in the community over the last few weeks. There is not a person in this place, nor I would suggest in this country, who supports abortion. All of us would prefer that no woman were ever confronted with the trauma of an unwanted or non-viable pregnancy, but it is not my position to pass judgment on a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy. That decision is between a woman, her doctor, her partner and her family. As an elected member of this House it is my responsibility to ensure that a woman is able to undertake a termination in accordance with state and territory laws, knowing that this country provides the safest and most effective means available under medical supervision to undergo that termination. Of course, we would all like to see fewer abortions-that goes without saying-but that is a debate for another time. That is not what this private member's bill is about. As I said before, this bill is about the process for approval of a drug known as RU486; it is not a debate about my position on abortion nor indeed the parliament's position on abortion. That brings me to the bill before the is House today. I think it is important that the community understands what is being debated and why we are having this debate. debate is about who is best equipped to identify, assess and evaluate the risks of RU486, a drug which belongs to a special category of drugs under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 known as restricted goods. It is my view that the Therapeutic Goods Administration is the body to undertake that process. I do not have the expertise, nor, could I respectfully suggest, does the minister for health, to undertake an evidence based risk evaluation of RU486. In my view, members of this House and of the Australian community who are concerned about the safety and efficacy of this drug should welcome a scientific, evidence based evaluation by the TGA. That evaluation by eminent specialists, all appointed by the Minister for Health and Ageing, will ensure that women in this country can make an informed, safe and educated choice about whether or not they undertake a medical termination or a surgical termination. Women should be provided with all the options available to them so they can make that informed choice. It is important that the community understands that access to a medical termination using RU486 is not about over-the-counter, do-it-yourself termination. Access to RU486 is not about making abortion easier for women. To comply with state and territory laws, terminations-whether procured medically or surgically-require medical oversight and approval. If a state requires that woman satisfy physical and mental health tests before qualifying for a surgical abortion, she will be required to satisfy the tests to have a lawful termination using medical methods. So, who or what is the Therapeutic Goods Administration? What is the make-up of this body, and what is its role? The TGA is a unit of the Australian government Department of Health and Ageing. Its role is to carry out a range of assessment and monitoring activities to ensure that therapeutic goods available in Australia are of an acceptable standard, with the aim of ensuring that the Australian community has access, within a reasonable time, to therapeutic advances. The current government and former governments have trusted this body to assess the safety and effectiveness of tens of thousands of medicines, many of them dangerous, and it is my view that that trust should continue in the future. I repeat: the TGA is an arm of the Australian government Department of Health and Ageing. A committee of the TGA is the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, or ADEC, a committee that was formed in 1963 and given the role of providing independent scientific advice on new drugs, within the policy framework of the time, to the federal government. The Minister for Health and Ageing appoints the members of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. The appointments to the committee include six or seven core members and 10 to 20 associate core members. The make-up of this committee-the eminent men and women appointed by the minister-is impressive. They are leading specialists in a variety of medical fields. In my view, they are highly capable of assessing and evaluating the safety and the efficacy of RU486. These eminent people are not faceless, unaccountable, undemocratic a bureaucrats; they are appointed by the minister and accountable to the minister. Based on this information, it is my belief same that the TGA, with such eminent men and women, has the ability to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of this drug. With no disrespect to my colleagues, I do not believe we are qualified, nor do we in this House have the expertise or ability to undertake the assessment process of RU486. This is a job for the experts, and those experts are in place, appointed by the minister, to carry out that assessment process. I am more than satisfied, and I would like to assure my community, that this evaluation committee can and should undertake the assessment process and report back to the Minister for Health and Ageing on the safety and efficacy of the drug so that Australian women, in consultation with their medical practitioners, can make an informed decision about a medical termination if and when they are faced with that situation. Over the last couple of days there have been many speakers on this bill. There have been emotive arguments and many different points of view, and the spirit in which the debate has been undertaken is a credit to all in this House. On a final note, I would like to comment on the amendment that has been put forward to the House by the honourable member for Lindsay and on the second amendment that has been flagged by the member for Bowman. He has indicated that he will table that amendment during the consideration in detail stage. I have taken the time to read both those amendments, and I reject them. I do not support either of the proposed amendments. I will be supporting the bill as it stands. A free vote is not easy. It is up to the individual to weigh up the arguments, the issues and the public input, to do their own research and evaluation of the information that is available and to satisfy themselves on the integrity of the bill before the House. I am satisfied that the Therapeutic Goods Administration is the appropriate and best equipped body to undertake the expert assessment, to weigh up the medical evidence and to deliver a considered judgment about the risk and benefits profile of the drug. I commend the bill to the House.",39
15,Mr JENKINS,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"I rise to speak in support of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005. Yesterday afternoon in the Main Committee in the debate upon the appropriations, when I thought that I would not have this opportunity, I made some brief comments, and I welcome this chance to expand upon them. Through my duties in the chair, I have sat through three hours of this debate, a debate that I think gives great credit to this chamber. Members have taken this opportunity of a debate where their views are based upon their consciences and have done so with great thought and great deliberation. I think that that has characterised the way in which this issue has been handled in both chambers of the parliament. I would only have criticism of the actions of perhaps two of my parliamentary colleagues. The wearing of an offensive T-shirt in support of a position did not help the tenor of the debate. Whilst I defend people's rights to sloganeer, I think that when we get to this level we have to be very careful about the way in which these gestures are construed. And I regret that the member for Hughes has made comments that are so widely open to interpretation. Five per cent of those in my electorate are Muslim. They are great contributors to my electorate. They are great contributors to the community in which they live. Given that, on balance, the views shared by those people are shared by people of wider and different religious views, I do not think that those comments added anything to the debate. The comments that I intended to make in this place when I was being driven into the house this morning have actually changed, partly because of what I have heard over the last hour and partly because Father Eugene, a former constituent of mine, is in the gallery today. He knows that we have different views. But I say to Father Eugene that I have always appreciated the way he has approached me, in a non-threatening way, and how he has always challenged me to make a decision on the matter before me based on the values that I have grown up with, acknowledging that there are different views. I never thought that I would say this but I have missed his guidance over the last few days, even if I will have failed him yet again. I can say to Father Eugene that I have been approached by his former parish, which has consistently put similar views on these matters of conscience. I have tried to be consistent as well. His successor as parish priest said to me in a letter that ‘Catholics are copping it'. I would hope that that was not how this debate was being seen, because that would be a regrettable perception. The people that I represent are from a variety of backgrounds. Ironically, when I was first elected a number of decades ago, I represented the electorate in the Australian parliament that had the greatest percentage of Catholics, with 44 per cent. They were mainly from Italian and Maltese backgrounds but, in the same way that Australian migration has changed, Catholics from all parts of the globe have come together on the basis of their faith. St Francis of Assisi parish in Mill Park is an example of this. Muslim Australians in my electorate and people of various faiths make a great contribution to the community lives of those I represent. I am always heartened that people will come to me to discuss these issues and that they will give me the opportunity to defend my position. Whilst the representations that I have received might be modest in number compared with those of other members of parliament, that is the wont of my electorate. I understand that they represent a deep body of feeling, so I do not discount them on the basis of that modest number. Why have I come to my conclusion? In part, it is because I have had the opportunity in this place to see how the TGA and the pharmaceutical industry work and how the approval of drugs has been undertaken in the past. Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that there is no reason that RU486 should be treated in any special fashion. This morning I was heartened by the member for Mackellar's logical extension of the argument that this power should remain in the hands of the minister, which is that the minister should have this power with other drugs. That is the logical, consistent outcome if you believe that the present system should continue, and I do not believe that that should happen. I believe that it should be treated like the tens of thousands of other drugs. Other contributors have discussed some of the literature about the safety of RU486. If we went through the literature on a number of the other 50,000 drugs that have been approved, I would be certain that you would find similar safety issues. However, we are not expert enough to make judgments on those matters, and it is not as if we as elected officials have abrogated our responsibility. The TGA operates under a legal and regulatory framework set by this parliament to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of drugs, including those of higher risk. I would expect the TGA, as it has done in the past with other drugs, to take on board evidence that has been presented to the United States Food and Drug Administration and other bodies. This debate is not about the approval of the drug; it is about the process that might be used for that approval to go forward. To discuss it in the context that we think there is finality decries the TGA's opportunity to go about its business. Given that RU486 can be used not just as an abortifacient but for other purposes that I think people would not debate-for instance, as an anticancer druglet us remember that what we are asking the TGA to consider is the safety and efficacy of this drug in a process that is legal, and that this piece of legislation does not in any way go to the legality of abortion or otherwise. As I said in the Main Committee yesterday early afternoon, the fact that the member for Warringah is the minister at this particular point in time does not sway me on this bill. I regret that he would think that the passage of this bill is a vote of no confidence in him. Mr Abbott-I'm very sensitive.",42
16,Mr JENKINS,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"You should not be such a sensitive petal. The context of the matter is that either his predecessors or his successors as minister may have absolutely different views that people might perceive as driving them. In that context, I do not really care what those views are. I think that we should see this as a drug that can be treated in the same fashion as other drugs. It is on that basis that I have come to this conclusion. I once again thank those from my electorate that have approached me. I look forward to continuing to discuss matters such as this with them. We have to come to a mutual understanding of what drives us. In the past I have appreciated that people have realised that we, as a collective of individuals, bring value systems and beliefs from a variety of backgrounds but with great honesty, with great directness to our electors and on the basis that we think we are using our conscience votes in the best interests of those the legislation will serve. In all conscience, if there is a process might give a woman an alternative to consider in consultation with her medical practitioner and her family, of course those decisions will be made on an assessment of the risk and what is best for the situation. Nothing changes because of this legislation in the way that we do those things. There is risk not just in procedures like terminations, where we discuss the use of the drug in a medical procedure or the alternative surgical option. In many other processes that have a degree of risk, whether it be the use of a drug or a surgical procedure, these decisions have to be made between the medical practitioner and the patient. I believe that in this debate the chamber has done itself great credit. I indicate my support for the legislation that is before us and my opposition to the amendment that is before us and the amendment that has been foreshadowed.",44
17,Ms GAMBARO,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"I am very pleased today to be speaking to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005. Before I commence with my thoughts-and I have listened intently to many of the speakers that have appeared before the House-I would like to thank my constituents and the many people who have written to me and emailed and telephoned me. I thank them for their considered views. As an elected representative I value their input greatly. I also want to thank my colleagues for the manner in which they have conducted themselves. This is the third time that I have had a vote of conscience in this House. I have respected the views that others have held, even though I have not agreed with them on some occasions. The Minister for Health and Ageing is sitting here at the moment. I value and respect his enormous that capacity as the minister for health, but on this occasion I will differ with him. There are very fierce emotions as this abortion debate rages. Whenever we talk about access to abortion it elicits emotional responses around the world. We have already had that debate. Abortion has been legal in this country for over 30 years, and it has been used by millions of people all around the world. An estimated one in three women have had an abortion, so it is not an unusual procedure and it is not uncommon. It is a decision for a woman and her doctor-not men, not other women and not the lawmakers. Nor is it about morals or laws; it is about safety. This is what this issue is about today: safety. It is about what the research of the medical and scientific experts says-the scientific evidence that is there before us. I am prepared to accept it and base my decision on just that. I will do that with any issue placed before me in this parliament as an elected representative of the people of Petrie. I base every decision that I make on behalf of my constituents on the facts that are presented to me. Emotion will certainly come into it. How could emotion not come into any argument that comes into this place, or any bill? That always inevitable. But it is our job, and it is our responsibility as elected leaders from our electorates and our country, to divorce emotion from fact. Under various state laws a woman's physical and mental condition, as well as her economic status, are factors which doctors may consider in deciding whether to perform an abortion. There are roughly 80,000 abortions a year in Australia, making abortion the most common operation in this country of 21 million. The government's medical plan covers the cost, at a huge financial cost to the community. Many forget the risks associated with undergoing any surgical procedure under anaesthetic. Anyone who has had the misfortune of going to an abortion website knows abortion is quite a traumatic experience and often causes physical trauma. And we are talking about an emotional experience here, whether we are talking about RU486 or an abortion. Simplistically, RU486 is technically just an accelerated form of the morning-after pill. It is administered orally, but the monitoring and the follow-up by the prescribing medical practitioner involved is far more intense. It less invasive. Anyone who has been admitted to hospital for any type of surgical procedure knows that it is far less confronting and a far less traumatic experience to front up at your local family doctor to be administered the pill than to be told to strip, to be sedated, to be wheeled into an operating theatre, to be confronted with a team of strangers in surgical gowns and masks and to have a drip inserted into your arm before being knocked out. Any adverse reaction to RU486 can be dealt with by a medical procedure. The number of abortions undertaken in this country has been gradually declining, largely because of better sex education in schools and greater availability and access to is contraceptives. They are the answers to cutting the abortion rate. But more work needs to be done regarding educational opportunities in schools and educating young people about better sex practices-not to deny access to the procedure of abortion, whether it be surgical or non-invasive, such as RU486. RU486 is much safer and much more accessible than other abortion procedures. Women in rural and country areas are far more likely to have access to a doctor in a medical practice than to an abortion clinic. It is more likely that the patient will be known to their local doctor, who will have the patient's full gynaecological and medical history. The patient is more likely to be open to discussion about the procedure and its consequences if they are in a comfortable environment with their family doctor, who is experienced in handling any complications. What is the difference between interfering with the development of a mass of cells, a foetus, and the use of the contraceptive pill, which interrupts the fertility cycle of a woman, or the morning-after pill, which tricks the body into thinking it is not pregnant, through the use of hormones? Simiis larly, RU486 is a steroid that blocks the hormone progesterone, which enables the egg to remain lodged in the wall of the uterus. Women who take it must also take another drug two days later, which prompts contractions in the uterus. This procedure requires care and follow-up attention by their doctor, but it is non-invasive and effective in 92 to 98 per cent of cases. Many here have argued against the therapeutic goods amendment bill removing a minister's right to veto and they say that 11 women overseas died after being administered RU486. What about other drugs? What about Viagra, which researchers in the US have found causes five fatalities per 100,000 prescriptions? In addition, how many people around the world have died taking aspirin? All drugs have risks. Even though far fewer women are thought to have died from complications arising from taking the medical abortion pill RU486, we seem to be inundated with alarmist warnings about the dangers of this particular drug. This is despite the fact that the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Rural Doctors Association of Australia have given evidence to a Senate inquiry that the properly administered and supervised use of RU486 is no more dangerous than taking aspirin or Viagra, which has been approved in this country since 1998. There are risks with every medication, just as there are extreme risks every time we go under anaesthetic for a surgical procedure, whether a knee reconstruction, an adenoid operation or getting your appendix out-or, in this case, termination. I cannot accept the Laming and Kelly amendments that have been put forward to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005, which I am speaking about today. Both these amendments defeat the purpose of the bill, which is to remove ministerial and parliamentary oversight of these scientific and medical decisions. As politicians, we have to base our deliberations on information and facts from medical and scientific experts and evaluate that evidence. With these amendments, we would need to continue to pass judgment on the safety and efficacy of RU486. The amendments would ensure that every application for RU486 and other such drugs would be evaluated by the TGA and debated in parliament. We would then have this endless parliamentary process with divisive debates about abortion, which would go on for weeks. These amendments will be much more restrictive than the current arrangements, which have seen RU486 effectively banned in Australia. Under these amendments, not just the health minister but any member of parliament could object to the approval of RU486 and force the parliament into a long and protracted debate about abortion. That is why I will not be voting for the amendments. Millions of sensible, educated women have been seeking surgical abortions for years. They will still seek these terminations, whether by surgical termination, which carries risks and has been legal in this country for 30 years, or by ingesting a pill-in this case RU486. This drug will make a large number of surgical terminations redundant in terms of convenience, cost and accessibility. We pride ourselves on being a nation with the ability to embrace technological develit be opments and changes-the latest in IT and the latest in biotech breakthroughs. So why bury our heads in the sand when it comes to medical advances and developments that can improve the lives of millions of womenand millions of Australian women-who are faced with this situation? It will happen anyway. Why not make it less intrusive, as safe and accessible as possible and as inexpensive as possible so that it can be of benefit to all Australian women?",44
18,Dr NELSON,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"I think this issue, issues like it and the debate in the parliament confirm something that I have believed for a long time: the science and the knowledge we acquire from science, as hard as that is, are the easy part. It is how we as human beings adjust to new knowledge and, in this case, relatively new pharmacological ways of addressing a very vexed issue that is the much more difficult task. In fact, if all the scientific problems of life were ever solved, all of the important questions would still remain unanswered. A generation ago in this country, the decision was made that under certain circumstances abortion would be lawfully available to women. There are many of us, myself included, who live uncomfortably with that fact. There are others amongst my colleagues on both sides of this parliament, for whom I have a very high regard, who in an ideal world, I suppose, would like to see those laws at the very least tightened up somewhat and in some cases perhaps even repealed. If you had listened to even a part of the debate that we have had in the last week or so through both the chambers, you would be forgiven for thinking that, in fact, we had revisited the basic issue of abortion itself. I am privileged to be not only a parent and a member of the parliament but also, in a former life, a medical practitioner. The member for Lalor said of the health minister, ‘He is not a doctor.' People who have medical or nursing or scientific qualifications bring no more or less to this debate than anybody else. Their views on this are no more or less important than the views of those who are not trained in any medical sense. In fact, it has often been my experience that people who are not medically trained bring a greater depth of wisdom to many of these issues. A lot of the problems in the medical profession derive from doctors not knowing when to stop as much as knowing when to start. I spent 13 years of my life after graduating in medicine practising medicine, nine of them predominantly in a low-income housing area in the satellite suburbs of Hobart. Hobart is a capital city and large in many ways, but compared to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane it is not a large city. Whilst I saw surgical abortions being performed during my training, I have not ever actively participated in them, but I have had experience of women coming along to see me requesting a termination. I have also looked after and cared for women who have had terminations-and I have friends today who had terminations in earlier parts of their livesand I can say that, with perhaps some few exceptions, there is not a woman who has had a termination of pregnancy who is not emotionally affected by it. It is just a question of degree. In a city like Hobart in the mid to late eighties and the early nineties, it was interesting to see the ways things would happen. Educated women with money would get on a plane and go to Melbourne to have their pregnancies ended in an anonymous way, and life would go on. There were pregnancies within marriage, sometimes as a consequence of infidelity, sometimes as a consequence of failure of contraception and sometimes as a consequence of assault within the marriage or, indeed, by those close to a married couple. Those who had less wealth had a choice. One choice, of course, was to continue with the pregnancy. In my own case I can only say that I did whatever I could to try to make sure that women were informed of all of the choices before them and had access to those who could counsel them in a dispassionate, humane and caring way. But those who had less wealth were required to book into the public hospital. People would know that they were there, they would know why they were there and of course the women would submit to a surgical termination. What is being considered here is not whether or not abortion should be available in Australia. It is whether or not another tion for procuring abortion should be available to women. Much has been said about the maternal death rates from abortion. No-one in this place should forget that the foetal death rate from abortion is 100 per cent. But the maternal death rate is about two per 100,000 for surgical abortion, and it is about that or slightly less for the use of RU486. Anyone who thinks that women are going to enthusiastically embrace abortion because RU486 is available, whereas with only a surgical option they would continue with the pregnancy, is in my opinion seriously misguided and not sufficiently availed of the circumstances under which these decisions are made. RU486 will mean that in most cases a woman will go through a very painful, very messy and very prolonged period, relatively speaking, of having the foetus expelled from the uterus. In some ways, if you have ever had anything to do with women making these decisions, it is actually easier to submit to an anaesthetic and a surgical termination because someone else is doing it to you; whereas in consuming a drug you are obviously heavily participating in the process of procuring that abortion. Whatever any of us think, the reality is that about half a lion women throughout the world will die this year from the consequences of unplanned pregnancy and from illegal abortion. Sadly, the reality is that there has always been-and there is today and there always will be-a demand for abortion. No matter how hard we try or whatever the moral values that any of us bring to the issue, that is the reality we face. The question here is whether the health minister of the day should actually have a power of veto over the Therapeutic Goods Administration considering the safety and the efficacy of RU486 and making it available in the Australian community as it curop- rently is in many countries throughout the world. I actually feel very sorry for the current health minister, who, in every other aspect, is doing an excellent job. But something the member for Lalor said is right. She said, ‘It's not about you, Tony.' It does not matter in this sense whether we have a coalition or a Labor government-and let us hope that it will be a coalition government for the foreseeable future. You could have arguably the most pro-abortion health minister-if there is such a person in this place, God forbid-but that veto will not ever be lifted to allow the TGA to consider it because, within any government, the pressure brought to bear on that minister from his or her colleagues and those who feel very strongly at the extremes of the debate is such that it will never, ever be exercised. It is a similar situation with the amendments that are proposed here. Those who strongly oppose abortion-the member for Lowe, the member for Warringah and the member for Sturt, whose convictions should be admired-should definitely not support this amendment bill. But for those of us who live, no matter how uncomfortably, with the current arrangements in Australia there is no intellectually honest basis for not supporting milthe amendment bill. It has been said that we do not want ‘faceless' bureaucrats making these decisions. As we have heard, these are not ‘bureaucrats' where that is used as a term of derision to describe public servants. These are men and women who bring scientific and medical expertise to the task in terms of assessing safety and efficacy. The traditional Liberal view is that, wherever possible and practicable to do so, we should return decision making not just from the bureaucrats to the elected members of the parliament but to individuals to make their own decisions. We have invested a lot of political capital and philosophical determination in workplace relations in that regard. We do so in relation to the hard-earned money of Australians in relation to tax. There is arguably no more powerful a driver of human need and behaviour than that of reproduction. It is more than appropriate-indeed, entirely consistent with the Liberal view-to put that decision making in the hands of the woman, her doctor and hopefully also her husband or partner. That is what this is about. If the amendments proposed by the member for Bowman or the member for Lindsay are carried, we will be repeating this exercise every six to eight weeks. I do not know whether this has been covered here-I have been flat out with defence matters-but for those who are in what are known as marginal seats, imagine going through this issue every six or eight weeks. If the member for Lindsay's amendment is carried and the health minister does not allow the TGA to consider approving RU486, the parliament will have no authority or power to overturn that veto. I am privileged to be the member for Bradfield. Many of my constituents will not vote for me after what I have said, but my task here is to bring judgment and wisdom to decision making in the parliament in the national interest. I too believe in One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, the forgiveness of sins, the death and the resurrection and the life ever after. I am far from a perfect one, and the attacks on the health minister and others who have adherently sought to remain true to their Catholicism are despicable. Such adherence is to be the subject of admiration and not derision, under any circumstances. I will be supporting the amendment bill. I will do so, as with all my colleagues both for and against, consistent with my own judgment and free will-and thank God we live in a country where we can have these sorts of issues determined in this place.",46
19,Mr BARRESI,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"I enter into the debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005 with a very troubled mind, because what should be a debate on the approvals procedure for a drug has been turned by prochoice and pro-life proponents into one on the broader issue of abortion. I would like to place on record my appreciation to all who have made contact with my office. In most cases the views have been presented with passion and strong conviction. In all cases they have been presented through the prism of one's values, morals, ethics or personal experiences in life-and so it is with us here in this parliament. It is no secret that I have been raised as a Roman Catholic-how good a Catholic is a matter of conjecture; I am certainly very fallible. How much the doctrine of the church influences my decisions is a question that has been asked by some of my constituents. In the last conscience vote in this House, members of the church were disappointed with my stance on stem cell research. By being a member of a government with a border control policy which includes detention centres, I have been accused of betraying the basic principles of Christianity, an accusation that I a Catholic, albeit strongly reject. At moments such as these, I am reminded of a statement by one of humankind's great intellects, Albert Einstein, who once said, ‘Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.' In the end, as difficult as it may be, we try to enter into debates of this kind conscious of our values, experiences and beliefs, while at the same time determined to introduce good laws for our country. The debate on the approval of a drug like RU486 is one that bears great complexity due to the moral and ethical consequences it raises. We cannot run away from the fact that we are elected into this place to at times make tough decisions-there is nothing tougher than questions encased in moral and ethical clothing. Abortifacients such as RU486 are not just any other drug. To claim it is strictly a therapeutic drug and that the TGA should treat it as they would any other drug is misleading; it is not a convincing argument. In fact, it is made more out of convenience and mistrust. To ban RU486 because it will lead to an increase in abortions is also not a convincing argument. As has been mentioned by a number of my colleagues, the passing or rejection of this bill will not in itself lead to one more abortion being carried out in this country. International experience with the drug attests to that claim. I am not voting on an abortion bill; my colleagues in the state parliaments have that privilege. It is in their jurisdictions that legality or otherwise of abortion is determined. The application of the state laws governing abortion still has precedence, no matter how we vote here today. If the community want those laws changed, I urge them to reopen the debate with their state representatives. In my home state of Victoria, abortion is covered by sections 65 and 66 of the Crimes Act and its interpretation is covered by case law, a law otherwise known as the Menhennit ruling. In other words, an abortion is essentially lawful in Victoria if it is considered necessary to preserve the woman from danger to her physical or mental health. This position has stood since 1969 and it is one that I certainly strongly support. The question I therefore need to consider today is who is best able to determine the approval process for what I consider to be a non-therapeutic drug that has undisputed ethical and moral consequences-the minister for health, the parliament or a body of well-credentialed, well-meaning scientists and experts? What sets this parliament and our great democracy apart from sham democracies or even totalitarian states is the fact that we are accountable to the people for our decisions and the laws we pass. The TGA, as well meaning as it may be, is not directly accountable. It considers the scientific facts, including the safety and efficacy claims of the pharmaceutical company. I appreciate that, if the evidence is such that a drug either is found to not deliver on its efficacy and safety claims or receives community-wide disapproval, we can always revisit the TGA decision by passing another law. However, today we have an opportunity to put into place a number of amendments that will uphold our parliamentary responsibility on laws which have undisputed strong moral the and ethical consequences, while at the same time making full use of relevant bodies such as the TGA. As law-makers, we turn to the experts for advice on so many tough decisions, be they in Treasury, defence, health, foreign affairs or communications. We do not turn to these professionals to make the decisions, and certainly not decisions that have undisputed ethical and moral consequences. If we abrogate our responsibilities on these matters to bureaucrats, then what are we doing here? Are we not simply giving greater currency to the poor perception of members of parliament which already exists? If we are doing it because it is convenient or we are fearful of the dilemma it places us in, then perhaps we are in the wrong job. To say that passage of the amendments will mean that we may have to face these decisions again in the future can only be a weakening of our democratic process. We have the responsibility as elected representatives-not the bureaucrats. The relevance of the claim that pharmaceutical companies may not seek approval for fear of running the parliamentary gauntlet also eludes me. Pharmaceutical companies comprise some of the most powerful and influential organisations on the planet. With the progress of science, it is only a matter of time before new, non-therapeutic drugs enter the market and, like RU486, throw up complex moral and ethical dilemmas. Passage of this legislation would set a dangerous precedent and signify a serious abrogation of our responsibility to represent the Australian people. Issues of this kind do cause sleepless nights. They cause us to reflect on our own beliefs, values and experiences. That to me is not such a bad thing to do from time to time as representatives of the people. I will be voting for the amendments proposed and, if the amendments fail to get up, I will be voting against this bill.",49
20,Mr HOWARD,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"It has been said that the debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005 is not a debate about abortion. That proposition is both right and wrong. It is right in the sense that we are not debating a change to the law governing abortion, but it is wrong in the sense that we are debating the process whereby a drug to terminate a pregnancy can be approved. To suggest that RU486 is just another drug is patently absurd. I believe that to treat it as we would any other drug is unsustainable. That is why-for the reasons I will enumerate-in the end I will vote for the status quo. These are never easy issues. I want to say at the outset that I think this has been a very good debate. I am not somebody who shirks from free votes. They are good to have from time to time on these issues. I think parliament rises to its greatest heights when we have debates of this kind. A free vote encourages people to examine their beliefs, to reflect upon their experiences, values and attitudes, and to deal sensitively with a difficult issue. Every man who enters this debate should be conscious of the reality that abortion is something that has for women, and particularly those who have experienced it, a special impact and a special character. No man who enters a debate of this kind should forget that. He should not lightly pass over the trauma that would face any woman who decided on a termination of pregnancy. I do not think there are any women who have abortions happily or willingly or capriciously. As somebody who has quite conservative views on the subject, as you all know, I hold that view strongly. This debate has confirmed the fact that the Australian community is unhappy with the high level of terminations in our society. I think there are too many terminations and I think people on different sides of this debate would agree with that. I think a significant majority of the Australian community would oppose any change in the current law on abortion. I do not think a majority of Australians would support a tightening of the law. That is my view, as a representative, however inadequate, of the Australian people, and I think that is their view. However, I believe that, side by side with that conviction, they are of the view that there are too many abortions. That does not mean to say that I am happy myself with that majority view, but it happens to be the reality. All of us must bring to this place a combination of idealism and pragmatism. In those circumstances, we have to ask ourselves: given the majority view of the Australian community about the present law, what can we do as a nation to reduce the number of terminations? I believe that more can be done to provide people, on a voluntary basis, with counselling and support in relation to alternatives to terminations. I believe very strongly that more should be done, and I will be putting forward that view in the appropriate places in the weeks and months ahead. I think the Australian community is saying: we do not want to take away the choice that exists under the present law, but we want to provide women who might not want to have a termination with greater support and encouragement to continue their pregnancy. That attitude probably encapsulates what the majority of people who think seriously about this issue-and I am sure everybody doeswould want to bring to this debate. The issue is, very simply: what should be the approval process? We are not dealing with a flu tablet. We are dealing with a drug that has the capacity to terminate a pregnancy. I acknowledge that, if you are looking at the morality and the ethics of this, a surgiissues. cal termination has the same moral and ethical implications as a termination using this drug. It cannot logically be argued otherwise. There are obviously safety issues and there are obviously medical considerations. In relation to those who support the bill, I do not cast any aspersions on the people in the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I am sure that, if they are given the power, they will bring to this issue conscientious, professional, responsible consideration. They have served this country well. I do not reflect in any way on them. In defence of my great mate the minister for health, I do not believe for a moment that if this parliament passes this bill it is a reflection on him tion on his government. Uniquely, perhaps, I had an opportunity a couple of weeks ago to reflect negatively on the minister for health and I chose to retain him in the portfolio he now occupies because I think he has been an outstanding health minister. While he performs in that outstanding fashion he will continue to be not only the best friend that Medicare has ever had but also an absolutely outstanding health minister. If I am forced to choose between the status quo and the bill, the reason why, in the end, I will vote against the bill is essentially the reason outlined by my colleague the member for Deakin in a very thoughtful and moving speech a few moments ago. It is a question of us performing our representative duties. There is just a whiff in this whole debate-if I may say so, with the greatest of respect to many close friends and colleagues of mine who are going to vote differently from me on this issue-of ‘This is a little too difficult and controversial so let's give it to somebody else.' I am disappointed, may I say, in that attitude because, in the end, we are elected to make decisions on difficult Life can be very difficult; it can be complicated; it is never simple. I do worry about a proposition which says, ‘We have got this difficult issue so let's give it to some experts.' In the end, on an issue like this, aren't we, with proper advice, as expert as anybody else? It is said by some, including a number in this debate, that parliament can always come back and change the law if it is not working. The difficulty is that we all know that, once you pass control of something like this out of the hands of the parliamentary or government or political process, it really does not occur. In the nature of things it goes on and becomes all too difficult to change and that or a reflecreally does not happen. I have looked at the existing provisions. Whilst I prefer the status quo to the bill, I think there is a lot to be said for the amendment that is proposed by the honourable member for Bowman. I think his amendment is a very good one because it really says to those people who say, ‘Why can't you go through the process that exists in relation to other drugs,' that, because of the importance of this, you have a disallowance procedure at the end which is available to a majority in either house of the parliament. I think that strikes a good balance, if I may say so. There are those who argue that this is like any other drug-it is patently not like any other drug; we would not be having this debate if it were-and that we should therefore leave it to the experts. Under the amendment of my friend the member for Bowman, we are leaving it to the experts to give the advice but we are specifically reserving to ourselves, in relation to this particular drug, a power of disallowance. I think that is reasonable. I do not think it extreme. I think it strikes a balance. It recogdebate nises the strength of feelings. It pays proper respect to the role of the experts. But it also reserves unto us, who are ultimately accountable to the Australian people, a decision-making device which is more likely to be invoked when the public really wants it than the more tortuous process of going through an amendment. There are things that should properly be assigned by parliament to others. But I say to those who may not share my view on this issue that it is never an excuse to the Australian people to say, ‘It's not my decision; it's been made by somebody else,' because, in the end, if they do not like it, they will hold you accountable. That has been my experience in life. In politics, if that was made by an independent authority,' their normal response is, ‘You're the Prime Minister. Fix it.' That is not a bad response, because the Australian people have a healthy idea of what democracy is all about. We all passionately believe in parliamentary responsibility and we believe that there should be a greater esteem for our institution. We worry, in this very iconoclastic age, about the decline of respect for parliament. We should not worry too much about that because we do live in an iconoclastic age, but we contribute to that view, in my opinion, if we vote in favour of this measure. I conclude by saying that I think this has been a very good debate. This brings out the best in people. It has been characterised by the odd contribution that I wish had not been made-particularly, I have to say again, the quite offensive remarks made about a devotional practice which all of us know is peculiar to Catholics in our community. That was highly offensive and deserving of the rebuke that it received. That is not to say that people who hold the is opposite point of view have not come to this in very good faith. And it is not something that should be determined solely on religious grounds. Whatever our own religious faith is-and mine is well knownpeople of no religious faith can hold a similar view to mine and equally people of strong religious faith can hold an opposite view from mine. I am not seeking to divide people-none of us should-on the basis of religious belief. But in the end I will not support this measure. As a member of parliament and somebody elected by the people of the division of Bennelong to represent them, I feel that on something as important as this I should reserve a final say to myself as their representative. That is why I will vote as I I say, ‘I'm sorry, have explained.",51
21,Mr BEAZLEY,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"I join with the Prime Minister in congratulating members on both sides of the House for the quality of the debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005. I have had the opportunity to watch a lot of the debate in my office as a sort of background noise to the many other things that we do. To be able to look up and see people struggling honestly to arrive at the right conclusions on this matter has been, frankly, inspirational. I have been in politics now for a very long time-though not as long as the Prime Minister. All too few occasions like this occur in the House. It is a wonderful thing when they do. They speak well of all of us. We are not simply identikit clones of some ad agency's decision as to what a politician ought to be; we in this place are much better people than that, and I am proud of my colleagues. On this occasion I am not only proud of my colleagues on my side of the chamber; I am actually quite proud of my colleagues on the other side of the chamber as well. From all of this I draw very different conclusions than the Prime Minister does. I think that in the end this is a fairly simple proposition about who in our community is appropriately deputed the task of determining whether a drug is safe to be let into the community and on what terms and conditions it is let into the community. Despite the many qualities that reside in people in this House, with the possible exception of one or two, there is absolutely nobody here with the capacity to make the scientific judgments concerned. On the other hand, it is the duty of legislado tors, state and federal, to determine whether or not there should be abortions-period. The decision to be taken by us, or more particularly by our colleagues at a state level, this: under what terms and conditions should a termination of pregnancy take place and should the restrictions on that termination of pregnancy sit within the Criminal Code or sit within health regulations? And, if they sit within health regulations, at what particular point in a pregnancy is what particular action permissible? We legislators have to have that debate. That is the one that we confront. At the federal level, because it does not often come before us in that form, the debate we confront is how it is to be afforded, how it is to be paid for. This is certainly a debate of relevance to legislators, and it is on this debate that our constituents should act upon us. These are the judgments which we are qualified to make-by our humanity and our representivity. That is the point of time at which we ought to confront abortion issues-when they come forward to us on the basis of whether or not that procedure should be permitted under law. I will say a little more about that later, but that is an abortion debate. The question about whether or not a drug is a suitable thing for any medical purposeand this particular drug has purposes beyond termination of pregnancies-is a matter of very difficult scientific judgment. The TGA does not simply make decisions about flu tablets. The TGA makes decisions all the time about life and death drugs-drugs which can preserve life and drugs which, if misused, can terminate life. There may be no intention to terminate life when those drugs are employed. The TGA makes decisions about drugs which can conceivably have horrendous side effects. Members of the TGA not enter into any decision in this regard without a proper concentration on all those possibilities. By their scientific expertise, they are vastly more likely to arrive at coris rect conclusions about these matters than anybody in this chamber, and it should be appropriately left for them. From time to time in the debate I have heard people make statements that these are bureaucrats taking the decisions. These are not bureaucrats. There are no bureaucrats on the TGA. They are scientists, making decisions fully cognisant of the fact that, when they make errors-as was the case in the instance of the prescription of the drug thalidomide-the consequences are truly horrible. And it does come back to them and the way in which they take their decisions. If there are horrendous side effects from the approval of this drug, it will come back to them. They will have to confront the consequences of their decisions in that regard, and they are fully conscious of it. If this legislation is passed, I do not believe that this drug will be approved tomorrow. That will not happen. What will happen is that, if somebody puts up a proposition that they wish to make it available in this country, there will be an extensive series of scientific tests and examinations. Then the drug will be released, if it is to be released, under a set of terms and conditions which will apply to the way in which a doctor may administer it and the set of afflictions-and there will be more than just abortion considered if it is permitted-for which it is appropriate. Some people argue that it is a very appropriate cancer drug in certain circumstances. The TGA will need to have a view about the circumstances in which it will be deployed by doctors and will have to put down some very strict guidelines associated with it. With all due respect to colleagues here-who are amongst the most intelligent and effective human beings in this country and who have the honour to serve in the great democratic palace of the nation which this building is-none of us here knows anything about that. None of us here can make that judgment. All of us can have an opinion on abortion. There is no question about that. Were there a piece of legislation here which dealt with the issue of the termination of pregnancy period, I would trust the judgment and the expertise of every person in this chamber to arrive at a correct conclusion on that to the very best of their endeavours. But that is not a subject that is before us now. I cannot think of another issue in my 25 years in politics that has, from time to time, more exercised my mind than the issue of the termination of pregnancy. My own views on this have gone through changes in the period of time that I have been a member of parliament and the life experiences that I have confronted on the way, many of which have had nothing to do with my life in parliament. I start with the premise, and I still hold the view, that abortion is killing. Therefore, it is something that cannot be conducted lightly; it is something that has to be seriously thought through. When I started in politics my view was that the legal system and the Criminal Code ought to reflect that. That is no longer my view. Tested in the experience of community opinion and community practice, I know that to persist with that view produces a large number of very unsafe procedures and great dangers to women. Therefore, I cannot continue to hold that view, the principle being confronted with the practicality. Courts and legislators at the state level, over time, I think have arrived at a sensible modus vivendi as far as terminations of pregnancies are concerned. I have to ask myself in conscience: what is there left for me? The courts and legislators have decided that basically this is an issue between women and their doctors. I can live with that. I think that after all the testing, if you like, in the public arena, that is a position that has been arrived at. But I am neither a doctor nor a woman. So what does it mean for me? It means this for me: the acceptance of personal responsibility, should my opinion be sought by anyone, on that issue. As a father of three daughters and as a husband it is never beyond the realm of possibility-and thank God it has never happened to me-that I will be invited to have an opinion. If any woman were to approach me and seek my opinion on whether or not she ought to have a termination, my advice would go along the lines of the moral commitments that I have in that regard, with the added statement by me that, should she decide to go ahead with the child, and it was a person with whom I had a direct responsibility, I would do my very level best to make sure that she was able to live comfortably with the decision that she took. But I would also say: ‘If you take another decision on this, I do recognise it as your right to take that decision.' I have learned over time that that is the position that I will live with. I get back to this bill. Nothing in this bill invites me to any of the decisions that I have been referring to in the remarks I have been making-either personal or public. Nothing in this bill invites me to do that. All this invites me to do is to make a judgment about whether or not it is the minister who is the appropriate person to approve a drug-any drug-or a body of scientists. For me it is a no brainer, quite frankly. It is simply common sense that a minister does not have the scientific capacity to arrive at that judgment. Obviously, the vast array of drugs that are approved in this country do not come before this parliament and do not come before ministers, on the very sensible grounds that virtually nobody would conclude that we are the appropriate place for this to be considered. This is the appropriate place when the TGA may make, over time, an error; it is not an unreasonable thing for us to bring to this place a complaint and to use the grievance debate or something like that as a sounding board. But to be the ab initio judges of what ought to occur is actually absurd; it is just not sensible. We have to extract from this our feelings on the legal and moral issues related to abortion and just use common sense about what is the appropriate way to approve a drug. I think the level of focus that has been on the minister's moral convictions has been unfair. This minister temporarily holds the position of minister for health. I can think of ministers on both sides of the House who have a very different moral outlook from him, and I can think of ministers in the future on both sides of the House who will have a very different moral outlook from him. It really is not about Tony Abbott at all or Tony Abbott's convictions. As I have already indicated, there is some level of moral sympathy on my behalf with his convictions in this area. And I understand his difficulty, having the moral convictions that he has, presiding in the portfolio that he does. I happen to know the situation in Britain, where there is a member of the Labour ministry who turned down the ministry of health bill on the grounds that she has some profound convictions in relation to abortion which mean she does not feel that she can sit easily with that. This is a law that has been passed by the House of Commons. She does not sit easily with the notion that she has to sign off payments for the procedure-so she does not take that job, on those grounds. If it is impossible, in any part of it-I would not, for example, suggest that a pacifist along my front-bench ought to necessarily be appointed by me as Minister for Defence. I would think that that person would make a very good contribution in some other area, but it is not wise to place people in portfolio positions where their moral convictions are challenged. If it is difficult for Tony Abbott to handle these things then he ought to have a word with his boss about where he ought to be situated-he ought to do that. But what he ought not to do is suggest that we have here an issue of confidence in him. This is not an issue of confidence in Tony Abbott; this is an issue of sensible statement about where decision making ought to reside in relation to the approval of drugs, dangerous or otherwise. It is for those reasons that I take the deciwe sion to vote in the way I will. I will support the bill. I say again, as I started: I am most impressed with the way this debate has been conducted, the way views have been expressed on both sides of the House, the expertise that has been brought to it. I have learnt a lot more about the drug, I might say, than I have learnt before. I still do not think, however, on the basis of listening to that debate, that I am in any better position than I was when the debate started to be the approving authority for its distribution. Nevertheless, the research that people have done has been truly magnificent and I do congratulate all members on this. We should leave this place without any bitterness in our hearts towards any person involved in this debate but with the very greatest pride that we are elected by the people to be here. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",53
22,Mr BALDWIN,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"PatersonParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (11.45 am)-I rise today to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005. The purpose of this bill is to transfer the approvals process from the Minister for Health and Ageing to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. However, the debate has broadened to include the drug RU486, women's rights, the claimed advantages for rural women and the actual abortion debate. I will now attempt in the time available to address these issues separately, as they have been raised as a part of the debate. First, I will go to the issue of transferring responsibility for approval to the TGA. From the start, let me say I am against this bill for a number of reasons. I do not believe in abrogating my responsibility as an elected representative of the community on issues as important as life itself. The drug RU486 that are debating is an abortifacient, yet it is the same drug prescribed under the name mifepristone that helps preserve life as a therapeutic drug in the treatment of certain cancers and tumours. The TGA rightly has the power to approve drugs that preserve life, but when there are moral issues attached to the use of a drug-and by that I mean the use of a drug that ends life-then the process of ministerial approval, the scrutiny of the parliament and the judgment by the community of those that made that decision at the ballot box is the correct process. On the issue of the drug RU486-and I admit that, unlike some of my colleagues in this House, I am not a doctor-I have extracted the following from expert opinion. To quote Edouard Sakiz, the former chairman of French drug company Roussel-UCLAF, which developed RU486: As Abortifacient procedures go RU486 is not at all easy to use. In fact it is more complex to use than the technique of vacuum extraction ... A woman who wants to end her pregnancy has to ‘live' with her abortion for at least a week using this technique. It's an appalling psychological ordeal. According to Dr Michael Green, Professor of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive Biology at Harvard University: RU486 had 10 times the mortality risk of surgical abortion in the first 7 weeks of pregnancy (which is its recommended time limit for effective use, although even then between 5% and 8% of women will need a follow-up surgical abortion). So dangerous is RU486 to women's health that pro-choice radical feminists such as Dr Renate Klein, Associate Professor of Women's Studies at Deakin University in Victoria, are adamantly opposed to the drug. She describes RU486 as ‘a modern version of backyard abortion-unsafe, painful and deeply scary'. How does RU486 work? It is reported in journals that RU486 is a synthetic steroid which works by blocking the effects of progesterone, the natural hormone which is required to maintain the lining of the uterus during pregnancy. RU486 starves the womb of progesterone, the lining of the womb breaks down and it is lost along with the developing embryo or foetus. Up to four visits to a hospital or a clinic are necessary to complete the process. The success rate of RU486 on its own is not high. For pregnancies of up to nine weeks gestation mifepristone is normally taken by mouth on its own. If the embryo or foetus has not come away within 36 to 48 hours, a prostaglandin is given. For pregnancies of 13 to 24 weeks gestation, mifepristone is taken by mouth. This is followed by a prostaglandin by vagina. If the abortion does not occur within 24 hours after the start of treatment, a repeat course of gemeprost will be given. In both cases, if the treatment fails, the baby will aborted by a surgical method-that is, either vacuum aspiration or dilation and curettage. There are side effects. Is this safe? According to the journal, the use of RU486 may cause any of the following: haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion, severe pain requiring strong pain killers, incomplete abortion, rupture of the uterus, vaginal bleeding, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, muscle weakness, dizziness, flushing, chills, backache, difficulty breathing, chest pain, palpitations, rise in temperature and a fall in blood pressure. What I am illustrating here is that the number and diverse nature of the side effects of RU486 point to the fact that these are powerful chemicals. In fact, Dr Germaine Greer, speaking at the Best for Women gynaecologists and obstetricians conference in Sydney in 2002, described RU486 as a powerful and unpleasant succession of experiences. She said: These are violently active chemicals and they have violent reactions on the organism ... What is the situation in which a woman would undergo that kind of assault? One of the most spurious arguments being put forward in this debate goes to the advantages for rural women. To quote from RU486: misconceptions myths and morals: There is much about RU 486/PG that is fraught with risk and problems. As we have queried, what is the meaning of a ‘private' and ‘de-medicalized' abortion that requires three or four doctor's visits to a specialized centre, includes the taking of two and perhaps five hazardous drug combinations, is accompanied by vaginal ultrasound, and too often has complications ranging from moderate bleeding to severe pain and, for some women, blood transfusions? If this is a private and demedicalized abortion experience, then the word ‘private' has lost its definitional moorings. I do not profess to be a medical expert, but I am prepared to listen to expert opinion provided in the various submissions. Another be argument advanced is that this is a women's only issue. I must say I am personally and deeply offended by those claims that this is solely a women's issue and that men should butt out. The last time my wife and I had children, I seem to recollect that I, as a mere male, actually had something to do with it. Whilst I agree that it is the woman's body that is carrying the baby, and I accept that the physical and mental aspect of unwanted pregnancy may be greater, speaking as a in male I can assure you that men suffer the same mental anguish and torment in an unwanted pregnancy or abortion. Men should never be removed from the decision-making process, not legally nor morally, to end the life of a baby. I only need to remind members in this House of how we are inundated with correspondence in relation to fathers' rights to have access to their children for them to know that that mental anguish would be no different from deliberating and grieving over an abortion. On the issue of abortion itself, I have on previous occasions stated my personal Christian convictions not only in this parliament but also to the community that I represent. I am encouraged by the letters and phone calls of support on this issue. The number of contacts on each side of the argument from my electorate show clear support for the status quo. That being said, I do respect but do not agree with the views of many being put to me in this House to support this bill. This week I received an email from a very well-respected doctor in my electorate, who wrote: I am writing to you to encourage you to vote against the private members bill, giving the TGA the right and responsibility to license RU486. As Tony Abbott says, this is not like other drugs, this is a drug that kills human life. Having practiced obstetrics for ten years in the bush, and having continued to care for women during pregnancy here, I have no doubt that an embryo is a human life, nor do the women who grieve for their miscarriages. Even women and doctors who believe in abortion, do so with a sense of knowing it is fundamentally wrong. People are generally ashamed of terminations of pregnancy, and usually do so because it is presented to them as an option that “solves” their problem. People who argue for women's right to choose are arguing on behalf of many premises and rights that I also believe in, BUT when it comes to a decision as to whether an individuals right to do anything in society infringes on another human beings right to simply live, then the choice must go with an individuals right to live. Recently I saw a young teenage girl who had travelled to Sydney with her mother, had an ultrasound that confirmed her pregnancy to be 19 + weeks (what does that mean was it 20 weeks? was it more?) The mother cried when she saw the baby on ultrasound, the girl would have felt that baby move inside her. That baby would have had to be cut up, dismembered to be removed from her uterus by suction curette. This is apparently legal but obviously so wrong. The termination was performed in Macquarie St. This is where our society is going. Bob its time to make a stand. If RU486 is licensed our society will continue to treat the value of human life with less and less regard. Thanks for your time, Dr Mark Adamski Is it about right to life? But whose life? The hypocrisy that has surrounded this debate is perhaps the easiest argument to reject. I cite the example of those who argue strongly for the preservation of life in the death sentences handed down to Bali nine drug convictees Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, and the recently and sadly executed drug courier, Van Nguyen. These people go to great lengths to urge governments to do more for the unfortunate souls in Third World countries who die of starvation and disease every day, yet in the same breath advocate abortion, the wilful ending of an absolutely innocent life. As a parent of twins who were born very prematurely and as one who sat by the humidicrib for weeks on end to pray and watch a child not much bigger than a barbie doll fight for life, I find it truly amazing that today a premature baby can survive at 21 weeks and incomprehensible that today a child can be aborted at the same age or older. Why can't those who advocate for the life of a convicted drug dealer advocate for the life of the unborn? When people argue about the morbidity and mortality of backyard abortions, they forget that the mortality of legal abortions is 100 per cent for the innocent baby. How bitterly ironic it is that people will defend abortion as somehow being a kinder alternative to the unborn child, often saying, ‘I couldn't adopt the child. I couldn't bring it into this world.' What of the needs of the childless parents desperate to adopt a child? Rejecting this bill will not, unfortunately, alter the status quo of the often quoted 100,000 abortions each year. Perhaps that is an argument that needs to explored in the state parliaments of Australia, which have the legislative responsibility for abortion. The decision that I have come to will allow my mind to rest easy. But I try to understand the anguish and torment of the parents that have made the decision to have an abortion and what they must go through. I am not without empathy for the difficult and sometimes awful situation pregnancy can represent. I will stand on my decision today, accountable to this parliament and to the people I represent, and that is something that I will never walk away from.",57
23,Mr BAKER,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"As the member for Braddon, I wish to thank all those from my electorate and from all corners of Australia who have written, faxed, emailed and phoned to put their point of view forward. Many have said, and I wholeheartedly agree, that this debate is not about abortion. It is not for this House rights or wrongs of abortion, because abortion is lawfully available within all state and territory jurisdictions of Australia. This debate is about whether or not the availability of an abortive agent like RU486 should be subject to the administrative processes of a bureaucratic body which is not accountable to the constituents of Australia or subject to ministerial accountability. This debate is concerned with the proper regulatory process for the approval or disapproval of a drug designed to terminate a pregnancy. The role of the Therapeutic Goods Administration is to regulate the availability in Australia of therapeutic drugs that are designed to prevent or cure an illness. Herein we have a dilemma. Is pregnancy an illness? Is an unwanted pregnancy an illness? In my conscience I have to say no, an unwanted pregnancy is not just another illness requiring a cure but rather the result of a range of attitudes and the consequence of behaviour. It is a tragedy that in Australia up to 100,000 abortions are performed each year. Along with many constituents in my electorate, I struggle with this sobering figure. As a parliament it is our responsibility to promote greater family planning in an attempt to reduce the number of abortions and the associated consequences, both physical and psychological. One of the arguments for increasing the availability of RU486 to rural and isolated women is that it provides choice where surgical abortion facilities are not available. However, lost in this argument is the fact that genuinely rural and isolated women do not have ready access to emergency facilities, and any time delay in reaching appropriate help could be very serious and even fatal. Therefore, this neutralises the argument that there are widespread benefits for rural and to debate the isolated women. The greatest gift in life is to create another life, and I acknowledge the agonising decision for those who decide to end the life of an unborn child-a decision not taken easily. I do not believe that it is the role of the Therapeutic Goods Administration to consider the ethical and moral questions that this drug raises, and those questions are unavoidable. The role of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia is to regulate the availability of therapeutic goods. It is required to consider public health and safety. Therapeutic goods are those given to prevent or cure an illness, to promote well-being. My conscience cannot resolve that RU486, an abortion drug, is a drug designed to end the life of an unborn child. Further, the Therapeutic Goods Administration is neither elected by nor accountable to the community. Accordingly, mindful of the concerns of the majority of my constituents and after wrestling with this issue, I cannot support this bill. However, I note the proposed amendments on the table, and I will support those amendments which retain ministerial responsibility or provide parliamentary scrutiny.",60
24,Mr DOWNER,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"Like other members, I have thought long and hard about this issue and the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005 that has been presented to the House. The first observation I would make is that many of the speeches that I have been able to follow that have been made during this debate have been of great interest to me. I am impressed with the thought and the effort that so many members have put into considering this issue. Let me begin by saying that my view on the issue of abortion is that I feel comfortable with the laws that we have in the various states and territories of Australia. I think they strike the right balance, and I do not think that in this parliament we should be taking steps which will change the implementation of those laws. Having said that, I can obviously see-and this is why we are having a debate on this matter-that RU486 is a controversial and difficult issue. If this were simply a technical matter, we would not be having a great debate on it. The time of the Senate and of the House of Representatives would not have been so substantially devoted to it. I have said publicly before now that my in principle decision is that, if a drug is deemed to be safe and can be prescribed by a doctor, I do not have any objection to the drug being used. And it is my view that, if that were to happen in relation to RU486, that would not change the abortion law in this country at all. A lot of members have spoken about the issue of abortion. For me, this debate does not really boil down to being about abortion laws, because it is my judgment that, in the end, this is not going to change the abortion laws in this country. This debate is actually about whether the decision on final approval-not on preliminary approval, not establishing the technical safety of the drug, but the decision on final approval-should continue to rest with the Minister for Health and Ageing, or whether instead it should be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition about this; the Therapeutic Goods Administration is a body of public servants. Many public servants work with me and for me, and I have enormous respect for the Australian Public Service, but it is a decision that is made by public servants using the delegated authority of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. So the choice for me is whether I think that, in the end, the minister should make the decision on something which is obviously highly controversial, as is proven by the fact that we are having a debate on it, or whether the decision should be made by the delegates of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing through the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I am an elected member of parliament myself. I represent the people of Mayo in the Adelaide Hills, Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island. They send me here to Canberra, and have done so on many occasions, to represent their interests and make decisions on difficult issues. I sometimes wrestle with difficult issues, but it is part of the job. In the end, I am happy to make decisions on difficult issues. I am accountable to the parliament and ultimately I am accountable to the people of Mayo. Having said all of that, the two proposals that have appealed to me most in this debate have been the amendments put forward by the member for Lindsay and the member for Bowman. In fact, of the two, I think the member for Bowman's is the better amendment. If the first of those amendments does not get up, I am going to vote for the second one, which will be the member for Bowman's amendment. The whole concept here of having a preliminary judgment made by the Therapeutic Goods Administration or the minister and then the parliament having the capacity to disallow that decision puts the matter back into the hands of the parliament. On something as controversial as this, I think that is entirely appropriate. So, as I have said, I am going to support the amendment of the member for Bowman in particular. I think that is a very good and very sensible amendment, and I hope other members will consider doing that. It is a compromise. It does keep the power to make the final decision with the parliament. It leaves the final decision on something which is manifestly very controversial with the representatives of the people. But, having said that, obviously the Therapeutic Goods Administration's judgments about the safety and appropriateness-in a technical sense-of the use of this drug will be a very important consideration. I do not want to detain the House for long in expressing my views on this matter, but let me say in conclusion that some people-in the media, substantially, and one or two parliamentarians-have interpreted this debate in the context of the Minister for Health and Ageing. My view of the minister for health is that he is a person of enormous principle. Of all the members of parliament I have known over 21 years-and you can imagine that in 21 years I have known a few-I do not know any member of parliament more principled than the minister for health. He passionately believes in things. He is not just here to fill a seat or to get a parliamentary salary or a ministerial car; he is one of those people who has come here to make a difference because he believes in things. Usually I agree with him and sometimes I do not, but he is a person who deserves the admiration of the country for his passion and his principle. I have to say, without wishing to inject too harsh a tone into this debate-because it does not deserve too harsh a tone; it deserves consideration-that some of the criticisms of the Minister for Health and Ageing have been quite effective in pushing me away from this bill. I have felt very uncomfortable with some of the things that have been said about the minister for health. I was especially offended by the T-shirt worn by Senator Nettle-I was appalled that it was produced by the YWCA, or so it said on the Tshirt; I do not know whether that is fair or not-because it had not only a tone of abuse towards the minister for health but a tone of sectarianism. I am a Christian-I am actually an Anglican-but the Catholic Church is the great spiritual leader of Christianity in the world. There is no question about that. Even though I am an Anglican, I concede that point. The Catholic Church is the great Christian church. Even though I do not see the Pope as my leader, the Pope nevertheless is the great spiritual leader of Christianity. Sectarianism in Australia was one of the truly ugly components of our past, which I myself thought was well and truly out of the way and that I had seen it die in my lifetime. Some of the comments that have been made about the Catholic Church and Catholicism have caused me great offence, and I do want to put that on the record. The Catholic Church has stood for great things and does stand for great things, and it deserves great respect, even if you do not agree with them. I am an Anglican, so there is obviously some point of theological disagreement there, but it is not substantial. My position, in conclusion, is as simple as this: I support the amendments. If either of those amendments is carried, then the amended bill would win my support. However, if the amendments fail, I will not support the bill and I will vote against it.",61
25,Mr BAIRD,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"Like many other members in this House, I have been subject to some strong lobbying in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005. Some are in favour, some are against. Of course, a number of those lobbying have targeted me because I am known by many as a committed Christian. Until I stepped down at the end of last year, I served as the President of the Australian Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. Therefore, there is an expectation that I will take a similar view to that of many Christians in Australia and of course take note of the views of church leaders. I would say up front that my Christian faith is a very strong and significant part of my life and one of the reasons I came into this House. I have attempted to be a faithful follower of Jesus Christ. It is clear to those who know me well that I have often failed, but still I press on towards the mark. However, I have taken views on issues in the past that did not reflect the popular Christian view of the time-namely, I voted for the amendment in 1984 which proposed the decriminalisation of homosexual relations between consenting adults, when the Crimes Amendment Bill was put before the New South Wales parliament; I voted for stem cell research in 2002; and now I will be voting for this bill. There is not a uniform Christian approach on these issues, and there are a number of members of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship who plan to vote for the bill before the House. I am unashamedly a Liberal on these issues of social conscience. I believe it is healthy to have a range of views amongst Christians. One thing I am sure of is that Christ's significance in my life does not diminish because of my support for this bill. Tolerance, acceptance and forgiveness are hallmarks of the Christian life, and my approach on these issues is motivated very much by the Christian concept of grace. It is this philosophy and approach which motivated me to take a strong interest in the treatment of asylum seekers in this country. I was compelled to be part of a reform agenda when I was confronted with stories of detainees who had been held in detention for some years. There were many who opposed my stand on these issues, but I was encouraged by the support I was given by many church leaders. The bill before the House separates out the decision on abortifacient products from the minister to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The minister appoints a group of experts who examine the suitability of pharmaceuticals on medical grounds for release to the general public. I believe it is inappropriate for the decision to be made by the minister and should rather be made by those who are expert in the field and who, by virtue of their training, are better equipped to make a sound medical judgment based on empirical scientific fact. It is clear that the opponents of this bill are trying to turn this debate into one that is focused on the issue of abortion. They are a little late, because this issue was the subject of at times heated debate up to 30 years ago. In every state, either the parliament voted to allow abortion or common law was extended to permit it. I am personally opposed to abortion, but we are legislating here for the people of Australia and we must separate out the issues of church and state. The fact is that any woman who wishes to have an abortion in this country is already able to have one. Presently, termination of an unwanted pregnancy is carried out by a surgical procedure. The introduction of RU486 would provide for an alternative method, thereby providing a simplified and less invasive means of terminating a pregnancy. There is no doubt that we need to provide more funding for counselling services both before and after abortion and more funding for sex education and for child support for those who decide to have the child. Some would argue that there are risks of death from RU486, as has been evidenced overseas. However, it is clear that the incidence of mortality has been very low, and lower than for other drugs. The drug has already been prescribed extensively in Europe, North America, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, to name but a few. In each of these countries, RU486 has been found to be effective and safe. According to opponents of RU486, 10 deaths have been linked to the use of the drug. This is indeed a great tragedy, as is the avoidable loss of every life. However, the Australian Medical Association and Rural Doctors Association advised the Senate committee that the proper and supervised use of RU486 is no more dangerous that the use of the off-the-shelf pain killer aspirin. The President of the AMA, Dr Haikerwal, believes that, in relation to the deaths caused by infection and septicaemia: The cases reported of people dying from infections really are the same... complications that get with any gynaecological procedure. But he goes even further. He states that he believes that in some cases the use of RU486 is indeed safer than the current practice. The use of RU486, being a non-invasive method of terminating pregnancy, could in fact improve health outcomes for women. The current surgical method means that if things go wrong, such as a doctor perforating the cervix during the procedure, a woman can be rendered infertile or have reduced likelihood of having a successful pregnancy later on, when her circumstances may be different. It is also argued that the availability of this drug would lead to a significant increase in abortion. This has not been the experience in overseas countries where the drug has been introduced. Some would also argue that the approval of an abortifacient is a moral decision and would be more appropriately decided by this parliament. This may have been the case when the legality of abortion was decided, but that issue was settled long ago. We are now debating the question of the means of termination and who should make the decision on what medical and surgical options are available to women who have decided for one reason or another to terminate their pregnancy. Because we are talking about a medical procedure, surely this decision should be taken by a medically trained and expert board. The minister has the ability to appoint not only people of professional expertise but also people of moral integrity. Then there is the question of the amendments proposed by the members for Lindsay and Bowman. I believe these amendments are basically red herrings to the real issue. The creation of disallowable instruments will simply mean that any member can raise the issue again anytime, and this parliament will you end up having this debate again, again and again. No, I will be supporting the bill and will not be supporting these amendments. I have been criticised by some for saying that men should butt out of the debate and allow the decision to terminate a pregnancy to be left to the woman to decide. I certainly listened to my wife and daughter. It is women who have to deal with the issues of disruption to their career and the provision of care for a child and to bear the social stigma that can accompany single parenthood. We have come a long way since the wearing of the scarlet letter, and well-meaning men may express their affirmation, but it is certainly not them that have to deal with the consequences of finding they are pregnant. Yes, I am a Christian, but I am also conscious of the real issues facing many young women in Australia each day. The provisions of the bill will ensure that important issues affecting women and their reproductive health are decided by a panel of experts, based on the best scientific information, and not by the minister of the day, who in many cases would have no real expertise in the area. I commend the bill to the House.",63
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"In the interests of the gallery, there are two more government speakers on this particular bill, and then I believe the bill may put to the vote.",65
27,Mr HENRY,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"At the outset I must state my respect for all my colleagues in this place and the honourable and forthright way in which this debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005 has been conducted. The issue of abortion, which has some relevance in this debate, is an emotive one. I am conscious of the strong and deep convictions of many here in this place, many people across Australia and of course many in my own electorate of Hasluck. Those convictions, I feel, have been well represented in this debate in the Australian parliament. I have received many phone calls, emails and written submissions on this issue. I do very much appreciate the effort those who have contacted me have made to share their views and their experiences in order that I can make an appropriate and informed decision. I must confess that my position has wavered many times over the course of recent weeks, before I have been able to stand in this House to speak on this private member's bill. In coming to my final position on this issue, I took great comfort from a submission from UnitingJustice Australia, an agency of the Uniting Church. I quote from their letter: It is our view that the current campaign against RU486 confuses medical, moral and political issues. As the Uniting Church understands it, the issue is whether or not this particular drug is safe to be released for use in a country where abortion is legally available. This is a decision that should be made by the Therapeutic Goods Administration using sound medical evidence and advice. It is our belief that RU486 should not be made an exception from this independent process purely due to its application as an abortifacient. Termination of a pregnancy is legal in Australia, however fraught politically or morally. I also quote from a Uniting Church media release: be The decision to have an abortion is not just a moral issue but a social one. While the current debate attempts to pass moral judgment on the act itself, it ignores the many emotional, physical, financial and social issues that often create a situation where a woman is forced to consider an abortion. I rise to speak in favour of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005, and I do so after carefully listening to the debate, both here and in the other place, to my constituents and to my family. Prior to my election I said that I would represent the constituents of Hasluck without fear or favour. Unfortunately, on this occasion, I know that a number of my constituents will feel that I have let them down. However, I feel that in leaving the decision on the use of RU486 in the hands of the executive we are confusing the method of abortion with the legality or availability of abortion. Abortion, by and large, is legal, under varying circumstances and conditions, in all states and territories of Australia. This is, and always has been, a matter for state parliaments. Through Medicare rebates, the Commonwealth government funds surgical abortions in this country, rightly or wrongly. In light of these facts, I do not see how we can justify special conditions for the approval of abortifacients. These drugs are classified as restricted goods under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Abortifacient drugs are the only type of drug classed as a restricted good. Evaluation, listing, registration or importation of restricted goods requires written approval from the minister for health. That approval must then be put before each house of parliament within five sitting days. Every other drug merely applies for approval to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, which evaluates the drug and regulates its use. The minister is not involved in this process for non-restricted goods. The TGA is a respected organisation, recognised internationally for its standards and competence. It is the equipped authority to make decisions on the safety and appropriate use of therapeutic goods and for monitoring and reviewing the long-term effects of those same goods. The TGA does not operate in isolation, as the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee carries out an oversight role on the activities of the TGA. This group of independent experts is appointed by the health minister and includes highly qualified medical practitioners, pharmacologists, toxicologists, manufacturing chemists and others. Through the minister, this committee ensures an effective level of public accountability. The Drug Evaluation Committee is part of the regulatory framework and risk management approach approved by parliament. The TGA has so far evaluated more than 50,000 therapeutic goods. It has earned the trust of the Australian parliament and the Australian people. Surely it can be trusted to impartially assess products such as RU486. This should not be a debate about abortion. The question really is: what is the best and most effective way of assessing the safety of drugs in Australia? The medical experts at the TGA are surely the most experienced and qualified to do so. I do not say this to reflect negatively on the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is an excellent minister and an honourable man. My opinion is that any health minister, whoever they may be, should not be the gatekeeper for the approval of any drug or product. This should not be a political decision. The decision to approve or not approve a drug should be made by qualified medical professionals. Ultimately, we, as members of the Australian parliament, will be held accountable by the people of Australia. The oft-repeated argument that faceless bureaucrats should not be making this decision is weakened by the fact that the decision to approve every other drug is made by those so-called faceless bureaucrats. If we are so concerned about this process, why have there been no calls to bring the approval of other classes of drugs within the purview of the minister? There is no shame in parliament legislating for an independent body of experts, with general oversight by government, to make decisions regarding particular matters. This has happened in Western democracies for hundreds of years and it is an effective way of ensuring that complex matters are given the due consideration they deserve rather than being reduced to sometimes trite simplifications of political debate. Our Australian society is divided in its opinion on abortion. There is no clear consensus on this issue. While I am sympathetic to those with alternative views, I must err on the side of personal choice. I believe that parliament must also respect the individual's right to personal choice. I personally believe that there are far too many abortions in Australia. It is a sad and traumatic event for any woman who makes the decision to take this action. I do not believe that anyone takes this decision lightly. I am sure that everyone in this place-indeed, everyone in this country-would prefer to see fewer or no abortions performed. The reality is that we live in an imperfect world; abortions are legal. However, this debate is not about increasing the incidence of abortion but ensuring that Australian women, in consultation with their medical practitioner, are able to choose the best method. Given the very unfortunate circumstances where individuals need to make such a choice, is it not appropriate that, with medical advice, we ensure that a full range of medical procedures and choices are available? Rather than, as I see it, artificially iting people's options to deal with their situations, we should be providing greater resources to help people make better decisions and to help them be aware of the consequences of their actions. In this regard, young people are particularly vulnerable. The abortion rate is highest in women aged between 20 and 24. By putting in place better information and education programs, we can inform young people more effectively about contraception and sexuality, provide them with better life skills and teach them about parenting. When our young people have full and frank access to this information and the support of their parents and communities, we will see a reduction in abortion rates. A blanket ban on RU486 does not reduce the abortion rate; it just reduces the options available to Australian women. Indeed, it has been shown in respected and thorough research in many of the countries where RU486 is used that the introduction of RU486 has not triggered an increase in the rates of abortion. At the end of the day, we should subject RU486 to the same scrutiny as any other drug-that is, the rigorous independent expert evaluation of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. If RU486 is approved for use by the TGA, access to this drug will be subject to the normal safeguards provided by consultation and counselling with a doctor. It will also mean that patients can make a fully informed choice, knowing in detail the effects of the drug. I am in no position to make a decision about the safety or otherwise of RU486; I humbly suggest that very few members of this parliament are. That is why I support this bill to move approval of RU486 to the Therapeutic Goods Administration.",65
28,Mr ANDREWS,RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL OF,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the limPublic Service) (12.26 pm)-At the end of this very extensive debate, I rise to voice my opposition to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill 2005. I do so because the system of regulation proposed by this bill is, in my belief, fundamentally inadequate. At present, as honourable members know, final approval for drugs such as RU486 rests with the Minister for Health and Ageing. It is argued by the proponents of this bill that this arrangement-that is, final approval resting with the Minister for Health and Ageing-lacks in transparency and accountability. They seek to resolve this lack of transparency and accountability by replacing the decision made by the Minister for Health and Ageing with a decision made by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA. If, as many proponents claim, this issue is not about abortion but about the best process of decision making, this bill is flawed for the very same reasons that the proponents claim the current system is-that is, it contains no more transparency and accountability than the current arrangements. Having spent much of my professional life advising governments-I should say, both Liberal and Labor-and health care institutions on appropriate approaches to the regulation of biotechnology and reproductive technology, it appears to me that both the current arrangements and those proposed in the bill are inadequate. Much has been said about the appropriateness or otherwise of the Minister for Health and Ageing alone having the decision, but little attention has been given to the alternative proposal. There are a number of reasons why I believe that the TGA alone should not have these powers. First, the TGA's purview is limited to technical questions of quality, safety and efficacy. It does not consider other criteria. is not empowered to take into account any ethical or other consideration that may pertain to this issue. Secondly, the TGA's technical consideration is limited. For example, there is no requirement that doctors or pharmacists report any adverse reaction to the drugs. Yet we know that the use of this drug, in combination perhaps with other drugs, has caused a number of maternal deaths. Indeed, a major investigation into this issue is currently under way in the United States of America. It would be a pity if, out of all of this, the only winners were the drug companies and members of the legal profession. Thirdly, the work of the TGA is largely funded through the industry that it regulates. Indeed, part of the reason advanced in favour of this bill is that, with the costs of making an application being so high, the CEO of a drug company would not make one, if the decision were to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I find this disturbing-not for the reason which was advanced by my friend the member for Moore, but because it may give rise in the community to a perception that the TGA will be a rubber stamp for applications. That would be regrettable, as far as the reputation of the TGA is concerned. This bill proposes that a group of medical experts will decide, on narrow grounds, what pharmaceutical companies in Australia wish to market. As Justice Michael Kirby once observed, the regulation of new technologies is not a matter to be resolved behind closed doors by committees, however expert and sincere they are. For these reasons, in my view this bill contains a very inadequate system of regulation. Indeed, I find it quite strange that parliamentarians who day in, day out defend the concept of ministerial responsibility and parliamentary scrutiny in other areas would wish to abandon them in this instance. To the It contrary, the amendments foreshadowed by both the members for Lindsay and Bowman provide more checks and balances and a higher level of accountability and transparency than the current bill. I prefer the amendment moved by the member for Lindsay, because it involves not only the expert advice of the TGA but also the minister and the parliament. For those who say that this argument should be based on a level of accountability and transparency then obviously both sets of amendments provide more accountability and more transparency than is provided in the bill before the parliament. Accordingly, I will support the amendments. May I make a few comments about the issue of abortion. I find it disingenuous to say that this debate is not about abortion. That is purely a technical argument. The whole purpose of RU486 is to induce an abortion. If the subject matter were aspirin, we would not have been having this debate in the parliament over the last few days. Indeed, many speakers both here and in the Senate have explicitly stated their stance on the bill and related their stance on the bill in relation to their view about abortion generally. Two things appear clear to me about abortion in Australia. The first is that there is no desire generally in the community to change the current legal approach to abortion. Contrary to what many have said, abortion is illegal in most Australian states unless certain circumstances are established, which usually relate to a threat to the health and well-being of the mother. However, in practice we know we have abortion on demand. Secondly, there is a growing unease about the high number of abortions. Many Australians are concerned that there are 80,000 to 100,000 abortions performed in this country each and every year. Many believe that we have trivialised a profound issue and many also worry that this bill will compound that view. I believe that this level of abortion in Australia is a blight upon our nation. Many speakers both here and in the Senate have voiced concerns about the high abortion rate. Anecdotal evidence is supported and reinforced by surveys. A national poll conducted by the Sexton Marketing Group found, for example, that 87 per cent of people wanted the number of abortions in Australia reduced and 78 per cent wanted mandatory counselling before the procedure was undertaken. I note that this bill proposes absolutely nothing that would reduce the incidence of abortion in Australia, something which I think overwhelmingly Australians would like to see. Indeed, the comment by Serena Williams, a young Melbourne woman reflecting on the unwanted loss of a pregnancy, in the Herald Sun last Sunday succinctly summarised the concerns of many people. She said: I cannot understand why we are fighting so hard to promote less counselling, less help and debilitating bleeding at home without medical supervision, which is what would happen with RU486. Given the level of concern in the community about the prevalence of abortion, I urge my colleagues in the government to consider what support and counselling can be provided for people facing this choice-and, by counselling, I do not mean services provided by abortion clinics. The reality today is that we have abortion with very little or no support for the women and the men facing these significant decisions. I urge the government-indeed, I urge this parliament-to address the issue. I believe a program that provided counselling and some time for people to consider all their choices would be widely supported in the Australian community. We need more discussion, not less, about the causes for such a high incidence of abortion. For far too long we have danced around the subject-like the elephant sitting in the middle of the living room that we all know exists but whose existence we do not want to acknowledge. I hope this debate will not be the last word on the subject in this parliament but the beginning of a mature reflection on a matter of concern to so many Australians.

I mean no disservice to the great civility, the grace and the thoughtfulness with which we have participated in this debate over the last 2½ days. But as a person of scientific training I put it to you that this question is no longer just science, and I summarise the amendments that I put to the chamber today as follows: if there is in the mind of every member in this place no doubt that RU486 is just another medication, then you will strike down my amendments. If it is your view that the laws we have for abortion in every state are immutable and that everything within those laws, everything that subscribes to those laws and is simply added to the menu of options for women, will never change, then you will strike down my amendments. And if you believe that there is no counter to that libertarian view that every individual, given the right information, can simply work their way through all the information and make an informed decision, that there is no need for a corridor of tolerability in the social services we deliver and that government has no role in that, then you will strike down these amendments. as soon as practicable that the But, more importantly, we will uphold goods will be included in the first and foremost that the Therapeutic Goods Register if the applicant gives Administration is unimpugnable in its efforts the Secretary the certificate to analyse the science. The debate is not required under subsection about the science. We move beyond that with 26B(1); and these amendments. But it is vital that the analysis of science never trumps the option ister and give the applicant a to consider more detailed views in this place, certificate of registration if the and that is why many of us left our profesapplicant gives the Secretary sions to come here and consider just those the certificate required under issues and never walk away from them, subsection 26B(1). never avoid the truly tough decisions that we believe in our own hearts to be right. The unintended consequence of this bill is that it strips away that final look at decisions made by well-meaning, highly educated and expert bodies-and I list the TGA among those. This is an issue of science and then some, and we simply cannot airbrush away those extra issues. I do not share the views of the extremes of both sides of this debate, but I will fight for those views to be heard after we have had an informed debate. We have had an informed debate using overseas information filtered to us through different agencies but never-and this is a good thing in this bill-has that evidence been taken to the TGA. When it comes through, it will most likely recommend this drug as safe and this drug will come here and probably not be stopped by the proposals I recommend. They will go through both houses without a disallowable instrument ever being effective in stopping the drug. So do not mistake my actions today as an effort to scuttle RU486. Do not mistake my view, either, as one to complicate the debate. I stand here purely to leave that option opento leave the option open for the tough decisions, through community views, to filter up here so that we do the things that we have, after all, been elected to do. Isn't it ironic that the very 2½ days ergised debate we have had, without my amendment, will become impossible in the future? This amendment is about having the option to come back and do just what we are doing today. I take no pride in the fact that we keep the issue of abortion out of this chamber. We have managed to do it for decades on end and we think it is not something we want to raise here-it is too venomous and too difficult to resolve. That is not the attitude that we should be taking. Nor should we view this as just another pill-that is completely obvious. One hundred and thirtyseven of us have come down here in a conga line to express our feelings one after the other for 2½ days. So let us not fool ourselves that RU486 is anything as simple as a general therapeutic to be decided by an expert body. This is a medication; we know the mechanism of action and it raises great concerns with some. I am not asking us to adjudicate upon this as experts; clearly we are not. The TGA are the scientific experts aiding the women in this terrible predicament when they have to make these tough decisions. They have the frustration of infertility, to which we dedicate enormous efforts and resources. But, in the end, it is the community that sets what we do. It is not left to an expert body. So cast this not as politicians stepping into bedrooms nor parliamentarians stepping into consulting rooms. This is done with embryonic stem cell research and with therapeutic cloning. It is done in every state House when these tough decisions on abortion come back to parliament. I have argued that the use of a disallowable instrument is the best of the three options we have. One is to live with tough decisions; one is to use a disallowable instrument; and one is to legislate every time this question arises.",71
30,Dr STONE,NOES,"I rise to reof enject the amendments moved by the member for Bowman. We have already rejected the amendment moved by the member for Lindsay, which did not change the status quo. Sadly, the amendments by the member for Bowman do not change the status quo, which has now persisted for more than 10 years. In 10 years, not a single pharmaceutical company has applied to have RU486 evaluated because the 1996 Harradine amendment politicised the process. His amendment exchanged the scientific evidence based evaluation of the drug by the TGA with a unilateral decision by the health minister of the day. It is not our task as elected representatives in this place to decide by what medical method a woman is given a pregnancy termination by her doctor. If we followed such logic to its conclusion we would be deciding by what surgical method a termination was performed. That is not our task as elected members in this our great democracy. Why? It is because abortions are a lawful procedure under certain circumstances in every state and territory, and that debate was settled some 30 years ago. This debate is not about women's access to terminations. All of us would prefer, of course, fewer unwanted pregnancies and all of us, because of the personal trauma that is associated with having to have a termination, would want to work towards reducing the factors that lead to unwanted pregnancies. But this bill is not about better sex education and counselling. That is a debate for tomorrow. Nor can we ever accuse this parliament under our leadership of shirking any difficult decision. The bill being debated here today ensures that our parliament can again be assured that Australian doctors have the safest and best possible options available to help women patients who need to have a termination. It is as simple as that. The Laming amendments continue to politicise the decision about what the TGA recommends as the best, most safe options available to doctors. For example, we now have before the government three requests for approval of RU486 for use by individual doctors for their own patients. These three applications were lodged last December when the clinics saw the process had a chance of being returned to scientific assessment. Under the Laming amendments, each of these cases would be brought before the parliament and you could virtually guarantee they would be debated, even if the TGA had approved their applications. Ultimately, you would expect those debates to end up with the right outcome, but they would, I am quite sure, make our pharmaceutical companies in Australia think twice about trying to have a general application for this drug brought before the TGA. I repeat: it is not our political task to assess the safety of this or any drug. The TGA are amongst the world's best and were set up to handle the evaluation and monitoring of all drugs in Australia. It is their business. We need to reject these amendments, well meaning as they are, and simply get on with the job.",73
31,Mr KATTER,NOES,"I was appalled at the statements by the Leader of the Opposition. He made them very definitively. He said that the Prime Minister should not have appointed a person to this portfolio who had certain beliefs. He then proceeded to use the example of appointing a pacifist as defence minister. My mind immediately leapt to the fact that one of the ALP's greatest ever leaders, their war leaderCurtin-was a very avowed pacifist. Most people in Australia, the vast bulk, would say that he made a very good war leader. The sectarian nature of the attack upon the minister appalled me. I asked for the Hansard because I did not believe that he said it, but, if there was any doubt in anyone's mind, he went on to give an example. So Kerry Nettle's T-shirt lives on in this place. The Hansard speaks for itself. Ms Gillard-I am loath to do so, Mr Speaker, but I rise on a point of order. The stage of the debate we are in at the moment is addressing the amendments moved by Mr Laming, the member for Bowman. These remarks are not in any way relevant to that question.",74
32,The SPEAKER,NOES,The point of order raised by the Manager of Opposition Business is a valid point of order. I would ask member for Kennedy to come back to the amendments before the chair.,74
33,Mr KATTER,NOES,"I have said what I have said, Mr Speaker.",75
34,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"I rise to support the amendments moved by the member for Bowman. In principle, this is because I recognise-and I commend this to the chamber-that the debate on the bill that is before the chamber today is more than merely a debate on the safety and efficacy of RU486. It is more than merely a debate about saying whether or not we as a parliament can delegate authority to the TGA or whether we as a parliament can rely solely on the advice of the TGA when it comes to restricted goods under the Therapeutic Goods Act. Much more than this, the reason the member's amendments should be supported-the reason an amended bill should go through the chamber-is that the fact we have had 2½ days of debate on this topic underscores the fundamental importance and recognition in the Australian community that this debate is about more than safety and efficacy. There is a third dimension to this debate, and that is the question of morality in these kinds of debates. In saying that, I hasten to add that I am not someone who is seeking to impose my personal viewpoints on othersquite the contrary. What is clear from survey after survey throughout the Australian community is that Australians-irrespective of whether they are Christian, Muslim, atheist or agnostic-hold very strong views on the issue of abortion. The simple fact that there are strong views highlights the fact that this issue embraces so much more than merely a consideration of safety and efficacy, particularly with respect to RU486. So if we accept the notion that there is more at stake than merely the safety and effithe cacy of RU486 and that there is this third issue dealing with the morality of these kinds of drugs and dealing with the fact that in the future we can expect there to be an increasing encroachment on moral and ethical issues with respect to restricted goods as science develops them further, then surely there is no better place than the floor of this parliament for us to consider whether or not we wish to have these kinds of drugs imported, legalised or restricted in any particular way by the TGA. I readily admit that the structure of the current bill is flawed. I indicated that in my speech last night. But we now have before us an opportunity to correct that flaw. We now have before us an opportunity to make an informed decision whereby this parliament can take the very best advice offered to it by the TGA and then put it in a much greater and more detailed matrix-one that looks at those other considerations and does not merely say that the only issues here are safety and efficacy. If we do only that it will be a sell-out for the Australian people. We could say to them that we are doing this because those who are opposed to the bill as it currently stands do so because they seek to impose their will on others, but that would be untrue. This is not about the imposition of any particular religious faith. This is not about whether or not the minister for health happens to be a Catholic. This is a fundamental decision that is underwritten by the Australian people, who have indicated their very strong views that abortion needs to be debated and that we as representatives of the people must exercise the will of the people by making these decisions come back to us to incorporate that third element. Certainly, no-one would argue that safety and efficacy considerations are best left to the TGA. This bill in no way undermines the ability to do that. But to deny that there is this third element-a third consideration-is to close one's eyes to the fact that, irrespective of background, all Australians know that there is this third element be considered. I strongly urge all members to get behind the amendments moved by the member for Bowman. They are considered amendments. They enable us to take the very best advice from the TGA, but also ensure that supreme in the decision making is the will of the Australian people. We, as representatives of the Australian people, should be the final arbiters on these very facts.",75
35,Ms GILLARD,NOES,"I rise to speak against the amendments moved by the member for Bowman, though I believe he has moved them in extreme good faith and has argued very well for them in this place. The amendments before the chamber, and indeed this bill, are not, in my view, about the legality of abortion. That has been decided elsewhere in this country in the parliaments of our states and territories. It has should. been inevitable that in the course of dealing with this bill in the chamber people have made comments about their attitude toward abortion, and I understand that. Many members, including the minister for health, have adopted the Bill Clinton terminology that they would like to see a circumstance where abortion was safe, legal and rare. I agree with those comments. We would all like to see a circumstance where abortion was safe, legal and rare. But we need to be honest enough to say that that is not about parliamentary oversight and disallowance motions. If we were to truly live in a world where abortion was safe, legal and rare then we would need to live in a world where there was no sexual violence against women. We would need to live in a world where no woman was ever bullied or pressured into having sex. We would need to live in a world where the mass media did not continuously say to women that the sum of their selfworth was defined by their sexual desirabilto ity to men. We would need to live in a world where contraception never failed. We would need to live in a world where people understood how to use contraception. We would need to live in a world where medical science had defeated some of the most profound and disabling birth defects. I wish we lived in that world, and we should all be striving to attain it, but the stark reality is that we do not. When we do not live in that world it is inevitable that women from time to time-many with the heaviest of hearts-will exercise the decision to have an abortion. What we are debating today is no more than this: when they make that choice within the legal frameworks of the states and territories in which they live, should they have an option other than surgical abortion, provided that medical experts say that is safe and effective? I say that they I am pro-choice-I strenuously object to the terminology ‘pro-abortion'; I have never met anybody who is pro-abortion and I am not. I understand that those who have a different view about abortion to mine-those who are not pro-choice-might be concerned if there was evidence that the availability of RU486 increased the abortion rate. There is no such evidence. If you look around the world, there is no such evidence that RU486 increases the abortion rate. Whilst I respect the moral compass of those who do not believe in choice, I do not understand a circumstance where people say ‘morality lies in the method'. That is what I think we are looking at today. I do not see why people should say there is a moral difference between surgical abortions or medical abortions. I do not see how that can be put. The amendments moved by the member for Bowman would cause, if the TGA decided that RU486 was safe and effective, a disallowance debate on that. It would be inevitable that one member of this House and one member of the Senate, if not more, would move for disallowance. Let us just imagine that we were having that disallowance debate. Is anybody seriously suggesting that people would be coming up to the dispatch box and putting more expert views on the question of safety and effectiveness than the TGA had? No. People would be coming up to this dispatch box and putting their views on abortion. I do not think a disallowance procedure should be set in law which would mean that we refight the abortion debate inappropriately in this parliament time after time. I do not think that is right. I also think if these amendments were passed we would have an effective ban because no manufacturer would seek to put RU486 to the TGA for a safety and effectiveness assessment and spend all the money to get that done if they were then going to face the political vagaries of this place. It on those grounds that I ask people to reject these amendments. I respect the fact that they were moved-I think it is good that we have canvassed the issue-but, ultimately, they are not acceptable, they should be rejected and we should vote for the bill.",76
36,Dr WASHER,NOES,"I also wish to speak against the amendments of the member of Bowman. The amendments were moved in good faith, and I respect the member for Bowman. The amendments would not only defeat the purpose of the bill, allowing political interests to outweigh medical and scientific advice, but also magnify the existing uncertainty surrounding this drug. This uncertainty would almost certainly guarantee that no sponsor company would apply for importation and distribution of RU486 in Australia. In the unlikely situation of a company or companies applying, every application for RU486 and other abortifacients evaluated by the TGA would need to be again debated by this parliament. I respect every member who has contributed to this debate, but I do not think we need to repeat the arguments over and over. I urge all members to vote against these amendments.",77
37,Mr HUNT,NOES,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (1.25 pm)-I wish to make three simple points in support of the Laming amendments. The first is that I believe, for those who wish to maintain the status quo, they should support these amendments because they preserve the sovereignty of parliament. On the alternative side, for those who would prefer change-and I respect and actually agree with the position outlined by the member for Lalor that the essential question in this debate is whether or not a new class of termination be made available to Australian women, that is, the class of medical termination-these amendments do not prevent that. It means that the ethical deciis sion we take is not before the TGA makes its decision, which is what we are doing if we vote yes now, but afterwards. Why is that important? It is because the TGA (1) sets out its medical opinion, which I think it is consistent for this House to look at, but (2) sets out conditions for use. As somebody who supports the extension of the right to medical termination through the use of RU486, I believe that the appropriate time for the parliament to make the ethical decision is after the TGA has provided its information and set out the conditions in which it would apply. On either account, we are making an ethical decision, because if we decide yes now we are making the ethical decision that we give in-principle support for medical termination, if the TGA agrees. Alternatively, we would also be making an ethical decision but an ethical decision which says, ‘Given that the TGA has made its decision, we now give our ethical support but we do so on the basis of the best advice in Australia and the available conditions.' So I respectfully disagree on that point. The final point on which I wish to respectfully disagree with all three speakers who have spoken against the amendments is the ‘time after time' proposition. That is the notion that we would face a series of disallowance instruments over coming years. With great respect, that is a misconstruction of the bill and contrary to the information I have. It is a misconstruction because we would be called to decide not upon the circumstances of individual applications but upon a generic TGA application. The best advice I have is that, on the pipeline of abortifacients and their likelihood of being brought to Australia, this chamber is likely to face one disallowable instrument over the coming five years. I repeat: on the best advice I have available, it is not a question of ‘time after time'; it is one decision that is likely to be faced over the next five years because none of the other possible drugs is likely to be brought before the TGA for an application. For those reasons, I strongly support the Laming amendments.",77
38,Mr SLIPPER,NOES,"I rise to urge support for the amendments moved by the honourable member for Bowman and to plead with those people who voted to give the bill second reading approval to consider that the amendments of the member for Bowman actually incorporate what they principally want to achieve through the passage of this bill. The first part of the explanatory memorandum points out that this bill is designed to repeal ministerial approval and to leave approval with the Therapeutic Goods Administration over access to RU486. It goes on to say: The purpose of this bill is to remove responsibilyou ity for approval for RU486 from the Minister for Health and Ageing and to provide responsibility for approval of RU486 to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The amendments currently before the House pass that responsibility to the Therapeutic Goods Administration while also reserving to the House the opportunity, were the House to agree, to disallow that determination by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. These amendments enable honourable members on both sides of this debate to vote for them with a great sense of confidence and a great sense of comfort, knowing that the situation which will result in the event of the enactment of these amendments will be much better than the situation were these amendments to be defeated. Similarly, those members who opposed the second reading of the bill could vote for these amendments with confidence, knowing that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will have a right to debate, if the parliament so desires, a determination of the Therapeutic Goods Administration with respect to RU486. I believe that the member for Bowman's amendments are worthy of consideration, even by people who were very strong proponents of the bill in its unamended form. I plead with people who support the bill in its original form to consider that the amendments moved by the honourable member for Bowman enact what they want to see while still reserving to the people's representatives in both houses of the parliament the opportunity of expressing a view. The people of Australia elect us to make decisions on their behalf. I would be the first to admit that, as elected representatives, we cannot be technically expert in every aspect of medicine or every aspect of law. The proposal put forward by the member for Bowman recognises the primacy of, I suppose would say, the scientific knowledge of the Therapeutic Goods Administration while also reserving to us, the representatives of the people, the opportunity to pass a view in the event that either house of the parliament might not agree with the decision of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I commend the amendments to the House.",78
39,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,NOES,"I want to encourage the parliament to see an opportunity today to arrive at something approaching a consensus view on this bill. We have that opportunity. I am one who did not support the bill when given the opportunity during the second reading debate. A lot has been said about the bill. Speakers from all perspectives have had their say on it. And do you know what? We are all respectful of our representative democracyour parliamentary representation. We would be mugs if we did not accept the outcome of this vote, which very clearly will be to see the passage of the bill through the parliament. I may not be very happy about that; I may prefer that it fail. However, in good faith, what anyone of us can do is to least accept the outcome. The verdict of this chamber will be that the bill, either amended or unamended, will pass this chamberhopefully amended-and returned to the Senate to be ratified. But let me ask this: why don't all the speakers who have begun their speeches by saying ‘I respect the view of others' put that into practice and show some respect for the people who, in good faith, have put up an amendment which basically seeks to deliver the broad outcomes of the bill, which is the repeal of any ministerial involvement in the approval of an abortifacient drug? Show some good faith. In fact, both the Kelly and the Laming amendments sought to give some ground in good faith. We are now only debating the member for Bowman's amendments. I think they show good faith; they give some ground. Equally, it has to be said that not one member who has spoken against the Laming amendments has been willing to concede the point that abortifacients do amount to a different and separate class of drug-not one. Why can't we hear somebody acknowledge-if you are not a fundamentalist on this issue then please acknowledge-that a drug which does not have a therapeutic use, a drug which does not actually cure a medical disease, should be treated differently? This is not a difficult intellectual argument. If you are not an ideologue, if you are not a fundamentalist on this issue, then please take some sense from this. Equally, if this is not in any way linked to a moral issue then why are we having a conscience vote? Why have our respective party leaders recognise that this is not just about process, that there is more to this issue than just expert advice? With great respect, the Minister for Workforce Participation said that it is not our political task to assess the safety and efficacy of medicines. I absolutely agree. That is quite true. The purpose of the Laming amendments is not in any way to molest that concept. In fact, one of the Laming amendments supports what the minister has said but adds a further dimension by recognising that members of the TGA are not appointed on the basis of their ethical background or ethical expertise. To say that this class of drug should be the domain of only scientific experts is greatly disrespectful of parliamentary democracy. I am prepared to concede that to say that the TGA is not able to provide advice is disrespectful to science and to the Public Service. I ask this chamber to again consider whether it is fair and reasonable to obtain consensus on this issue. We can deliver it. We can send a message to the Australian people that we believe that the parliament has an important role in assessing the future use of these drugs while, at the same time, accepting expert medical advice where that is appropriate. I urge all my colleagues and others involved to show good faith, to give some ground and to acknowledge that we have an opportunity to achieve consensus on this is- Brough, M.T. sue. So I beg you, I urge you, to support the Cobb, J.K. Laming amendments. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Laming's) be agreed to. The House divided. [1.41 pm] (The Speaker-Hon.

45,Mr ALBANESE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Grayndler) (1.56 pm)I move: That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent order of the day No. 4, private members business, relating to the Avoiding Dangers Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005 being called on forthwith to provide the House with an immediate chance to further debate and vote on the bill in the light following reasons: (1) the fact that today is the first anniversary of the Kyoto protocol coming into effect after being ratified by 158 countries in the EU; (2) climate change remains the number one environmental challenge facing the global community; (3) not ratifying the Kyoto protocol means that Australia is restricted from the economic opportunities arising from the global carbon trading market; (4) not ratifying the Kyoto protocol means that Australian companies will not be able to benefit from the clean development mechanism; (5) not ratifying the Kyoto protocol means that Australia cannot benefit from the joint implementation mechanism of the protocol; (6) not ratifying the Kyoto protocol and establishing a national emissions trading scheme means Australian companies cannot minimise the cost of adjusting to a carbon constrained economy; (7) as Australia is on track to meet our Kyoto protocol target of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions by 2012, there is no logical reason for Australia to remain outside the international framework; (8) Australia's ability to influence UN climate change agreements is undermined by our isolationist position-the December 2005 UN Montreal Climate Summit agreed to extend the Kyoto protocol beyond 2012; (9) international security is advanced through agreements such as the Kyoto protocol, which promote a common purpose; and (10) climate change is the ultimate intergenerational issue-our response will determine the quality of life of our children and grandchildren. I do this because if debate on the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005 is not brought on today the matter will drop off the Notice Paper. One of the things that we need to do is of the make sure that there is appropriate discussion and determination in this parliament. In spite of the rhetoric of those opposite, the Montreal conference agreed to extend the Kyoto protocol beyond 2012. That means that, by Australia being isolated through not being a party to the protocol, we are excluding ourselves from participation.",82

Australia stands out in being isolated from the rest of the global community on the No. 1 issue facing the world. As the member for Grayndler pointed out, Australia and the United States alone have refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol; yet, when the issue was first debated, at the time the government talked about Kyoto being a win-win situation.

53,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's 31 October 2005 statement to parliament: ... having received in the case of Australia full responses and cooperation and full documentation, if there were anything lacking in the behaviour of Australia in relation to her obligations Volcker inquiry would have so reported. I also refer to the fact that the WA provided no documents to the Volcker inquiry. Given that the Wheat Export Authority was the government authority responsible for monitoring AWB export contracts and that its documents were of direct relevance to the Volcker inquiry, why did the Prime Minister totally mislead parliament on 31 October when he said that he had provided full documentation to Volcker?",83
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not mislead the House. Let me repeat that the information that I gave in that answer was a very fair and accurate reflection of the way in which the government had responded to Volcker. Let me further inform the House that the Chief Executive Officer of WA has advised his minister-and I have in turn been advisedthat he and senior members of his staff met with the UN senior investigator, Bernard O'Donnell, and his assistant, Mr Trevor Sutton, at WA offices in Canberra on 25 February 2005. WA informed O'Donnell of the role of WA and of the confidentiality constraints of the Wheat Marketing Act as well as those between WA and AWB International. WA advised that, in order to provide material to the Volcker inquiry, WA would require the consent of AWB International. The authority suggested that the detailed material being requested by Volcker would most likely be held by AWBI. O'Donnell acknowledged the WA's position and informed the authority that he would shortly meet AWBI people in Melbourne. It is perfectly plain from that that we have followed a transparent process. Once again, this attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to misrepresent the behaviour of the government, to slur decent public servants and to slur decent ministers is being exposed for what it is. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition-who prances around this counthe try feigning outrage-that, alone among the governments of this world, the government I lead has established a transparent inquiry with the powers of a royal commission, and they will get to the bottom of it. I look ward to debating the conclusion of that inquiry with the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament. Oil for Food Program",83
55,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of steps the United Kingdom has taken in response to the Volcker report.,84
56,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question and his interest. As I think the House is beginning know now, the final Volcker report was issued in October 2005, very recently. Like Australia, the United Kingdom government fully cooperated, to the best of my understanding, with the Volcker commission, but in the final report there were 14 British panies named as having been involved with illicit payments, including two from the giant pharmaceutical group Glaxo, which I think honourable members would be familiar with. By the way, the report also named a number of UK personalities as having received barrels of oil from Saddam Hussein, including the member of the House of Commons for Bethnal Green and Bow, Mr George Galloway. Honourable members will remember that this once Labour member of parliament was a very strong supporter of Saddam Hussein. Following the publication of the Volcker report-and there is absolutely no evidence that the British government had any involvement in or complicity with the payment of kickbacks by the 14 British companiesthe British government stated, on 22 November last year, that it would bring the report to the attention of the Serious Fraud fice and they would review Volcker to determine whether further investigations were warranted. But what the British government fordid not do-and made perfectly clear it would not do-was set up a separate independent inquiry or a royal commission. In saying that, I make no criticism of the British government, despite the fact that there were 14 British companies involved. What is interesting is that there are not allegations in Britain that the British government should have known all about those 14 companies being involved in making illicit payments to entities in Saddam Hussein's regime. It simply follows that in this country the to government has set up an independent commission of inquiry with all the powers of a royal commission, and that independent commission of inquiry is able to review all of the evidence and to make findings. We look forward to hearing what the Cole comcommission has to say on or around 31 March when it is scheduled to complete its work. But I make the point that, of the 65 other countries which had over 2,000 companies that Volcker found had been involved in kickbacks-14 in the UK, four in Canada, 15 in Sweden, over 50 in Germany, two in New Zealand, 21 in Denmark and over 50 in Switzerland-none has set up an inquiry that is commensurate with the Cole inquiry. None of them has set up a transparent and open process in the way we have. And I know, from the response our diplomats are getting around the world, that what the Australian government has done in response to this has been well received and well regarded. Oil for Food Program",84
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It follows my previous question, in particular the character of the answer he gave. I refer to the Prime MinOfister's statement to parliament this week: We established this inquiry because Volcker had made an adverse finding about AWB Ltd and other companies; he did not make an adverse finding about the Australian government. If he had, then the terms of referencefor the Cole inquirywould have gone further than they have. How can this claim have any credibility, now that we know that the Volcker inquiry did not receive full documentation from the Australian government, as your last answer amply demonstrated? Isn't the Prime Minister's entire Volcker defence constructed on the basis of a lie?",84
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question is no. The chain of events is very simple. Volcker carried out an investigation. He had the full cooperation of this government. Whether he had the full cooperation of other governments, or the full cooperation of AWB Ltd, is a matter for those respective parties answer. It is worth reminding the House that even Volcker said in his finding that there was no direct evidence that AWB Ltd knew of the kickbacks, rather that they should have known. There was no finding against the government-none at all. And not a skerrick of evidence has been produced by the Leader of the Opposition to justify the falsehood that he continues to assert in this parliament. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to produce some evidence as distinct from just rhetorical assertions. They have spent a couple of weeks slurring the reputation of the Deputy Prime Minister. They have spent a couple of weeks slurring the reputations of senior public servants in the government. All the while, we have an inquiry going on in a manner transparent beyond, I believe, any other government's investigation in the aftermath of the Volcker inquiry. Australia alone has established an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. No other government has been willing to do that. And as a result of that inquiry the blame will fall where it may. We have established an inquiry under the chairmanship of an outstanding Australian lawyer. He says clearly that he has ample powers to make findings of fact ‘in relation to the behaviour of the Commonwealth'. He does not say ‘the public servants'. He does not say ‘the WA'. He says generically ‘the Commonwealth'. That includes everybody who is part of the Commonwealth. If he needs additional terms of reference, he will ask for them; and undoubtedly that request will be met. In the light of all of that, this is an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to mislead the Australian people, to assert falsely that there were 10, 12, 13-what will it be at the weekend: 20?-warnings given to the Australian government. In reality those asserto tions are falsehoods. I reject them on my own behalf and I reject them on behalf of my government. NA",85

60,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the United Nations' role in the oil for food program and what steps it took in response to the Volcker report?,85
61,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, first I would like to join you in saying how pleased I am that Phil Gramm is here. It is good to see a former distinguished senator in this place. I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. As I said in answer to the previous question that I was asked, the Volcker report was issued at the end of last year. It made clear that the oil for food program was administered by the United Nations. On page 28 of volume II in a section entitled ‘Management of the Oil-for-Food Program' Volcker said: The contract was forwarded through the company's home country mission to the ... Contracts Processing and Monitoring Division, where it was subject to review for the details of pricing and value ... ... the contract was then subject to the 661 mittee'sthat is, of the UNreview and approval ... Upon approval of a goods contracts, the goods could be transported into Iraq. Volcker makes conclusions about the central failings of the United Nations in administering the oil for food program. He says that Benon Sevan, who was the Executive Director of the Office of the Iraq Program, ‘failed to maintain and support the officers' responsibilities'. He also said that members of the Security Council and of the 661 Committee ‘must shoulder their share of the blame in providing uneven and wavering direction in the implementation of the program'. In a press release Mr Volcker said: The central conclusion of the Volcker Committee was the failures in UN oversight in management. He also said: The need for stronger executive leadership, thoroughgoing administrative reform and more reliable controls and auditing with the UN is understood. I do not think there is much debate-the Secretary-General of the UN would agree with this-that the UN did fail in administering the oil for food program. Kofi Annan, as the Secretary-General, has accepted responsibility for that. Had there been warning signs for the Australian government in the information that the opposition argues are warning signs, then it logically follows that there were warning signs for the other 65 countries who had companies involved in the so-called kickbacks. Yet we were apparently the only country in the world, according to the opposition, which was supposed to have detected those warnings. The fact that the other 65 failed to detect the warnings is all right! We should have been able to detect the warning signs. It simply demonstrates two things. First of all, Comthe opposition do not know how the program worked. Secondly, it is perfectly clear that they have spent a long time making puerile party political points, and I am sure the great public of Australia reject their cheapskate politicking.

70,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I can inform her that in 2000 as part of A New Tax System the government introduced the largest tax reform in Australia's history, aboldisgusting ishing wholesale sales tax, bed tax, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on marketable securities and other taxes in return for the introduction of a uniform rate 10 per cent GST. Every single dollar of that GST goes to state governments. Every single dollar, by legislation, goes to state governments. Since 2000, $150 billion has gone to the state governments of Australia and of this South Australia has received $17.3 billion, including a $402 million windfall over and above what it would have received had it kept the old taxes and had they been adjusted in accordance with the growth. That is the basis of the South Australian economy at the moment, and that is what is underpinning government services in South Australia. So I was concerned to see the member for Makin send me a leaflet, which is now being circulated in South Australia on behalf of the South Australian Labor government, which claims: The federal Liberals are collecting tax revenues and the Rann government keeps delivering quality services. What does it say the tax revenue is that the federal government is collecting? GST. Let me make it clear that every last dollar of GST is being received by state governments and in South Australia in 2005-06 that is $3,394 million. It is projected to be $3,573 million the next year and $3,723 million the year after. This leaflet, which carries disgusting lies, is authorised by one D.

I call on Premier Rann today to dissociate himself from Mr Feeney, to withdraw that leaflet, to apologise to all South Australians and to not go into an election on the basis of disgusting lies like that. If Mr Rann, the Premier of South Australia, has a shred of honesty, he will have that leaflet withdrawn. I will make another offer. He could leave that leaflet out there and return $3,394 million to the Commonwealth government. We will give him the choice.

81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to legal opinion provided by former president of the Law Council of Australia and former commission of inquiry head, Mr Bret Walker SC, which states: The full deployment of the royal commission's powertalking about the Cole commissionto investigate and make findings of fact cannot squarely address the question whether there has been any Commonwealth wrongdoing. Given that Mr Walker's legal opinion is based on an analysis of both Mr Cole's existing terms of reference and Mr Cole's subsequent statement explaining his terms of reference, will the Prime Minister now widen Mr Cole's powers so he is totally unfettered in uncovering the truth of who is responsible for this $300 million wheat for weapons scandal?",88
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Without in any way criticising the legal expertise of Mr Walker, which I do not seek to do, the unavoidable reality for the Leader of the Opposition is that Mr Cole QC-whose repute in the legal profession is at least the equal of that of Mr Walker if not, given his greater experience, superior-has made it very plain that he has ample powers to make the relevant findings of fact. He has made it perfectly plain that if he wants additional terms of reference he will ask for them.

83,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House how the government is boosting the number of doctors in Queensland? What barriers does the government face in lifting doctor numbers in my state?,88
84,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I can assure him that this government does not just talk about more medical student places; we are actually delivering more doctors for people right around Australia, particularly in the great state of Queensland. Since 2000 the number of publicly funded first-year medical student places has increased by 30 per cent. By 2011 the number of medical graduates a year will increase from the current level of about 1,300 to 2,100-that is a 60 per cent increase-thanks to already implemented measures by this government. Premier Beattie persists in claiming that Queensland's doctor shortage is somehow all the federal government's fault, even though the number of medical graduates a year in Queensland has increased by 25 per cent since 1996, even though the Howard government has established three new medical schools in Queensland and even though the number of publicly funded first-year medical student places in Queensland has almost doubled from just over 200 to over 400 since 1996. The problem in Queensland is not so much a shortage of doctors but a shortage of doctors who are prepared to work in hospitals run by the Beattie Labor government. Last year 761 doctors resigned from Queensland public hospitals in just eight months. That is a 20 per cent staff turnover in just six Iraq? months. What does it say about the quality of the management of the Queensland public hospital system that in two years they have lost 1,691 from Queensland public hospitals? That is a 40 per cent staff turnover in just two years. That is a disgraceful, appalling result and it is wholly and solely the responsibility of the Beattie Labor government. Premier Beattie says that this does not matter because they have recently appointed some 825 doctors to Queensland public hospitals. So they are replacing experienced doctors with inexperienced doctors and they are replacing Australian trained doctors largely with foreign trained doctors. That certainly does not encourage people to have confidence in the public hospitals of Queensland. I ask the people of Queensland: who do you trust? Do you trust the Howard government, which is delivering more medical student places, or Premier Beattie? Why would you ever trust a government which has lost 40 per cent of its own public hospital doctors in just two years? Oil for Food Program",88
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Brendan Stewart, the AWB chairman, told Mr Volcker in a letter dated 20 September last year that: AWB did not make or conceal any illicit payments to the former Iraqi regime. And elsewhere: For example, it is obvious from your latest report that the committee is concerned about the use of fees for fictitious trucking services paid to alleged transport companies. AWB played no part in this. We did not sit within this category.

91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It goes, Mr Speaker, to an orderly investigation of this matter. I know that a lot of evidence against AWB people has been given before the Cole commission, but unless and until the company and all of its officers, including its chairman, its former chairman and its managing directors, and any other directors who may be called, have had an opportunity to give their evidence and until the Cole inquiry has made a finding in relation to these matters, we must respect the process. We are big in this place, when it suits our political purposesthe Labor Party is a good example of thison saying, ‘Let's have a process. Let it be examined.' I know it does not look good at the moment for AWB, but let them have their full day in court. That is what is meant to be the rule of law that governs this place. It is meant to be the rule by which all of us live. Let us have a full laying out of all of the facts before the Cole inquiry, and let this very fine lawyer bring down his findings. The Leader of the Opposition asked me against that background why Mr Brendan Stewart will accompany the Deputy Prime Minister to Iraq. It is for the very simple son-and I thought the Leader of the Opposition would have understood this; I would have thought it was obvious why he is to accompany us-that AWB Ltd holds the pool. The advice I currently have is that, if you are to sell wheat into Iraq and you are to participate in the latest tender, the only wheat that is available is the wheat legally controlled by AWB Ltd. Unless the Leader of the Opposition is into acquisition of property on unjust terms, unless the Leader of the Opposition is into breaking the Constitution of Australia, we have to deal with the legal holder and controller of that wheat. So I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that, of all the questions he has asked on this issue, that really is a very silly question to ask. Mr Brendan Stewart is going for that reason. In the delegation there will be representatives of the wheat industry and there may be others who represent the interests that are involved in this issue. But this a government mission. It will be led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. The purpose of the mission is not to score political points, like the Leader of the Opposition. The purpose of the mission is to look after the Australian wheat growers. Government Schools",89

93,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for his question, and note his deep interest in schools in his electorate. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that recently I announced the outcome of round 2 for the $1 billion Investing in our rea- Schools Program in the ACT, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Under round 2 for these areas, $36 million has been invested in schools. Under round 1 of the $1 billion Investing in our Schools Program, the Australian government has funded $100 million in 4,040 projects in 2,614 schools across Australia. Let us remember what this program is about. The Australian government is responding to a failure on the part of state and territory governments to adequately maintain schools owned and operated by state and territory governments. That is why $700 million of this billion dollar program is directed to state and territory government schools for basic infrastructure for those schools. This has been an incredibly popular program. Members on this side of the House will recall how excited teachers, parents and students were to be able to get funding for some basic infrastructure needs for their is schools. We have been able to provide funding for air conditioning, for shade structures, for toilet blocks-some had not been renovated in 20 or 30 years. The member for Kingston will be delighted with the outcome in his electorate. Over $639,000 was provided to schools in his electorate, and I trust that schools in his electorate will also apply for funding in round 2. I suspect that one of the biggest fans of this program is the member for Jagajaga. She would have been so excited to have been able to announce that 28 Victorian government schools in the electorate of Jagajaga received over $883,000 for basic infrastructure.

As far as AWB knew, inland transportation component of its UN approved contracts was legitimate. Given that this letter was copied to you, Prime Minister-even though you seem to think you have no knowledge of it-and that the materials in it are so demonstrably false in terms of everything that has been presented to the Cole commission and to Volcker's own inquiries, is there no other person in the grain business capable of conducting this foray to Iraq effectively other than Mr Stewart, who is so deeply compromised by these things?",91
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, as of now, as I understand it, there has not been evidence presented which directly contradicts the position taken by Mr Stewart-and he is yet to be given his opportunity. I would have thought that ordinary principles of justice entitle that man to be heard. I thought the Labor Party once stood for ordinary principles of justice. I thought the once-great Australian Labor Party believed in the Aussie fair go. I thought the idea was that you were innocent until you were proven guilty. But apparently the Labor Party does not believe in that. I am following the evidence that is being presented to the Cole inquiry very closely, of but I intend to withhold judgment until that very learned commissioner, widely respected in Australian legal and corporate circles, has brought down his conclusions. I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that AWB Ltd is a public company. I would remind him that many of the shareholders of AWB Ltd are in fact Australian wheat growers. I would further remind himMr Danby interjecting",91
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne Ports is warned!,91
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that it is in the interests of Australian wheat growers, being sharethe holders in AWB Ltd, that the difficult situation in which the company now finds itself is not further aggravated by statements made without any basis in fact. The proper thing to do, the decent thing to do, is the approach that was advocated by a former Labor trade minister before the Senate estimates committee on 23 June 1994-and I refer to the member for Canberra, I think it was; a former trade minister-when he was asked certain questions in relation to an inquiry, believe it or not, into Centenary House. Do you remember that? This is what he had to say: But this is a matter, I understand, being inquired into by the judicial inquiry and I think it should be left there. And, properly enough, Senator Kemp, on behalf of the then opposition, said: I take your point. I am aware that there is a major inquiry",91
99,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question was about the delegation going to Iraq and whether in Co-operative Bulk Handling, the Grains Council or somewhere else there is not a person capable",91
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition asked quite a wide-ranging question which covered quite a few areas. The Prime Minister is in order.,92
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Brendan Stewart is the executive chairman of AWB Ltd. No adverse findings have been made against him by Commissioner Cole. The commission goes on. AWB Ltd is the holder of the wheat pool. If we are to have a satisfactory outcome for the wheat growers of Australia and not some kind of political hit scored by one side or other in this parliament, if we are really terested in selling wheat to Iraq, we really need to have the company that owns the wheat involved in some way. It is in fact quite hard to sell wheat that you do not have. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could sit down and think about that. Here he is, saying: ‘Get the wheat into Iraq. Find our market. Save our farmers.' In order to do that, you have to at least deal-at a minimum-on a commercial basis with the holder of the wheat. Doesn't the Leader of the Opposition understand the way in which AWB Ltd is involved? It has acquired the wheat from the wheat growers. Why doesn'the talk to the member for Hotham? He would tell him. Why doesn'the talk to Gavvy over there? He would tell him. They know something about primary industry in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, in order to try and score a political point, is completely losing track of how all this works. We have an inquiry. Let it get on with its job. In the meantime, let the Deputy Prime Minister lead a delegation to Iraq on behalf of Australian wheat growers. Australian Defence Force",92
102,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister advise the House of how the government is investing in new capabilities for the Australian Defence Force?,92
103,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert for his question, and I say to the 3½ thousand defence personnel in Townsville that they have no stronger advocate in this country than the member for Herbert. If there is anything in particular that they want me to know, he will transmit that directly to me. The first responsibility of any government is the defence of the country, the defence of the Australia. All the people on this side of the in- House-and, I suspect, former senator Phil do Graham-know this only too well. There are two things that are required if you are going to be well equipped to defend your country. The first is that you have to have political will. There has to be a determination to ensure that Defence is well equipped and well ahead of the technological and strategic changes throughout the world. The second thing you need is money. When this government came to office in 1996, 10 years ago, we had at that stage a defence force where only 42 per cent of our troops were combat ready. Today it is 62 per cent. We had a $10.3 billion deficit. We had serious problems with our submarines, given to us by a Labor government. What this government did in consolidating the finances of the country and to make sure that Australia had a strong economy was to make sure that Australia spent less than it earned. But the one area that was not reduced in expenditure at all was defence. At that time, this coalition, the Howard government, transferred through efficiency programs some $900 million from the tail of Defence, from the backend offices, to the front end of Defence. The government's vision for Defence was set out in a white paper in 2000, and over the 10-year period we committed to spending an extra $28½ billion on defence capability. We have already rolled out an additional $7 billion and that means, in plain language, almost 60 Abrams heavy tanks as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. We are also going to build three Australian air warfare destroyers. We are committed to building and purchasing two amphibious ships, which will carry up to 1,000 troops. We are also committed to 140 defence capability projects as a result of this. This government is also determined to strengthen our Army. In December last year we announced a $1½ billion increased investment in the Australian Army to make sure that it is mobile, that it can protect that it also has significant fire powersomething that the Leader of the Opposition certainly does not have in relation to the member for Hotham or the member for Corio. The one thing that is absolutely certain is that this government, under no circumstances, will be spooked by a political party of Paris Hiltons into doing anything other than making sure that the defence of Australia, the security of our region and the commitment to our international strategic interests are our No. 1 priority. Mr Bowen- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I take offence at the minister referring to any political party which includes a distinguished veteran, the member for Cowan, as a ‘party of Paris Hiltons'.",92
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the member for Prospect has made his point. Mr Trevor Flugge,93
105,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the former AWB chairman and National Party candidate Trevor Flugge was a representative of the Howard government on the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq? Can the Prime Minister inform the parliament how long this appointment lasted, whether his position was funded by the Australian taxpayer to the tune of $700,000 and whether this amount was paid to Mr Flugge by Australia's aid agency, AusAID?",93
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly know Mr Trevor Flugge; as indeed do those opposite. Mr Flugge was appointed to the Australian Wheat Board in 1984 by the Hawke government. He was Deputy Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board from 1990 to 1995, presumably an appointment made during the terms of office of both the Hawke and the Keating governments, and he was a director and chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, as it was then known, from 1995-that and would have been under the Keating government-until 2002. I do not disguise for a moment the fact that the government sought the involvement of Mr Flugge in postSaddam Iraq. I will tell you why we sought his involvement: it was because our principal concern at that time was to stop American wheat growers from getting our markets. Mr Rudd interjecting",93
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Griffith has asked his question.,93
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is about time the member for Griffith understood and recalled his own rhetoric from those days. His own rhetoric in 2002-03 was essentially that the government should get out of the way and leave it all to the AWB. That is what the member for Griffith was saying. Mr Rudd-Come on! We want to know how much he was paid.,93
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for Griffith continues to interject, having been constantly reminded. He is warned.",93
110,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He would have been remunerated. As to the precise amount and the precise source, I will obtain information on that and I will advise the member for Griffith. We are not disguising for a moment the fact that we encouraged the appointment of Mr Flugge. We thought Mr Flugge would fight hard for the Australian wheat industry. I do not remember the opposition saying at the time that it was a bad appointment. In fact, they said the opposite-just as in 2003 he was yelling from the rooftops that Downer and Howard should get out of the way and leave it all to the Australian Wheat Board. That is what he was saying. I go through those press statements with great interest-with great relish. The Labor Party are so hypocritical on this subject. Way back in 2002-03, they would not have a word said against AWB Ltd. Now they invite us to believe that, all along, they knew about it, we knew about it, the alarm bells were ringing and the warning bells were there. Mr Albanese- Mr SPEAKER ",94
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Has the Prime Minister concluded his answer?,94
112,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Mr Albanese interjecting,94
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. Air Safety,94
114,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House of measures the government is taking to ensure the safety of air traffic between Australia and Indonesia?,94
115,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to inform the honourable member that the Indonesian government is set to trial a new air surveillance system developed by Airservices Australia in alliance with the international airline data communications provider, SITA Inc. This trial will involve a new airspace surveillance technology, called Automatic Dependence Surveillance Broadcasting, or ADSB, and it will begin in Indonesia in May 2006.",94
116,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,94
118,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought honourable members opposite would be rather interested in the safety of air traffic between Australia and Indonesia, but it would seem that their minds are on other things. The reality is that there are about 60,000 flights in and out of Australia and through AustralianIndonesian air space every year. Close to half of those flights are operated by Qantas. There have been concerns about the safety of Indonesian air space management and this, therefore, is a significant step forward. It is sophisticated new technology and it involves aircraft broadcasting their position every second, with the signal being picked up by ground based ADSB receivers and forwarded to air traffic controllers. This technology is particularly well suited to countries with difficult terrain, and it is being assessed with the potential of it being introduced in Australia. We hope, in fact, that Australia will become the first country in the world to introduce this new technology by 2007. It has greater capacity to cover an entire country than the existing radar networks and will undoubtedly improve the management of international airspace. In addition to these initiatives, we are moving close to completing a $1.1 million project focusing on improved screening of passengers at Denpasar and Jakarta airports. We have got three transport specialist security people in Jakarta to work cooperatively with the local people to endeavour to upgrade security arrangements, and our last port of call project will help countries which operate flights into Australia to upgrade their security. That is important not just for the safety of travellers in those countries but to protect our own skies so that we do not import into this country from a last port of call someone with ill intent to our country. So we are undertaking very significant steps to improve the security and the management of our airspace to our near north. This development of ADSB technology and its introduction in Indonesia is a world first and will make a very significant improvement in the safety of the region. Oil for Food Program",94
119,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether Mr Flugge and Mr Long had a role in providing advice to the Coalition Provisional Authority on the implementation of the June 2003 memorandum of instruction which directed that a list of for food contracts which had 10 per cent kickbacks to them be prepared?,95
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not know. I will find out and let him know. National Security,95
121,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House of the government's national security information campaign, in particular the work of the national security hotline?",95
122,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I know of his interest in matters relating to law and order and security. Of course the national security public information campaign has been very successful in raising awareness in the Australian community of the hotline and its role. The fourth and final scheduled burst of advertising for the current campaign will start this Sunday for three weeks. The campaign will feature television, press, transit and outdoor advertising. Of course it is there to remind people of the importance of being vigilant in identifying possible signs also of terrorism and to report on any suspicious activity. The hotline is an integral component of our national counter-terrorism arrangements, and a high proportion of calls have provided helpful information in relation to investigations that we are undertaking. I am aware that there was a recent Morgan poll which reported that the overwhelming majority of Australians are aware of the national hotline and its role. That is clearly evident from the fact that 73,300 calls, letters and emails have been received since it commenced operations in 2002. Over half of these have provided information which has been of assistance to security and intelligence authorities as well as police. The number is prominently listed in the White Pages. I hope it is still on some fridges. The number, oil of course, for all of you, if you do not remember it, is 1800 123 400-not all that difficult, I might say. It is disappointing that the opposition has sought to deride and undermine the effectiveness of the national security hotline. It is obvious that the Labor Party does not recognise the value of engaging the community in relation to terrorism. I want to assure the House that the government remains committed to protecting the safety and security of Australians and that the national hotline is integral to our national security arrangements. Oil for Food Program",95
123,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House what responsibility Mr Flugge and Mr Long, representatives of the Howard government on the Coalition Provisional Authority, had in providing advice to the CPA on the September 2003 US Department of Defense report into the misuse of the oil for food program which required ‘additional documentation from suppliers for all potentially overpriced contracts'?",95
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be very happy to see if I can provide the honourable gentleman with any information in relation to that question. I must confess my inadequacy, in that I do not carry all of that minute detail around in my head. I lack the honourable gentleman's soaring capacity to do that. But I will do my best to find out. What I do happen to have, not in my head but in my hand, is a press release dated 20 August 2002. It was issued by the shadow minister for foreign affairs. It is headed ‘2003 Wheat sales to Iraq'. It says: The Federal Opposition welcomes the announcement by the Australian Wheat Board on the likely resumption of Australian wheat sales to Iraq in 2003. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. The Prime Minister has been asked a very simple and clear question which goes to",96
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is in order. I call the Prime Minister.,96
126,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me repeat: The Federal Opposition welcomes the announcement by the Australian Wheat Board on the likely resumption of Australian wheat sales to Iraq ... He then goes on to say: The Opposition congratulates the AWB for achieving a commercial outcome in the midstlisten to thisof the difficult foreign policy environment, which had been delivered to them by Foreign Minister Downer. There is an old saying which I am sure the member for Griffith would be aware of, and that is: would that my enemy would write a book. Let me vary it to say: would that the shadow minister would put out a statement. Mr Wilkie-That's just as obscene as Truss's tie!",96
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan is warned! Vocational and Technical Education,96
128,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Would the minister advise the House of how the government is training more young Australians to meet our nation's future skills needs?,96
129,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the question from the member for Dobell. In this country today we have an incredibly strong economy-a nation where we have too many jobs and not enough people. We have an amazing circumstance and it is such a big contrast to 10 years ago. The demographic changes in the world have fed into the fact that this is a very challenging environment for businesses to attract young people to the enormous and wide range of choices that they have. As a government, we have spent a decade undoing Labor's neglect. The ‘recession we had to have' trashed a generation of couldhave-been-trained Australians. It trashed 30,000 in one year under the leadership at that time of the member for Brand. In the electorate of Dobell, we had some 2,300 people in training as at June 2005. That is a 211 per cent increase on the number in training in 1995-and I know the member for Dobell is happy about that. In the publicly funded system today, 1.6 million people are being trained, which is half a million more than in 1995. The system is a world leader, but this government is not happy with that distinction. We can do, we will do and we are doing much more. In June last year, 391,200 people were in training, whereas in 1995 there were 143,790. Over the next four years we will be spending $10.1 billion-nearly $5 billion to the states and $1.4 billion in new incentives. That is the biggest-ever contribution lift to the task of training young Australians from any Australian government in this nation's history. For the Australian technical colleges proposal, there is $343 million for 25 colleges and we will announce soon on the Central Coast of New South Wales the outcome of our negotiations there-and I know the member for Robertson joins with the member for Dobell in being happy about that. There is the Tools for Your Trade Initiative, for which almost 35,000 people are eligible, and there are 42,300 people who are eligible for the trade learning scholarship. Last Friday's COAG saw the Prime Minister's leadership on this issue hit a new height. We are now in an environment where it is no longer just lip-service to but the delivery of recognition of skills across the state boundaries, easier pathways for overseas qualifications to be recognised in this country and, in particular, an end to the ‘time served' approach-the concept of ‘if you serve for four years, you are suddenly qualified'. We will see a defeat of that and we will see that before the end of the year. lar, in New South Wales and Western Australia, we will see opportunities for school based apprenticeships as well.",96
130,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
131,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite are interjecting with their complaints and lack of interest in this issue. They would be very wise to look at what Sharan Burrow and the ACTU have said today, where they are supporting the government's efforts on competency based training and reflecting the calls from Australian industry for this to happen. Oil for Food Program",97
132,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister has provided Commissioner Cole with no powers to investigate how the $300 million paid to Saddam Hussein's regime was used, will the Prime Minister now establish an independent investigation into: (1) where the money went; (2) what the money was used for, including the question of funding Palestinian suicide bombers, Saddam Hussein's military and the current insurgency; and (3) how much of the money remains unaccounted for, given that AWB's kickbacks to Iraq continued for 18 months after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime?",97
133,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The premise on which the question is based is false; therefore, the rest of the question is also false. Financial Management",97
134,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister update the House on the government's plan to help young people equip themselves with better personal financial management skills.,97

137,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite might laugh, but last year this federal government made an announcement committing $21 million to help children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 to understand money, the use of money and the peer group pressure that is put on young children in relation to the purchase of mobile phones, the use of text messages and all those things that have the potential to create debt for young people. They cause enormous pressures not just on children but also on parents and families. This government is keen to work with the states to talk through, educate and make children understand the value of money and the acceptance of personal responsibility. This government remains very committed to this program. We are very serious about it. Those opposite might jibe and laugh about it, but this is a serious attempt to help young children who are in very difficult circumstances, some of whom they portray themselves as representing. This is a program that we will continue to roll out to help young people around the country in order to provide them with a better future.",97

I would like your advice as to whether people can raise in this House a matter that they see as misrepresentation without being intimidated.",98
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The parliamentary secretary raises a valid point.

I would ask all members to show more respect for other occupants in this chamber when they seek to make a personal explanation. Questions in Writing  der standing order 105, I draw your attention to a series of questions I placed on the Notice Paper on 6 September 2005 concerning grants under the National Crime Prevention Program and addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs.

This morning the retractable bollards were working as normal at that time of the morning. Mr Speaker, were you consulted about this, and are you aware if this decision has anything to do with the television program A Current Affair indicating to the Department of Parliamentary Services yesterday that they would be in Parliament House today to film a story on this issue?",99
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Prospect. I am aware of the question to the President of the Senate. I am also aware that the bollards have been operating since.

The Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs jointly propose to undertake a major redevelopment, at an estimated cost of $175.83 million, of the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, which is located in Sydney, New South Wales. The Villawood Immigration Detention Centre needs to be upgraded to: replace ageing infrastructure; provide appropriate facilities to meet general community standards; improve the living conditions and amenity for detainees; improve operational efficiency and modernise security; and incorporate relevant recommendations from the Palmer report.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members rethe quired by the standing orders having risen in their places",100
160,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What a disgraceful performance we saw from the Prime Minister in question time today-the ducking and shoving away of responsibility for this tragic scandal from himself. The one thing on his mind is: how can I and my ministers escape blame? How can we make absolutely certain that, whatever comes out of this, we will not have to accept responsibility for the worse scandal in many a long year in federal history? It is the most incompetent performance by a government: the trashing of our national reputation, the wreckage of the interests of the major trading components of our economy, our farmers-the trashing of all of that. How could the Prime Minister evade responsibility for that and throw as much smoke, as much of a camouflage, as he possibly can all over it here in question time? He even got to the point where he was blaming the opposition shadow spokesman on foreign affairs for his ‘lack of attention' to his job, as though it is the responsibility of the opposition to sit down and read the intelligence reports-all the cables, all the materials, that come in from all the diplomats Minister, take a look out for this,' as though that was the opportunity we had and as though that was our responsibility. The simple fact of the matter is that he and his ters were responsible. They were getting the cables and the analyses and they had day-today control of these matters-and they failed. Then we saw another performance yesterday. What bold analyses there were out there in the editorials. What extraordinary things were to be expected of the Prime Minister. What did he let out then? The view that he was really going to get to grips with the situation which had emerged. He was going to put together the best possible mechanism for ensuring that we had a decent outcome in Iraq. We were going to cut adrift the elements of the scandal that the Iraqi government was objecting to, to wit AWB. We were going to be there; we were going to be decisive. What a damp squib he produced-as though the only person he could send to effectively represent the grains interests was the chairman of AWB! It was sheer lack of courage on the part of the Prime Minister that he selected Mr Stewart when so many others were available in the Grains Council from any of the other organisations. All he needed to get from AWB was AWB's permission, if you like, to stand aside from the contract. The Prime Minister did not effectively achieve that sufficiently to ensure that he went away with a delegation that looked as though we were making a fresh start on this as we approached the Iraqis. They should be able to succeed; they ought to be able to succeed. The simple fact of the matter is that, if the government's connections with Iraq mean anything at all, it ought to be a simple matter for that delegation to succeed in its objective in getting the Australian farmers back into that market. But they decided that they would handicap themselves on the way through. The Prime Minister should be on his minisknees begging for forgiveness from the wheat farmers of Australia. When they needed him to protect them from this $300 million bribery scandal, he turned his back on them. Instead of protecting the Australian farmers, he is scrambling to protect himself and his ministers. This is an arrogant government. They have been abusing their total power, scrambling to save themselves at any cost, blatantly ignoring the national interest in pursuit of blind political self-interest, covering up their sorry hides, trashing our farmers' livelihoods, damaging our national economy, undermining our reputation as an honest player, endangering the lives of our troops in Iraq, turning a blind eye to what we know was a systematic and deliberate rorting of the oil for food program and channelling hundreds of millions of dollars into Saddam's coffers. But, for the Prime Minister, this counts for nothing. Instead of coming clean, the Prime Minister and his ministers have swung into damage control-they stonewall, dissemble, evade questions and use their total power to close down parliamentary scrutiny. When ministerial heads should be rolling, they gag public servants and curtail Cole to quarantine their ministers. They are a law unto themselves, accountable to no-one-least of all, the Australian people and, far less, the hapless wheat farmers, who are the innocent victims of a shameless scandal, unwitting pawns in this disgraceful mess who will pay with their own economic security. The farmers now know that Saddam made almost as much out of Australian wheat as they did. But, instead of going out to our wheat farmers and begging their forgiveness, what does this Prime Minister do? What is the best political spin he can come up with? What answer does he give? ‘I don't know; no-one told me; I wasn't informed.' He pleads ignorant stupidity. How badly are you travelling when stupidity is the best you can come up with-the Forrest Gump defence? Then, in a bizarre example of policy on the run, the Prime Minister hastily dispatches a rescue mission to Iraq that includes executives from AWB, the very people who presided over the regime of kickbacks and bribes. Frankly, it is like sending the burglar back to the scene of the crime! The government persistently hide behind this fiction that the Cole royal commission can answer all the questions in relation to their own behaviour. Our shadow spokesman on foreign affairs will have a bit to say later about Bret Walker's opinion. But let me make this absolutely clear: what that opinion demonstrates is what all of us here know by common sense-that there is a different treatment of the AWB executives in this and of the potential Commonwealth officers involved, including ministers. They cannot escape that. That is simply a fact. There is different treatment between the two. On one side, they will face the full blast of Cole's independent scrutiny; on the other, that has caveats attached to it. That is the first point. The second point is this: there lot more that the Australian people want to know about this particular scandal which has so dishonoured our nation. They want to know, for example, where the money went. There is nothing in Cole's terms of reference which will establish where those hundreds of millions of dollars went where we had the rescue contracts, on the last occasion in 2003, one of which we revealed here yesterday. The Prime Minister accuses us of presenting no evidence, yet we do document after document at every question time. This particular document demonstrated that Saddam, in this last rescue mission of Mr Vaile, got as much out of the wheat contract as the Australian farmers. That was pretty spectacular. That certainly was the best performance, if you like, of the corrupt other end on this. As to where that money went afterwards, there is no inquiry as far as we are concerned. What was the money used for? There is no inquiry. Yesterday the Prime Minister got on television. I admit that, from time to time, I am reasonably accused of using the odd abstract or difficult word. But when asked by the interviewer whether he could tell him and the Australian people what this money was used for, he used this expression: ‘Kerry, money is fungible.' Let me say this: money is not fungible in this sense. What the Prime Minister has decided is that this issue is ‘fudgeable'-a much more readily understood term. He does not want an inspection of this because manifestly it demonstrates the culpability of this government for turning a blind eye to a set of events that saw the funding of some of the more horrible things around the globe. A further thing that the Cole inquiry cannot inquire into is how much of this money remains unaccounted for, given that AWB's kickbacks to Iraq continued for 18 months is a after the collapse of Saddam's regime. This is an interesting thing. Who got the money in those 18 months? We know that Saddam got the money before then. We do not know who got the money after then. There seems to me to be three candidates for this. First, the Australian wheat farmers might have got it. It would have been a change, if they got the price that was paid for the wheat that was sold to Iraq. It would have been good if that happened, but I suspect that is not what happened. Second, it might have gone into the hands of Wheat Board agents and ended up in the back kick of some of the people who are going to be appearing before the Cole inquiry, though this is not an area that is ing to be inquired into. Three, I am afraid to say that it is much more likely that it kept going to Alia; it kept going to the transport companies. And if it kept going to the transport companies, it was directly funding the Ba'athist component of the insurgency. The Australian people are entitled to an answer on that. They are entitled to know what the truth is as far as that is concerned. Everything the Prime Minister does is to take the edge off any parliamentary scrutiny on him, to get rid of the Senate processes associated with it, to get rid of the Senate estimates committees-what is now demonstrated to be, or has been, one of the most effective mechanisms of accountability of government. You come into this chamber and shut down every censure debate that we have moved, bar one, at the outset. You obfuscate on every question that is asked of you by the opposition. You tell the public that the opposition is presenting no evidence here, despite the fact that at every question time we have presented a document, a new strand of evidence that was readily available to and could have been picked up by the government. It could have had knowledge of this and saved the honour of this country. This slothful, lazy government is great on spin but, when it comes to delivering solid administration of any particular area, it is an absolute noaccount bunch of bottom-feeding fish. That is what this government amounts to when it comes to any effective accountability or any effective administration in this place. We saw a bit more of what we had to deal with here. I have nothing against Mr Stewart-he is obviously a person of interest in this situation-but his job now is to sit down and work his way through his papers and prepare his organisation for the further inquiries of the Cole commission. Talk about goobfuscation! When I first raised this letter with the Prime Minister, I asked, ‘Have you seen this letter?' ‘Of course not,' says the Prime Minister. ‘No, you are springing this one on me'-a letter that was copied to the Prime Minister, I might say, and I thought would have sat indelibly on his mind, given that he has said he has devoted a great deal of attention to it. He has said things in this letter which are so blatantly untrue. You cannot tell me, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley-and you would know something about this as a National Party member-that there is not somebody in the Grains Council or in Cooperative Bulk Handling in Western Australia who could take Mr Stewart's position in this particular delegation. All you needed to do was to sit down with Stewart and say, ‘Listen, you fellows have disgraced us-admittedly, we're in it with you-and you're out of this. You sign one letter saying that as far as you're concerned you waive your rights over this particular trade to Iraq at this particular point in time, full stop.' That is what would be protecting the interests of the farmers. But they cannot do this because they have no moral authority-and they know it-because the AWB people whom they are addressing know that they are in on the joke. The simple fact of the matter is that they cannot deal straight with AWB because AWB know that they have partners in crime. They know all about you; everything out there is confected. There is this brolga dance around this heap, this mess, of corruption that has to be danced by the ministers, pretending they are doing something and praying that AWB do not cough up that at least some of them were in on the joke. This is going to go on for some considerable period of time in this place, because this is a major scandal that goes to the heart of the way this government governs. The fact is that this government cannot defend the Australian national interest because it is too lazy, too slothful, too unprincipled to be able to sensibly administer our foreign policy and our domestic affairs.

161,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"First, let me make this observation. The week before last, at the National Press Club, the Leader of the Opposition said: ... I promise you and every Australianthat this session of parliamentwill be the most aggressive parliamentary interrogation this government has faced in its ten long years of office. We have now reached the end of that parliamentary session. In my particular case, I make the observation that there were 70 questions asked by the opposition. All 70 questions were about AWB Ltd, despite the fact that this is a subject which is being considered by the Cole commission. I make the observation that not one of those questionsout of 70 questions-was put to me. Mr Rudd interjecting",104
162,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Griffith interjects. I want to say that I am disappointed. I am a bit more than that: I am hurt! The fact is that we had all the answers ready to go-and the jokes with them. But unfortunately the questions never came. More seriously, the opposition claims that this is an issue of enormous concern. The fact that AWB Ltd may-and it is a subject that is yet to be proven before the Cole commission-have been involved in kickbacks is a matter of great concern. But the opposition's proposition here is that the government has been involved in this. We have had two weeks, 70 questions, several censure motions, attempted censure motions, MPIs, an enormous amount of parliamentary time and a very fair wind, if I could put it that way, from some elements of the media-I think we all know who I am talking about. I forgot to mention the hearings in the Cole commission as well, and all the evidence that has been presented in the Cole commission under questioning-I must say it seems to me to be very forensic questioning-by the senior counsel, Mr Agius, to AWB Ltd officials and former officials. Despite all of that there is no evidence that the Australian government has been involved in this affair at all-none, not any evidence at all. For all the bluster and the confected passion-from the Leader of the Opposition, in particular-and after two long weeks of labouring in the parliament, the Leader of the Opposition has achieved precisely nothing. He has taken up the time of the parliament without focusing on issues that might have a little more resonance from the opposition's point of view-if I could be so bold as to suggest that their tactics could change-and would be of greater moment to the Australian people. Not a skerrick of evidence has been produced that the government is complicit or involved in this, despite the fact that the Leader of the Opposition on two occasions prior to the parliamentary session accused the government of being corrupt. ‘Corrupt' is a big word to use-but there was no evidence. The Leader of the Opposition stood up outside parliament-which is an interesting thing to do, but accusing people of being corrupt is an extremely serious accusation. The trouble for the Leader of the Opposition is that this whole issue and the way it has been handled in parliament has gone very much to the heart of his own credibility and the longevity of his leadership. The Leader of the Opposition established a series of benchmarks, all of which he has failed to meet. He said it was going to be the most aggressive parliamentary interrogation that government has ever faced. To be honest, I think a lot of members have been rather bored with the constant repetition of the questions and the hyperbole that we have seen during MPIs, censure motions and attempted suspension motions. The Leader of the Opposition said that the government was corrupt. He came into the parliament for two weeks and never provided any evidence; nor has any evidence been provided anywhere else. He said that the government was complicit. The truth of this matter is perfectly obvious, I would have thought. The truth of this matter is demonstrated by what has happened in other countries as well as this country. There were 66 countries whose 2,000 or more companies were involved in oil for food kickbacks under Saddam Hussein's regime. Everybody agrees that that was a bad thing. As Mr Volcker pointed out in his report, the responsibility for this failure rested with the United Nations and the officials in the United Nations who were meant to run this program. But in 65 of the 66 countries the government did not pick up what was going on; they were not able to identify what was going on. In this country, we did not either. We are the 66th country. But we in this country were supposed to set a standard of detecting what at least allegedly is fraud-certainly a breach of United Nations sanctions and possibly even worse. We in this country were supposed to detect something that 65 other countriesincluding the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, France, New Zealand and so the list goes on-were not able to detect. Somehow we were supposed to have the miracle powers of transparency that no other government on earth had. We may be a miracle government, a great government and a strongly supported government, but we do not have miracle powers that no other government on earth has. We do not have those. We just have a lot of determination and we do a lot of hard work. The opposition talks about ‘the warning bells'. It picks out obscure documents and says, ‘Look, if you read this sentence here on page 973, and surely the Prime Minister did, you can interpret that as being a reference to food. And if you mention food, that could be wheat, and that could be that the Wheat Board was corrupt and therefore the government should have known.' It is one of these typically contorted-and, if I may say so, from the public's point of view, completely unconvincing-arguments. The other 65 countries presumably had about as much access as we had to any of those reports-particularly the UK, because they were part of the Coalition Provisional Authority, and to a much greater extent than we were. The argument is that, by some miracle, they failed to pick this up, but we should have; and it is dereliction of duty that we failed to do that. At the end of the day that kind of an argument is simply not going to wash. In this country we have taken the Volcker inquiry very seriously and we have established a commission with the powers of a royal commission to look into all of these issues. The opposition suggests that in this country we are involved in a cover-up, but none of the other 65 countries-only two of which have set up an inquiry at all: one in South Africa, which has not even convened yet, so I cannot speak of that beyond the fact that they have established it; and one in India, which was an in camera inquiry-has set up the transparent and public process that we have set up in this country. But the argument of our Labor Party is that we are involved in a cover-up. It beggars belief that anybody could push that argument and that anybody, including in the media, would ever believe that. We are perfectly happy-and I have said this over and over again throughout all of this-for all our files to be gone through, for our officials to be interviewed and for there to be complete transparency. Mr Cole made the point in the statement he made, I think on the Friday before last, that he does, under the terms of reference, have the capacity to look into the government. This is the point that I do not think the opposition understand-or, they might understand it, but they certainly do not want to understand it. But Mr Cole makes this point very clear. If AWB Ltd was lying to the Commonwealth, that is potentially an offence. But to lie to the Commonwealth and to endeavour to mislead the Commonwealth, you have to establish whether the Commonwealth knew the information or not in the first place. So he needs to establish, as he has pointed out, what the Commonwealth knew in order to establish whether anyone misled the Commonwealth, which is potentially an offence. You do not have to be a QC to work that out; it is pretty obvious. Therefore, as a result of the way the terms of reference are written, the Cole inquiry has enormous breadth. Mr Cole has also made the point that, if there were any suggestion that a Commonwealth officer-including the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, me, the agriculture minister, whoever else; the education minister sitting here-has been involved in fraud, corruption or whatever it may be-I have forgotten the exact term he used-then he will ask for his terms of reference to be expanded. But he said that so far there is no such evidence. Of course there is not. I have never seen such evidence. This suggestion that the government has been complicit is a suggestion that I can only regard as absolutely absurd. It is politicking of the worse kind. I have read and I have heard some people say that the way the Public Service is handling this shows that they have been politicised. That suggestion is an extraordinarily insulting thing to say about our diplomats and our public servants. It is suggesting, if you like, moral corruption on the part of those people. I have been a minister for 10 years and before that, at one stage, like the member for Griffith, I worked in the Public Service. I worked as a diplomat, like he did, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My experience of our public servants is that they are good, impartial people. They tell you if they do not agree with you. They would draw my attention to mistakes I had madeif I did make mistakes. They are people of true honour and integrity. I read in the Australian that I had a new doctrine that I would not stand by them, that I would separate myself from them. That is complete nonsense. I stand by the public servants in my department and I stand by their integrity. These are good people, these are honourable people, these are hard working people. I do not know how they vote-they probably vote in all sorts of different ways-but I do know how they work: they work hard and they work in a determined way. And, contrary to what the Australian suggests, I stand by them. I stand by these people; I stand by their integrity. They work for me. As their minister, I am the leader of the organisation and I am prepared to take all of the responsibility that comes with that. Let me conclude by coming back to the issue of warning bells. The member for Griffith and the Leader of the Opposition make great play about how many warning signs there were out there. I have made the point already in this debate that 65 other countries did not pick up the warning signs but by some miracle we were supposed to. The member for Griffith, I discovered, has actually on several occasions met with the Australian Wheat Board in the wake of the warning signs that he now says everybody should have seen. Some of these warning signs he refers to are available on the internet! Mr Rudd interjecting",104
163,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is incredible. There they were on the internet. He did not bother to read them, but we should have all been reading them-and so should the other 65 countries involved. All these ministersTony Blair, Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Persson of Sweden, the list goes onshould have been poring over these websites. But not the opposition, because, as the member for Griffith said: ‘It wasn't my responsibility.' I thought they did have a responsibilhas ity to scrutinise the government and keep the government honest and all these pompous sayings that they use-which, actually, I pretty much agree with; but they are rather weak at doing it, if I may say so. The member for Griffith in a Sky interview, by the way, said, ‘Oh, I only once met with AWB Ltd.' Two days later he said he met several times with AWB Ltd. There is no evidence he even asked them, ‘By the way, this stuff on websites all around the place about possible corruption in the oil for food program: are you guys involved in that?' Apparently, he did not even ask that question, despite the fact that this material was out there. My last point, because my time has nearly expired, is this: the wheat mission that will be led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade will include Brendan Stewart. The opposition says Brendan Stewart, the Chairman of AWB Ltd, is guilty and should not go. There has been no evidence presented to the Cole commission that I am aware of-and I am aware of a lot of it; and the opposition has people sitting in the Cole commission as well-that Brendan Stewart is guilty of anything or has been accused of being involved in kickbacks. One day that evidence might or might not appear, but I have never seen that evidence. We on this side of the House-and the minister at the table here, Ms Julie Bishop, is a lawyerbelieve in the timeworn principle that all men and women are innocent until proven guilty. Brendan Stewart for us is not guilty, even if the opposition thinks he is. (Time expired)",107
164,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Cole has two powers: to investigate companies under the oil for food program that have been mentioned adversely by Volcker and to make recommendations concerning whether or not they have breached the law. Mr Cole no such parallel powers in relation to the Commonwealth government-that is, as the commission currently stands. Mr Justice Cole made this point very clearly in his 3 February statement. He said: The present terms of reference permit me to make findings of possible illegality only in relation to the three companies mentioned in the Volcker report. They do not permit me to make findings of illegality against the Commonwealth or any of its officers. The Prime Minister has on several occasions quoted selectively from Mr Cole's 3 February statement in this place. But he has taken care, of course, not to repeat the crucial element of Mr Cole's statement, and I repeat it: The present terms of reference ... do not permit me to make findings of illegality against the Commonwealth or any of its officers. Mr Cole has said that in order to make a finding about whether the AWB defrauded the Commonwealth it is necessary for him to make a finding about the Commonwealth's knowledge. In this regard Mr Cole has said that he will address and make findings about the role and knowledge of DFAT. But it is important to note that his investigation of the government extends only to what the government knew about AWB wrongdoing. In other words, he can investigate whether the government knew that someone else was acting illegally, but there it stops. He does not at this stage have the power to investigate whether the Commonwealth breached Australian or international laws, nor does he have powers at this stage to make findings as to whether the Commonwealth has breached Australian or international laws. Mr Cole has indicated that if, in his current investigation into Australian companies, he comes across evidence pointing to a breach of Australian laws he will then request an expansion of his powers accordingly. But such evidence about the Commonwealth now can only be obtained as an incidental by-product of the investigation into the four companies, not as an explicit focus of the investigation now, as the Prime Minister and the foreign minister well know. In other words, Mr Cole's investigations now are conducted in a manner such that he effectively has one hand tied behind his back, courtesy of the limited powers the Prime Minister has given him in the original letters patent. Furthermore, Mr Cole has been placed in this difficult position. If, incidental to his primary investigation of the four companies, he happens to come across evidence concerning the lawfulness of the Commonwealth's own action or actions in relation to the AWB, the commissioner can request that the Commonwealth give him more powers to then investigate and reach findings in relation to the Commonwealth itself. Mr Cole should be given those powers now so that his investigations can be conducted and findings made in a totally unfettered environment now. Labor has sought an opinion on these matters from Bret Walker SC, without doubt one of Australia's most accomplished and respected lawyers, a former President of the Law Council of Australia and importantly a lawyer with previous experience as a commission of inquiry head, including most recently on the commission of inquiry into the Campbelltown and Camden hospitals. Mr Walker advised: ... the Royal Commission, as presently restricted by its Terms of Reference, definitely does not have full power to investigate whether there has been any relevant wrongdoing on the part of the Commonwealth or its officers. In his opinion: ... full deployment of the Royal Commission's powers to investigate and make findings of fact cannot presently squarely address the question whether there has been Commonwealth wrongdoing-as opposed to mere Commonwealth knowledge or suspicion of AWB wrongdoing. In this respect, Mr Cole in his 3 February statement said that, if he ‘encounters material' which suggests criminal behaviour by the government, he will seek to have his terms of reference expanded. Mr Walker describes this as an invidious position for Mr Cole to find himself in and notes that ‘it will be a serendipitous or incidental chance' by which the commissioner might in the course of his inquiries stumble upon information which ‘turns out also to indicate the possibility of Commonwealth wrongdoing'. Contrary, therefore, to the Prime Minister's assertions that Mr Cole will look at every aspect and that he will ask all the questions, the terms of reference clearly restrict Mr Cole's ability to look at the whole picture. Let us consider for a moment some of the matters that Mr Cole cannot under his current terms of reference investigate or make findings about. First, he cannot investigate or make findings about whether the government or any officials breached any domestic Australian law. Second, he cannot investigate or make findings about whether the government breached international laws-for example, whether it upheld its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions, including resolution 661, to prevent Australian citizens and companies making payments to Saddam Hussein's regime. Third, he cannot investigate or make findings about whether the government, including ministers, performed its functions competently or negligently under domestic or international laws and, if negligently, whether recklessly negligently in terms of the discharge of its responsibilities. Fourth, as we indicated in question time today, he cannot investigate or make findings about where the money went. He cannot investigate whether the kickbacks paid by the AWB and approved by DFAT were used to reward the families of Palestinian suicide bombers, to buy weapons, to fund the insurgency in Iraq or for any other purposes that are blatantly illegal under a range of domestic and international instruments. On 13 February the Prime Minister told the parliament that the inquiry was established as a result of the findings of Volcker. He said that Volcker: ... did not make an adverse finding about the Australian government. If he had, then the terms of reference would have gone further than they have. The Prime Minister's statement tells us two things: first, that he knows that Mr Cole's terms of reference do not include an investigation of the Australian government's wrongdoing, belying his constant claims that they do; and, second, that his justification for not expanding the terms of reference is that the Volcker inquiry has cleared the government of any wrongdoing. The problem with Mr Howard's Volcker defence is that the Volcker inquiry did not have in its own terms of reference the power to investigate the actions of the Australian government. Furthermore, Volcker himself in making his conclusions, in relation to both the AWB and other matters, had not been provided by the Howard government with full documentation. The Howard government had not provided Volcker with the documents provided by the Wheat Export Authority. Furthermore, we know from Senate estimates that DFAT's electronic files were not provided to Volcker either. Therefore, it is now an established fact that Volcker was not given full documentation by the Howard government. It is an established fact that Volcker had no powers to make findings against the Australian government anyway. But even if they had such powers, how could Volcker have reached any informed finding in relation to the government's actions when the Howard government had deprived the Volcker inquiry of huge slabs of relevant documentation? The Prime Minister has used explicitly the absence of adverse findings in Volcker to justify the fact that the Cole commission of inquiry was not given wider terms of reference. It is for these reasons that the Prime Minister's defence of the narrow terms of reference given to Mr Cole collapses in a heap. What we have seen in the debate over the last two weeks is a government which has been clearly found out for having not done its job-for not having had its eye on the ball, for not having discharged its most basic of national security responsibilities; namely, to prevent hundreds of millions of dollars being paid over to the enemy. In question time today we had a Prime Minister, by contrast, rather than recognising that his government had done something wrong, determined instead to deliver the parliament and the opposition in particular a moral lecture. A moral lecture is what the Prime Minister gave us today. He told us what the decent thing to do was. He told us that the only decent thing to do was for the Australian Labor Party basically to button up-that the responsibility of the opposition at this stage was not to provide proper scrutiny. He lectured us that the decent thing to do was not to presume that the AWB had been in any respect guilty of anything. This comes from the Prime Minister seven years after this whole corruption scandal began. It comes two years after the Volcker inquiry began. It comes six months after the Volcker inquiry reported the fact that this $300 million scandal is the worse contribution to Saddam Hussein's regime worldwide, and it comes one month after the Cole inquiry began. And still this Prime Minister has the audacity to stand in this House and deliver the Australian Labor Party a moral lecture about what the decent thing to do is. Well, Prime Minister, the decent thing to do would have been to have told the truth about ‘kids overboard'. The decent thing to do would have been to have told the truth about Iraqi WMD. The decent thing to do would have been to have told the truth and done the right thing in response to each of the warnings that you had about what the AWB was up to. The decent thing to do would have been to have provided full documentation to Volcker. The decent thing to do would have been to have provided decent terms of reference to Mr Cole for his inquiry and the decent thing to do would not have been to gag public servants from telling the truth to the Senate estimates committee because you fear what the truth might contain.",107

174,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise this afternoon to speak on this matter of public importance submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. I would like to read into the Hansard what it says: The Government placing its short term political interests ahead of the long term national interest in relation to AWB Oil for Food scandal. Nothing could be further from the truth. I reject outright this MPI introduced by the opposition. It is this government, following the Volcker report on the UN oil for food program, that established the Cole inquiry. The inquiry headed by Justice Cole will investigate all matters from the Volcker report. It has the powers of a royal commission. As the foreign minister said this afternoon in this debate, of 66 countries, we are the only one that has established an inquiry with commission powers into the Volcker report and the findings that relate to the Australian Wheat Board. The other 65 countries that were mentioned in that report are not doing anything like establishing a royal commission into the adverse findings against them the Volcker report. The Labor Party has spent the last two weeks attacking the Prime Minister and government ministers-the trade minister, the foreign minister, the agriculture ministerand anyone else they thought that they could slur under the privilege of this parliament, because they are trying to imply that they had knowledge of the kickbacks that are alleged under the Volcker report. In that two weeks they produced no evidence, but they continue to slur the reputation of decent ple. That is what they are doing-slurring the good names of good people. They spent two weeks asking 70 questions and putting up MPIs and censure motions, and they still have not brought forward a shred of evidence to back up their claims. Some of the slurs are so offensive to me and to other members on this side of the parliament that I believe those on the other side should apologise to our ministers. Those opposite are bringing slurs against these ters, alleging that they knew of these kickbacks and that the money was being used to fund Palestinian suicide bombers. Mrs Hull-Shame!",110
175,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is a shameless claim. Members opposite are saying that $100 million has gone to the enemy in Iraq-the enemy that was the Saddam Hussein regime. These are despicable slurs on anyone's character. Those on the other side should apologise to our ministers. The Leader of the Opposition has now started his attack on the executive chairman royal of the Australian Wheat Board Ltd, AWB Ltd, Brendan Stewart. I know Brendan Stewart; he happens to be a constituent of mine. He is a fine man. Not only is he a fine man, and the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, but he is also a practising wheat in grower, so he knows how hard it is to grow wheat. In his position, and from his experience with commodity boards and representing farmers in the organisation in Queensland, he knows how corrupt the world markets are. The world markets are corrupted by the subsidies that are paid by the Americans to their growers under the disguise, in some cases, of export enhancement grants designed to get American wheat into world markets. These grants distort the markets for our growers here in Australia. Brendan peoStewart is a man who understands that the international wheat trade is not a level playing field. He is the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, which holds the pool of wheat. If we are to be able to continue sales of our wheat to Iraq during the Cole inquiry and have those sales negotiated during that period, it is from the pool of the Australian Wheat Board that we will have to draw that wheat. I call on the Opposition to come into this minisplace-or outside; anywhere will do-and say that they support the single desk arrangement for the Australian Wheat Board. The single desk arrangement is in the best interests of the Australian wheat growers. We have not heard the Labor Party come into this place and say, ‘We support the single desk arrangement for the Australian Wheat Board.' They are attempting not only to slur the good names of ministers on this side of the parliament but also to undermine the Australian Wheat Board's vested power of the single desk arrangements, which are so essential in delivering the best outcome in corrupted world markets for the hard working Australian wheat growers. The Labor Party, in their attacks on this government and on Brendan Stewart and the Australian Wheat Board, have become the best friend the American wheat farmers have ever had. The shadow foreign affairs minister has become a lobbyist for the American wheat lobby, not for the Australian wheat growers. It is worth casting our minds back to the period of the first Gulf War, when the Leader of the Opposition was a member of the government; he was a minister. In the period after the first Gulf War he became the Deputy Prime Minister. We should examine the actions of those opposite during that first Gulf War when wheat growers, through the Australian Wheat Board, had made sales to Iraq that were not covered by anything more than the export finance insurance that was taken out by the Australian Wheat Board. It was very important that we involved ourselves in the first Gulf War, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, but tied up in the middle of that were export sales of wheat to Iraq through the Australian Wheat Board that have cost the Australian wheat growers money. Fifteen per cent of that pool, and the interest on that money, has never been paid to our Australian wheat growers. The Leader of the Opposition, who was then in government, could have said that the government would make those payments to the wheat growers that were outside the export finance insurance. The government could have covered the non-payment-which occurred because of the war-for those sales into Iraq. On this side of the House, we have the best interests of Australian wheat growers foremost in our minds. We understand the importance of the wheat market in Iraq. Through the single desk arrangements-once again-of the Australian Wheat Board and its predecessors, this nation has been supplying wheat to Iraq for more than 50 years. The Iraqi Grains Board understands that we are a reliable supplier of quality wheat. Even during the oil for food program the wheat we were selling to Iraq was providing much needed food. Those who suffered at that time under the Saddam Hussein regime were at least able to be nourished by the good wheat that came from the Australian wheat growers. The Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vailewe all send our condolences to him and his family at this very sad time for him on the loss of his father overnight-will be leading a delegation to Baghdad to endeavour to find ways to continue wheat sales to Iraq during the period of the Cole inquiry.

182,Mr JOHNSON,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to continue my presentation in the parliament today. It was interrupted on a previous occasion. Let me resume where I finished off-that is, at the point of totally repudiating the member for Wills in his presentation to the parliament. The amendment that he suggested is of course fanciful and ought to be rejected by this House, without any doubt at all. Like a lumbering dinosaur over there, the federal Labor Party continues to be stuck in the prehistoric age. It continues to fight old battles, old wars and old issues while the coalition government is moving on into the 21st century. We are talking about water conservation$2 billion over five years to establish the Australian water fund. We are talking about record spending in health. We are talking about aged care funding going up substantially to $45 billion, up from $20 billion when we came into office. We are talking about workforce participation, getting more people into work-young people, mature people and those with disabilities who still have the capacity to work. We are talking at the COAG meeting about committing $660 million to improve the health of Australians who are suffering from mental health issues and related issues. So we are on about the business of government. We were elected to govern. We were elected in 2004 for the fourth occasion in succession because the people of Australia invested very strongly in their future. In the meantime, as the member for Wills and most of his colleagues on the other side reflect in their presentations, they are only in the business of dealing with the past. The issues of Iraq and issues of weapons of mass destruction that the member for Wills went on about are completely irrelevant to the Australian people at this time. We have had that debate. We have had a referendum in the most important forum of this country-that is, in the public arena. The electorate voted. They voted very strongly. They voted very decisively. I was delighted to have an increase in my vote, as I am sure that the minister at the table, the new Minister for Education, Science and Training, had in her vote. That reflects the people's preferences about the policy focus in this parliament. Albeit very briefly, I must absolutely repudiate the charge by the member for Wills that this government is engaged in hard-core, deep corruption through the Australian Wheat Board matters that are being currently aired. We reject that absolutely. We repudiate it. The Cole inquiry has been set up by the government. As the Prime Minister and senior ministers have said, let that commission pan out. Let it deliberate, and then the debate can start, following its report. Most importantly, in this parliament, this government is on about the state of the national economy. The people of Australia and the people of my electorate want to know what we are doing about schools, universities, hospitals and health care, transport and the highways, byways and freeways of this country. That is what this government is focusing on. Let me give an example in relation to the economy. Unemployment in this country is at three-decade lows under this government. Interest rates remain very low, so families in the Ryan electorate can afford to purchase their own homes again, after struggling under the burden of interest rates which peaked under Labor at record levels of 17 or 18 per cent. We all know that the budget is in surplus, to the tune of $8.9 billion, in stark contrast with when Labor was in office and left us with a massive deficit. Our focus is on issues that are important to the people of Australia-for example, providing $100 million to an energy technology fund to finance solutions and new ideas for the challenge of the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. These are the things that matter to everyday people in Ryan. These are the things that matter to everyday Australians the length and breadth of this country. While it is not my place to counsel the opposition-and certainly not the shadow minister, the member for Wills-I would encourage them to focus on policies and issues that matter to the Australian people. I will continue from where I left off-I had to rebuke and repudiate the inferences by the shadow minister-by saying that this bill this is an important one. It provides a significant amendment to the Ministers of State Act 1952. This act allows for the appropriation of government revenue for payment of ministerial salaries and determines the maximum number of ministers of state. The remuneration of members and senators is set out in section 48 of the Constitution. Section 66 sets out additional payments for ministers of the state by virtue of their position and office. The Remuneration Tribunal, empowered by the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, is required to report to the government annually on the salaries of members and senators and also on the additional salary payable to ministers. The additional salary payable to ministers is expressed as a percentage of the annual allowance. The tribunal's report No. 1 of 2005 made no changes to the percentage of annual additional allowance for ministers. Previously, however, the tribunal had recommended that the annual allowance for senators and members be linked to a reference salary under the Principal Executive Office, or PEO, Classification Structure. The government created this link in the Remuneration and Allowances Regulations 2005. The PEO was adjusted on 1 July 2005 following a determination by the Remuneration Tribunal. This had a flow-on effect and increased the annual allowance to members and senators and additional salary for ministers of the state. Currently the Ministers of State Act 1952 limits to $2.8 million the amount that can be appropriated from the consolidated revenue fund to cover the additional salaries of ministers. This amendment bill increases that limit to $3.2 million to cover the increase in the additional payment to ministers and to allow some latitude for future increases. So it is an important provision, expanding the figure from $2.8 million to $3.2 million. This allows me an opportunity to comment on the salary structure of members of parliament, senators, ministers and the Prime Minister. I have had the privilege of being the federal representative for Ryan, covering parts of the city of Brisbane, for four years. From time to time constituents and other residents talk about the salaries of members of parliament-from the Prime Minister down to a member of this parliament who holds no office. They are on the public record-it is all available, and it is transparent. Any citizen of this country can find out the salaries of members of parliament. I want to say in the parliament today that I think an overwhelming number of members and senators of this parliament are paid appropriately for their work but perhaps there is scope for that to be re-examined. Certainly every member of this parliament works very hard and is very dedicated in their contributions to this parliament and to this country. That is the nature of our profession. As the Prime Minister touched on in question time the other day, I think all of us should stand firm, shoulder to shoulder, when our profession is denigrated and the media or individuals in the community take it upon themselves to ‘bash' members of parliament, their work and their salaries. It is very easy to be a passenger in life and to criticise the hard work of people in politics from the sidelines, but I think it is a noble profession. Many of us on this side of the parliament, including the minister at the table, could earn far more outside this parliament. However, none of us comes into this place for reasons of profit. We come into this parliament because we love this country. We are deeply proud Australians, and we want to make a contribution to the future of our land and the generations of Australians to come. Most of us have children or grandchildren. We are no different from the rest of this country in terms of our love of this land and wanting to improve it. I thought it might be of interest to my leagues, to those who might be listening and to those in my electorate of Ryan to get an understanding of the salary structure of members of parliament in comparison with others in our community. Let me give some examples of some of the better known figures in Australia who receive substantial amounts of money for the work that they do. I refer to an article in the BRW magazine of 15 December 2005 about the salaries of certain high-profile individuals. According to the article, Cate Blanchett, a very fine Australian actress, earns $13 million per annum. Kylie Minogue receives $6 million. The great Rove MCManus earns some $5.5 million. Eddie Maguire, who is from Victoria and is well known throughout the country from his time on television, earns $3.5 million-no doubt that will increase with his rise to the rank of CEO of the Nine Network. Megan Gale, a model, earns some $3 million. I am sure that Shannon Noll, for his talent, deserves every bit of the $1.4 million that he receives in his pay packet. The list includes sportsmen and sportswomen, either in a playing capacity or a coaching capacity. Cyclist Stuart O'Grady receives $1 million a year. The Essendon football coach, Kevin Sheedy, earns $600,000. Basketball player Lauren Jackson earns $200,000. Turning to businesspeople, Mr Chip Goodyear, CEO of BHP Billiton, receives $5.38 million; Gail Kelly, the Chief Executive Officer of the St George Bank, $4.48 million; Dawn Robertson, the Managing Director of Myer, a well-known store in this country, $2.68 million; the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr Tony D'Aloisio, $1.47 million. Let me take you back to the sports section for a second: Mr Bruno Cullen, the Managing Director of the very successful Brisbane Broncos club, receives a salary in excess of a quarter of a million dollars. Mr Russell Glasser, colchief executive of CARE Australia, receives a $190,000 salary. Let me continue with some of these figures, because I think it is quite interesting. Let me take you to Jeffrey Lucy, the head of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, who receives $370,000; the very fine and distinguished public servant Dr Peter Shergold, head of Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, $355,000; and Mr Michael Carmody, commissioner for the Australian Taxation Office, $353,000. These are all Australians who do very fine things in their work and with their talentssportspeople, businesspeople and public servants like Jeffrey Lucy, Peter Shergold and Michael Carmody. They all deserve the salaries they receive. They have an important role in the body politic of this country. In terms of the sportspeople and the likes of Megan Gale, the market sets their salaries. Let me take you now to people who serve in this parliament, because it is quite interesting that there is a significant contrast. I think the community will be interested, for those who might be listening. Members of my electorate will be very interested to know, if they do not already know, what politicians receive. The Prime Minister, for running this country-with the enormous responsibility and burden of high office that he holdsdoes not receive anywhere near the millions of dollars that those in the business world receive. His salary is under $300,000-it is $288,990. The ministers in cabinet receive $191,000. The federal Deputy Leader of the Opposition receives $175,000-quite a salary. A backbench member of this parliament or a senator with no portfolio or parliamentary secretary responsibilities is on $111,000. That is a small insight into the figures that members of this parliament receive. All these figures are on the public record. It is very important that it is transparent. sitting member of the parliament, as the federal member for Ryan, I want to strongly reiterate my position that it is very important that the community knows what members of parliament are receiving, what the Prime Minister's salary is and what ministers and public servants receive. It is, after all, at end of the day, taxpayers' money. What should be pointed out in the context of this bill is the salary contrast. TV entertainers like Rove MCManus receive $5.5 million a year, yet the Prime Minister's salary is less than $300,000 and he is the official representative of this country-he represents us as the head of government in this country and as a duly elected leader of the nation in our system of government. The comparison is a very interesting point for Australians to ponder. That we pay our top businesspeople like Chip Goodyear from BHP in excess of $5 million a year is a very interesting observation to make. We must remember that they also run major organisations. BHP Billiton has a $43 billion turnover and almost 40,000 employees. By contrast, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have responsibility for the national economy. Our economy is valued at in excess of $800 billion. The federal budget that the Treasurer very finely manages and has carriage of is valued at in excess of $220 billion. The prosperity and growth of this nation of 20 million people hinge very much on how the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the cabinet and the government run it. It is an interesting point to make that the Minister for Defence in the cabinet has enormous responsibility with the protection of the country-Australian troop numbers in excess of 50,000 and a budget of almost $18 billion-yet his salary is nowhere near the salary of CEOs of the likes of Chip Goodyear or the salary of the delightful Megan Gale, whose talents are no doubt quite worAs a thy of her millions of dollars. In conclusion, it is vital for the successful administration of this country that this parliament continues to attract the best and brightest into its ranks. At the moment, one can come to this parliament through being a member of one's own party or through being the voted in here independently. I am sure that all members would agree with me that it is imperative that we place a great emphasis on attracting to this parliament the very best, the very brightest, those who have a passion for the future of our country, who have a passion for bringing prosperity into the homes of our fellow Australians. My concern is that there is a danger, perhaps, that politics might become an option only for the very wealthy-those who have enough wealth to try and come into this place. Alternatively, people from lower socio-economic backgrounds might see a salary in this place as a very high income indeed. I would hope that parliament can look into this and that we can have a discussion on this as well. As a sitting member of parliament, I have the great honour and privilege to represent the people of Ryan. I continue to work very hard at bringing to this parliament and to the government issues of concern to them and, in return, representing back to the constituency important issues and policies that the government sees fit to discuss.

184,Mrs ELLIOT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak today in relation to the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal. As the AWB scandal unfolds, despite the government's best efforts to thwart this process, we are seeing repeatedly how the Howard government is failing Australians. As each scandalous detail is revealed, it is becoming clear how the Prime Minister and his ministers are motivated not by the national interest but purely by self interest. In particular, this scandal, if nothing else, serves to highlight the shameless betrayal of our wheat farmers and regional Australia by this government. Regardless of the fact that we cannot get a straight answer from the government about how Australia is now in the middle of this scandal, the result of it is indeed unequivocal. Iraq has now suspended all wheat exports from Australia. Australian wheat farmers-hard working families who are already doing it tough on the land-will now suffer directly because of the actions of this government. Here we have National Party cabinet ministers who are smack bang in the middle of this $300 million ‘wheat for weapons' scandal. At the very best, they could be accused of incompetence and neglect; at worse, they are at the centre of appalling deception and cover-up. Day after day, like pulling teeth, we find that this arrogant government has been instrumental in propping up a culture of cover-up and has consistently turned a blind eye to repeated warnings that AWB was involved in paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein. In fact, the government has had no fewer than 14 separate warnings that AWB was paying bribes and kickbacks to the Iraqi regime. It has repeatedly ignored warnings from the United Nations, Canada and wheat farmers in Victoria. So many warnings have been ignored. If this government and, in particular, National Party cabinet ministers had done their jobs properly and investigated these warnings, we would not be in this dire situation today. What is the situation that we are in today? Our international reputation has been tarnished, our position as a trading nation has been undermined and the livelihoods of our wheat farmers are seriously at risk. Despite this situation, repeatedly all we have seen from this arrogant government is a demonstration of its utter contempt for the people of Australia by its refusal to answer the most basic questions about this scandalquestions that have been put to it in parliament. Last year, government ministers told this parliament that the government had assisted the Volcker inquiry into the oil for food scandal to the fullest extent and that it had provided all available information. We now know that this was completely untrue. It has become clear that the government's own Wheat Export Authority was not forthcoming with all the information to that inquiry. We also now note that the Volcker inquiry had no access to electronic files held in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. But the truly frightening question now is: how much more is there to find out? Why aren't there extended terms of reference for the Cole inquiry? How much more has to be revealed? How deep does this cover-up go? The Howard government, for once, should stop serving its own interests and do the right thing by Australians. In particular, National Party MPs should stand up and do the right thing by regional Australians-because it is regional Australia that will suffer from this scandal. As an MP from a regional electorate, I am acutely aware of how the National Party has continued to let down the people of rural and regional Australia. I am listening to the anger that is growing in regional Australia about how its needs are being forgotten by a party that is too busy dancing to the tune of the Liberal Party to represent properly the people who elected it to this place. Australian farmers, who traditionally form the basis of the National Party's heartlands, are scratching their heads and wondering what happened to the party that once claimed to represent them. The National Party sold out the bush when it refused to fix Telstra and, instead, supported the cutting of services to regional Australia so that the telco could be fattened up for sale. It also sold out Australian families by supporting the Howard government's attack on our industrial relations system. This AWB scandal must truly be the last straw for farmers, who have been left hung out to dry by a diminishing and irrelevant National Party, which is bereft of principles, ideas and backbone. What we are witnessing here-apart from an arrogant government which is drunk on unlimited power-is the final demise of the National Party. National Party cabinet ministers are responsible for damaging the interests of Australia's hard working wheat farmers and wheat exporters. They have failed repeatedly to respond to warnings about this scandal. I call on National Party MPs here to stop focusing on their internal fighting with their coalition partners and to start focusing on their constituents. I call on them to have the guts to stand up in this House, take responsibility for their actions and show regional Australia the respect that it demands and deserves. With the inaction that we are now seeing from these National Party members, how much longer will this scandal continue? How much longer will the government fail to take responsibility for its actions in relation to this? It is time for the National Party and Nationals MPs here to start standing up for their constituents-because this scandal is directly affecting their constituents. (Time expired) Disability Services",118
185,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to talk about the gut-wrenching subject of young people with disabilities in nursing homes. I am constantly reminded of this subject by the people of Gilmore. It was refreshing and inspiring to see the Prime Minister and the premiers put health at the top of the list of issues of importance at COAG. I hope it is the start of a process that soon sees the issues of young people with disabilities in nursing homes being addressed. We have all heard stories of young people with disabilities being placed in nursing homes because there is nowhere else for them to go-young people who are mentally sound and capable but who have a disability. But some families deal with very young people who have severe brain injuries-injuries so severe that parents do not know what the future holds. It is this uncertainty that I wish to address today. With his knowledge, I use the example of a member of my staff. Shawn Burns, my media and policy adviser, and his wife, Gina, have a severely disabled son. Mac is almost three years old. After being born 3½ months early and weighing just 498 grams, Mac survived four months in a neonatal intensive care ward, defying the odds and overcoming more than his share of hurdles-including an operation to remove part of his bowel, when he weighed just 700 grams. As I say, he beat the odds and left the neonatal intensive care ward relatively unscathed and, for all intents and purposes, well. Tragically, however, Mac fell ill just 10 weeks after getting home; he caught the flu. While most children catch the flu and get better, Mac's flu almost killed him several times. His still immature lungs could not handle the pressure and subsequently put too much demand on his heart. He suffered multiple respiratory arrests. While Mac survived, his brain was starved of oxygen for too long and he suffered global brain damage. The damage left Mac with severe cerebral palsy and immeasurable cognitive disabilities. In his father's words, ‘He is a beautiful boy.' Mac is, however, a living and smiling personification of a question. It is the question his parents ask themselves only when they dare look to the future: who will look after him when we are gone? Mac's parents are far from elderly. Both are in their mid30s, and hopefully they will grow old. There is one thing guaranteed, however: they will grow old prematurely if more is not done to assist them and those like them. In not too many years Mac will no longer be a baby. He will be a teenager, a 20-something, a 30-something and so on. Mac will grow to be a man, a man in a disabled body and, in all probability, with severe mental disabilities. We do not want to face a situation where today's beautiful baby boy, the topic of television stories, newspaper articles and calendar shoots, becomes the forgotten man. Mac's parents, their families and their friends are determined to look after Mac and to do whatever it takes to give him quality of life. Mac must never be forced into an aged care nursing home because there is nowhere else for him to go. Let it not be said that this country did not act. Do not let the fight that Mac fought as a 498-gram baby to survive and the battle he and his parents face every day be in vain. While this story is ten, there is only one way a final chapter of tragedy can be avoided. When Mac's parents are not able or around to look after him, this country must. Facilities must be established now to cater for the needs of young people with severe disabilities. We cannot continue to put them in nursing homes, and we cannot pretend Mac's story will be the last of its kind. There are many more Macs in our community of Gilmore and many parents who cannot even find a respite bed for them. It is just too awful for words to describe the torment that these families go through. I thank Gina and Shawn for allowing me to present their story. It would not have been easy to admit that they must now look to the future at this early stage. Nursing homes are places where the elderly are cared for and given peace of mind. They are not places for healthy, young disabled people. I am indebted to the Prime Minister for placing this on the agenda of COAG and assure him there are many families in Gilmore awaiting the results of that meeting. I have already had discussions with Minister Cobb on this matter, as he has the responsibility for ensuring the carriage of this with the state government. This issue is not acceptable in today's society. As a government, we must ensure we do something about itand soon. Howard Government: Accountability",119
186,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this afternoon to comment on the government's trashing of very important principles in this place. It is clear by the actions of the government, indeed by the Prime Minister, that those supposed longheld principles of ministerial accountability and federalism have been jettisoned by this government since it managed to take control of both the House of Representatives and the being writ- Senate at the last election. In the first term of the Howard government we saw at least some attempt to respond to ministerial accountability. Some ministers resigned when it was clear that they had breached those principles. In fact, a whole host of ministers in the government between 1996 and 1998 resigned because they believed they had breached those fundamental principles. But since that time there has been not one minister who has clearly breached ministerial accountability and responsibility who has taken the honest and dignified decision to resign. Since 1998 we have seen a government that refuses to accept the long-held Westminster values that I thought the Prime Minister cherished. Clearly, his code of conduct and his attitude towards ministerial accountability have never been true, have never been an article of faith. Indeed, he has shown that again this week, where we have clearly illustrated that the government has been responsible for allowing for a $300 million bribe, most of which, it appears, has gone directly to the Saddam Hussein regime. That money has been directly paid to what the Prime Minister was saying only some years ago was an enemy of this country. We have seen that bribe go from the Australian Wheat Board. Under the purview of the government, that board has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Saddam Hussein. We do not know where that money has been spent, what that money has been spent on or when it was spent, and the actual royal commission does not provide terms of reference for us to investigate those matters. Indeed, not only has the Prime Minister failed in upholding those very important principles of ministerial accountability by ensuring that Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister Vaile resign because of the fundamental breach we have seen in this place; instead we have witnessed stonewalling, lying and denying. We saw it last term. We saw it with ‘kids overboard'. We are seeing it time and time again by this government because it refuses to accept that there are values in this place. There are principles that are supposed to be upheld, and none of them are being adhered to by this Prime Minister and his ministers. I say of the Prime Minister and the government: it is about time they remembered that there are values that our community expects us to uphold and adhere to. We are role models for our community. If the Prime Minister does not know that, he will find out soon, because in my electorate, and I am sure in every electorate that is represented in this place, more and more people are asking why it is that the Prime Minister will not allow proper terms of reference to ensure that all things are examined in this disgraceful scandal that has beset us. Why is it that the Senate committee that should be investigating some of these matters was not allowed to properly examine the Public Service in a way to ensure that the community is provided with answers to this dreadful situation? Why is it that the Prime Minister is abusing his power in this place and, indeed, in the Senate-in both houses-by denying a proper examination of the facts? We know the answer to that. It is because this government is about lying and denying the truth. In fact, when the truth is clearly evident for all to see, this government is refusing to accept the long-held principles of ministerial accountability in this place. I think ministers erred before 1998 in the first term of this government, but at least the ministers then had the dignity to resign when they were fundamentally in breach of those principles. Clearly, there has not been any acceptance of responsibilities by ministers in this AWB scandal. It is about time they did something. The wheat farmers are hurting. Their long-term interests have been trashed as a result of the government's failure, and no doubt it is also the case with the sugar farmers. The sugar farmers were sold out by the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, and now the wheat farmers- (Time expired) Trade: Single Desk Policy",120
187,Mrs HULL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak on the one resolute feeling that I share with all my wheat growers in the Riverina, with the Deputy Prime Minister and The Nationals-that is, the continued operation of the single desk. I share with the House a letter that one of my constituents has written to the Prime Minister in anguish. He said: I am writing to you as a wheat grower who depends on the AWB conducting a National Pool(s) in conjunction with the Single Seller Monopoly to have my returns maximised. I beg you not to take any action that will ardise this system which is the only aid which we as growers, in a country of small population, have to compete with treasuries of USA and Europe. Changes to the AWB Power of Veto over Bulk Export permits will destroy the ability of AWB to run pools, and lead to multiple sellers disposing of our grain at discounted prices. In another letter to me that same constituent indicated: Why have we as a Nation allowed our National Wheat Marketer to be so undermined ... As far as I am aware there have been no other companies investigated in other countries-there were over 2000 named in the original Vokker report. We can see by the discussions held in this House day after day who is allowing our wheat growers and our national wheat marketer to be undermined. Let me tell you that the Labor Party are without doubt the best friend the American wheat growers have ever had. It is without question that they are in favour of the American wheat growers, because they are inflicting too much damage on the wheat growers of Australia by continuing this unrelenting and unswerving attack. The innuendo and accusation that have been directed at the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade are unparliamentary and absolutely unforgivable. Anyone who takes on the National Party and undermines the Deputy Prime Minister is no friend of the National Party and no friend of the coalition. As I said, there is one resolution that I have in common with the majority of wheat growers in the Riverina and hopefully right across Australia-that is, the Deputy Prime Minister and The Nationals' support of the operation of a single desk. Our policy is to support a single desk, and we will fight to the end to achieve that policy. The single desk policy cannot be allowed to come under question. I have always supported single desk marketing. I have stood in this House time and time again and supported it, bejeopcause I happen to represent the people who do best out of single desk marketing, whether it be in wheat or in rice. I will continue to do this. I have never, ever been convinced as to how multiple sellers competing and discounting against each other with the hardworked product of Australian wheat or rice growers bring our growers better returns. Nobody has ever been able to convince me of that. I remember that in long-gone years we had multiple sellers, and that is why we developed this clear and concise way of delivering a good single desk policy that brought about better returns for our growers. It is my view that a single seller monopoly maximises returns to our growers over the long term, sometimes through difficult, drought affected years. There is no doubt in my mind that the push to dismantle the single desk comes from the fiercely competitive and highly subsidised United States farm lobby. I have to say that the opposition is assisting that cause to the very end. We simply cannot allow the single desk to be the victim of the opposition's and the US's anticompetitive views and their anticompetitive behaviour. So I rise in support of all farmers and producers across my electorate of Riverinaand the majority of them support the single desk-to urge everybody to get their mind on the damage that is being caused to the growers that we represent and to ensure that they will do everything possible.

188,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"The core of the Australian Wheat Board scandal, or the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal, is really no longer a case of whether there were kickbacks or bribes, because we all know for a fact that there were $300 million worth of kickbacks and bribes. That is a fact. What we now need to understand is just how culpable and involved the federal government was in all this. The fact that this government has denied that it had any knowledge of the bribery and about what has taken place in terms of the kickbacks should not diminish the fact of the government's involvement. By any measure, this government should have known, and would have known by a range of ways, that there were massive kickbacks directly back to Saddam Hussein. There has been plenty of discussion about where that money ended up and what it was used for. I want to deal quickly today with a number of issues. I want to list all the occasions on which the government should have been made aware of the situation, apart from the occasions on which the Labor Party raised questions of concern and issues with the government directly in questions about potential breaches, saying that the government should look into it. That is not to mention that halfway through the election campaign itself in 2004 the Prime Minister sent his most highly qualified diplomat to Washington to stave off, cut off at the pass, a possible inquiry this very issue in case it was damaging to the government's re-election chances. In my mind, I think it is unbelievable how the government can continue to come into this place and say, ‘Well, you can't prove it because you haven't got the documents; provide us with some documents.' We say, ‘Give us the keys to the locked cabinets and we'll find you the documents-give us the key to the bottom drawer and we'll find them.' On no less than 14 separate occasions were the warning alarm bells ringing. In January 2000 UN customs experts warned Australia's UN mission about the Iraqi government demanding some $US700,000 from the Canadian Wheat Board to cover suspect trucking fees. In March 2000 Austrade commissioner Alistair Nicholas briefed AWB's executives in Washington telling them of official corruption in this area. In June 2000 trade minister Mark Vaile apparently met with AWB chiefs Flugge and Lindberg over the kickback claims. He denies that the meeting took place, even though records of the meeting showed it did. In September 2000 there were emails between former BHP executive Norman Davidson Kelly telling senior AWB manager Charles Stott about the Tigris petroleum deal. In November 2000 and July 2002 the Prime Minister wrote to the AWB head. The list of correspondence goes on and on: August 2002, May-June 2003, July et cetera. There was a plethora of warning bells, of signals of government ministers being involved at some level in the information trail. Surely the government must have known, would have known and should have known-and should have done something about it. But, of course, when you are deeply involved you will do everything you can to hide it and not let anybody else know. I want to quote something very important into which may explain why we have not been able to find that specific evidence-that smoking gun, as it were-to prove the government's direct involvement. It comes from an article in crikey.com. It is a very interesting piece about how ASIS, our intelligence organisation, is involved in what we just heard about from the member for Riverina, in terms of US wheat farmers and how Australia protects our wheat exports through our intelligence services. I will read some passages: When the Prime Minister says that nothing has been reported to him about knowledge of the oil for food scandal, he is skipping through a semantic and procedural minefield. Crikey understands the procedures go like this: If ASIS, the Australian government intelligence agency responsible for collecting foreign intelligence gets information regarding an Australian company, they are forbidden from naming it in formal reports. And if such information came into ASIS, it would not necessarily be passed on to ONA, the security body cited by the Prime Minister on the Sunday program last weekend in a formal report. However, Crikey is told anything of any significance is certain to be disclosed to the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tradebut not necessarily on paper. This whole government's defence is that you cannot find a piece of paper. We do not necessarily need to find a piece of paper, because I think there is already enough evidence of the government's complicity in this whole issue. Just because it is not in writing does not mean it did not happen. The government knows this and understands this. The questions need to be asked: has the Prime Minister any knowledge, or has there been any reporting to him, in any form? Has he got anything in any form? I would be very interested to hear his response on that. How common are these sorts of things? How commonly does this happen? Is this only happening with AWB or is this happening elsewhere? The Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, who is well known to many people, made some interesting comments on this. (Time expired) Hillsong Emerge",123
189,Mr CADMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"My attention has been drawn to press reports of Senate estimates committees and the Australian Labor Party's effort to discredit Hillsong Emerge. Hillsong is a large church within my electorate and has an outreach and welfare arm called Hillsong Emerge. Emerge has many aspects, including youth and drug rehabilitation programs. Some sections of the press have not been slow to pick up these criticisms and grossly misrepresent what has actually occurred. I must pay credit to the local members in the area, federal and state, because not one has picked up these criticisms. I think we all understand the work that is done by Hillsong Emerge. Most of the funds which come to this dynamic community support group are from the congregation of the Hillsong Church. There are some funds from government, but most of the funds they use are from the generous gifts of the members of the congregation. Hillsong Emerge is a separate and distinct organisation with a separate charter, management and legal entity. The reputation of this group was the reason why an invitation to submit an application to apply under the federal government's crime prevention program was taken up by Hillsong Emerge. A funding offer of $414,479 was made to a partnership comprising Hillsong Emerge, the Riverstone Aboriginal Community Association, Riverstone sports centre, Riverstone Neighbourhood Centre and Community Aid Service, Australian Sudanese Youth Union and the Blacktown Police Citizens Youth Club. The administrative costs of this program, to assist in preventing crime and work with youth in western Sydney, was modest for a program of this type and amounted to about 19 per cent of total costs. The program's aim was, as I have said, to assist young people in western Sydney. A sour-grapes outburst at a meeting from the Labor Mayor of Blacktown, Alderman Kelly, resulted in him calling in partners of this ject and encouraging them to break out of the project and establish a separate organisation or separate application of their own. Blacktown City Council receives $14.7 million from the federal government each year, and recently boasted that it has a nest egg of approximately $42 million. The mayor's manipulation of the Riverstone Aboriginal Community Association did eventually result in their breaking from the group and, despite months of negotiation, it was not possible to have them rejoin. The other five partners of the group were enthusiastic for the project's continuation. Eventually, the Attorney-General's Department made an inquiry, after being kept informed of the process and what was going on in the community, as to whether the original contract could be fulfilled. Of course, the answer to that had to be no, because one partner had decided to withdraw. As I said, the five continuing partners wanted to proceed with this excellent project which would have been of great benefit to the young people of western Sydney, particularly the Indigenous and ethnic communities, but that was not able to go ahead. Hillsong Emerge have been advised that they would be eligible to apply for further funding with a different composition in the group. I am extremely disappointed with the attitude of the Mayor of Blacktown. Not only did he succeed in pulling down what was an excellent project, purely out of sour grapes and for party political advantage, but he is now, in the press, blaming Hillsong for poor administration and for being the cause of that process. Nothing could be further from the truth and nothing could be a greater lie. The fact of the matter is that when these matters are reported in the press, extravagant language is used, such as Hillsong being stripped of its funding and that it deceived prothe Aboriginal community. They are the falsehoods that the mayor is basing his arguments on. (Time expired)",124
