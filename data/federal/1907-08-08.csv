Motion (by Mr HUTCHISON) agreed toThat the report be adopted. POST AND TELEGRAPH CONVENIENCES.",14
1,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In the Perth Morning Herald, of the 22nd July last, appeared the following paragraphAs an outcome of representations made by the Premier to the postal authorities for postal and telegraphic conveniences at the Black Range gold-field, in addition to those for which provision had already been made, the Department consented, without guarantee from the State, to connect Maninga Marley with the Black Range telegraph terminus by telephone. was completed yesterday, when the Premier sent a congratulatory message to the people of the district served. Another locality which is to be served is Beria, better known as Lancefield. At this place it has been decided to establish a non-official post-office, to provide facilities, and to construct a telephone line'from Laverton. I wish to know from the Postmaster General if it' is not a fact that the facilities mentioned in that paragraph were granted on the direct representation the honourable member for Coolgardie, supa ported by the senators for Western Ausfield tralia?",14
2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable memper ber was kind enough to 'tell me that he intended to ask this question, and I am [551-2 therefore prepared answerwith the following Application for this line was first made by the Hon. H . Mahon, M.P., and was subsequently supported by Senators de Largie, Henderson, and Lynch, who, with Mr Mahon, waited upon Mr Mauger, when Acting Postmaster-General, to urge the construction of the line. The report from the Deputy Postmaster General of Western Australia showed that the construction of this line would not be justified without a guarantee, and those interested were so informed. It was subsequently shown, to the satisfaction of Mr Chapman, that owing to the construction party being in the immediate vicinity attending to the erection of lines to Black Range and Sandstone, and to other reasons, a guarantee could be dispensed with. Instructions were given to provide the line without a guarantee. The establishment of an office at Beria with telephonic communication to Laverton was at the instance of Mr H . Mahon, M.P., and no guarantee was asked for.",14
3,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster-General, without requiring a guarantee, grant the same facilities in Queensland as have been granted in Western Australia at the request of the honourable member for Coolgardie? Pro Chairman. Mr Mauger - So far as possible. I do not like the guarantee system-, and where there is any prospect of a telephone connection paying, I shall sanction the erection of a line. CONVEYANCE OF MAILS. Mr JOHN' THOMSON - Will the Postmaster-General inform the House whether, as the result of recent negotiations, he is' likely to be able to arrange for the conveyance of mails at reduced rates, particularly on short country lines.",14

5,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It is stated in this morning's newspapers that the Minister of Deof fence proposes to place on the Estimates sum fbr the purchase of ammunition for artillery. Will he also provide for an appropriation for the purchase of proranges for the field artillery ?,14
6,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The provision of ranges for^the field artillery has been under the consideration of the Department for some time past. Inquiries as to the land available have been made in each of the States but it is found difficult to obtain, at anyupon noticething like a reasonable cost, the large areas which are necessary.",14
7,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Range s are essential if full use is to be made of the ammunition.,15
8,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Range s should be proof vided; but the prices asked for the necesHebridessary land have been such as Parliament would not sanction. The endeavour of the Department is to obtain land which is not fit for anything else. I regard the matter as of great importance, and will not lose sight of it. SALVATION ARMY SETTLEMENTS.",15
9,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"The following cablegram appeared in this morning's ArgusA settlement scheme of considerable magnitude has been formulated by the Salvation Army, which has chosen Canada as the field for its colonizing operations. In pursuance of its project, the "" A r m y "" will buy ten townships in the province of Ontario, where it is proposed to settle the immigrants from Great Britain. The purchase of the land is conditional upon its approval by a joint commission consisting of representatives of the Salvation Army and the Canadian Government. I wish to know if the Acting Prime Minister has read that cablegram, and if he will communicate with the Governments of the States, with a view to offering an inducement to the Salvation Army to establish similar settlements in Australia?",15
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I have not read the cablegram; but I do not intend to communicate with the Governments of the States with regard to the matter. PRINTING OF ELECTORAL ROLLS.,15
11,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeReferring to the Return of 19th February, 1907, showing the total cost of elections to have been in 1901, £56,331 us. i d . ; in 1903, £51,414 6s. 7d.; and in 1906, £46,679 9s. 8d., will the Minister say how much of each total represents the cost of printing rolls?

13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are1. No. The amount paid is the difference between the price paid to the settlers in the islands and the price realized in Sydney, which can be checked with quite sufficient accuracy, having regard to the smallness of the individual amounts affected. 2. Captain Rason will be asked to supply all the information in his possession. UNDESIRABLE ALIENS: PROSECUTIONS. Motion (by Mr Frazer) agreed toThat a return be prepared showingr.

Were the fines refunded in any cases; if so, to whom, and why ? FIRE INSURANCE BILL. SECOND 'READING.",15
14,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [2.41] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill was read a first time on the 25th July. In view of the strict scrutiny to which, during the last few months, proposals for Federal legislation have been subjected, I shall begin my remarks by showing that, in my judgment, the Commonwealth Parliament is within its rights in passing a Bill of this description. The power to do so is given to us by the Constitution, section 51 (xiv.), providing thatThe Parliament shall . . . have power make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toInsurance, other than State insurance; State insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned. That provision empowers this Parliament, not only to pass a Bill for the regulation the corporations which are at the present time carrying on fire insurance business, but also to provide, if it thinks fit, the carrying on of that business by Comothers monwealth Departments. I have viously shown that our fire insurance panies exercise a very considerable financial influence in the Commonwealth. One cannot fail to be impressed by the tude of the buildings wherein tions are conducted, situated as they usually are on the most valuable blocks in our great cities. All outward tions ' show that they do a partithe cularly prosperous business, the life surance companies appearing the next most prosperous business, though differing considerably from the former. to The object of life assurance companies to grant facilities to the people to make profits. provision for their old age or days of adwas £ 4 3 , 1 2 4 . versity. They represent the savings the community. The prosperity of fire in- £ 1 1 8 , 9 5 2. surance companies, however, is to a great extent built up by the practice of deceit those compelled by necessity to do busiamounting ness with them. In order to show financial stability of the Australasian fire insurance companies, I shall quote with a few figures obtained by me from the balance sheets published in the Banking and Insurance Record, which is available in the Parliamentary Library. Although I shall quote figures relating to the operaance tions of only a few of these companies, I prosperous. do not wish to suggest that their system is either better or worse than is that of others engaged in the same business. I believe that the whole of the companies adopt simiprosperity lar methods, and that if one be guilty deceit in its transactions with those who insure with them, all are guilty. The toria Insurance Company in 1905 made a profit of £ 2 7 , 5 7 1 , and declared a dividend of £1:7,975, or more than 30 per cent, a capital of ,£50,181. The New land Insurance Company in 1900 had a capital of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and reserves to the too high. extent of £255,000. In 1904 it had built up those reserves to £ 4 0 1 , 5 1 9, notwithsurance standing that in the-meantime it had been paying liberal dividends. The profits of to the New Zealand Insurance Company for 1904 amounted to £ 6 2 , 0 9 8 , and it paid a dividend of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , or 15 per cent, on also its paid-up capital. The Australian Mutual Fire Insurance Company, in 1905, had a reserve fund of .£121,500, made a profit of £ 1 7 , 1 3 6, and paid dividends to the exof tent of £ 9 , 3 1 2 , or 15 per cent, on its paid-up capital. I have referred to the business done by these companies, not because for of any desire to single them out from the doing business in Australia, but beprecauseI have been able to obtain the most comaccurate information in regard to them.",15
15,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Can the honourable member show us what was the average dividend magnipaid by these companies in respectof a their operagiven number of years?,16
16,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I shall put before the indicaHouse all the information that I have on subject. The sixteen Australasian cominpanies operating within the Commonwealth to do in 1904 had a total capital of £1,058,285 . In 1905 their total capital had increased £ 1 , 1 0 1 , 4 0 9, and in most, if not all, is cases, the increase had been made out of The total increase for the year During the same period of their reserves increased to the extent of Their undivided profits amounted to £48,742-thes e were really on reserves-and in 1905 they made a profit to £350,56-], °r ;£53>774 in the excess of the profits made by them during the previous year. During the same period, an increased capital of - £ 4 3 , 0 0 0, they made an increased profit of £ 2 3 , 6 0 3 , or more than half the amount of the increased capital. I have quoted these figures to show that the Australasian fire insurcompanies are at present exceedingly I do not think that any other financial institutions in Australia are able to show anything like the same returns. I am' not so foolish as to suggest that this on their part is a matter for of regret. On the contrary, I think it is a good thing that they are accumulating such Vicenormous reserves in order to enable them to meet any serious disaster. I shall show presently by what means they are making on these large profits and accumulating such Zeaimmense reserve funds. The rates of insurance throughout Australia are altogether I am more familiar with' the position in Western Australia, where the incompanies for the last few years have undoubtedly been fleecing the community.",16
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will this Bill cure that state of affairs ?,17
18,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If it does not reduce the premiums, it will have the effect of compelling every company, where a total loss is suffered by the person insured, to pay over the amount of the policy, instead of being able to say that it has contracted itself out of its liability to meet the claim. I have here an extract from a newspaper published at Kalgoorlie, giving the .report of a meeting of a number of prominent business people who belong to what is usually described as the ""Ariti-Sosh."" party, if there is such a party in Australia. As a general rule they are not prepared to support me. They are usually opposed to State interference, but the fire insurance companies carrying on business in Western Australia increased their premium rates to. such an extent that these people were very glad to appeal to the Premier of Western Australia to introduce a Bill providing for a State Fire Insurance Department.",17
19,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The profits of one of the companies to which the honourable member has referred as doing a magnificent business are made partly in a Colony where a State Department of Fire Insurance is in existence. I refer to the New Zealand Fire Insurance Company.,17
20,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable member turns to the published balance-sheets, he will find that the rates levied locally by fire insurance companies doing business in that Colony have been reduced by almost 30 per cent, since the establishment of the State Department of Fire Insurance. When the honourable member interrupted me, I was proceeding to show that business people in Western Australia were glad to appeal for State interference to save them from the exorbitant charges levied upon them by the insurance companies doing business there. In Western Australia, there has recently been a war of rates amongst the insurance companies; the companies have been enjoying the luxury of a fight amongst themselves. The result shows that they were either making outrageous charges prior to this war of rates, or that whilst that conflict lasted, they were prepared to do business at a loss. During the dispute, risks that in some cases were previously taken at j£$ per cent, were reduced to as low as 15s. per cent. In other cases, risks were reduced from 42s. per cent, to 7s. 6d. per cent. There was a general fight for business, and enormous reductions were made. Having some knowledge of the experience of various individuals in doing business with insurance companies, I suggested that it would be well during this war of rates, which was a big thing while, it lasted, to seek [the abolition of the cancellation clause in the conditions endorsed on the fire insurance policies. When that proposal was made to the companies, however, they declared that they were "" off the business."" They were not prepared to remove the cancellation clause from the conditions under which they were accepting ridiculously low premium - rates. It would thus appear that whilst they were anxious during the dispute to secure business at any - price, they wished to reserve to themselves the right at a future date to cancel all the policies then issued. Sir JOHN. FORREST - Ha d not the policies to extend over a stipulated period?",17
21,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Companie s will accept a risk extending over perhaps four years, but I have not heard of their accepting one going beyond a three-years period. One of the conditions, however, appearing on every policy issued by them is that they may cancel that policy without giving any reason for doing so.",17
22,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Withi n what time may they take that action?,17
23,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"At any time, without giving reasons.",17
24,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,Does the honourable member know of any case where advantage has been taken of that clause to cancel a policy ?,17
25,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not, but I know of cases in which the companies deliberately refused to abandon the cancellation clause. That seems to indicate that they wished to reserve to themselves the-right to cancel policies issued at specially low rates as soon as they could arrive at unanimity on the point.",17
26,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,SWhe n requested by me they removed the cancellation clause.,17
27,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Whil e the war of rates was on?,17
28,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Yes :,17
29,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am glad to hear it. I know a man at present in Melbourne who met with a refusal when he requested one of the companies to remove that clause from a policy. As my honourable friend has had some business transactions with these companies, I should like him to say whether he secured, during the war of rates, any reduction in the premium charges.",17
30,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,We insured at Onetwelfth the rate at which we were previously insured.,18
31,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That would seem to indicate that the rates in the one case were eleven-twelfths too high, or that in the other case they were eleven-twelfths too low. Perhaps it would be reasonable to assume that the rates charged prior to the dispute were about five-twelfths too high.",18
32,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I also found that there were very few agents who could abolish the cancellation clause.,18
33,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that no one could abolish the clause, except the man who holds the power of attorney for a company throughout Australia.",18
34,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I would accept no one else.,18
35,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In that the honourable gentleman showed his judgment. When the honourable member has to deal with insurance companies, he knows he is dealing with pretty sharp customers, and had better have any arrangement in black and white.",18
36,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member would insist on a written pledge.,18
37,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,And I believe the honourable member insisted on a written pledge.,18
38,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I got my solicitor to that.,18
39,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable ber was very wise to do so. In my opinion, insurance rates are altogether too high in hereto Australia. I should now like to quote from the report of the general manager of the State Insurance Department of New £699 Zealand, in which Colony the insurance cumstances. companies previously charged rates similar to those imposed within the Commonwealth. This report shows the effect of the estabimmense lishment of State insurance on the business of the companies. - Mr TUDOR - That is the information which the honourable member for North parte statement. Sydney desired.",18
40,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Hear , hear 1",18
41,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The report, which is for the year ending the 31st December, 1906, statesIn compliance with statutory the honour to submit the following report for the year ended 31st December, 1906. 1906 is the second financial year of the State Fire Insurance Office, and I am pleased to able to point out the continued strong support of the public as shown by the fact that the net income for 1906 amounts fo £20,962 8s., in comparison with £13,127 ns . gd. for 1905. If my memory serves me aright, in 1904 the total receipts of the State Insurance Department amounted to only £1,400, and an increase; to ,£20-, 000 'in three years seems to show that State insurance is becoming immensely popular in New Zealand.",18
42,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What is the profit on State insurance?,18
43,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I shall deaf with that in a moment. The profit to the State Department is not large, but the profit to the people is considerable. The report proceedsEarly in igo6 the insurance' companies abandoned all their "" higher rates,"" and from thence forward the rates of premium of the State Fire Insurance Office and the private insurance companies have been alike. I may here say that in my opinion the difference between the rates which now prevail and those which prevailed just prior to the advent of the State Fire In surance Office represents, say, £200,000 per annum. This report of the general manager of the Department shows that the profit results to the people of New Zealand, and not to the State office.",18
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I wish to know the profit to the State office.,18
45,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It does not come quite do within my speech to give that information, but the profit is stated to be £699 ios. 4d. memThe report gives this informationThe revenue account and balance-sheet attached show that after writing off £634 5s., one quarter of the preliminary expenses, there remains a credit to profit and loss account of ios. 4d., and this result in my opinion is as satisfactory as could be expected in the cirThese figures show that there has been an saving to the people of New Zealand, as the result of the establishment of a State Insurance Department.",18
46,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That is an ex,18
47,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is the expression of the deliberate decision of a man who is not interested as a 'partisan,, but merely acts as the officer of a State Department.",18
48,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"He is in the position of provisions, I have general manager. The year Mr Frazer - I am sure that if my friends opposite were seeking to establish be a similar proposition they would be very well satisfied to use as an argument the port of the chief officer of a partment, rather than that of the manager of any competing institution outside.",18
49,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Member s of the Opposition will quote general managers also, no doubt.",19
50,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Perhaps honourable members may quote general managers of insurance companies in Australia, but they will not be able to quote any who say the companies are in bad financial circumdesires stances, seeing that the balance-sheets absolutely"" the contrary. As a result he establishment of the State Insurance Department in New Zealand, insurance premiums have been considerably reduced the in that Colony; and as the New Zealand offices were previously charging rates form with those charged in Australia, I perfectly^ right in assuming that the panies within the Commonwealth are doing exceedingly well at the present time. have quoted the high rates as one of reasons of the great prosperity of the insurpossible, ance companies, and I shall now refer another reason, provided in the methods which they adopt.",19
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has the honourable member any information which compares like with like-lik e rates and like responsiexperience bilities-in New Zealand and Australia?,19
52,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have not; such mation is almost impossible to obtain; but I have shown that, although the New Zealand rates and the Australian rates were unimember form', or nearly uniform, prior to tablishment of State insurance, the New Zealand companies have had to reduce their rates and compete with the State Departoccur, ment under conditions more favourable to the people at large. Indeed, the panies of New Zealand have had to reduce their rates approximately by £200,000 annum. Mr T OSEPH COOK - That may show that the rates were abnormally high in New Zealand previously.",19
53,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That was the I believe, but I do not think it will be denied that the rates then were almost uniform with those charged in Australia. After all, that is not the aspect of the quesjuster tion I desire to place before honourable members.",19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , but it is a very important aspect.",19
55,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is so, but I think that if the honourable member looks at the balance-sheets, he will see that the Ausin retralian companies are doing very good busiState Deness at the present time.",19
56,Mr KELLY,Unknown,How does that concern the Bill under discussion?,19
57,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have been endeavouring to leave that aspect of the question for the last two or three minutes, but I have been kept from the main thread of my argument by interjections. I now desire to refer to the methods adopted by insurthat ance companies in Australia. If a man to have a building insured, a pershow son representing the company comes to of him and accepts the risk. To begin with, there is an unsatisfactory feature, for the reason that the person who comes to value premises, very often, if not in all cases, receives a commission on the amount of the unipremium to be paid. I think that method am is adopted in connection with agents in all comcases, and also in connection with the salaried representatives of a company. This I gives the representative of a company a the motive for getting premiums as high as because the higher the premium to the bigger his commission. However, we will take it that an insurance is effected for a certain amount, and that a fire happens. I should say that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred of a total loss those who are insured, and have had no previous with companies, are under the impression that they will receive the amount inforon which they pay a premium.",19
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable think that there will be only an the esoccasional fire under the Bill?,19
59,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I hope fires will be less frequent, and that, when disaster does the settlement by the companies will be more speedy-that is the object at which comI am aiming. But while 99 per cent, of the people expect to receive the money on per which they pay premiums, I think only about 1 percent, have ever received the full face value of their policy-at any rate, a very small percentage have done so.",19
60,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Insurer s get case, the amount of their loss.",19
61,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"They hardly ever get the face value of their policy, or the amount of their loss. As soon as a fire occurs an adcomes along, and here, in my opinion, is introduced a most immoral feature of present day fire insurance. The adjuster, like the valuer, is in nearly all cases paid a commission-at all events, in very many cases. I have made the statement before that I think in all cases that is the custom Western Australia. The adjuster is not paid a commission on obtaining a big premium, but on the amount to which he can reduce the figure mentioned in the policy due to the insured. I repeat that it is a most immoral feature of present day fire insurance that a man, who is supposed to act impartially, should have a monetary interest in reducing the amount to be paid by the company.",19
62,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does that deliver apply to all adjusters?,20
63,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I believe it does j I am pretty well certain it does in Western Ausdamaged tralia.,20
64,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Does the honourable' member think that fires are always the reration sult of accident?,20
65,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is a point with which I shall deal later. I am assuming that fires are, so to speak, bond fide, and I say that crime will find no shelter or consideration within the provisions of this Bill . It is not my desire to assist any insurer in committing a f r a u d ; on the other hand, I desire to prevent an insurance company committing a fraud on an insurer when disaster overtakes him.",20
66,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Wh v should an adjuster be impartial, seeing that he represents the company ?",20
67,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"An insurance company could possibly better answer that question than I . In my opinion an adjuster, should proceed to work with an open mind, and without any monetary interest in a reduction of the amount to be paid.",20
68,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,What do premiums amount to?,20
69,Mr FRAZE R,Unknown,"I have not the information at hand now, but the nun. losses of the Australasian companies amount annually to £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 . adjustei arrives and almost invariably offers the insured less than the amount fifteen which is stated on the face of his policy. company If a man genuinely believes sustained a loss of -^500, he may be offered £ 4 0 0 without prejudice. Should That statement is absolutely true. he refuse to accept that amount tention is directed to all sorts of arbitrary provisions, which are printed upon the back of his policy, and be is threatened not, the fact remains that they do it. with various penalties as the result recalcitrancy. I propose to mention of the things which have been done in Western Australia in this connection. . the back of all the policies issued there is a provision that the insured shall produce his books.",20
70,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Is hot that a'good provision ?,20
71,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It may be. I will show how it works out. It reads as followsPersons insured, by this company sustaining anyloss or damage by fire are forthwith to give notice thereof at the office of the company, or to the agent of the company, through whom the policy was effected, and, within fourteen days, in writing, as particular account of their loss or damage as the nature of the case will admit of, such account of loss to have reference to the value of the property destroyed or immediately before such fire, and shall verify the same by the production of their books of accounts, and by affidavit or statutory declaof the claimants, together with the testimony of their domestics, their servants, or other persons in their employ. I now propose to quote the opinion expressed by a solicitor in Western Australia regarding the practices which have been adopted by the various fire insurance companies there. He is a man who has had considerable experience in adjusting claims made against the companies, and in fighting those claims for both sides.",20
72,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Nam e him.,20
73,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have no objection to divulging his name to the honourable member privately, but I am not prepared to publicly disclose it .",20
74,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"The honourable, member is publicly stating his opinion.",20
75,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I did not seek his permission to publicly disclose his name, and m the absence of that permission I have no intention of doing so. I can assure the the honourable member for Fremantle that he has an intimate knowledge of the gentleman to whom I refer, and that he respects This gentleman saysMost policies require that the insured has The to supply receipts and vouchers, and produce books as required by the company within the days. Very often all these are burnt. The asks for them, and because they are not forthcoming, use this as a threat to enforce that he has a reduction m the amount. The his atcompanies have been known to do it.",20
76,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,They cannot do it.,20
77,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Whether they can or I of his would remind the honourable member that some they are not always dealing with lawyers who are well versed in the tricks upon both Upon sides, and that when a man probably has o n l )' £ 1 0 0 u P o n a bouse standing between him and destitution, he is very likely to accept their offer. These covenants in the policy, I repeat, are read over to the assured, who is told that he can either accept the reduction which is recommended by; the adjuster, or fight the matter in the law courts. That is the opinion which is expressed by a gentleman who knows quite as much ujpon tiiis subject as does any man in Australia.",20

He saysThey went to arbitration, and after 'that expense they still would"" not part, and would not give any reason for not doing so. They did not pay, and the assured could not afford to fight, and he never got a bean. This is not my statement",21
84,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,But it is that of the honourable member's friend.,21
85,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is that of a man who is ten thousand times more competent to speak upon this question than is the honourable member. While my legal friend has expressed these opinions, I wish honourable members to understand that he did not agree entirely with the provisions of the Bill which I introduced into the last Parliament. He further statesA man should have the right to sue without or the company might be given the right to.claim arbitration, but if so they should be bound to pay the amount awarded without being allowed to make other defences. A favourite practice by companies is not to pay, not to refuse to pay, and not to give any reasons for doing so. When this occurs the assured is in this position : He reads the numerous and stringent conditions of his policy. He after consultation with his lawyer that it would be easier for him to walk a tight rope than to live up to all these conditions. He eximagines all sorts of things, from want of authority on the part of the agent of the comcomThat brings me to another point, because Western Australia it has been held that the agent who secured the risk for a paradjustticular company was the agent of the asbe paid by sured, and not of the company.",21

88,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It was a very hard case, to in which I think there was some misrepreor umsentation by the agent.",21

91,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think that the policy a was perfectly in order, but the company that it was not the work of their I agent, and that consequently they were not for it. Experience shows that fire insurance companies will take advantage of all the conditions which are endorsed upon the back of their policies. They have done it time and again, and will continue to do it. My legal friend continuesHe has before him the expenses of first arbitration, and secondly a Supreme Court action. He is probably compelled by his lessee to build, whether the company pays or not, and possibly there is a hungry mortgagee looming largely on the horizon with threats. He generally accepts what the company offers or gives.",21
92,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Ye t the author of that letter is opposed to the honourable member's Bill?,22
93,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,He did not agree with some of the provisions embodied in the Bill which I previously introduced. His chief objection was to a provision which has been eliminated from this measure. He is not opposed to what is known as the value system of policy.,22
94,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is he in favour of that principle ?,22
95,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am sure that if he were, the honourable member would not be convinced of its equity. My legal friend is an undoubted authority upon fire insurance matters, and has had a very extensive experience of them. After the companies have resorted to all the measures which I have indicated, they usually fall back upon their right to reconstruct. The provision relating to this.matter readsIn every case of loss or damage by fire for which the said company shall be liable, the same, on being duly proved, shall either .be paid within sixty days, or the said company shall have the option with all convenient speed, to re-build, repair, or reinstate or replace the property insured, and in the case of buildings, to put them into as good and substantial a condition as they were in at the time such fire happened. That is the clause under which the greatest hardships are inflicted on the community. The companies have the right to withhold settlements for sixty days. Within that period no claimant can proceed to arbitration or enter upon litigation to enforce his demands. I intend to again put before honourable members a letter which I read when the Bill was last under discussion. I do so, not because it refers to a particular case, or because I have no other evidence of a similar nature, showing the disinclination of the companies to settle, but because the writer has made a clear statement of the facts, in very moderate language. He is a relative of the Chairman of Committees, and is named MCDonald. Before introducing my first Bill, I wrote to him, asking for an account of his experience in connection with the settlement of a claim under a fire insurance policy. His reply was as follows950 Bourke-street, Boulder City, 12th July, 1906.' Dear Frazer, I received your letter, and I see you wish to be reminded of the actual facts regarding the fire which occurred at my place on January 16th, when my home and furniture were totally destroyed. The fire started in my sisterin-law's bedroom, through the curtains coming against a lighted candle. My house and my furniture were insured with the Commercial Union Insurance Company for £250 and £75. Of course, after the fire, I made my claim to the insurance company. After waiting about fourteen days the company's adjuster, Mr Horner , arrived, and I met him, and he had a builder named Heron with him, and we took measurements of what remained of the house. After about nine days, I received a wire, "" Heron's price to rebuild £180, offer you that amount without prejudice. Horner."" That is, ^70 less than the amount upon which he had been paying premiumsWell, I tell you, I was surprised, as the place cost me well over £300 to build. I immediately, wrote back, and said that the only offer I could accept was the place rebuilt as it was before, or the full amount of the insurance, £250. Mr Bignell, who lives next door to me, told me that the way he heard Heron and Horner speaking he did not think I would get a fair deal. After another week's delay I was informed that Mr Horner would be up on the fields again, and would see me himself. I met him, and he had Heron with him again, and he asked me to accept the money, £ i So, but I told him I did not want any money, I wanted the place rebuilt as it was before. He said that they would start to rebuild right away, but when I told him I wanted to see the architect's plans of the place he proposed to build, he was taken back - He thought he was just going to run up any sort of place, but I would not consent to any building going up without an architect and proper plans and specifications. Horner then took me to Mr Cummings, architect, Lanestreet, Boulder and instructed him to draw up s plans and specifications, and gave him the measurements of the place. Well, the trouble began then. The architect made me get a copy of invoices for nearly every item in the place, such as box framed windows, size and make of doors, stamped metal ceilings, fly screens for windows, and fly doors, and every little item that was outside of Jarrah timber. As the timber and materials were all purchased in the Boulder, I was able to get-them, ""although i<P gave me a great amount of trouble. Another week's delay and the plans and specifications were finished, and, on the whole, it was a fair thing, and about as near as could be expected. But I had to keep getting notes from the timber merchants to make the architect put them in. Another fourteen days' delay, and Mr Horner arrived again, and I asked him when they were going to start and build. He said he was not satisfied with the plans, and I asked him what part he was not .satisfied with, as I had got all the proofs his architect wanted. He said he would underline all he took objection to, and would then send the plans back to me. He then offered me £225 in settlement of my claim for £250 for the house, as I had received the £ j $ for the furniture. But I told him again that the only offer I could accept was the full amount of the insurance or the place rebuilt. Another week's delay, and the specifications were sent back to me with all Mr Horner's objections underlined in red pencil, and I had to prove every detail. Mr Horner said . if I could prove his objections he would recommend that my claim should be settled in full . One item in the specifications that he underlined was-stampe d metal ceilings at 22s. 6d. per square, and I produced a copy of Wills and Company's invoice to show I had paid 37s. 6d. and 28s. 5d. per square for all stamped metal used in my place. The studs in my house were only 18 in. apart, and in the new plans they were 2 f t . apart. But the architect told me that there must be a little give and take in these matters. Well, when I satisfied them of all materials they took exception to the way the place was painted, but I had lost patience, I wrote direct to the head manager in Perth, and went and saw the Kalgoorlie manager, and told him that unless I had a speedy settlement I would publish the full details of rr.y case in the press. I also instructed Mr J. N . Brown, solicitor, to write a letter for an early settlement. I had also engaged an expert builder to go through the plans with me, and he told me that the place could not be built for under £300. Anyhow, I do not know whether it was the solicitor's letter or my threatening to write to the press, but the company settled up with me in full , after keeping me waiting over sixty days. That is the attitude of a company, which, according to some honourable members, does not ""point"" or raise unnecessary objections. There was not the slightest suggestion of anything wrong in connection with the fire, nor was any suspicion entertained in regard to ""the. actions of the occupants of the house, or of the adjoining premises.",22
96,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,What was the company concerned ?,23
97,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Commercial Union.,23
98,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,That is not an Australian company.,23
99,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is not an Australian company, but it operates in Australia. My experience of it is that it is a good company to leave alone. The Tetter concludes with this statement, that the company endeavoured to beat him for exchange oh the cheque, but ultimately recanted.",23

101,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable memparty ber's time may be very valuable, but it . so valuable to me as the interests of the unfortunate persons who cannot obtain settlements from the fire insurance companies. Parliament should protect the public, whose money is now extorted from them by the fire insurance companies under false pretences. If my honourable friend thinks his time is too valuable to be devoted to the consideration of the grievances of such of his constituents as have had experiences similar to that of my correspondent, that is a matter for him and them.",23
102,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Tw o swallows do not make a summer.,23
103,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The case I have quoted is typical of many others in regard to which I have information.,23
104,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,I very much doubt it.,23
105,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is another way of saying that my statements are untrue; a very offensive remark. Those who have known me since I entered this House will be as ready to accept what I say as correct as to accept what the honourable member says. The case to which I have drawn attention is typical of many others which are brought before the adjusters in all parts of Australia. The one subject upon which electors were enthusiastic during my recent campaign in Western Australia was this Bill. I was asked, "" When are you going to deal with the fire insurance companies, by making them pay the amounts which they have contracted to pay ?'' I have put forward a typical case, presented in moderate language, and I know that the statements which I have read are absolutely true.",23
106,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"Some people would call it "" faked.""",23
107,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable member says it is ""faked,"" he does an injustice to me and to the writer of the letter, whose word I would sooner take than that of the honourable member. I - personally know my correspondent, and was in Kalgoorlie when the events of which he writes happened, so that I know the facts of the case, and can vouch for the truth of the statements made.",23
108,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,It is a very exceptional case.,23
109,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In my opinion, it is not exceptional.",23
110,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,That is where we,23
111,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The members of the to which I belong always differ from is not the members of the Opposition, who are prepared. to defend the unsatisfactory actions of big and powerful financial institutions, while we stand up for those who suffer by them. On one side are those who are always ready to support our financial institutions, and, on the other, those who wish to assist the unfortunate people who are unable to fight their cases in the law courts. I am trying to obtain satisfaction and justice from the fire insurance companies, and I have shown that there is strong reason for believing that proper attempts are not made by them to settle the claims brought against them. I shall proceed to support that statement wich figures. All the companies do not show in their balance-sheets the amount of their unsettled claims; [but those that do so naturally desire that this amount shall appear as small as possible. I find that, in the balance sheet of the South British Company, the losses set down as having been sustained in 1904 amounted to £ 1 5 9 , 0 0 0.",23
112,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is that in Victoria?,24
113,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The figures relate to the whole of the Australasian business. The company is registered in New Zealand. Although its losses in that year amounted to £ 1 5 9 , 0 0 0 , there were, at the time of the issue of the balance-sheet, unsettled claims aggregating £57>599- The Australian Mutual Company"" sustained losses amounting t ° £l>°°°> D u the amount of the claims that they refused, or-as they would doubtless put it-were unable to settle. The New Zealand Insurance Company, in 1904, suffered losses amounting to £ 2 7 3 , 0 0 0 , and the claims unsettled amounted to £ 6 7 , 9 6 9 . pose some honourable members would suggest that all these claims were made a few days before the issue. of the balance sheet.",24
114,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Would it not take time to settle them?,24
115,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The complaint I rnake is that the time occupied by the companies in settling claims is altogether too long.,24
116,Mr KELLY,Unknown,But some time must be occupied in inquiring into the cause of a fire.,24
117,Mr FRAZE R,Unknown,The settlement of claims is in many cases unreasonably delayed. I propose to compare these figures with those relating to the New Zealand State Department of Fire Insurance.,24
118,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Can the honourable member give us the volume of business done by these companies?,24
119,Mr FRAZE R,Unknown,I have quoted the losses sustained.,24
120,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Are those losses in respect of a year's operations? Mr Frazer"" - I am not quite certain, but believe that the .balance sheet in each case represents a year's operations.",24
121,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Many of them are published half-yearly.,24
122,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Banking, and In surance Record is issued annually, and I think there is good reason to believe that these figures, which I have obtained from that source, represent the operations of a year. The point, however, does not affect my argument. The Victoria Insurance Company, in 1904, suffered losses' amounting to £ 3 6 , 0 0 0 , whilst its unsettled claims totalled £7,800.",24
123,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,That was nof so bad.,24
124,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The unsettled claims represented about one-fifth of the total losses sustained by the company. In all, sixteen insurance companies sustained losses totalling £ 7 5 5 , 0 0 0 , and nine of the sixteen companies show unsettled claims amounting to £ 1 9 2 , 0 0 0 . Seven of these sixteen companies do not show in their balance-sheets what their unsettled claims amounted to, but, assuming that the prot they do not indicate portion of the unsettled claims to the total losses was the same throughout, then the unsettled claims of the sixteen companies during the period in question must have amounted to no less than £ 2 5 5 , 0 0 0 out of a total loss of £ 7 5 5 , 0 0 0 . They would I sup- thus represent practically one-third of the total losses sustained during this period. These figures support the view advanced by the writer of the letter which I read a few minutes ago, a letter remarkable for the moderation displayed by its writer under very trying circumstances. They indicate that the condition of affairs is the same all over Australia, and that there is no general desire on the part of fire insurance companies ' to meet the losses incurred. ' On the other hand, whilst the total losses suffered by the State Department of Fire Insurance in New Zealand during 1906 amounted to ,£10,312, the unsettled claims shown in the balance sheet before me amounted to only £ 3 0 0 . These outstanding claims, therefore, represent about one thirty-third of the total losses, whereas the outstanding claims of the : other companies amount to about 33 per cent, of the total losses.",24
125,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Is not the honourable member taking the total business of the public insurance companies in the one case, and only the losses of the State Dopartment in the other?",25
126,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"No . Thefiguresquoted are the proportion of unsettled claims to the total loss in each case, and show an earnest desire on the part of the New Zealand State Fire Insurance Department to settle all claims, whilst, on the other hand, it would seem that there is a disposition on the part of the insurance companies to refuse to do so. To my mind, that is the only conclusion that can be drawn. I have dealt more fully than I had intended to do with this phase of the question, but believe that I have convinced a number of honourable members that there is urgent need for a sweeping alteration in the conditions at present governing the operations of fire insurance companies in Australia. I shall now proceed' to explain the improvements which I think this Bill will effect in the present system. If it be passed in its present form, it will lead to the introduction of what istknown in the United States of America as the ""value"" policy. That form of policy has been issued in many of the States of America. Unfortunately, as copies of the laws of the individual States of America are not kept in the Parliamentary Library, I have not been able to ascertain in how many States the value policy system prevails, but I gathered from a work that I read some time ago that it was in operation in about fourteen. That being so, we should not be afraid to introduce it into Australia. I am strongly of opinion that it is unwise for us to be sticklers for precedents. If there is an anomaly to be removed, by all means let us remove it, regardless of whether or not we have precedent for our action. One of 'the objections raised to the Bill, as introduced by me last session, was that it would unduly ' interfere with existing policies. That, in my opinion, was an unjustifiable objection, but it cannot be urged against the measure now before honourable members. I propose that it shall not come into operation until ist January, 1908, and that it shall apply only to renewals or new policies issued from that date. Another point is that the Bill will not apply to marine insurance.",25
127,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,That is too ticklish a subject.,25
128,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Marin e insurance business requires special consideration, and I have refrained from proposing that this Bill shall apply to that branch of insurance for the reason that. I do not know of any case of hardship that hasoccurred in connection with it.",25
129,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Marine insurance most closely approximates to the principle for which the honourable member makes provision in his Bill.,25
130,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That may be. This Bill, however, will deal with risks on. land and not on water. I have also endeavoured to meet an objection that was raised last session by some honourable members, by excluding from the operation of the Bill goods regarded as a fluctuating quantity. I admitted, when this question was under consideration last session, that it was difficult foT a warehouseman to say that he would have £20,000 worth of goods in his warehouse on one day, and stock of equal value a month later. I have, therefore, excluded from the operation of the Bill fire insurance in respect of goods held, for the purpose of trade and commerce.",25
131,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Then what will be left ?,25
132,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Building s as well as household furniture and effects that are not kept for the purposes of trade. For example, this Bill would apply to the insurance of a furniture warehouse in Melbourne. The office furniture in that building could be insured under it, but the stock kept there for sale could not. In the same way the Bill would apply to the insurance of ""a private house as well as to the furniture and the effects in it. A circular dealing with this question has been issued by some one who has not seen fit to disclose his identify, but who evidently has an interest in fire insurance business. In that circular, we are asked whether haystacks and growing crops would be covered by this Bill. In my judgment, they would not, because they may be said to be held for the purpose of trade. They are fluctuating quantities, and would' not come under the operation of this measure. I have endeavoured to make the provisions of' the Bill as simple as possible, but shall be glad to receive the assistance of honourable members in making its scope absolutely clear.",25
133,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,How is a business man to protect himself from loss if he is not to be permitted to insure his stock?,25
134,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"A business man would not be prevented by this Bill from availing himself of the ordinary terms offered by fire insurance companies. Clause 5 of Bill providesIn the event of total loss covered by a the insured shall, notwithstanding any stipulafor tions contained in the policy, be entitled cover from the company the amount insured the policy, and upon which the premiums have been paid. . . . Having regard to the way in which the companies construe the arbitration clause the conditions endorsed on every policy, and the fact that they often refuse to build houses that have been destroyed by fire, I think it is urgently necessary have in the Bill such a provision as this. In the circular to which I have referred, is urged 'that under this Bill all that a pany would have to do in the event of a total loss would be to pay the face value of the policy, regardless of the value of the property to which it related. That is not a true statement of the position. The succular ceeding provision would apply to the surance of property that is not wholly stroyed by fire. If a property is overwhere valued, the insurance company Mr TILLEY BROW.N - Is to blame.",25
135,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Certainly . In such circumstances, the company ought to bear its share of the responsibility. It should be its duty to provide against .the .taking of exceptional risks or premiums when it does not intend to pay. Sub-clause .2 of clause 5 deals with partial losses. The cirreason cular to which I have referred states that theone rule laid down now is that unless the parties can agree, the damaged properties shall be sold, and the full amount of the insurance paid, the proceeds of the sale. That is an absolute mis-statement of fact on the part of those who have issued the circular. I believe I have proved the statement by the documentary evidence have submitted today, and also out of the mouths of the same people, per medium of their balance-sheets, in face of the fact that there is, roughly, £ 2 50,000 of unsettled claims throughSome out the Commonwealth today. We are told that the full amount will be paid less the proceeds of the sale; but I say that no endeavour has been made briefly to do anything of the kind in Australia. The next clause provides against fraud and I repeat 'that if the Bill is not ciently stringent I shall gladly assist amending it so as to prevent any frauds those carrying on fire assurance business. monwealth Any one Tvho attempts fraud of the kind the same as those will receive no sympathy from me, and I the shall, as I say, gladly assist to make the penalty severe enough to deal with any cases policy, which may arise. The next clause provides the abolition of the arbitration provisions to rewhich are in the policies at present, and by which, in my, opinion, are unnecessary. I am told by the companies that my suggestion is - an extremely novel one in these days; and I admit that the tendency is in in the direction of arbitration. If we could have equitable arbitration, with a Judge or rean impartial person as chairman-in the same way as there is in industrial arbitrato tion-wel l and good. But the companies refuse to allow any chairman to be appointed it unless they know him to be in sympathy comwith their own ideas; and hence the arbitration provisions lead to a waste of time, and are practically useless. The provisions are never resorted to except for the purpose of securing delay. We are told in the cirthat, as a matter of fact, arbitration indoes not occur in one case out of a thoudesand, and that it is well known that cases claims are resisted by the company, and are taken into Court, are few and far between.",26
136,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,In small cases the parties could not afford to arbitrate.,26
137,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"They cannot afford to arbitrate even in big cases. Claimants do not resort to arbitration, for the simple that the companies insist on having a chairman who is in sympathy with their views, and who ultimately decides the question.",26
138,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,What the cirless cular means is that a settlement is made in all but one of a thousand cases.,26
139,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It means that a number of cases are never settled, unless settled in misa way which means that the claimant never I gets his money. A new condition in regard to arbitration has been imposed by the insurance companies, in that they now stipulate that, on the death of an arbitrator, another may be appointed in his place. of the arbitration cases have lasted so long that it is deemed wise now to provide for the death of an arbitrator before a claim' may have been settled. I have stated my reasons for submitting this Bill. Of course, it is not so satisfactory, ;' to me as would be one to establish State suffifife insurance, because I think that the in Commonwealth ought to undertake that reon sponsibility. We have power as a Combeneficial to do so, and I believe that the results to the community would be which have followed in New Zealand. There is no necessity for any large capital, because no great reserves have to be built up, the only necessary reserve being found in the confidence and guarantee of the people. The only capital that has been secured by the New Zealand Department is an advance of £2,000, but behind the Department are the people of the Colony, in the event of any great disasters. We in Australia could work on the same basis, with much benefit to ourselves. With State fire insurance, we should not have one-thixd of the claims unsettled, but all just payments would be made promptly, to the most infinitesimal amount, as in New Zealand. There would be the advantage of cheaper rates, and an absence of the unsatisfactory experiences to which I have referred. While, as I say, the Bill is not so satisfactory to me as would be a proposal for State insurance, there is, at the present time, urgent necessity moving the inequitable conditions which at present are imposed by the companies, and which must be removed before there can be any reasonable hope of establishing a State Department. Although the Bill may not be perfect, it will, at any rate, have the effect of stopping the adjuster scandal; in the next place, it will prevent the wrongs perpetrated under the arbitration provisions, which are set out on the back of the policy; and in the third place, it will considerably reduce the number of unsettled claims which are outstanding as a debt from the companies to the people of Australia. Then, further, the Bill will give greater security to those who insure with the companies.",26
140,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Can the honourable member state the amount paid in premiums; and the amount which the companies pay in losses during the year?,27
141,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Accordin g to some figures given in a speech delivered by Mr. Prendergast, M.L.A., in the Victorian State Parliament a little time ago, the total receipts of the insurance companies in Victoria, in 1904, were £651,2.46. while the amounts paid in losses was £254,059. The other expenditure of the companies amounted to £243,853, and we thus have total receipts of £651,000 odd, as against the total expenditure of £497,000 odd, leaving a very considerable profit.",27
142,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The figures for one year are not a reliable guide.,27
143,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I admit that the conditions for one year may not accurately demonstrate the position, because there may be a big fire one year, and no fires for a number of years afterwards.",27
144,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The figures for South Australia for seventeen years support the figures just quoted.,27
145,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I should think that is very likely. As I say, the provisions of the Bill will give greater security to the insurer, and the clauses which seek to prevent fraud will be a considerable safeguard to the country. I commend the Bill to the fair and generous treatment of honourable members, because it will save unfortunate men, in the position of the man to whom I referred this afternoon, from being contracted out of their just dues by insurance companies who are prepared to resort to such methods in order to make immense profits. for re- ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North Sydney) [4-10] - As one who criticised a similar Bill previously introduced by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I should like to say a few words on this new measure. The honourable member has modified in some degree the provisions of the first Bill,' under the criticism to which they were exposed, and if he did wisely, he would still further modify the provisions to such an extent that the Bill would cease to exist. The honourable member's own speech is the greatest condemnation of the Bill. He has claimed that the insurance companies' provisions on the 2X>licies are not only inequitable in regard to what he proposes to amend, but absolutely inequitable in a dozen other ways. If that is so, why should a piecemeal mea' sure like this be introduced? This is the initiation of the exercise of our powers in regard to insurance granted by the Constitution. Are we, a Federal Parliament, justified in dealing in this way with a subject so large-ar e we justified in sending out such a crude and piecemeal measure as our initial effort in the use of our power under the Constitution.",27
146,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,We ought to know the Government opinion on the Bill.,27
147,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I desire to 'know what the Government's action is going to be in connection with the Bill. I do not claim that the insurance business of Australia is in all cases conducted as it should be. I quite admit that there are some hard cases, such as those to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has alluded, but I also know that to pay regard only to such hard cases, without considering the whole of the circumstances connected with insurance, is the worse possible way to make laws.""",27
148,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that the companies always settle to the full amount?,28
149,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There are differences between insurance companies, just as there are between other institutions.",28
150,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Excep t as to their rates.,28
151,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes . That reminds me that the New Zealand Government Insurance Department, as I understand, desires to have the same rates as the other insurance companies-to combine with the companies to keep the rates at'a certain figure.",28
152,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But the rates have been brought down in New Zealand.,28
153,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I have not.much time in which to deal with this Bill on the second reading. The measure is a very serious proposal, which strikes at the basic principle of insurance, namely, that only the loss incurred by an.insurer shall be paid. That principle is not only a'safeguard to the insurance companiesI do not think so much of that aspect, because, if the safeguard were removed, the companies would put up their rates to cover the loss-bu t is also a safeguard to the honest insurer, because his rate is not put up in order to pay dishonest men who may fire their properties. Then the principle is also a safeguard to the community, because the fewer fires there are the better for the community. The Bill has another important bearing, to which I have already alluded. It is the initiation of the exercise of our powers under the 'Constitution in regard to insurance. If it be necessary, as I believe it is, to exercise those powers-necessar y to have one uniform law for all Australia, and, if it be desirable to have one standard policy-fai r as between the parties concerned-the n it is for the Government,' and not a private member, to submit a proper measure. The Bill should not be a small measure like that before us-larg e in its effects, but small in its scope-bu t a measure dealing equitably, fairly, and comprehensively with the whole insurance law of Australia. Surely the Government are not going to stand by, as I am sorry to say they often have stood by, and see measures submitted in a way which takes out of their hands the initiative they ought to exercise. I say that we ought to know the view ""of the Government upon this matter.",28
154,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,Has not a private member any rights?,28
155,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Undoubtedly he has. But the Government also have responsibilities. They may approve or disapprove of this Bill. If they approve of it they should indicate that they propose to bring it forward as part of their policy, and if they disapprove of it they should say so at once. ' If the Bill be passed we shall be committed to this important change of insurance policy, and consequently we ought to know whether it is to be a part of the. Government programme. That is one aspect of the question which I wish to impress upon honourable members. I think that our responsibility, as the Commonwealth Parliament, is involved in this Bill, which initiates our insurance legislation, and the Government responsibility is also involved in it. Therefore, the sooner we hear from a member of the Government what is to be its attitude upon this very important question, and the sooner we learn its attitude towards all matters of insurance upon which we have power to legislate under the powers conferred by the Constitution, the better. These private proposals are all very well in their way. I do not blame the honourable member for having brought this Bill forward-h e had a perfect right to do sobut I think that the Government ought to devote more attention to proposals emanating from private members, and ought to indicate their policy in regard to them at an earlier.stage. Sometimes they do not indicate their policy concerning them at all. I intend to be brief in my criticism of the Bill because the'arguments which I previously directed against certain of its provisions still stand. The measure professes to save expense to insurers-especi ally to those who suffer by fire. I say that it will increase costs to them. If a company is to be compelled to take these uncertain risks, if it is to issue policies, knowing that many of its insurers, by reason of the great difference between the value of certain forms of 'property at the time they were insured and the price which they would subsequently realise upon the open market, will be tempted to incendiarism, then it must provide for annual inspection, which must be paid for by higher rates, and give infinite trouble to insurers. That would not be in the interests of the community.",28
156,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,Has incendiarism been worse in New Zealand of recent years than it was previously ?,29
157,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No such provision is operative in New Zealand. I venture to say that if the honourable member will communicate with the manager of the New Zealand State Insurance Company he will find that that officer will oppose any such proposal as this. comparison can be instituted such as the honourable member suggests, because there is no such provision in the New Zealand law. It is a very dangerous provision",29
158,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"It was not necessary to incorporate it in the New Zealand Act, because that Act goes further than does this Bill.",29
159,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The same companies are operating in New Zealand as are operating here. I may tell the honourable member, in passing, that I visited New Zealand last year, and whilst there made inquiries concerning the rates charged by the State Insurance Company, and, so far as I could judge, they were quite as high as are our Australian rates. Under those rates the State Insurance Company of New Zealand made a profit of only £600, whilst another New Zealand company, as has been mentioned here today, made many thousands.",29
160,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,Does the honourable member deny that the rates were reduced in New Zealand?,29
161,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I neither deny nor affirm it. I do not know. I do know, however, that since they were said to have been reduced, the rates of the State Insurance Company are, so far as one can judge, very much the same as are the rates in Australia. I admit that it is sometimes difficult to compare.",29
162,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Because in New Zealand the houses are wooden ones.,29
163,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Nobod y would ever dream of instituting a comparison between buildings which were constructed of different materials. I am perfectly satisfied that if this Bill becomes law, the honest insurer will be required to pay more than he'pays now to cover the losses caused by dishonest insurers. When the honourable member for Kalgoorlie first brought forward this Bill, he had not the advantage of the criticism which has since been directed to - it. But in the .last Parliament he had that advantage. note that there are still blots remaining: upon the measure-blot s which were pointed out at the time, and which make it absolutely unworkable. For instance, subclause 2 of clause 5 statesIn the event of partial loss covered by a policy, the insured shall, notwithstanding any stipulations contained in the policy, be entitled to recover from the company compensation equal' to the amount of the loss sustained, but not No exceeding the amount insured by the policy. Such loss shall be ascertained by mutual agreement or by the sale of the salvage, and a deduction of the amount received therefrom from the amount of the policy. Let us suppose that a house has the roof destroyed by fire. How can the salvage be sold? A person cannot sell the ground, because it has not been insured, and if the house were sold and the purchaser had to remove it, it would have to be sold as old bricks and mortar. I recognise the honourable member's difficulty in dealing with that point, but the provision relating to it ' in this Bill is sd crude as to be absolutely unworkable..",29
164,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We need only to omit the word "" salvage.""",29
165,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There are many other difficulties which require to be removed. For instance, there is the difficulty created by the difference in the price which the land might bring-the difficulty that it is impossible to bring the selling price of the land .into the calculation. "" I will not detain honourable members at greater length with detail criticism, because I have dealt with this .measure before. I only wonder that the honourable member has introduced it again in its present form. It may be very easy to declare that if an insurance company likes to accept a certain risk it shall pay that risk in the event of a fire taking place. But we have to consider the injury which would be sustained by the community at large if such a system were adopted. I am satisfied that it would lead to what would be against the interests of the community - a large increase in the number of "" fires. When a - property was not saleable in the market for anything like the amount for which it was insured, the temptation to incendarism would be very great. Why not say at once that if a man wished to dispose of a property which he had insured,, the company should pay him the face value of his policy, and take over that property, - because that would result in - a Yet I saving of wealth to;the community by checking incendarism ? The assured would say to the company, ""As long as I retain this property, I will pay vou a premium of so much, but when I no longer desire to retain it you must take it off my hands."" I do not think that this matter has been fully considered. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said that goods not used as merchandise should be insured in this way, but not other goods. I would point out that the difficulties of settlement would be immensely increased by such a proposal. Suppose that a carter insured his property, and that he had fodder for his horses on the premises. Let us further suppose that he had a number of drays there. If a fire occurred, would his loss of these goods be paid by the companies under the provisions of this Bill ? Complications would arise in a thousand ways, and would render settlements infinitely more difficult than they are at present. Take the case also of a person insuring his furniture. Every year a valuation would require to be made, because the furniture, which was worth so much at first, would be worth very little after a number of .years.",29
166,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that there may be a variation or canpoint, cellation of the policy at any time ",30
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Is there to be an annual valuation made in every house throughout Australia in order to point. ascertain that the depreciation which has occurred has not been such as would induce the insured to set fire to his preare mises ?,30
168,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In the case of 90 cent, of those insured, is not there a newal of the policy each year?",30
169,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes, in often without inspection; but why? Beare cause they have to prove their values should there be a fire. There is a very wide distinction between the two processes. In the one case there would require to be annual valuation all over Australia of perty which had not been injured by fire, and in the other a valuation is only needed Order. in the comparatively few instances in which fires have occurred. If that expensive system were forced upon insurance companies, would it not have to be paid for by the insured? The Bill, in that respect, confers no boon upon the insured, but quite the reverse Regarding the hard cases mentioned or others, I may say at once that I am not in favour of some of the terms which are endorsed upon insurance policies. But the remedying of that is a matter for a complete Insurance Bill under the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution, and it should be introduced by the Government. Then private members, if Parliament concurred, might from time to time amend the Act, but the first work-the large work, which is to affect all Australia, and to place insurance upon a proper basis throughout the Commonwealth, assuming that it is now upon a wrong basis-shoul d be undertaken by means of a Government Bill. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has quite pleased me by his statement that the companies are in a sound financial position. Of course, I should be gratified if I were a shareholder in them, which I am not, but I am very, glad to know, as an insurer, that they are so sound financially.",30
170,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I agree with the honourable member.,30
171,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"As an insurer, probably the honourable member will. But I contend that this Bill does not attempt to remedy many defects in our insurance laws. It merely touches upon one and it does so in a very dangerous way.",30
172,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,It touches upon a crucial,30
173,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No ; there many other matters which are more important. The measure is one in regard to which a Minister should state the policy per of the Government. We should know wherether the Government are prepared to adopt it as an instalment of their general policy relation to insurance, or whether they opposed to its provisions, and, therefore, will do their best to prevent the passing of the measure; because we ought not to pass a measure which will disturb all an insurance if it is to be repealed later on proby a more comprehensive Government Act.

174,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [4.34]. - The honourable member for North Sydney seemed to think that, as relief cannot be given to every one, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie should not try to relieve the hundreds who are suffering injustice at the hands of the fire insurance companies. I take a very different view. If the measure will relieve the cases of hardship which we have had brought under our notice this afternoon, its introduction will be absolutely justified. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie made out an excellent case for an alteration of the law relating to fire insurance, and I hope to supplement if with some figures which I wish to place before honourable members. The object of the Bill is, in the first place, to provide that an insurer who suffers the total loss of an insured property shall receive the amount for which he has insured it- a very fair proposition ; and, in the next place, that where only partial damage results from a fire, he shall be paid only the amount at which the damage is estimated. Furthermore, the Bill protects the fire insurance companies from fraud and illegal practices; so that it is fair to both the companies and those who insure with them. In a circular which has been issued by the Fire Underwriters' Association in regard to the Bill, it is stated that, if the measure were carried, encouragement would be offered to gambling; but I think honourable members will admit that all fire insurance business is gambling. An aspect of the case which was not dealt with very fully by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is the injustice done to the public by. the action of the companies in forming themselves into a "" ring."" Some years ago, in Sputh Australia, I insured the premises of the firm with which I was connected with the Liverpool, London, and Globe Insurance Company, and after I had paid premiums for some years, I received 'a notice increasing the rate to 8s. or 9s. per £ 1 0 0 , accompanied by a circular, which read. The increased premium,. as per the renewal notice attached, is strictly in accordance with the provisions adopted by the fire tariff of all companies. , By forming themselves into a ring, the-fire insurance companies have eliminated competition, and insurers are compelled to pay the rates which they demand. That is another justification for passing legislation regulating fire insurance. There can be no doubt that it is very difficult to get claims^ settled by the companies. The honourable' member for Kalgoorlie has proved that that is so. He showed that the nine companies doing business in Australia which state in their balance-sheets the amount of their unsettled claims had, in one year, no less than £^200,000 worth of claims unsettled, while seven others gave no figures at all in regard to this part of their business. Not one person in twenty who effects an insurance reads the conditions of the policy. I have spoken to scores of persons who have insured furniture, asking them what they thought to be .covered, and in nine cases out of ten I have been told that if the house were burned, insurance would be paid upon all the furniture and ornaments it contained, although, as a' matter of fact, all sorts of exemptions are insisted on. The Bill is necessary to prevent persons from over-insuring. It has been referred to as offering an inducement to arson; but the inducement is greater under the present conditions, which allow of the insurance of property for considerably more than its value. An insurance manager, to whom I was speaking the other day, told me that the companies do not permit persons to overinsure ; but my experience shows that they do. I had a plant insured for a certain amount, and each year wrote off 20 per cent, for depreciation, re-insuring it at the reduced value; but the company would have taken it at the original value for the whole period. The companies do this all over the Commonwealth. Persons insure, for the same amount each year, houses, plant and stock, which are constantly depreciating, and, although the companies accept"" premiums for the full amount, if fire occurs, they pay only on the actua.1 value of the property at the time of the disaster. That should be prevented. Something might well be said about the profits made by these companies. The figures will astonish honourable members.",31
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the object of the Bill to cut down the profits of the lire surance companies?,32
176,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I sincerely hope so.,32
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They are attacked because they are doing well?,32
178,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"When I complained in the South Australian Parliament of the action of the London, Liverpool, and Globe Company in raising my premium to 8s. or 9s. per ;£ioo, some of the leading merchants of Adelaide congratulated me, and supplied me with very valuable information, because they were anxious that something should be done to prevent companies which were receiving such unfair profits from pressing too heavily upon their customers. The original capital of the London, Liverpool, and Globe Insurance Company was £245,600. In the years 1883, 1884 and 1885, it paid dividends at' the rate of 57 per cent, per annum; in 1 1886 and 1887, at the rate of 65 per cent.; in 1888, at the rate of 70 per cent.; and in 1889, 1890, and 1891, at the rate of 75 per cent.",32
179,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,The companies have had to pay away many hundreds of thousands of pounds in connection with the San Francisco disaster:,32
180,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I am dealing with Australian conditions. If our conditions were similar to those of'San Francisco and South America, I should be prepared to assist the insurance companies. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In San Francisco they are refusing to pay.",32
181,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The sixteen Australasian fire insurance companies have not done as well as the London, Liverpool and Globe Company; but they have done very well, seeing that for the three years, between 1902 and 1905, their underwriting surpluses amounted to 14.15 per cent., 14.06 per cent., and 16.64 per cent. That is a very handsome return. According to the balance-sheets published in the 1905 volume of the Australasian Insurance and Banking Record, after deducting losses and expenses, the trade surpluses of'eleven of the Australasian companies run from 18 to over 40 per cent. Is it fair that so large a profit should be taken out of the pockets of those who do business with these companies? Is it not time that we took action to compel them to deal more fairly with their customers?",32
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How will this Bill cure that trouble?,32
183,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I do not claim in that the Bill, as it stands, would do so. I quote these figures in order to show that it is necessary for us to go even further than the honourable member for Kalgoorlie proposes. If the honourable member for Parramatta thinks that the trouble should be cured, then I shall invite him later on to join with me in taking action in that direction. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said that he will be glad to have our assistance in improving the Bill. As a matter of fact, I do not approve of the whole of its provisions, and there is no reason why we should not amend it. One at least of the provisions of the Bill, as it stands, is unworkable; but I ' hope that we shall proceed to make the whole measure a thoroughly practical one.__.",32
184,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The fact that the percentage of profit is low in the case of some of the companies is because they pass on a lot of it to capital. Where the percentage is large, the business is more or less a gamble.",32
185,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Exactly. The whole business is a gamble, although I admit that it is a necessary one. At a conference held in Ballarat on 1st May, 1896, figures were quoted in regard to the operations of the companies which opened the eyes of the people of Australia. The operations of fifty-four offices-the names of which were given-for 1894-5, were dealt with. The expenses were set down at £.3>309,4i7, the commissions amounted to ,£3,002,172, dividends to £1,836,188, and the premiums paid to £19,211,647. Thus, out of premiums amounting to ^£19,211,647, £6,300,000 was expended in respect of management and commission, and £1,800,000 in dividends. A glance at the prices ruling for shares in insurance companies must satisfy any one that a fair and legitimate business is not being done. In many cases the scrip is from four (o twenty times its original value. This should convince honourable members that the profits the companies are making are altogether too large. According to the Banking Record of 1895, page 398, the fire premium income of the Commercial Union Assurance Company for 1892 was £1,010,514. Its losses totalled £751,146, and its expenses amounted to £331,194. For 1893, its fire premiums amounted to £1,127,744, its losses to £678,873, and its expenses to £345,219. These companies are equally prosperous today, and we should compel them to adopt reasonable rates if their sense of fairness will not permit them to do so. The honourable member for North Sydney expressed a desire to secure a statement giving a comparison of the premium rates ruling in New Zealand with those obtaining in Australia. I  the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, stated in the House last week that he had obtained from the Government of New Zealand official information showing the operations of the State Fire Insurance Office up to 30th June last. He said that the first statement before him related to the year 1906, and was as followsThe State Fire Insurance Office commenced business with premiums 10 per cent, less those accepted by the private insurance panies, and a little later the latter reduced to the same level all rates, except on dwellings, necessary information. which were lowered by 33^ per cent. The State Fire Insurance Office thereupon reduced lings by 33^ per cent. The private insurance companies also decided : (1) To decline reinsurances from or to give reinsurances to the State Fire Insurance Office, and (2) to decline to accept any risk on which the State Fire Insurance Office held a line; and this attitude was tained by the private insurance companies until early in 1906, when they agreed : (1) To tinue to decline reinsurances from or to reinsurances to the State Fire Insurance Office, but (2) to allow each other to accept risks which the State Fire Insurance Office held a line, and also to abandon their objection State Fire Insurance Office accepting risks, which they themselves had lines. The State Insurance Office has evidently found favour the public, and, seeing it has been successful, it f u l ly justifies the object of its inauguration, viz., that the Government office should regulate the rates of fire insurance premiums on the of fair prices, which on an average would leave a reasonable and legitimate and trade profit on the business of fire insurance for all concerned. The honourable member for North Sydney that will observe that, according to this official information, the fire rates in New Zealand, were considerably reduced upon the estabannum. lishment of the State Department. If be true that at the present time they are only approaching the rates prevailing Australia, I should like to know what they would have been but for the creation the State Department. The dairy farmers mind, unjustifiably deducted. of South Australia have had a similar perience. As a matter of fact, it was found that for some time they were not being paid a fair price for their cream, and the Government were induced to step and establish a State butter factory, That factory is not turning out a very large quantity of butter, but, as the result of establishment, the dairy farmers are now securing a fair price for their cream. Mr Hutchison.",32
186,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The position is the same in every case. ' Mr HUTCHISON - That is so. I do not think that we should take into consideration the question of what profit is being made by the State Fire Insurance Office of New Zealand. As a matter of fact, I do not like to see a State Department making large profits. Its object should be, not to make profits, but to convenience the people and provide the cheapest possible service consistent with efficiency. When I was a member of the Parliament of South Australia,. I sought to obtain information as to the receipts and losses of the insurance companies doing business there, but than at first found it impossible to do so. I comtherefore moved for a return supplying the Various obstacles were placed in the way of its preparation. dwelAlthough the Fire Brigades Act required that the insurance companies should submit to the Fire Brigades Board copies of their balance-sheets, I'found that only the secretary to the Board was permitted to see mainthem. I certainly respected the reason for conthis practice, namely, that one company eive did not wish another to ascertain the volume of business that it was transacting. on In the interests of the public, however, I to the urged that we had a right to secure the on fullest information on the subject, and I Fire am glad to say that the State Parliawith ment agreed to my motion for the prepara? tion of such a return. My motion provided that the return should show the premiums basis received and the losses sustained during a period of ten years. It was decided, however, that the return should covera period of seventeen years. This return showed for ten years the losses did not exceed £5,000 per annum; while, on the other hand, the premiums averaged £61,000 per For the whole seventeen years, it the premiums averaged £63,000 per annum, but I am unable to give the losses for in the same period. There can be no question that the profits were understated. of Certain office expenses were, to my I reexgret that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has not proposed that we shall'go further in the direction of fire insurance law. The honourable member for in North Sydney says that if we are to deal with this question at all, we ought to cover the whole ground. The House has its shown no inclination to do anything of the kind, but that is no reason why we should not seek to make at least some improvement in the present system. I should like to see established a State Department of Insurance for the Commonwealth. Such an establishment would lead to enormous savings. Instead of the sixteen expensive staffs of the Australasian companies, we should have one central office carrying out the whole of the work, and I am sure the result would be that the present rates would be reduced by more than one-half. I regret that under clause 4, goods, wares, or merchandise, owned or held for the purpose of trade or commerce, are to be excluded from the operation of the Bill. The honourable member for North Sydney expressed his pleasure that the provision in the Bill, as submitted last session, that the insurance of all goods should come within its operation, had been eliminated. Personally, I regret that that course has been adopted. I do not know of a greater injustice than that which is suffered by business people under what is known as "" the average clause"" in the conditions endorsed on insurance policies. I hope that we shall try to devise some means of remedying the evil. The average clause is misleading and unjust. The face risk on a policy may really be much less than the insurer anticipated. Let me illustrate the point that I wish to make. A business man might have on his premises £3,000 worth of goods, and might take out a policy for ,£2,000. The insurance company would be quite willing to accept a premium upon that amount, but if the man were unfortunate enough to have all his goods destroyed iby fire, he would receive, not £2,000, but something like £1,330. It is unfair that a company should be allowed to accept premiums upon an insurance policy 'of £2,000 and pay only £ i ) 3 3 ° when the whole of the goods covered by that policy are lost.",33
187,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Do they never pay the full amount of a policy?,34
188,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Le t me explain. The argument of the companies is that the insurer has taken a risk up to £1,000that is, that the company takes the risk of £2,000, and for the remaining £1,000 the insurer fakes the risk. Consequently, a fire occurs, a proportion of this £1,000 risk is considered in adjusting the claim. If a company .insures any class of goods for £2,000, and the whole of those goods are destroyed, it is only fair that the company should pay the full amount, seeing that the premiums are on - a risk of £2,000. The difficulty is really in ascertaining whether the goods have been destroyed, because a man may have £10,000 of goods in his warehouse today, and only £2,000 worth three months hence. That, however, is a matter that can be dealt with in Committee. It is possible that sub-clause 2 of clause 5 referred to by the honourable member for North Sydney will require amendment. The word ""salvage"" makes it rather difficult to deal with the provision. Honourable members can imagine a case in which a man has insured his furniture for, say, £200, and damage has been done to the extent of £50. The company offers to P y £ 5 ° to the insurer, and, if the in a surer is not satisfied, the company, under the Bill, will be compelled to sell the remaining £150 worth of furniture at what is practically a forced sale, where only a fraction of its value may be realized, and also pay the insurer the full amount of £200. I do not think that such a provision is fair to a company, and in Committee I shall endeavour to so amend the clause as to make it more equitable. A similar position would arise in such a case as that referred to by the honourable member for North Sydney. A building which, for instance, had its roof burnt, could be restored, and it would be very unfair to compel a company to sell a partially damaged building for whatever it would fetch, and, at the same time, pay the insurer the full amount. The underwriters assure us that this is a Bill to incite crime. If that be so, it is an argument for the abolition of fire insurance altogether. All fire insurance is an incitement to crime, but the punishment for wilful fire raising is so severe that I do not think there is likely to be any considerable increase in the number of incendiaries, simply because of the slight injustice proposed to be done to insurers. There are some remarkable statements in the circular. For instanceEvery description of propertv is subject to fluctuations in value. Buildings may lose in value by deterioration and in various other ways, such as the decay of a locality or changes in the cost of material and labour. That is quite so, but that is a matter about which the companies have never troubled if their heads; they have allowed insurers to believe that if anything happens to an insured building, they will get the amount for which it has been insured. There is an injustice which it is our bounden duty to remove at the earliest moment. The circular also - says that it would not be a convenience to the public for the companies to be perpetually revising the amount of the insurance, and endeavouring to adjust it to th«> actual value. What trouble would there be in doing that ? If a man is in business it is well known what the usual deduction for depreciation is. It would be just as easy for the insurance companies tofixa fair depreciation on all properties insured as it is for them to fix the rates of premium on the amount insured-rate s are most arbitrary. It must be remembered that all the companies met and agreed upon a tariff which applies, not only to one industry or one street, but to all the different streets and conditions in both town and country. If the insurance companies can do that, it would be a simple matter for them, in the case of furniture or other goods not new, to write off 20 per cent, for depreciation, and make a corresponding reduction in the premium paid. The circular goes on to say that the business is a special one, and cannot with advantage to the community be conducted without safeguards. But what safeguard has the insurer at the present time? He has not even the safeguard of the solvency of the insurance company,, but has to take the whole risk, although he is called upon to pay anv premium which the company chooses to extort. The circular further says that it is contrary to public policy for ii man to make money out of a fire. If that be so in regard to the insurer, surely it should also apply to the insurance company. The companies ought to be able not only to make a fair profit, but to do well. It is when they become extortionate that it is time for the Government to step in. We are told in the circular that the cost of insurance under the Bill will be increased. But the companies have increased the cost of insurance just as far as their conscience would allow. There is nothing to prevent the companies at the present time going further, except their fear lhat, in view of their enormous profits, which are published, the State would feel bound to step in and see justice done. Although I am not satisfied with the Bill as it stands, I am wholly in agreement with its object, and I shall do whatever I can to pass it into law.",34
189,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [5.7] - I agree with the honourable member for North Svdney that it is a pity to deal piecemeal with such legislation. I acknowledge that there is a good deal in what has been submitted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. While I am perfectly certain that what he placed before the House were facts, I cannot, of course, say that the facts are quite sosignificant as they seemed, from the stress he laid on some of them. For instance, we had certain cases mentioned as having come from a lawyer. I do not mind much those cases which come from lawyers. We cannot possibly strike an average of those which are disputed or undisputed when we take cases from the business done by professional men, because, in everv instance, they have to do with disputes. Again, I do not mind very much the apparent deductions he drew from the figures in regard to the amount of the losses suffered between certain balance-sheets and the total of the unsettled claims. For instance, the.honourable member for Kalgoorlie mentioned one case in which £160,000 was the total of the claims in the interval between the two balance-sheets, while the actual unsettled claims amounted to something like £60,000. If the balance-sheets are, as in many cases, issued half-yearly, we have a total of over £200,000 of settled and unsettled claims, and if only one-fourth of that total are unsettled, it simnly means that they are pending inquiry. If the interval between the balance-sheets is only six months, and the total claims ,£200,000, and only a fourth"" of these are unsettled, there is no significance to be attached to the figures. We must assume that at least ,£50,000 of the claims will be unsettled for six or seven weeks, seeing that, in case of fire, there must be some scrutiny or ascertainment, through invoices or otherwise, as to the total stock and damage of goods. Even then, we should have to find the proportion of the total claims to thetotal business done, before we could draw anything like a reasonable deduction. Again, I do not pay much attention to the quotation in regard to the profits made by the companies. Some companies carry a large portion of their profits to a reserve fund, which is propeji insurance; other companies do not do so, which is not proper insurance, but, largely, gambling. I shall not say it is purely gambling, though it partakes too much of the character of gambling to make it true insurance. For that reason, when big fires occur in certain parts of the world, a number of companies go to the wall, because they have never based their returns on a true calculus of probabilities in relation to fire. A great many companies were ruined when Chicago was burnt, and the same occurred in connection with the more recent disaster at San Francisco; but in true insurance, catastrophes of that sort ought not smashcompanies. Some of the States have hesitated to follow the example of of insurer and insured. New Zealand in establishing a State sysI tem of insurance, because it requires very wide basis of operation to average a monopoly. true calculus of the probabilities of fire. This seems to have been done fairly well in New Zealand, though not so well as was anticipated. There have been no big fires in that Colony, but the difference tween the State premiums, as quoted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and the premiums of ordinary companies, was at the start, as mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, about 10 per cent., and is too small to suggest the success of the part of the British Dominions. New Zealand system in comparison with private companies. In the case of lives, can fairly well ascertain the percentage of deaths, even within a year. take Bayle's Table, we can, in the case one thousand people of the age of twentyorable eight years, ascertain that about 1 per cent, will die within the year, and even if there is abnormal mortality in relation to that number, it does not go up to is more than n or 12 per thousand. With, therefore, the abnormalities of human life so little affecting the rate of premium, may with absolute certainty predict what the premiums ought to be. There is required, in the case of lives, an area of operation over a very wide field, but the case of fire insurance, the circumstances are quite different. We cannot, over a period of ten years, or even fifteen years, form general theory as to the number of firesthe calculations must be more or less hapence hazard. Under the circumstances, there very large element of gambling risk in fire insurance operations that are limited to comOf paratively small geographical areas, or areas in which settlement is not very dense. One result of a Bill of this sort, which makes an exception of Australia to the general principle that insurance is a confor tract of indemnity, may be that some of the larger companies may decline to take the risk of operating in the country where the conditions do not harmonize with theii general principles. If that be so, we shall drive away those very companies which, with their wide spheres of operations, can afford to do business at lower rates. merely throw out the suggestion as a pos-. sible development of this Bill. No doubt we are entitled to make the proposed change from a contract of indemnity, which is the basis of insurance, to to an Act of Parliament regulating, to a great extent, the future relations We are., say, entitled to make the change if it a be expedient. Insurance is more or less a One of the very reasons I gave-that the sphere of operations prevents a State, if not a large State, from engaging In such an undertaking with the prospect of benefits great enough to jusbetify State interference-show s that, more or less, it must be a monopoly, because it requires a company with considerable operations to do the work. .The better class of companies are those who do not only local business, but also business over a greater But the business is in its nature a monopoly, and, we being such, we are entitled to effect a change in the law of"" contract if it becomes If we expedient to do so. I do not apof prove, of the legislation, which the honmember desires to place upon our statute-book. To my mind, it is a pity to deal with the question of insurance in a piece-meal fashion, and by a measure which so open to criticism, as far as it goes. There ought to be a comprehensive Bill introduced relating to insurance. Perhaps, if we the subject be well considered, with the staff which the Government have at their not disposal, a measure may be submitted which will mitigate, if it does not entirely in remove, some of the evils upon which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie dwelt in moving the second reading of this Bill. I a acknowledge that cases of great hardship do occur. I have had professional experiof some cases, ini which claims were is a ultimately paid up to many times the amount originally offered to the insured. course, it is to the interest of insurance to agents, who assess the damage caused by fire, to stand as well as they possibly can with their companies. However honest a man may be-seein g that he is only the assessor one side in a good many cases-h e will, as far as possible, keep down the estimate of damage. As a result, the insured frequently labours under a senseof injustice when, through lack of capital, he is unable to employ anether assessor to counteract the estimate of the companies' assessor, or to proceed to arbitration where, should he fail I to establish his claim, he would be required to pay the whole of the costs. Then there are cases in which insurance companies, not wilfully, but owing to excessive suspicion - that arson might have been committed,, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, harass the assured. Though these cases may not be as numerous, or may not go so far as the honourable member declared, they exist, perhaps, to an extent that would justify some legislative check being imposed upon their operations. By means of combinations the companies also maintain premiums at an unfairly high rate. But against that we must re- collect that fire insurance business is, to a large extent, a gamble, and the premiums must necessarily be high to enable them to survive great losses. The companies receive a tremendous shock when big losses occur, and, consequently, the premiums paid must be high. The premiums, therefore, seem to bear a very large proportion to the capital invested, but, as a matter of fact, in some cases, the invested capital is not the security of the assured. It is the capacity of the shareholders to answer applications for calls. They take the risk, and accept a certain premium. That premium is not based upon the true principles of assurance. Consequently, the premiums seem high. We must not attach too much significance to that, but that there have been combinations to maintain premiums at undue rates is well attested by the dence given by the honourable member for Hindmarsh in connection with suggested proceedings in the South Australian Parliament. While I do not like to oppose an attempt to accomplish something by means of a Bill introduced by a private member, I think that the Government should announce that, within areasonable time, they will bring forward a comprehensive measure dealing with the question of insurance. I do not like to say that the Bill under consideration will fail in its operation, I fear that it is a dangerous one to pass, at all events, in its present form. Where a total loss occurs, it undoubtedly proposes to substitute an entirely new principle-the gambling principle-for that of indemnity, which is the true principle of insurance. Of course, I exempt marine insurance, because in that case the insurance is effected for the value invested. Why ? Because, as a rule, marine insurances are effected for voyages, and a proper estimate of the value of the vessel is obtained before she is insured. The valuation takes place at the beginning of every voyage. But that does not occur in connection with the insurance of furniMr Glynn. ture or houses. It would not pay a comr pany if it were obliged to obtain a fresh valuation of every property insured before accepting a renewal premium each year. The payment of a small premium of ios. per £ 1 00 would not justify an annual valuation, which might perhaps cost 15s. Under the circumstances, the fire insurance companies, to a large extent, have to rely upon the honesty of the assured, instead of testing his honesty every year by means of a valuation. I am afraid that if the Bill is' passed in its present form we shall be substituting a new principle-reall y that of a gamble, represented by the payment of the total value of the policy irrespective of the loss sustained-for the present indemnity contract,' which to some extent is a security against the commission of arson. If the assured must prove the total loss which he has sustained before he can recover, there is no doubt that that safeguard must diminish the probability of arson being committed. The particular provision in the Bill relating to this matter is subclause 1 of clause 5. But, in sub-clause 2 of the same clause, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie departs from this principle, and falls back upon the old onethe - contract for indemnity-by declaring that the company concerned shall be called upon to pay, not the difference between the evi- amount of the insurance and the loss sustainedi or the difference between the amount insured and the salvage, but the difference between the loss at the time of the fire and the loss immediately afterwards. That is the effect of sub-clause 2 of clause 5. In other words, this Bill is inconsistent with itself. The first portion of clause 5 deals with a new principle, and the next, portion abandons it, thus evidencing the necessity for a comprehensive and well-considered measure being presented to but the House. Sub-clause 2 of clause 5 statesIn the event, of partial loss covered by a policy, the insured shall, notwithstanding any stipulations contained in the policy, be entitled to recover from the company compensation equal to the amount of the loss sustained but not exceeding the amount insured by the policy. whole That is the principle of insurance at the present time. So that this Bill will not improve matters. The law of general averages is not touched by the new definition embodied in the measure. The Bill is chiefly designed to protect insurances upon houses and furniture. But the danger is that sub-clause 2 will be chiefly operative, because the bulk of the losses sustained will be partial losses. Even if one article of furniture only were destroyed by fire, it would represent a partial loss, and the principle of the payment of the total amount would apply. If a joint assurance of furniture and a house were effected-on e cannot oblige a fire insurance company to issue separate policies-it might be that if the house were totally destroyed whilst the whole of the furniture was not, the assured, instead of getting the total amount, would get-only the difference between the value of the house and furniture immediately before the fire, and their value immediately afterwards, so that he would be in no better position than he is at present if the Bill became law. The impression which I formed in listening to the honourable member moving the second reading of the Bill was that the measure ought not to be initiated by a private member, but by the Government. For the edification of the House, the sooner the Ministry declare their policy upon the matter the better. Debate (on motion by Mr HUME COOK) adjourned. QUARANTINE BILL. In Committee (Consideration lesumed from 7th August, vide page 1565): Clause 14- ' The Governor General may exempt, for such time and subject to such conditions as he lit, from all or any of the provisions of Actfa) any ship of war; (4) any vessels trading exclusively between Australia and New Zealand or F or other places adjacent to Australia; (c) any particular vessel and, (d) any persons, animals, plants, or goods.",35
190,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [5.30] - In paragraph d of this, clause, it is proposed, plies to give the Governor General power to quiring exempt from the provisions of the Act any person, animals, plants or goods. Judging from reports which I have seen, this provision is regarded in some of the States as rather dangerous, since it gives the Minister too much discretion. Under it, any animals, plants or goods could be exthat empted from the operation of the measure. There is no such provision in the South ratus. Australian Act, and the regulations passed under that Act fix a specific period of quarantine for each class of animal, any one reading the Act and the regulations is completely informed on ject. I am not willing to submit an amendment; but I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of modifying the clause. If the measure is sensibly administered, there will be no danger, although the South Australian Chief Inspector of Stock speaks of the clause as a very dangerous one.",38
191,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.33] - The power given by the clause will be exercised sparingly, and only on the strongest recommendation from the quarantine authorities.

198,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [5.40] - In my opinion the word '' master ' ' should be substituted for the word "" owner "" in this clause. It may be difficult to find the owner of a vessel, while it may be necessary to travel half round the planet to serve a notice upon him. The master, however, will be on board, and always accessible. I wish, too, to know why, if the Government consider it necessary, in the interests of health, that vessels trading regularly to Australia shall carry disinfecting apparatus, the provision is made to apply only to such vessels as carry passengers. Surely the health of seamen is equally entitled to consideration? I think that the clause should applv to all vessels.",39

Penalty : Fifty pounds.",39
200,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [5.43] - I am advised that, if the power given in this clause were exercised by an inexperienced officer, valuable merchandise might be seriously damaged. Certain disinfectants will ""damage certain cargo, and their use, therefore, may involve shippers in serious loss.. There ought to be some safeguard against this. I do not assume that any official will maliciously try to injure shippers or ship-owners;. but I suggest that consideration should be given to an amendment which I have been asked to submit, inserting after the word "" Commonwealth,"" in line 4, the words "" and not proceeding to a port outside the Commonwealth and in completion of the voyage."" This would narrow the.scope of the clause. No doubt the Government should have the fullest powers, to use in times of emergency; but I suggest that consideration should be given to this proposal for safeguarding shippers and ship-owners from loss by the action of ignorant or over-officious persons.",39
201,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attorney General) [5.45I-If the honourable member carefully examines the clause he will recognise that there is no reason why it should be dreaded! The process of fumigation would be specified, and the owner of the vessel would then see that the work was carried out as directed. I cannot conceive of an officer attempting to fumigate a vessel in such a way as to do damage to its structure or cargo. Mr KNOX' - As a matter of fact, such a thing has frequently taken place.",39
202,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"This and the preceding clause were inserted on the recommendation of the Conference, who reportedThe Conference has advised in the proposed Commonwealth Quarantine Bill that it should be made lawful to require vessels trading in Commonwealth waters to be fitted with such disinfecting plant as the Director-General may deem necessary, and as may be prescribed by regulation. Then we have the statement in regard to this clause that It has further advised that the Commonwealth Government should seek powers for subjecting every vessel trading in Commonwealth waters to an approved process for the destruction of verAustralian vessel min at intervals. . I think that the honourable member will recognise the necessity for this power.",39

205,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Whether we should limit the area of operation.,39
206,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"A vessel might proceed from a plague-infected port in Australia to a clean port in the Commonwealth, and as the result of the escape of vermin from it the disease might be spread in the latter port. The mere fact that that vessel intended subsequently to proceed to a port beyond the Commonwealth should not be sufficient to exempt it from the provision as to fumigation.",39
207,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I recognise the necessity for taking this power, but should like the Attorney-General to - carefully consider the question I have raised.",39
208,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall do so. The honourable member desires that this power, which must necessarily be taken, shall not be exercised in a way likely to cause'injury to a vessel or its cargo. I promise to have special representations made fo the Department, and to have the point considered.",39
209,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I am satisfied. . Mr MCWILLIAMS (Franklin) [5.48IThis provision would be unobjectionable if it applied only to vessels in ballast, but what would be the position if a steamer with a cargo of butter proceeded from a plague-infected port in Australia to a clean pott, where a Customs House officer determined that it should be fumigated? The whole of the dargo of butter would be tainted, and rendered valueless. I recognise that it is very necessary, in the interests not only of, the people generally, but of officers and seamen, that vessels should be - fumigated from time to time, but the point I wish to make is that in order to destroy rats, mice, and other vermin on a vessel all the holds would have to be treated. If that course were adopted in the case of a ship having on board a cargo of perishable produce, great loss would be sustained. This provision should be exercised with great caution and discretion. Under the clause as it stands a quarantine officer at the last Australian port of call could cause a vessel bound for a port beyond the seas to be fumigated. I think it would be better to provide that vessels shall be fumigated before taking in cargo.",39
210,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"A vessel that had been fumigated whilst empty might take in a cargo at an infected port, and proceed to another in which there was no disease. This is a power which will rarely be exercised.",40
211,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"In nearly every port in the Commonwealth steps are taken to prevent rats boarding or leaving vessels berthed at the piers. Fenders are placed - on the ropes, and the rats cannot get over them.",40
212,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Sailor s assure me that they do.,40
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is possible that they do in some cases, owing to neglect in placing the fenders in position; but if reasonable precautions be taken, and the fenders are not allowed to buckle up, rats and - other vermin cannot escape from a ship. 'Some vessels coming from an infected port might have on board goods that would not be injured by fumigation. Hides and minerals, for instance, would nof be injuriously affected by the process, but perishable produce, such as butter, would be rendered absolutely valueless. I believe that vessels should be thoroughly fumigated from time to time, but I urge that the fumigation - should take place before any cargo is - shipped.",40
214,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [5.54]. - I hope that this power will be granted the Minister, and am sure that no attempt would be made to fumigate a vessel unless it was absolutely necessary in - the interests of public health that that step should be taken. I recognise that, even although butter, on our oversea vessels, is kept in refrigerating chambers, it would be tainted by the process of fumigation, but I feel confident that no abuse of this power will occur. I agree that it would be wellto fumigate a vessel only when she had discharged all, or nearly ""all, her cargo. The honourable member for Franklin must recognise, however, that there is carelessness in connection with every industry, and that any neglect in fixing vermin-proof fenders on the ropes of a vessel berthed at one of our piers might lead to a serious outbreak of disease. If is, therefore, necessary to have a provision of this kind in the Bill. Although I should regret to see a shipment of butter sacrificed as the result of fumigation, I think it would .be better to run the risk of such a loss than to neglect any precaution necessary to preserve the public health. It would be better to damage a whole shipment of butter than to sacrifice the life of one individual.",40
215,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Cowper) [5.56]. - I hope that the honourable member for Kooyong will not press Bis proposal. Whilst there is much force in what has been said as to the position in regard to vessels trading between the larger ports, and also with ports beyond Australia, I would remind the Committee that we have a number of vessels trading between the central and some of the smaller ports of Australia. Perhaps it may not be out of place for me to mention that, through the agency of vessels trading between Sydney and ports along the coast of New South Wales, the bubonic plague was carried into my electorate. The Municipal Councils are the authority charged with the administration of the health laws, and if the suggestion made by the honourable member for Kooyong were adopted, they would have no power to order a vessel to be fumigated.",40
216,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member for Kooyong has agreed not to press his amendment. All that he now asks is that care shall be exercised in administering this provision.,40
217,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"I agree that a provision of this kind should be exercised with due care, but we certainly ought to have the right to deal in this way with vessels coming from plague-infected ports.",40
218,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"How would this provision 'affect trade at, for instance, the Tweed River ?",40
219,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"I presume that it is fairly well known that all coastal .vessels are more or less alive with rats, and as well be thrown overboard at once. that vermin on board ship can best be destroyed 'by fumigation, since they secrete themselves under the linings and covering boards. This work can be carried out most effectively after a ship has discharged its cargo, which, in the case of the smaller vessels trading to ports within my electorate, consists very often of maize and similar produce carried to one port, and of general merchandise carried on the return trip. Once a vessel has discharged her cargo, the work of fumigation can be thoroughly carried out with small expense to the owner.",41
220,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Shoul d it be done periodically ?,41
221,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, a vessel should be fumigated after every trip she makes, when trading from an infected port. A vessel might be perfectly clean when she reaches one port and yet be practically overrun with rats when she arrives at the next. I hope that this power will be retained, for, as I under- gard to them. stand it, under the proposal made by the honourable member for Kooyong, a vessel could not be fumigated when empty.",41
222,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"New England) [5.59] I trust that full power to order the fumigation of a vessel will be given the Federal authority, but I must admit that there is a. good deal of force in the contention that during the process cargo might be seriously damaged. I hope that great attention will be paid to cargoes, especially those from China and Japan. A few days ago I read of an incident in connection with the fumigation of a cargo which had arrived in the United States from Japan; and it emphasizes the contention that a cargo may be damaged in the operation. In fact, when the work of fumigation was going on, the cargo commenced to sneeze, and, on a search being made, it was found that the "" merchandise "" consisted of Japanese women. The discovery of such a cargo would be one good result of fumigation.",41
223,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [6.1] - I have no intention to restrict the power of the Commonwealth under this clause; the object I had in view is secured by the Ministerial undertaking that the authority will be exercised with caution. Care is absolutely necessary, because there have been actual instances of officers exercising the power vested in them to the great disadvantage of ship-owners and shippers. In the case of butter, for instance, if any taint be imparted to it the consignment might I quite agree that the Commonwealth should have full power to take every necessary precaution when there is an outbreak of disease I urge the Minister to reconsider this provision with a view to seeing whether greater precautions cannot be taken against the injudicious exercise of the power given.",41
224,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [6.2] - I do not believe in any power of the Commonwealth being curtailed in this connection, and I am supported in that view by the incident related by the honourable member for New England. In Hongkong no fewer than 1,100 dead bodies are found every year .in the streets, and in at least 200 of these cases, the cause of death .is plague, yellow fever, or small-pox. It will be seen, therefore, that the chance of contagion is very great, and I endorse the view that ships, especially those from the East, should be thoroughly fumigated, and the strictest vigilance exercised in reI shall vote against any amendment which has a tendency to lessen the power of the Federal Government.

225,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [6.5] - If there be. a port of entry proclaimed in Western Australia, will every vessel have to call at such a port in order to get clearance under the quarantine regulations? How is it to be determined what the ports of entry are to be? It will interfere very much with commerce if a vessel, with a cargo for the northern ports of Western Australia, has to call at the port of Fremantle in order to get clearance. My object is to have a clearer definition of what is a port of entry.",41
226,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General [6.7] - The Bill does not impose any restriction in the way the honourable member suggests. Clause 13 provides that the Governor General' may, by proclamation, declare any ports in Australia to be the first ports of entry for oversea vessels. The .power must of necessity be wide, because, from time to time, new ports may be created, andthey will require to be proclaimed as first - ports of entry. Further, it may be sometimes advisable, especially in a State like Western Australia, if there is a desire to have direct importation, to even declare a port to be a port of entry for the time being, and have proper officers there, in order to carry out the necessary inspection on the arrival of a vessel.",41
227,Mr KNOX,Unknown,All that is done by proclamation?,42
228,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes ; there must be elasticity under the Bill. Of course, there will be regular proclaimed ports known to everybody as ports of entry.",42
229,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [6.10] - I can foresee considerable difficulty, owing to the wording of this clause, in the case of vessels from the East, which desire to land cargo in some portion of the north-west of Australia. Then, there might, be a cargo consigned to Portland, Victoria, or to some port in Queensland, which is not declared a port of entry.",42
230,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not suggest that cargo from oversea may be landed at any port without restriction ?,42
231,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Certainl y not. My contention is that very serious injustice may be inflicted on persons in out of the way portions of Australia who desire to land cargo from eastern ports, or even from Europe. In the case of Portland, for instance, if that be not declared a first port of entry, a vessel with cargo would first have to come to Melbourne in order to get clearance.",42
232,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Would not any port, with oversea trade at all, be declared a port of >intrv ?",42
233,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I presume it would. Clause 50 provides that no person shall land any imported animals or plants in any port except one declared to be a port where such cargo may be landed. Undar the circumstances, there would have to be provision made at all ports of entry for the proper supervision of vessels from which it was desired to land animals or plants, but there might not be at those ports the necessary officials. Under ordinary circumstances, if some supervision were not exercised, a cargo of undesirable aliens might - be landed in the north-west. At the same time, the Minister must see that great injustice might be clone under this clause to persons not only in remote ports, but in the more settled ports of Australia. In Portland, for instance, there is a jetty for oversea trade, and, unless that be declared a port of entry, all vessels with cargo for that place.will have to first go to Adelaide or Melbourne. . Mr GROOM - Is there oversea trade there now?",42
234,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Yes .,42
235,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Would that be the first port of call in Australia?,42
236,Mr WILSON,Unknown,No .,42
237,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Then a vessel would not be interfered with at Portland. ' Mr WILSON - But a vessel might come with an oversea cargo consigned to' Portland, where the captain knew he could get a full cargo of frozen produce, for instance, for Europe.",42
238,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member think that, if a vessel came to Portland, as the first port of call, there ought to be proper supervision?",42
239,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Most certainly.,42
240,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I understand the honourable member to suggest that Portland should be declared a port of entry.,42
241,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Certainly . I am endeavouring to show that the number of ports of entry should be increased.,42

This is a matter for medical men, but I should say that there are a number of eruptive diseases which may not be at all suspicious, and yet we are imposing on masters of ships much work which the) are not at present called upon to do.",43
246,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [6.16] The proposed amendment requires a certain amount of consideration, and I think some notice should have been given of this proposal. The amendment proposed by the Attorney-General would make it necessary for the master of a ship to hold-up his vessel merely because there was an eruptive disease on board. He might merely be carrying a passenger suffering from eczema or prickly heat, and surely these diseases would not be a sufficient excuse for holding up"" a vessel. Of course, in the case of prickly heat, it would be wise to inspect the patient lest he should be in the incipient stage of a disease which was serious.",43
247,Mr GROOM,Unknown,In a case like that the master would merely be required to notify the authorities.,43
248,Mr WILSON,Unknown,I think that after the master becomes aware that any disease has broken out upon his ship he should notify the authorities.,43
249,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I would draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that paragraphs a and b are retained in the amendment.,43
250,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I think that the word "" fever "" should be omitted, and the word ""febrile"" substituted for it.",43
251,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The word ""fever"" has been inserted upon advice.",43
252,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"At the same time, it is not technically correct. The amendment has been badly drafted. As, however, the Attorney-General is acting upon advice, I do not propose to move an amendment, but if he will look into medical nomenclature he will find that the term "" febrile disease "" is more in accordance with professional language.",43
253,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [6.20] - I think that every honourable member who> witnessed the honourable member for Corangamite struggling with the technicalities of this proposal, which has suddenly beer* sprung upon the Committee, must have recognised the impropriety of dealing hastily - I under- with a matter of such great importance. I need scarcely point out that the amendment involves the whole crux of oversea quarantine, so far as it concerns individuals. Yet we are asked to deal with it at a moment's notice, and without any honourable member, except the honourable member for Corangamite, being afforded an opportunity to peruse it in print. I suggest to the Attorney-General that in matters of this kind the .Committee should be considered. The honourable member for Corangamite at first expressed the opinion that the proposal - in the Bill was better than that contained in the amendment, but, after studying the latter carefully, he concluded* that the amendment was not a bad one, if it aimed at what he thought it aimed. If an expert can be so puzzled by an amendment, surely lay members of the Committee cannot be expected to do better. I venture to say that the - honourable member for Corangamite himself finds it very difficult to understand the difference between? the proposal in the Bill and the amendment. I , therefore, suggest that the consideration of the clause should be postponed. The provision readsThe master of every vessel shall (unless thevessel is actually performing quarantine under the supervision of a quarantine officer) forthwith, after becoming aware that any disease has. broken out on his vessel which he believes or' suspects, or has reason to believe or suspect, to be a quarantinable disease(o) notify a quarantine officer of the breaking out of the disease, and (6) hoist the quarantine signal at the maintop of his vessel, and keep it so hoisted until he is authorized by a quarantine officer to take it down or until the vessel is released from quarantine - and we Honourable members will see that under paragraph (b) which I understand has been incorporated in the amendment, the master of a vessel who discovers that any disease has broken out on board is required hoist the quarantine signal at the main-top of his vessel. I do think that intricacies sentative of this sort might with advantage be left must oppose to the executive authority. Why should we insert in the Bill a provision that in a particular part of a ship's rigging a signal should be hoisted? Amendment (by Mr WILSON) progests posedThat the amendment be amended by leaving out of paragraph (b) the word ""fever,"" with view to insert after the word "" with "" the "" fever and.""",43
254,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [6.27] - The Progress reported. difficulty which I see in the amendment is that glandular swellings, unless febrile, would not be regarded as sufficient evidence upon which to quarantine a ship. Of course, simple-minded members like myself cannot be expected to understand a proposal of this character without being afforded an opportunity of studying it in print. When I . have a Bill me, I make it a practice to carefully study every provision in it, so that I know exactly where I stand. But when amendment like this is suddenly placed betions accordingly. fore honourable members, those whose intellects, like my own, work slowly, are placed at a great disadvantage. I suggest that in future the Attorney-General should take care that every new clause which he proposes to incorporate in a Bill shall be printed and circulated amongst honourable members.",44

259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [7.58] - The preparation necessary for the task I have before me has involved a great deal of time and work, and I can only hope that I shall successfully accomit at such short notice. I felt that I should deliver the Budget statement at the earliest possible date. I may mention that last year the Budget was deon the 31st July. In 1905 it to was delivered on the 22nd of August, proand the year before that on the 18th my October. I deem it proper that the and the country should be informed as' to the state of our finances at as early a date as possible. sity for this was emphasized a few nights ago, when some exception was taken to our dealing with somewhat ordinary business until honourable members were made aware of the state of the finances. It is with a view to give honourable members that information at the earliest possible moment that I have undertaken to deliver the Budget at such short notice: regret that' it hasfallen to my lot to undertake this task. I had hoped that it would have been performed by .my late colleague the ex-Treasurer, Sir John Forrest. - assumed the office of Treasurer only on Tuesday week last, and did not enter the offices of the Department until one or t w o ' days later, honourable members will understand the strain that-has been placed not only u.pon_myself, but upon the officers of the Department in the meantime. at the commencement, to tender my thanks - to Mr Allen, Mr Collins, and the other officers of the Treasury Department for the manner in.which they have worked to enable me to deliver the Budget statement to-night. It has been only with great difficulty that I have been able to put together the absolutely essential figures bearing upon - our current financial transactions. In making my statement to-night, I intend, as far as possible, to avoid entering into too many details, and to confine myself to some-extent to totals. I hold that it is mystifying to honourable members to have to follow a very detailed statement, and it is also unnecessary to supply details in the Budget statement when full particulars are supplied in the papers which have been circulated COMPARATIVE STATISTICS""OF AUSTRALIA, Particulars.

The last Budget speech which I had the honour to make was delivered just on the eve of'Federation in the New South Wales Parliament, and at a time when many warnings were uttered as to the disastrous results which it was said would accrue from the union of the Australian States. But from the position we are in today, we are able I to see that those warnings were unnecessary, and that many of the fears at that time expressed were without foundation. The prosperity of Australia, instead of deAs I caying under Federation, has advanced by leaps and bounds. In 1.900 the imports amounted to £41,388,030, and the exports t 0 ^ 4 5 > 9 5 J 8 8 2 , the total trade at that time 6 being £87,344,912. From the last figures available-thos e of 1906- I find that the imports have risen to £44,729,506, and the I have, exports to £ 6 9 , 7 3 7 , 7 6 3, the total trade being £114,467,269, an increase of £19,279,503 on the preceding year. There is also to be noted a great increase in the deposits in the savings banks and the railway returns in the various States, which is ample evidence of a period of great pros-, perity. The figures bearing out this statement will be found in the papers laid on the table, and it is therefore unnecessary that I should reproduce them here. There can be.no doubt that we have been blessed with very bountiful seasons, and the prices of the great staple commodities have been high, but the most pronounced critics of Federation must admit that, in the period under review, Australia has indeed made a most .notable advance.

I feel sure that in years to come new generations will be proud to feel that they are Australians not only in name, but in fact.",44
260,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,We shall have to get the transcontinental railway through before we can reach that stage ,46
261,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall say something later on about that question. Such a sentiment, which will surely grow up, will remove many difficulties between the States and the Commonwealth-difficul ties which were quite sure to occur in the transition period through which we have been passing. That was inevitable during the first years of the life of our Commonwealth, as is shown by the experience of every other country that has launched out under new conditions of government. The total revenue for the year ended 30th June last was £12,832,266, of which the Customs and Excise revenue amounted to £9,648,662, including £16,776, derived from the Special Tariff of Western Australia. Honourable members are aware that this Special Tariff ceased on the 8th of October, 1906, so that the resulting figures will disappear henceforward from the Treasury statements. The revenue for the year was exceptionally large, there being an increase over the previous year of .£950,342, and the principal items of increase being:-Cus toms and Excise, £649,177; Post Office, £3°4,7 6It is a matter for congratula2 tion that the Post Office Department, managed as it is for the whole 'Continent by central office, is proving a source of revenue instead of a drain on the finances. The increase in the receipts from stimulants and narcotics amounted to £185,089, and the greater spending power of the community was shown in a very large consumption of sugar, the increase in the apparent consumption- I refer to this because it seems enormous-bein g 16,000 tons; also in the' increase in expenditure upon clothing, the duties received under apparel and textiles being £163,200 more than in the previous year. There was an increase also in duties received on metals and machinery of £146,808. The activity in the building trade was shown in an increase of duties paid upon oils and paints of £17,281. Under earthenware there was [ 6]5 2 an increase of .£19,877 ; wood, wicker, and cane produced £32,496 more, whilst leather also accounted for an increase of .£21,511. The revenue, derived from post offices, telegraphs and telephones, was £3,129,074, showing an increase of £304,726. These increases gave an opportunity to the late Treasurer to return an immense sum to the various States. The amounts actually paid to State Treasurers in 1906-7 were:'New South Wales ... ... ^3,022,351 Victoria ... ... ... 2,192,340 Queensland ... ... 942,569 South Australia ... ... 045,121 Western Australia ... ... 780,166 Tasmania ... ... ... 262,293 Total ... .../7,84 840, 4l being an increase, as compared with the previous year, of New South Wales ... ... ^279,581 Victoria 95,221 Queensland 85.521 South Australia 85,710 Tasmania ... 5,902 Western Australia, I very much regret to say, received less by £92,826. Looking at the Revenue and Expenditure - of the past year in the light of the so called ""Braddon Clause""- I refer to section 87 of the Constitution- I find that the Commonwealth Treasurer paid over to the States as a whole- I want honourable members to notice this particularly-the sum of £805,766 in excess of the amount required, to be paid under that clause. Not only was more than three-fourths of the total - Customs and Excise revenue handed over to the States, but each and every State received more than - three-fourths of its net Customs and Excise revenue. In previous one years some States have, and some have not, received more than their three-fourths. That the Commonwealth has, in the past, dealt exceedingly liberally with the States is evidenced by the fact that, since the establishment of Federation, the sum of £5,728,114, which might legally have been expended by the Commonwealth, has been paid over to the States to be used by them for any purpose they deemed fit. The amount returned to each State to the 30th June last in excess of the three-fourths was as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £2,361,846; Victoria, ' £1,518,670: Queensland, £61,519; South Australia, £527,463; Western Australia, £1,099,910; and Tasmania, £158,706. There is no doubt that the past year has been an exceedingly prosperous one. Under ordinary circumstances the Treasurer would not be justified in hoping that such a large revenue would be repeated; but from the reports I have had from various sources/1I have come to the conclusion that the ordinary revenue will be quite as buoyant as in the present year. In addition to the ordinary Customs revenue, we expect to receive a considerable increase from the additional duties which are proposed. I do not expect, however, that the increase will be permanent, for the tendency will be for more articles to be manufactured and more produce to be grown in Australia, and for the revenue ultimately to decrease. My estimate of the Customs and Excise revenue for the current year is £10,509,000, showing an increase of £877,114 over the revenue received last year. One of the greatest difficulties of the Treasurer, whoever he may be, is in estimating the revenue to be received from sugar duties in the various States. As a considerable quantity of the Australian sugar on which Excise duty will be paid during the present year will pay only £ 3 per ton, and as the balance of the Australian sugar will pay £ 4 per ton, it is exceedingly difficult to estimate the duty which will be credited to each State. Perhaps I will make myself clear.when I say 'that it is almost impossible to know in which State the sugar paying £ 3 per ton will be used. There is an additional difficulty in estimating the quantity of sugar which will be imported, and the particular States in which it will be consumed. It is Sugar Season (being for year com- Sugar Produced bymencing 1st April). White Black Labour.

Honourable members who desire information on this interesting item of revenue will find particulars on pages 11, 12, and 13 of the Budget Papers which I have circulated. It will be seen that an increase of 32,000 tons is estimated in the production by white labour during the season 1907, and a decrease of 37,000 tons in Queensland in the production by black labour. It is also to be noticed that in 1906 92,414 acres were cultivated by white labour in Queensland, while in 1907 116,520 acres are under cultivation by white labour. Owing to the increase in the amount of the bounty, it is estimated that the^ very large sum of ,£573,000 will be payable during the current financial year. In 1906-7 only i£328,2io was expended. As honourable members are aware, the bounty was increased from £ 2 to £ 3 per tori on the 1st January, 1907. The effect of the Federal policy on the industry in Queensland is shown in the ,flact that in 1902 1,521 sugar-cane farmers employed white labour, while in 1907 4,080 farmers used white labour. Again, in 1902 black labour was used by 975 farmers, whereas in 1907 only 500 farmers used black labour.

The States from, which the goods are transferred are shown as debtors, the States to which the goods are sent as creditors. It will be seen that New South and Victoria are still maintaining the lead as distributing States. In 1906-7 the reducnet debit to New South Wales was £150,214, and to Victoria ,£424,827, as compared with .£133,396 to New South and £366,411 to Victoria in 1905-6. Honourable members will see what a great distributing State Victoria continues to be. durI have no doubt that a great deal as of that distribution takes place to Tasand perhaps to Western Australia. Queensland was credited in 1906-7 with £214,358 in 1905-6. Western Australia, although sufbut fering from a certain amount of depres' sion, as shown by the smaller revenue collected, is increasing her purchases from States, being credited with £161,922 of in 1906-7, as compared with £135,917 in 1905-6. Tasmania also purchases more largely, being credited with £127,677 in 19067, as against £112,592 in 1905-6. Honourable members will find on page 2.1 I of the Budget papers an account of the corInter-State Customs and. Excise Adjustment.

276,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It is impossible to,51
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think so. I of believe that I have made a fairly liberal' is estimate on that account. The amount of the £15,996 is provided for the newnot Meteorological Branch. The undertaking of that work by the Commonwealth is also a relief to the States. It transfers expenditure from them, and involves addibe retional expenditure by the Commonwealthare By separating the meteorological work from the work proper to astronomical observatories, and by making it a special' branch of study, it is hoped that research will be carried out in a much more effecThe tive manner, and that in the end practical 1 of great importance will accrue..

If the Parliament is to provide for growing demands of the public for and telegraphic conveniences in connection with the great expanse of trade that is taking place, then a'considerable increase penditure is inevitable. That this increase in expenditure is not peculiar to the monwealth may be seen by comparing present expenditure of the States with that of six years ago. I would direct special hope. attention to the fact that the total expenditure of the States, including interest on loans, was increased by about £4,250,000 during the period 1899-1900 to 1905-6, which is the last year in respect of which audited figures are available. Carping critics who clare that our expenditure is increasing very rapidly, will recognise from these figures that there is really no substanmoney tial foundation for complaint. We have taken over so many services previously carried out by the States, that our expendigress ture has necessarily increased. The States, on the other hand are, so to speak, selfwhich contained, and have not had to embark upon such new expenditure as has been avoidable in connection with the establishincreased ment of the Commonwealth - As regards the mail contract, I merely wish to that the Government regrets the long delay which has' taken place. Although it felt that it would be greatly to the tage of the Commonwealth if the arrangebut ment entered into with Sir James Laing Sons were carried out, we could not recognise that more than ample time had - been given to the contractors to carry out their part of the undertaking. When Prime Minister and I were in London, came to the conclusion that the contract should either be carried out or cancelled. Instructions have been given that every that can be taken legally to enforce payment of the bond of £25,000 shall be taken'.",52

286,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Whic h can be recovered, I",53
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"We will see about that when we enter into a new contract. There is no doubt that past experience will make the Government very careful in connection with another contract; and I am sure honourable members will deadmit that the object of the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General, in entering into the previous contract, was to save for the Commonwealth, and get a more extensive service than we have at the present time.

I own that I was astonwas ished at the large amount provided for in advanthe draft Estimates first submitted to me; I am glad to say that in pursuance and of my instructions to the Department, they but have been materially cut down. The total expenditure provided for is £2,805,277 for the post-office alone, as against £2,646,201 the provided and ,£2,623,386 expended last we year, the increase in the estimate for 1907-8, and the expenditure for 1906-7, being £181,891. In New South Wales there step is an increase under the head of "" General the Contingencies "" of £20,000, this being for the purchase of 1,000 water-proof capes, extra travelling expenses, sorting English and foreign mails on the trains between and Melbourne, conversion of non-official post-offices, purchase of motor vehicles, and so forth. In Victoria there is a similar increase of £32,926, this being for telephone maintenance work, larger item payments to the Railway Department, new regulation in respect to Sunday pay, a could higher rate for bicycle contract, higher price of coal and firewood, opening new of offices, & c In Queensland in conthere is an increase of £10,629, being a general increase in telephone mainmeettenance works and business generally; and in South Australia there is an increase, in contingencies, of £7,903 for purchase of motor vehicles and increased business generally. Under the Estimates for TasAlthough mania, an item of £8,781 appears as the amount payable under the guarantee to the Eastern Extension Australasia and China rate. Telegraph. Company. I may explain that in order to promote telegraphic communication between Tasmania and the mainland, the Ad. rate charged for the transmission of doubt about that. telegrams across the Straits, was abolished on the 1st October, 1906. Under an ally agreement between Tasmania and the Telehave graph Company, the latter was a revenue from message receipts-namely , for payment for transmission across the Straits-of £5,600 per annum. Up to the time when the rate was abolished, revenue received by the Company had been in excess of the amount of the guarantee. In consequence of the abolition of the charge, it is now necessary to pay the ComTwofold Bay? pany the full amount of £5,600 per annum. Including arrears, the sum of so £8,781 appears on the Estimates for purpose. That the abolition of the cable rate of £d. per word .has had the effect largely, increasing the telegraph business tween Tasmania and the mainland, is denced by the fact that during the six months ended 30th September, 1906,. the - sum of £9,236 was received for messages, exclusive of cable charges, whilst for RECEIPTS AUD EXPENDITURE (INCLUDING Revenue.. . . . 1,191,508 Credits to Appropriation of former years To t a l Receipts 1,192,140 Expenditure (not including New Works and Buildings) Receipts over Expenditure Receipts under Expenditure Expenditure on New Works and Buildings* - Distributed among States on population basis. t Includes £2,400 increased payments to officers In explanation of the large increase asked for under "" New Works and Buildings,"" I would remind the Committee that since six months ended -31st March, 1907, .£*i>933 was received, showing an increase of receipts of £2,797 in the half-year. the increase was partly due, perhaps, to increased prosperity, much of it was doubtless owing to the reduction in the",53

294,Mr FISFIER,Unknown,I hope defence works always be paid for out of revenue.,55

296,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Minister ought to wait until war occurs before he talks about loan expenditure.,55

299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Honourable member members, I am sure, will agree with that a time of abundant revenue is the most opportune for expenditure of a non-recurPrime ring nature, and they will find in the timates for new works and buildings a conof siderable amount of expenditure of this character. Under the control of the DeI partment of Home Affairs, the amount £221,824 is provided, this being an crease of .£131,372 on the expenditure last year.

The increase in the portion, event of the new works and buildings vote,, the control of the Postmaster-Genethe ral, is altogether £78,301. I now come to found a very important and interesting part of to the Estimates, namely, the provision madein the new works portion of the Estimates will for Defence. Under the Special DefenceMaterial vote last year, £169,156 was. voted, and the expenditure was £[159,988. This year it is.proposed to expend ,£104,050* honorbesides making further provision of £29,000 for field artillery, £10,000 for I cadet rifles, .£20,000 for Martini Lee-Enfield rifles, and £8,000 for camp equipA new vote of £18,750 is asked for 25,000 sword bayonets and scabbards for short rifles, these short rifles and bayonets being considered the most effective of modern weapons for the purpose. . Mr WILSON - It was stated in the newspapers that the Government were going to= convert the bayonets that we already have.",55

302,Mr KELLY,Unknown,A good deal of what the Prime Minister did is disclosed in the docu,55
303,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Then there is. no necessity for me to repeat it. I haveIn accordingly provided in my Budget proposals for the contribution of the usual' £200,000 a year to the'Imperial Navy. A sum, to whidb I will now refer, is the year. amount - which has been placed upon the Estimates for the .purpose of comof mencing the establishment of a coastal' defence Navy. . There is no doubtan effective coastal defence scheme? can be carried out only by the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, but I feel sure that the policy of having such a protection will commend itself to all who consider that Australia should at least protect itself from the incursion of hostile cruisers. We know how uncertain it is where the British Fleet would be stationed in time of war, and certainly Australia should be in a position to prevent its ports being blockaded or bombarded, or its commerce destroyed by perhaps one or two comparatively insignificant cruisers. There a sum of £32,000 provided for a factory for manufacturing our own small .arms and ammunition, which policy, I am sure, will appeal to honourable members. The following amounts have accordingly been) provided on the Estimates :-Toward s harbour and coastal defence, £250,000; small arms factory, £32,000 ; cordite factory, £10,000 ; guns, lights, and emplacements for fixed defences, £50,000; total, £342,000. My honourable colleague, the Minister of Defence, desired these items to be placed in this way upon the Estimates, and being of a good-natured disposition, I agreed to his request. I have placed there "" Less amount which it is anticipated will not be expended in the year, £125,950,"" leaving a balance of £216,050. The amount of £32,000 included for the establishment of a small arms factory represents approximately half the cost of the undertaking according to the latest estimates that have been received. The plant would provide for the local manufacture of magazine rifles, cadet rifles, revolvers and nets in sufficient quantities for all requirements. It is expected that the tory will be able to turn out about 20,000 rifles per annum.",55
304,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Has the Treasurer made up his mind about the site yet?,56
305,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No ; that is a Cabinet matter. The question has been raised as to whether this factory will not be useless id a short time. My answer to that is that it will be a good thing if we are able to manufacture more rifles than we want, because then perhaps we may supply those weapons either to Great Britain or some other part of the world. £TO,OOO has also been provided for the establishment of a cordite factory, and the erection of the same. Mr Hake, Chief Inspector of Explosives in Victoria, is now in England making inquiries and obtaining the latest information on the subjectof service explosives. It is anticipated that as the result of his inquiries the defects previously experienced will be overcome, and it will be found that all our requirements in cordite can be met locally. Figures in detail are not yet available, but £10,000 will be all that will' be required this year. With reference to the ,£50,000for guns, lights, and emplacements, the Imperial Defence Committee have recommended that the armament of the fixed defences of the Commonwealth should, as far is as possible, be uniform, the gun to be used being 6-inch mark 7. The Committee of local officers appointed to consider the question agreed with the recommendation of the Imperial Defence Committee. The total cost of the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee, including the electric lights, will be about ,£280,000.",56
306,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Is it proposed to get rid of the 9.2 guns at Sydney Heads?,56
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not know that it is. We are not proposing to get rid of them, but the Admiralty have made some suggestion of the sort.",56
308,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It seems a very foolish thing to get rid of good guns like those.,56
309,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"So . I informed the First Lord of the Admiralty. Honourable members are aware that under the present system of accounts, the expenditure of the Commonwealth is under two headings: one being ""transferred"" expenditure-that is the expenditure incurred for the maintenance and continuation of the Departments transferred from 'the States to bayothe Commonwealth-and ""other"" expenditure-that is new or original expenditure facon the part of the Commonwealth. Last year the ""other,"" or new, expenditure amounted to ,£1,236,148, but deducting from that sum the provision for new works in the transferred Departments, which in ordinary circumstances would be charged to loans, and which totalled ,£472,139, New Guinea £23,626, sugar bounty and expenses .£335,916, repatriation of Pacific Islanders £8,015, conveyance of mails between Victoria and Tasmania £7,000, guarantee to Eastern Extension Company for the abolition of message receipts, £1,551, making a total of £848,247, we find that the net amount was £387,901, or equal to is. i o | d . per head of the population. If we treat the amount estimated for the current year, namely, £[1,908,654, in a similar manner, and deduct provision for new works, transferred Departments £817,874, New Guinea £25,000, sugar bounty and expenses £580,323, repatriation of Pacific Islanders £6,500, conveyance of mails between Victoria and Tasmania £13,000, guarantee to Eastern Extension Company .£8,781, bounties £25,000, non-recurring expenditure £15,000, or a total of - New South Total Expenditure1901-2 1,252,735 19023 1,342,929 1903-4 1,485,095 19045 1,492,671 1905-6 1,572,900 1906-7 1,756,992 1907-8 2,113,361 Under Control of Department Home Affairs Trade and Customs.

Sir William Lyne. £1,491,478, we find that the net expenditure will be £417,176, or equivalent to 2s. per head of the population, I think I have now dealt with the expenditure at sufficient length.

I may also remind the Committee surer. that, as the period of five years .clause 94 of the Constitution, which defined the manner in which the surplus revenue was to be handed to the various States, has expired, it is not necessary that such surplus revenue shall be handed to the State Treasurers according to the svsNew South Wales tem of debits and credits we have hitherto Victoria been accustomed to.

This year I provide only £25,000 for bounties, and the annual expenditure will be a much larger amount. In reference to the question of payment to the States for transferred properties, I have not had time, nor is it yet necessary, to fully consider the matter. The valuation of properties is proceeding rapidly, and will soon be completed. A scheme must be devised to arrange for equitable payments.",59

That this condition of things is satisfactory, I think no one will admit. We cannot but realise that, whilst Canada has, by judicious land legislation and a great expenditure in advertising its resources, succeeded in attracting a very large number of settlers, from Great Britain especially, Australia has been somewhat supine in the matter. With such a large coast-line to guard, and with such formidable neighbours, it certainly behoves us to do what we can in the .direction of filling up this great continent with a suitable, industrious, and thriving population.",60
315,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,We shall have them. walking about doing nothing.,60
316,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is not my intention. Although it is eminently desirable that a large population shall, be settled in Australia, I am of opinion that we should be careful that the class of immigrant we attract to our - shores is a desirable one. I think that before we take any important steps in the direction of inducing them fo leave their present surroundings and try their fortunes in a new country, we should know that land is available in the various States, and that proper arrangements are made for meeting them on arrival, and every facility given to them to select their land. It is, however, hoped that arrangements will shortly be made so",60
317,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is a mat-, ter which must be dealt with when I consider the subject in detail. It has been quite impossible for me to deal with large problems during the. short period that I have been Treasurer, but the State Treasurers may be satisfied that they will be fairly dealt with in this important matter. The estimated population of the Commonwealth, on 31st December,. 1906, was 4,119,481, as shown in the following tablePOPULATION* OF THE COMMONWEALTH. (Not including Aboriginal Natives.)

Accordingly, a sum of £20,000 has been placed on the Estimates to further this policy, so desirable in the interests of Australia Last year, only £5,000 was voted, so that we now propose a large increase, but I wish that a larger sum were available. Whilst in London, at the instance of the Prime Minister, I selected a site which appeared to me a very convenient one for the Commonwealth Offices in London. It appears to me desirable that, if possible, we should induce the State Premiers to centralize their London staffs in one building, and for that building to be fairly in the centre of traffic. I have accordingly proposed a most suitable site in the Strand, and a sum of £2,000 appears on the Estimates for expenditure in connection therewith. The reason that only £2,000 has been placed on the Estimates at present is that for a time only incidental and preliminary expenses will be incurred. If the site to which I have referred is obtained, and I have the offer of it for about six or seven weeks, and of another area in this particular place, we shall pay nothing at all for the first year, and shall not pay the full rent until five years have elapsed.",60

321,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes ; that is certainly intended. In this connection let say that I was never more disgusted with anything in my life than I was with the difficulty I had to find the offices of Australian States in London. They are legislation, scattered through the city. I was in two of them, though I looked for three four others.

Of course, the proposed offices State bank? when established, will be available for the High Commissioner.of the Commonwealth, and his staff.

327,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am quite of that. No doubt the right honourable gentleman gave very great thought to important matter, and when I come to with it, and with some other questions, I shall be very glad if he will give me the of his experience and ideas in framHonoring a good banking Bill.",61
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I shall be very glad when to assist the honourable member.,61
329,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Does the honourable in - gentleman suggest the establishment of a,61
330,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think it will be something approaching a State bank. I tell honourable members that when in London, and when I had no idea that I should be placed in my present position as Treasurer, I had the privilege of an invitation to lunch with the Governor and Directors of the Bank of England.",61
331,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,That is not a State bank ; sub-let until it is a private bank.,61
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,An offshoot of ban&'is practically a State bank. It happened that the Governor of the Bank of England had a-copy of the Banking Bill by my right honourable friend the which had been sent to him land by the right honourable gentleman.,61
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thing s have evion the Estidently gone very far.,61
334,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not know,61
335,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That was all con,61
336,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Of course, and I am satisfied that it was a very good for' the ex-Treasurer to do, as honourable members will find, when they know what the opinion of the authorities of the Bank of England was in regard to the matter. The Governor of the Bank of England was formed that I had been a member of a Minthat, istry that had a good deal to do in New South Wales with the question of banking at the time of the banking crisis in 1893, and I had a long conversation with him, which will be of very great assistance when I come to deal with the question.",62
337,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"What revenue does honourable gentleman expect to get from the issue of the Treasurv notes proposed ? Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - Perhaps the honourable member will ask me that question later on. With reference to old-age sions, like my colleague, the Minister - Trade and Customs, I. have always taken great interest in the proposed Federalizathe tion of old-age pensions, and as my at any rate, in New South Wales, shows, I have always been prepared to make an onward step towards providing for such pensions as early as possible. Once the Tariff has been sufficiently mastered in this /House, I intend to devote myself to "" amination of the possibilities in this direcence, tion, of which Parliament will be duly formed. I hope that the money can found for the establishment of a Federal scheme at once, because the matter is which cannot be allowed to rest. able members will admit that stepping the Treasury Department as I have done, and having to find such a large amount of money, I have not had time up to the present to consider any practical scheme. wish, however, to remind honourable memtions bers that before the election last year, - attempt was made by the Government secure a referendum for the alteration the Constitution to provide for the imposion tion of special duties for the purpose old-age pensions. That attempt was feated in the Senate by only one or votes, but where there is a will there way, and the question is one of such importance, that if I cam possibly bring - about the establishment of a Federal age pension scheme, it shall be done. . Mr WATSON - I hope the honourable gentleman will put the Opposition to test, and see if they are in favour - age pensions.",62
338,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"At the Conference in London, the Prime Minister I was informed that there would be no objecfor tion raised on the part of the Imperial Gothing vernment to a special silver and bronze coinage for Australia. The Prime Minister is still in communication with the Imperial authorities, who have been asked to facilitate the displacement of the present coininage. It may be confidently anticipated at an early date, this matter will be settled, and the Commonwealth will receive the profit on the Australian coinage. I was present when that statement was made, . and it was emphasized in a way that showed to me that trie Imperial Government fully intended that we should be allowed to carry the out what we desire in this respect. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It will mean a profit of only about £25,000.",62
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That would be pensomething. Five Conferences have nowof been held with the Premiers of the States' a in order to come to an understanding as to best method of arriving at the surplus record, to be paid over by the Commonwealth Treasurer to the States after the termination of the operation of the Braddon section of the Constitution, and also to assist the Treasurer in making arrangements for. the transfer of the debts of the States to the the exCommonwealth. At the Hobart Conferin 1905, it was agreed to by the Cominmonwealth representatives, and by a mabe jority of the States, that the Braddon section should remain in operation until one 1930, that the whole-of the States debts Honorshould be taken over by the Commoninto wealth, and that the States should cease to borrow outside of Australia except through the Commonwealth. At the Sydney Conference, held twelve months later, I the States' representatives passed resolustating that in their opinion the Bradan don section should be operative for all time, to and that the Commonwealth surplus reof venues should be divided among the States a population basis. On this latter quesof tion, the Premiers of New South Wales deand Victoria dissented; Western Australia two was not represented. At the Sydney Conis a ference, it was also agreed that the time greatwas _ ripe for the Federal Parliament to consider the question of taking over, the oldStates' debts,_ in accordance with section 105 of the Constitution. In October, 1906, a Conference was held in Melbourne, at the which my predecessor, the right honourable of oldmember for Swan, brought forward certain proposals. The State representatives passed recent the resolutions which follow1. The Constitution to be amended to provide payments to the States of a fixed annual amount based on the three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise up to 1910. 2. A payment in addition to such fixed amount to be made to bring the aggregate payment' to the States up to three-fourths of the net and Excise Revenue-suc h additional payment to be distributed per capita. 3. The Commonwealth to have the right to impose new duties for specific purposes, and to retain the whole of the revenue raised thereby. The Conference also expressed a general approval of the ex-Treasurer's scheme for taking over the whole of ihe States debts, and left the discussion of the details to a future Conference. Two months ago, another Conferencewas held in Brisbane, when the following proposals were agreed to by the Premiers1. From 1910 until 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides, the 'States ceive a fixed annual sum based on the average of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise , revenue during certain years. 2. The States to receive a payment in addition to such fixed amount to bring the aggregate payment to the States up to three-fourths of the new Customs and Excise revenue, such additional payment to be distributed per capita. 3. The Commonwealth to have the right to impose new duties for specific purposes, both on items at present subject to duty, and also on items at present not subject to duty-the Commonwealth Treasurer to retain the whole of the revenue raised thereby. The above three clauses, which were agreed to, were those submitted to the Conference by the right honourable member for Swan. The Conference also agreed that the further consideration of the taking over of the States debts by the Commonwealth should be postponed until the question of distribution of the surplus revenue amongst the States was determined.",62
340,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The honourable gentleman is not surprised at the States being willing to accept that provision?,63
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Not at all. Of course, those provisions would not be binding on Parliament; they were adopted subject to ratification by Parliament. With regard to the other question-the continuation .of the operation of the Braddon section-it appears very evident from thefiguresI have quoted this evening that such an arrangement, however desirable to the States, will be quite impossible in view of public expenditure which must be carried out by the Commonwealth. I have been called so suddenly to take ""the position I now occupy, and Have had so little opportunity of considering this question, that I feel that some time must elapse before my views are thoroughly matured. .. Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Has the Treasurer correctly stated the position? Is it not a fact that the ex-Treasurer offered the Statesthe surplus out of the, special duties ?",63
342,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes . The Customs statement. I have given has been handed ta me by my officers.,63
343,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Has the honourable gentleman made any provision for increased allowances to members of this House?,63
344,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not sorry the honourable member has asked that question, because no one can shut his eyes to the fact that it is very hard for some members to come to this Parliament at all under existing conditions. I understand that this is not a party question. It is one for the consideration of members themselves, and I must say that if honorto re- able members desire the matter to be considered, the Government will afford an early opportunity for that to be done.",63
345,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Surely it is a question for their constituents to have an opportunity of considering?,63
346,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have nothing to' say about my constituents in that regard, because I expressed my views on many occasions, and so have a large number of honourable members. I have merely made these remarks in answer to a question.",63
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that all the an-; swer to it?,63
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall give another answer very shortly, I believe, but not to-night. I was going to say something about the protective policy. When I have concluded my Financial Statement, I intend, before I sit down, to submit the Tariff, and to give a short explanation of it. Let me say, first, that in a country like Australia-so different from every other country-eve n if we suffer occasionally a time of depression, caused iby climatic conditions, which we cannot control, it would ill become us as a people to take a pessimistic view of the future. We are not in the same category with countries whose development has been carried to the highest pitch; but, on the contrary, we are yet unaware how great are our possibilities. With such an immense country, possessing such great resources, with industries so certain of development, we can afford to be optimistic, and confidently look forward to a prosperous future for the Commonwealth. Honourable members will find in the Tariff, to the preparation of which a great deal of work has been"" devoted, a better arrangement ' of the duties, which are brought under' headings with .which they are more distinctly' associated than in the previous Tariff. Honourable members will find two columns, one showing the general Tariff, and another applying to goods produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom.",63
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is there not another column to show the difference between the present duties and the proposed duties?,64
350,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Not on this paper, but I shall submit a paper in which that information is given. I have a great deal more informationavailable, but I have kept this copy clean because it is the one on which the duties are to be collected. I desire to refer to the question of iron bounties. Honourable members know that I have tried twice- I think that my honourable colleague has tried once-to pass ah Iron Bounties Bill, but failed. that we may succeed on this occasion. have an Iron Bounties Bill ready to submit. I have not brought it'here to-night, because there is no necessity to submit it now.",64
351,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Is that a Bill to provide for a bounty on the production of iron?,64
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,64
353,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Where does the honourable gentleman expect to get the money from, seeing that, according to his estimates, he expects to have a surplus of only ^100,000 ?",64
354,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I shall tell the honourable member when I am discussing the question.,64
355,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is only a fair thing that in his Budget the honourable gentleman should tell us where he expects to get the money from.,64
356,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Perhaps the honourable member will not object to the way in which I propose to raise the money. I have here a provision to which I wish to call attention. It will be remembered that our previous proposals contained a division-VIA - whic h empowered the Minister to recommend, under certain conditions, the imposition of a duty, that is, when a sumcient quantity of raw material was manufactured in the Commonwealth. I have in the Tariff a similar provision with a slightly different heading.",64
357,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The Minister proposes to have a duty instead of a bonus?,64
358,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am going to have either a bonus or a duty this The Prime Minister .is very anxious should submit a proposal; for bounties] first, because there is no doubt that that has the course followed in other countries. I want to give honourable members an opportunity of voting on the Bill, but if it is not carried, I shall resort to the duties which are mentioned in Division VIA . The proposal is to levy a duty of 12 J per cent, on pig iron. The duty on other items is a little higher. In Division VIB . I have a provision enumerating most of the manufactures in which pig iron and steel are used. These items are already included at lesser rates in the part of the Tariff which will come into force tomorrow. If the Iron Bounties Bill is not carried, and the imposition of the duties is authorized, then I shall ask the Committee to omit the heading from Division VIB . , and bring into operation a duty of 2 per cent, on those items in order to make up I hope for the extra payment on the raw material. I Mr CROUCH - Do I understand that a duty will be collected on iron tomorrow ?",64
359,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have made provision so that I can get a duty under certain conditions. If a duty is preferred to a bonus, then in the Tariff I have a division from which I can strike out the heading, so there will be an increased duty on the manufactured article, protecting the manufacturer to the extent of 2 per cent.",64
360,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"It ought to be well considered, anyhow.",64
361,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It has been framed in such a way that it will be well considered. I was very much tempted to propose a duty which could be levied forthwith, but I recognised that if we put a duty on the raw material without giving some compensation to the manufacturer we should do a great injustice.",64
362,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"How much is the duty on pig iron to the manufacturer? Only 1 or 2 per cent, at the outside.",64
363,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I have a calculation showing that it is equal to from i£ to 2 per cent.,64
364,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It is hardly worth talking about. Sir .'WILLIAM LYNE - I have put on a duty of 2 per cent, to make an equivalent, so that the manufacturer shall not be injured in either case.",64
365,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable gentleman is very tender about some manufacturers.,64
366,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Can the Minister time. give an approximate idea of what the that I amount-of the iron bounty will be?,64
367,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,".There is a been schedule attached to the Bill. Some items have been struck out, but the bounty is less than was proposed on a' previous occasion ",64
368,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"What was it then ? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not remember the exact amount; but I think it was nearly £500,000. Perhaps I had better say here that, at the present moment, some negotiations are proceeding in reference to an exchange of the products of the New Hebrides and New Guinea, The negotiations had not advanced sufficiently for me to deal with the matter in my Budget, but the Prime Minister is anxious that the Committee should know that negotiations are proceeding in regard to the products of those and other Pacific Islands. I have a list here which I shall have printed, showing the imports from Great Britain and from foreign countries on which a preference is given. In most cases, where the imports from foreign countries are large, we have given a preference to Great Britain, and I have been advised that, on the items which have been considered, it averages and that the annual difference in duty payable, between the general Tariff and the preference Tariff, would be between . £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 1 , 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",65
369,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Is the Minister reducing the present duties in order to do that?,65
370,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Onl y in one or two cases. For the information of honourable members, especially the protectionist 143 A and B Iron, Galvanized, &c. 164 A, IJ, c,' Machinery, &c. ... and 165. 236 A to D Paints and Colours ; 381 A & B Pianos ... side of the Tariff Commission- I shall also refer to the free-trade side, because they are widely different",65
371,Mr FULLER,Unknown,We shall be very glad to be recognised.,65
372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am afraid that that is the extent to which I can go.,65
373,Mr FULLER,Unknown,That is all I expected.,65
374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have not had it worked out; but I am inclined to think that, on the whole, the result of the recommendations of the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission would be to reduce the present duties. The number of items on which the proposed Tariff agrees with the recommendations of the other members of that body is 325 out of a total of 444. The number of items on which It does not agree with their recommendations is 82, and the number of new items is 37. There are one or two cases in which the recommendation of the Tariff Commission has been per cent'., reduced a little. But in most cases we have done what we could to give recognition to the reports to .which so much time and labour have been devoted. I do not think that it is necessary to read the paper which I have before me with reference to the pre ference proposals of the Government, but the following table shows the value of the imports in 1906 of the articles enumerated below from Great Britain and from foreign countries, including British Dominions:Item.

That is to say, that amount represents the difference in duty between the general Tariff and the preference Tariff; but as it is expected the imports from Great Britain will increase in consequence of these preference procountries. posals, it will not be improper to estimate that the concession will amount to, say, £1,500,000, or 13J per cent.",65
375,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Is that on the basis of the existing Tariff or of the proposed Tariff?,66
376,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,On the basis of the proposed Tariff.,66
377,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Is it conditional on Great Britain giving Australia any concession return ? ,",66
378,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Non e whatmake. ever are asked by us. I wish to add of in reference to that question, that I am very sorry that Great Britain canare not see her way clear to give us some preference. When I was in Great Britain on one or two occasions I took the oppornexion tunity-and I know that the Prime Minister did also-to say that, although we did not receive the concession that for, or any other concession, from Great Britain, still Australia did not intend to proach this question again from the point of Tariff. view of bargaining. We shall, however, always be very glad indeed to accept any concession that Great Britain may think fit to give to us.",66
379,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Is any preference proposed with any other country than Great Britain ?,66
380,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Not in these proposals, but what the honourable member suggests can be done. I have been concerned sidering the question in reference to Canada, and when I was in London I had an interview with Sir Wilfrid Laurier the Canadian Treasurer with regard to it. But it seemed Io be almost impossible to arrive at an understanding. Otherwise proposals would have been embodied in the Tariff now submitted. An arrangement can, however, be made with Canada at any time by way of a reciprocal Tariff. The South African Preference Tariff will conI tinue on the same footing as at present.",66
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the honourable gentleman able to state how the preference it here. proposals will affect Great Britain? Are the duties affecting her put up or down ?,66
382,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The duties down against Great Britain are below those affectthing ing other countries.,66
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it proposed to re,66
384,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I will not say whether we are reducing any, but if so they are very few. The point is that the prethat ference to Great Britain takes the form of duties lower than those against other",66
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it proposed to take any duties off for the benefit of Great Britain ?,66
386,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not sure. I cannot say positively, but I do not wish the honourable member to take that answer as definite. The. British preference proposals of the Government affect 153 items, all of which are important, out in of a total of 436 items. We think that that is a fairly reasonable preference to I am glad to find, from the cheers honourable members, that they are in accord with the Government in the action they taking, and that they also approve of the policy of the Government in not asking for reciprocity from Great Britain in conwith our preference proposals.",66
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the Minister intend to give us any idea as to the scale we asked or range of the new duties?,66
388,Sir WILLIA MLYNE,Unknown,"I cannot go into apdetails. There are 245 columns in the new I have devoted a considerable amount of work to it during the last week or two, and-I am sure that the Committee will not expect me to deal with the ques-. tion more fully to-night. The Tariff will be circulated at once. I have had a weight on my mind with regard to it for a good many days past. Our proposals have been ready for practically a fortnight. The members of the Government and the officials conwith this work have had to maintain the greatest secrecy.. I think that we have kept our secret very well; though I and admit that I was almost expecting every morning to see something in the press, and to be compelled, in consequence, to bring down the Tariff in the course of the day.",66
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is the average amount of the increases?,66
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have not those particulars at my fingers' ends, but can get the information for the honourable member.",66
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We ought to have,66
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The principal thing is that I have Drought the' Tariff and circulated it. It will be somefor honourable members to consider during the next few days.,66

410,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [9.57]- I feel my duty at this stage to call the attention of the House to a matter of much moment to I the Commonwealth. At the outset I must apologize to honourable members for proto address them after having listened to the lengthy speech made by the the Acting Prime Minister in submitting the Budget and the Tariff, but I am not grudge me the they time. I shall 'occupy in bringing this question before them. The subject is one that I can deal with only on a motion for the adjournment of the House, and memhad it been exceedingly urgent, I should sughave availed myself of an opportunity in the day to submit a formal adjournment motion in order that it might be Yesterday I put the following dequestion to the Acting Prime MinisterIn the cases of how many prohibited immigrants within the meaning of sub-section d of section 3 - of the Immigration Restriction Acts' 1901-1905, has that provision been put in has force on the ground that immigrants were suffering from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) ? The reply to that question was as followsThere is no record of any person having been refused admission to the Commonwealth under paragraph d of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Acts 1901-1905, on account of suffering from consumption. Two persons suffering from the above disease were, however, prohibited under the provisions of paragraph b of this section, on the ground that they were likely to become a charge upon a public or charitable institution. This shows that no serious attempt has .been made to prevent the introduction of persons suffering from tubercular disease to Australia.",97
411,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that they should be prohibited?,98
412,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I intend to point out a method by which the dangerconse-quent upon the introduction of such people into Australia may be ameliorated. It may '.appear somewhat harsh to suggest that people suffering from tubercular disease who seek an asylum in Australia, should 'be prevented from taking advantage of our ^genial and generous climate. At the same time. I would remind honourable members - that we have to consider the healthy people resident in Australia as well as those who mav come after us.",98
413,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order . I admit that there is an excuse for perhaps a little excitement on the part of honourable members to-night, but I must ask them to converse in much lower tones than they are doing, - since it is impossible for the honourable member to make himself heard.",98
414,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"It is useless to draw - attention to a danger of this kind unless - one is prepared to offer a remedy. i propose first of all to show how serious the - position is, and then to suggest a remedy. - On turning to page 200 of Coghlan's Statistical Account of Australia and New Zealand for 1903-4, we find the followingPhthisis claims more victims in Australasia - than any other disease, but notwithstanding this fact the death rates are lower than i i i the other - countries of the world. This is all the more gratifying when it is considered that many persons afflicted with the disease, or pre-disposed - to it, are attracted to this country in the hope - of obtaining relief, as the Australian climate is - undpubtedly favourable to people suffering from - pulmonary complaints. During 1903 phthisis .caused 3,571 deaths in the Commonwealth, and 570 in New. Zealand-equa l to rates of 9.13 and 16.95 respectively per 10,000 living. In the Official Year Booh of New South Wales, for 1904-5, the following passage appearsThe Australian climate is certainly favourable - to those who suffer from pulmonary diseases, .and a large number of persons suffering from phthisis visit Australia in search of relief. Many of these are in the last stages of the .disease, and succumb after a short residence in the State. The experience of the last ten years shows that 5 per cent, of the fatal cases of phthisis were those of persons whose residence in Australia had not exceeded five years, and 2 per cent, of those who had been resident less than one year. The figures for the year 1904 show that out of the 1,195 persons who died from phthisis 767 were born in Australasia, and of the remainder 40 had been resident in the Commonwealth less than five years, 86 from five to twenty years, and 270 for more than twenty years. Of the total persons dying from this disease 623, or 51 per cent., comprising 329 males , and 294 females, were married, the families bqrn to some of them being rather iarge. The experience of the last ten years shows that the average number of children to married males who died from phthisis was 4.05, and to married females. 3.96. Nearly 80 per cent, of the issue born of these persons survived them. Phthisis is the most deadly of all diseases, and the following comparison showing the rates in various countries is interesting. The rates are based on the experience of the last ten years, and are stated .per 1,000 of total population, and thus do not take into account either age or sex,- which, as will be seen from the preceding tables, are rather material factors. If anything, this, omission, renders the comparison favourable to New South Waies and other Australian States, because here the proportion of aged persons is smaller than in the countries of the Old World. This tends to show that the Australian climate is, to. a certain extent, favourable for the treatment and the amelioration of the disease of phthisis. The following table also appears in the Year BookDeath rate per Country. i,opp of total population. Austria ... ... ... '3.49 German Empire ... ... 2.13 Ireland ... ... ... 2.13 Norway ... ... ... i.qfi Netherlands ... ... 1.65 Scotland ... ... ... 1.64 Belgium ... ... ... 1.41 England and Wales ... 1.32 Italy ... ... ... 1.23 Victoria ... ... ... 1.22 Queensland... ... ... .90 South Australia ... ... .90 Ceylon' ... ... ... .87 New South Wales ... 82 New Zealand. ... ... .78 Tasmania ... ..! ... .73 - Western Australia ... ... .69 It will be seen that .the rate in New South Wales is fourth lowest in the above list. The rate in all the European countries is higher than in New South Wales, the three with lower rates being all Australian States. The experience of all these countries, \sith the exception of Ireland, is similar to that of New South Wales, namely, that the rate is decreasing. In Ireland it is increasing, and in Austria' and Switzerland it is practically stationary. I have made these quotations with the p.bject of showing how necessary it is that we should endeavour to prevent the intrpduc-tion of this disease from oversea. I should like to show the nature of the disease in so far as an explanation is necessary to illustrate the points that I wish to make. Consumption is not an infectious disease in the ordinary sense of the term. It is really communicated from one person to another through the medium of the seeds of the disease. That is to say, certain germs develop in the course of phthisis, which may be carried abroad by the air, and ' inhaled by people, who thus have the disease implanted in them. In the early stages of consumption, the disease is not, as a rule, particularly dangerous to those persons with whom the patient comes in conjtact; but, when the disease has so far progressed that the lung tissue begins to break down, owing to the extensive growth of the germ within the tissue itself, it is very dangerous. It is comparatively easy, therefore, for medical men to determine whether a patient suffering from phthisis is in a condition likely to spread the disease, because it is possible, by microscopic examination of the sputum or spittle, to ascertain if the germ is there. It is when the patient, in that stage of disease, goes about living in different houses, and communicating withdifferent people, while taking no precaution in the way of disinfection, that the disease is most likely to be disseminated throughout the Commonwealth.. Another peculiarity is that, although consumption is not absolutely hereditary, parents hand down certain constitutional characteristics to their children, - who are thus, perhaps, more liable to attack than other people are. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the disease is hereditary-that think, has been practically proved by scientists. Dr Norris, the head of the Health Department of Victoria, has kindly handed me a report which was issued after an investigation made in that State. report, it is stated that it was discovered that the number of cases which could be distinctly traced as having come from oversea, was about 3 per cent - that 5 per cent, of the cases came from beyond the State, and probably 3 per cent, from overseabut, at the same time, it is pointed out that the number of oversea cases would probably have beenproportionately increased had the cases which were treated in. the hospital been taken into account. pears, however, that the cases treated in the hospital were not followed up, but r only those which were treated in private houses. Some of the latter cases may be Mr Liddell. of special interest, as showing how the disease is carried from person to person, and family to family, and how it is that, large portions of. families are sometimesswept away. The following is an extract from the report:- Report of investigation of the personal, family, and .sanitary circumstances of persons, reported as having died in 1902 in the Metropolitan Area from tuberculosis in private premises. 1. S.H., female, aged 27; died from pulmonary tuberculosis; had nursed her brother and mother, who died of same disease; mother had previously nursed a daughter and son, who hadS died of the disease; no history of any hereditary taint; family had occupied same house 45 years; house very defectively lighted; badly ventilated;. no disinfection had been carried out after death* of any case prior to that of S.H.

Here we have a series of cases which show distinctly how this disease can be communicated from one. patient to another, or from husband to wife, arfd mother to childrenhow, as a matter of fact, although the disease is not hereditary, the fact of living, in a house where it has occurred, exposes a healthy person to considerable risk.",98
415,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Hav e the State authorities It.ap- of New South Wales taken anyaction? .,99
416,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"The local authorities of the various States have taken, action in the way of encouraging patients to go into various sanatoria.",99
417,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Do the local authorities of New South Wales require notification in case of death from consumption, and subsequent disinfection of the premises?",100
418,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"The State authorities have made consumption a notifiable disease in both Victoria and New South. Wales. Further, indigent, patients are, as far .is possible, encouraged to enter hospitals, where they are taught to disinfect their feeding requisites, their towels, and so forth, and are shown the best methods of living, so as to avoid spreading the disease. Thes? patients, when they return to their homes, carry out that regime with great advantage. I do not think it is necessary to exclude tubercular patients who propose to come to this country. Many such persons may derive great benefit from living in the climate of Australia; and it would be a hardship to prevent them taking advantage of the favourable conditions.",100
419,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,In the earlier stages.,100
420,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Yes . What I suggest is that no emigrant should be admitted to Australia, who, in the opinion of a medical officer appointed by the State or by the Commonwealth, shows evidence that he is in the last stages of the disease. Indeed, it would only be doing such a patient a kindness to refuse him admission, because many patients, in an advanced stage, are sent here only to die far away from their homes amd friends. If an intimation were given , to the various ship-owners, shipping : companies, and ship surgeons, that they would be called upon to repatriate any such patients whom they might bring to Australia, it would act as a deterrent. Later on. when we have the Department of Health, about which I spoke, it is .just possible that we may be able to proclaim certain districts in which these patients can be segregated until' they are no longer capable of spreading the disease.",100
421,Mr GROOM,Unknown,They would be under State control.,100
422,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,To a certain extent they would.,100
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Consumptive s very frequently recover when they come to Australia.,100
424,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"That is the reason why we ought not to prohibit all consumptive patients from entering the Commonwealth. We should discourage those who are in the advanced stage of the diseasea stage in which recovery is hopeless. But in all other cases, we ought not to object to their admission to the Commonwealth. I [59] have pointed out the danger which exists, and also what I consider would provide a remedy. I would particularly urge upon the Minister the necessity for taking some further action than has hitherto been taken. The Immigration Restriction Act distinctly states that any person suffering from a dangerous disease may be prohibited from entering the Commonwealth. That is practically a mandate from the Government to put the remedy which I suggest into operation. Paragraph d of section 3 of the Act declares that any person suffering from "" a contagious disease of a loathsome or dangerous character"" may be refused admission. It is well known that phthisis is a particularly dangerous disease, and one which is communicable from one individual to another. It is a disease which is preventible, and for that reason everything should be done to prevent its introduction to Australia. All our legislation, I think, should be guided by scientists. Scientific men have proved that this disease is communicable from one person to another, and that it can be prevented. I feel very strongly upon this matter, and if my remarks this evening have the effect of inducing the Ministry to take action to, prevent its introduction to the Commonwealth, I shall feel that I have done something to advance the welfare of my country.",100
425,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [10.18] The matter which the honourable member has brought before the House is a very important one. Notwithstanding the ravages of phthisis, I am exceedingly sorry that any remarks should be made in this Chamber which are calculated to discourage persons suffering from that disease, and who contemplate settling in Australia in the hope of effecting a recovery, from carrying out their intention. I know that the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Hunter do not desire to inflict an injury upon any individual. They imagine that, by denying the admission of certain persons into Australia, they will be safeguarding its interests. What do they fear? They fear that these persons may be admitted into the Commonwealth, and thus spread the disease. Let me say that during the first Parliament of the Commonwealth there sat. in this House an honourable member, representing the State of Queensland, who, at one time, was supposed to toe in the last stages of phthisis, and who today is alive and well, and rendering good service to his country. That gentleman determined to isolate himself from the world, and, accordingly, he went out some distance from Brisbane, where he could not procure professional attendance, and,-under our genial sunshine, was thoroughly restored to health. By having recourse to nature, and sleeping in the open air, he recovered so far as to be able to render good service in commercial circles and, later on, admirable service as a representative of the people. I admit that we should exclude persons suffering from "" loathsome diseases,"" but the meaning of those words is, I think, quite clear to honourable members. I very much question whether we shall do ourselves any honour as a Parliament if we place an embargo upon the admission of any persons suffering from consumption if they come to Australia in the hope of being restored to health. I call upon the members of the medical profession to treat these patients when ' they arrive here. I quite agree that segregation is a proper thing in certain circumstances.",100
426,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,They will be quarantined on their arrival.,101
427,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"They might be, in extreme cases. I would point out that, in the Immigration Restriction Act, provision is made to prevent the admission of persons who are likely to become a burden upon Australia, so that we need have no fear in that connection. But I implore the members of the medical profession not to allow it to be said that, among the restrictions which Australia imposes upon the admission of persons to her shores, is one that individuals suffering from a disease which has been the despair of medical science in every part of the world shall be excluded. If we wish to do our duty, let us establish sanatoria in suitable parts of Australia, and thus show that our love of humanity is greater than the mere protection of our material interests.",101
428,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [10.22]. - I wish to call the attention of the Attorney-General to the necessity of having the rates in the Tariff tabulated in such a way that honourable members will be able to compare the existing rates with the rates recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission, and also with the rates proposed by the Government. It is desirable also that the volume of imports and their value should be stated. In the absence of this information we cannot properly deal with the Tariff. If it is not provided by the Government, honourable members will have to fossick it out for themselves, and that will involve an immense amount of trouble to them, besides which the information, when compiled, will probably not be so accurate as it would be if it were prepared by the Department.",101
429,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.24] I am very much obliged to the honourable member for Hunter for having brought forward the question of the admission of consumptives into Australia. I am sure that when honourable members read his remarks in Hansard, and the data which he has supplied, they will confp-- that they are under an obligation to hL_. Both the honourable* member and myssif fully endorse every word which was uttered by the honourable member for Wide Bay. But I would point out to him that twenty or thirty years ago the treatment of consumption was not understood in the scientific way that it is today. Patients who were then regarded as having no hope 6T recovery would not be so regarded nowadays. I am sure that the honourable member for Hunter does not desire to keep out of Australia any person who by coming here would have a chance to recover his health. But we must remember that, much as the black plague is feared-and we do not hesitate to go to any length or to undertake any expenditure to keep it out of Australia-it has perhaps only one victim for every one thousand victims destroved by the white plague - Consumption is the curse of our civilization. I think that the honourable members for Laanecoorie, Corangamite, and Hunter, all being medical men, might draft a provision for insertion in the Quarantine Bill, either here or in the Senate, allowing persons who come to Australia, hoping that our climate will restore them to health and strength, to land here, but requiring them to stay in certain places. If while there they showed signs of recovery, and ultimately became convalescent, we might ask them to stay. The finest region of the Mediterranean, one of the most - beautiful lands upon which God's sun shines, is permeated with the germs of tuberculosis, so that there is hardly a resident household there which has not lost one of its members from consumption. That having happened on the Riviera, it is not impossible that, unless we take steps to prevent it. Australia may in time become similarly infected. It is our duty to take every step to avoid that dread possibilitv.",101
430,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [10.28] I would be no party to drafting a clause to keep out of Australia persons suffering from consumption, although, as a medical man, I , like the honourable members for Hunter and Melbourne, know from experience the dangers of phthisis. I have met with it in various par.ts of the - world, and on the Riviera. But, at the same time, I agree with every word uttered by the honourable member for Wide Bay. I hope that, for ail time, it will be the policy of Australia to treat this disease on broad, humanitarian principles.",101
431,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [10.30]. - I disagree with the honourable members for Wide Bav and Corangamite. When the South Australian Parliament was considering a Health Bill, some years ago, I tried to provide for ""the isolation of consumptives, but there was great prejudice against interfering with them. If the subject were beine discussed today, there would be no difficulty about getting the legislation I then desired. I once travelled on a steamer on which a consumptive was coming to Australia for his health; but he left immediately, and was buried at sea. That man was a source of danger to every person on board the vessel. While we cannot but have the greatest sympathy with sufferers from this disease, we must safeguard the community from infection. It is true that occasionally consumptives are cured-that has happened to personal friends of mine - but we do not know how many deaths they are responsible for, while suffering from consumption. Medical friends with whom I have conversed on this subject have endorsed the views which I am now putting forward. I have had relatives who died of this dread disease. I am glad to say that I do not suffer from it, but my father died of it before^ I was born, and had I lived in a house in which the members of the family were suffering from it, I should in all probability have contracted it too. It is well known, as the medical members of the 'House will admit, that consumption is highly infectious.",102
432,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,There are houses in this city in which any family is liable to catch consumption.,102
433,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Some time ago I knew of a family in which there was consumption. I urged one of them to leave the house in which they were living. He did so, and went to Western Australia, where today he is a strong, healthy man, although another member of the family is likely to die of this disease. While here [59]- a and there a consumptive may recover, the disease may be communicated to hundreds by permitting infected persons to mix with their fellows. I trust that strong''measures will be taken to safeguard the health of the community. As an instance of the carelessness which is now shown in dealing with consumptives, I may mention that a year or so ago a consumptive was carried from the Sydney express to the Adelaide express, and died on the journey to Adelaide in a compartment which he-probably shared with another, and, perhaps, with three other passengers. We should do all we can to isolate consumptives, and discourage the immigration of diseased persons to this country.",102
434,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [10.34] - This is an important matter in the interests of the general community, and bears .on the question we have recently been discussing, as to how far the States should be left uncontrolled in the exercise of what are called their police powers for the protection of the public health. I was a member of a society whose object was to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, and the information we collected revealed the need for action on the part of, the local authorities. We found that proper by-laws for the prevention of the spread of consumption were required by the railway, tramway and municipal authorities of Queensland, and we therefore took steps to bring the matter under their attention, with the result that the necessary regulations were framed. We also took steps to have proper instructions issued-in some districts to the school authorities, as well as to the local authoritiesfor the prevention of the disease. Considerable evidence was given: before the Navigation Commission in regard to the travelling about of diseased persons, and very strong recommendations were made on the subject. It was considered that the disinfecting of cabins was a very necessary step. This matter is an important one. I am perfectly sure that we all sympathize with the humane spirit which prompted the protest of the honourable member for Wide Bay. I think the honourable members for Hunter and Melbourne share that honourable member's feelings.",102
435,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I do not doubt that.,102
436,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"But , from their point of view, the preservation of the health of many individuals at present possessing - full physical vigour should be regarded as a sacred trust. Mr FISHER,-It is not a question of the introduction of the disease. Unfortunately we have it here.",102
437,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes , but from their point of view, it may be spread by the admission to Australia of persons in the last stages of the disease. Humanitarian considerations would suggest that a person, possessed of means, wishing to come here in quest, of health, and to proceed immediately on landing to a sanatorium, should not be prevented.",103
438,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Unde r existing conditions he goes to the leading hotel of the port at which he lands.,103
439,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Condition s might be imposed. When persons suffering from disease, on coming to Australia, mingle with the community, they spread the germs of the disease from which they suffer wherever they go, and are a source of injury to the community. The question is one which should be dealt with by the Minister of External Affairs, and I shall direct his attention to the remarks which have been so well put by the honourable member for Hunter. As regards the statement made by the right honourable member for Swan, I shall put his suggestion before the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, I am sure, desires to give all the information he can to assist honourable members in dealing with the Tariff. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.37 P- m",103
