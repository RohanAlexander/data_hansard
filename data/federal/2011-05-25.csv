1,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (9:01): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Shipping carries 99 per cent of Australia's trade by volume and Australia's shipping task makes up 10 per cent of the entire world's seaborne trade. If cargo is to be transported efficiently by ships, it is essential to ensure that accidents which lead to pollution, injury or death are minimised. This cannot be achieved only by ensuring that ships are seaworthy. It is also necessary to ensure that ships entering and leaving Australian ports are manned by wellqualified crews who have decent working conditions. We cannot reasonably expect seafarers who are subject to Third World living and working conditions to provide First World shipping services. Recognising importance of seafarers to the world economy, the International Organisation (ILO), in 2006, adopted the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC). The MLC is considered to be the fourth pillar of the international shipping regime complementing major conventions of the IMO on environmental protection, ship safety and ship security. The MLC is intended to provide decent working conditions for seafarers by setting minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship. Matters addressed by the MLC BILLS include conditions of employment, accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection. I am pleased to be able to say that implementation of the MLC in Australia is strongly supported by the maritime industry, unions and employer associations. Indeed, the tripartite Australian delegation, which participated in meetings leading up to the adoption of the MLC and in the conference which adopted it, included representatives of the Maritime Union of Australia and the Australian Shipowners Association as well as Australian government officials. The composition of the Australian delegation reflected the unique arrangements for ILO meetings which bring together representatives of governments, employers and workers to jointly shape policies and programs. The MLC will apply in Australia to ships of 200 gross tons and over, whether engaged on domestic or international voyages. However, the MLC requirement for ships to carry documentation as evidence of compliance applies only to ships of 500 gross tons and over engaged in voyages to or from ports outside their country of the registration. The Navigation Amendment Bill which is Labour being introduced today provides for the implementation of the MLC in Australia. It amends the Navigation Act 1912 to ensure that there is consistency between that act and the MLC. The most significant amendments contained in the bill are the amendments to Part IV of the Navigation Act to establish the inspection and certification requirements to ensure that ships actually comply with the MLC. In accordance with the MLC, Australian ships of 500 gross tons and over trading to or from overseas ports will be required to be issued with two documents-a declaration of maritime labour compliance and a maritime labour certificate. The declaration of maritime labour compliance will list the requirements that must be met by a particular ship to meet the standards set out in the MLC and will list the proposed measures that will be taken by the shipowner for initial and ongoing compliance with the MLC. The maritime labour certificate will be issued after a ship has been inspected and has been found to meet the requirements of the MLC. A maritime labour certificate will be subject to periodic validation based on intermediate, renewal or additional inspections as required. Such a certificate will be valid for a maximum period of five years before it must be renewed. Surveyors from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will inspect foreign ships at Australian ports during routine port state control inspections to ensure that those ships comply with the requirements of the MLC. The carriage on board of a declaration of maritime labour compliance and a maritime labour certificate will usually be accepted as prima facie evidence of compliance with the MLC and will mean that a full inspection is not required. Australian ships will be subject to similar inspections at foreign ports in countries that are parties to the MLC. While it is only ships of 500 gross tons and over trading internationally that will be required to carry certificates, it is expected that the owners of many other ships will apply for the issue of certificates for their ships. This will be an easy way for such ships to demonstrate their compliance with the MLC and will avoid the potentially costly delays that may occur if a ship is detained for a full inspection to ensure its compliance with the MLC. This bill provides for the issue of a declaration of maritime labour compliance and a maritime labour certificate to any ship which seeks them and which, after inspection, is found to comply with the MLC. As well as amendments relating to the MLC, this bill also makes two minor amendments to the Navigation Act to facilitate the reporting of the positions of ships. The bill will amend the definition of 'vessel traffic service' in subsection 411(3) and will widen the regulation-making power to allow for the making of regulations relating to vessel traffic services. These two amendments will help provide full legal backing for the extension, from 1 July 2011, of the current vessel traffic services to the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef. The amendments are part of the government response to the grounding of the Shen Neng 1 in the Great Barrier Reef in April 2010 and are intended to help ensure the protection of this wonderful part of the Australian environment. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Albanese. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (09:07): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Australian transport relies almost entirely on oil products. A significant amount of Australia's oil is imported as crude oil for refining at one of Australia's seven oil refineries. On occasions, crude oil is transported in supertankers. Because of their size, these large ships are unable to enter most ports. To enable their cargo to be taken to an oil refinery, it will often be transferred to two more smaller tankers. There may also be other times when oil cargo is transferred between tankers. While such transfers are rare in Australian waters, indeed the first and, so far, only such transfer was successfully carried out off the New South Wales coast in March of this year, it is important that they be carried out in a responsible manner. The Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation has recognised the potential for pollution damage resulting from an oil spill during a ship-to-ship oil transfer operation. In July 2009, the committee adopted amendments to annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, MARPOL, to regulate ship-toship oil transfers. The purpose of this bill is to implement those amendments in Australia. The key provision of the bill is the requirement for all tankers with a gross tonnage of 150 tons or more to have on board an operations plan setting out how ship-to-ship oil transfer operations are to be conducted. The carriage of such a plan indicates that a tanker is fully prepared to undertake ship-to-ship oil transfers in accordance with the requirements of annex I of MARPOL. Transfers are to be carried out in accordance with the plan. Should a plan not be in place for a tanker involved in an oil transfer operation, then the risk of an oil spill would be greatly increased. Failure to have a plan would be an indication that the tanker may not have sufficient safeguards in place to avoid an oil spill and that there is the potential for major environmental damage resulting from the escape of oil during the oil transfer operation. The ship-to-ship operations plans for Australian oil tankers will be checked and, if or found to comply with the requirements of the amendments contained in this bill, will be approved by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The master of an oil tanker involved in a ship-to-ship oil transfer operation will be required to notify the administration of the country in whose waters the transfer is to take place. Notification is required at least 48 hours before oil transfer operations begin. This is to allow sufficient time for authorities to ensure that pollution response equipment is on standby in case of an oil spill during the transfer. The requirements set out in the bill will apply to all ship-to-ship oil transfer operations carried out from 1 April 2012. The requirements will also apply to any tanker which has undergone a survey to check compliance with safety and marine pollution prevention requirements between the date of royal assent of this bill and 1 April 2012. Since coming to power in 2007 this government has significantly improved the protection of Australia's marine environment, and this bill continues that work. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr M Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (09:13): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to establish a national offshore regulator of safety, integrity and environmental management of petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities in Commonwealth waters. A national offshore administrator will also be established through amendments in this bill to administer titles in Commonwealth waters. This is the principal bill in a package of complementary amendment bills which I will be introducing in this session. This bill will largely implement the government's response to the 2009 Productivity Commission's Review of Regulatory Burden on the Upstream Petroleum (Oil and Gas) Sector, which I will be tabling with the government's final response to the report on the Montara commission of inquiry later today. The Productivity Commission's recommendation to reduce unnecessary burden on the industry was the establishment of a national offshore petroleum regulator. It found the existing system was burdensome, slow and lacked consistency across jurisdictions. The report of the Montara commission of inquiry of June 2010 recommended that, at a minimum, the proposal to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator should be pursued. The Montara commission specifically recommended the establishment of a single independent regulatory body looking after safety as a primary objective but adding well integrity and environmental management. The 2008 Varanus Island pipeline explosion and the 2009 Montara oil and gas blow-out highlighted the need for improvement in the regulatory regime to be robust and seamless. The existing regulatory arrangements are complex, disjointed and involve inconsistent administration, including regulatory duplication across governments. These inadequacies largely stem from the risk of regulatory gaps arising from the regulation of safety and integrity being separate from titles the regulation of environment and day-today operations. Maintaining the current arrangements is not a credible option in light of the Productivity Commission review and the report of the Montara commission of inquiry. Currently the Commonwealth has legislative responsibility for petroleum operation in Australia's offshore areas beyond three nautical miles. However, dayto-day regulation is undertaken by the designated authority in each state and in the Northern Territory. This system, which requires seven separate designated authority regulators for principal Commonwealth borders around Australia, made sense when established, particularly bearing in mind that at that time the two key jurisdictions, Victoria and Western Australia, both had well-established regulators more familiar with day-today offshore petroleum operations than was the Commonwealth. As Commonwealth expertise and involvement in regulating offshore operations has developed, in particular following the establishment of NOPSA, the inefficiencies and limitations inherent in the DA model has become more apparent. These shortcomings have been highlighted by the Montara incidence. The proposals that I am now putting to the parliament bring the legislative framework governing offshore petroleum operations into line with the Commonwealth's administrative capacities in order to ensure that day-today administration of our highly regarded regulatory regime can truly be said to be world's best practice. With the reforms contained in this package of legislative amendments, the government is replacing the seven designated authorities with an integrated regulatory system, promoting consistency efficiency across Commonwealth waters. The administration of titles will be centralised and the new national offshore petroleum titles administrator will replace the designated authority system currently in place for Commonwealth waters. However, the joint authority, which comprises the Commonwealth minister and the relevant state or territory minister, will be retained as industry. the decision maker for key petroleum title decisions. Retaining the joint authorities for petroleum titles ensures that each state and the Northern Territory continue to have a role in decision making on key petroleum projects in Commonwealth waters that could impact the individual state or territory. NOPTA will make recommendations to the joint authorities on key title decisions as well as administer titles and collect data relating to petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities in Commonwealth waters. As is currently the case, the responsible Commonwealth ministers view will prevail in the event of a disagreement. The Commonwealth minister will also remain the decision maker for greenhouse gas storage titles. States and territories will have an option to confer their administrative powers in their coastal waters on NOPTA. The existing National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority functions are to be increased to complement their expanded responsibility for well integrity regulation, which the parliament passed last year. A single national offshore petroleum regulator will ensure only one agency regulates the safety of Australia's offshore petroleum workers and the environment from exploration through to decommissioning. Safety and environment protection and dayto-day operational consents are all concerned with integrity and it is essential that they be and regulated in an integrated manner. The expanded authority will be known as the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environment Management Authority. In developing these reforms, the Australian government has undertaken significant stakeholder consultation over the last 15 months with states and the Northern Territory, as well as with NOPSA and the As with NOPSA currently, both NOPTA and NOPSEMA will be based in Perth, convenient for the oil and gas industry, and will operate on a full cost-recovery basis. This approach is consistent with the Australian government's policy on cost recovery and will help ensure minimal cost to regulatory burden to industry. These cost-recovery arrangements will be reviewed regularly in consultation with the industry. The establishment cost of NOPTA and NOPSEMA will also be cost recovered through the existing registration fees paid by the industry on transfers and dealings with offshore titles. Once the establishment costs of NOPSEMA and NOPTA are fully recovered, currently expected in 2013, these fees will be scrapped, representing a significant cost saving for the industry. Additionally, these reforms also deliver on the government's commitment to the Council of Australian Government's reform priorities. COAG's national partnership agreement to deliver a seamless national economy includes milestones to implement the agreed Productivity Commission recommendations and remove unnecessary burdens on industry. The offshore oil and gas industry is vital to sustaining our country's economic prosperity and security. By passing this bill, together with the other complementary bills, we will help deliver on the government's commitment to ensuring the Australian community's confidence in the regulation of the offshore petroleum industry by ensuring operating standards are the best and safest The reforms put forward through these bills will help streamline Australia's regulatory system, ensuring continuing competitive advantage for the necessary investment in Australia's offshore oil and gas industry to develop our resources for all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr M Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (09:22): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006, the Registration Fees Act, as it will be known. The amendments are consequential to the amendments in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011. The national regulator bill establishes a National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator to administer titles and to advise the joint authorities on key petroleum title decisions. NOPTA will replace the seven designated authorities as the titles administrator for Commonwealth waters. This bill will replace references to the designated authority in the Registration Fees Act with references to the titles in the world. administrator. The national regulator bill makes provision for the registration fees collected under this act to be retained to recover the costs of establishing NOPTA and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. Following the recovery of these establishment costs expected in 2013, the 1.5 per cent registration fee will be scrapped and replaced with a cost recovery fee which reflects the actual cost of administration with the required expertise. This will create significant savings for the industry. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr M Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (09:24): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is to make consequential amendments to the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006. The amendments are a result of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011, which establishes a National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Environmental Management Authority. NOPTA will advise the joint authorities on key petroleum title decisions and administer titles and collect and release data. NOPTA will replace the seven designated authorities as the administrator of day-today petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters. To reflect this reform, this bill amends the royalty act to replace references to the designated authority with the titles administrator. The bill has no impact on the level of royalties paid by industry or on the sharing of those royalties with Western Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Offshore Resources Legislation Amendment (Personal Property Securities) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr M Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (09:26): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill excludes application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994. The Personal Property Securities Act 2009 establishes a single national Personal Property Securities Register. While yet to commence operation, it is to become the and primary register of personal property securities interests throughout Australia. Commonwealth legislation, including the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994, is not automatically affected by the Personal Property Securities Act 2009. However, it is stated Commonwealth policy that, in order to remove duplication and increase clarity, existing approval and registration requirements for personal property securities and dealings in these securities are either removed from Commonwealth acts so the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 registration requirements only will apply or that the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 is expressly excluded from the application to personal property under the relevant Commonwealth acts dealing with personal property and interests in personal property. Chapters 4 and 5 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 relate to registration of, transfers dealings in petroleum titles and greenhouse gas titles respectively. Chapter 3 of the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 relates to registration and dealings for offshore minerals titles. Under these registration amendments in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 the regulator has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a petroleum title and the responsible Commonwealth minister has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a greenhouse gas title. The ability to refuse approval and registration of an interest underpins the purpose of the registration requirement to enable the Australian government to ensure the sustainability of the entities that are potentially able to exercise control over the exploitation of Australia's petroleum resources. There is no such approval mechanism contained in the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 as a precursor to registering an interest on the Personal Property Securities Register. By not excluding the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 from the Personal Property Securities Act 2009, the situation could conceivably arise whereby a dealing refused under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 could in fact be registered in the Personal Property Securities Register, which could lead to legal confusion over the standing of the security interest. Further to this, state and territory governments have advised the Commonwealth that they are electing to opt out of or exclude the operation of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 for their onshore mining schemes-therefore excluding application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. The Offshore Minerals Act 1994 is important to ensure consistency of and between the onshore and offshore mining regimes and to minimise the potential regulatory burden and cost to the mining industry and its investors in complying with different registration requirements, potentially skewing investment between onshore and offshore and having to keep abreast of developments. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies Legislation Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr M Ferguson. offshore Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (09:31): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will ensure that the Australian community does not bear the cost of regulating offshore investor activities, while reducing unnecessary regulatory burden and cost on industry. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to provide for the imposition of two new types of levies: firstly, an annual titles administration levy for each year of the term of that title; and, secondly, an environment plan levy to be imposed on a titleholder when an application is made for either acceptance or revision of an environmental plan. Through these levies the new National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator and the expanded National Offshore Petroleum Safety Environmental Management Authority will recover their operating costs from industry respectively. This bill is complementary to the national regulator bill, which I spoke to earlier, and is also consistent with the regulatory levies measures No. 1 bill of 2011, which enables an officer to recover the costs of regulating offshore wells and well operations. NOPSEMA and NOPTA are to be funded on a full cost recovery basis with levies from the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage industries. The level of these fees will be subject to a full cost recovery impact statement to ensure they are consistent with the Australian government cost recovery guidelines in providing increased date. transparency and the true cost of regulating the offshore oil and gas industry. The fees recover the establishment and expansion costs for NOPTA and NOPSEMA have already undergone a cost recovery impact statement process, which includes period. stakeholder consultation in April and May 2011. A further cost recovery impact statement process will be undertaken in the second half of 2011 to determine NOPTA's and NOPSEMA's ongoing operational costs in regulating after 1 January 2012. This reform will ensure that relevant regulatory expertise is available in offshore areas on a cost recovery basis from industry. In addition, industry will have transparency on how its cost recovery fees and levies are calculated. I also advise the House that I have written to the Speaker, as Chair of the Selection Committee, requesting that the Selection Committee refer the package of bills relating to the establishment of the single national regulator-namely, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies Legislation Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 2011 and the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011 to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry for inquiry, hopefully with a reporting date of 27 June 2011 so as to enable the government to consider the committee's report and for debate on the bills to occur in the sitting week commencing 4 July 2011. I further advise the House that before making this request I consulted with the chair and deputy chair of the committee regarding referral and associated reporting I commend the bill to the House and to simply say to all those involved in the drafting of what is a complex set of legislative instruments: thanks for an exceptionally hard job done over a very short Debate adjourned.

8,Ms ONEILL,CONDOLENCES," I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011. I believe that this bill addresses sensitive issues which we on this side of the parliament view with complete seriousness and responsibility. Bill 2011 In the electorate of Robertson, as in most electorates in Australia, the issue of asylum seekers and unauthorised migration is an issue of considerable discussion at this time. I understand that Australians hold very strong views on some elements of the discussion that is underway; but we have never resiled from the fact that we accept and understand fully our human rights and international obligations and that these must be upheld and complied with. I believe that this bill certainly achieves this objective. fact, it represents a necessary reform in the migration jurisdiction. This reform will streamline the means by which the Department of Immigration and Citizenship can assess asylum seekers who are not refugees under the refugee convention but whose return would breach Australia's nonrefoulement obligations. This legislation has the potential to significantly improve the outcomes of people who are seeking asylum who come from particularly difficult situations. As stated the title of this bill, these protection obligations are complementary to our obligations under the refugee convention. This bill gives, once and for all, full recognition to these responsibilities in addition to providing an integrated means through which the Department of Immigration and Citizenship can address applications based on non-refoulement. Currently, the non-refoulement obligations can be assessed only by the minister and cannot be taken into account by the department of immigration or independent merit review process. This means that the assessment of refugee claims based on nonrefoulement depends solely on ministerial intervention based on executive authority. I sincerely believe that a thorough statutory process for assessing claims based on non-refoulement is desperately needed. Indeed the statutory process proposed in this bill would enable refugee claims to be assessed more quickly and in a more comprehensive manner. Further, this bill provides for a more efficient, transparent and accountable system when assessing these complementary protection claims. The integrated approach will involve a single protection visa application process. Asylum seekers who have been refused refugee status may nonetheless be granted a protection visa on the basis of Australia's non-refoulement In obligations. If a decision is not made in the favour of an asylum seekers, then this legislation will provide that asylum seeker with access to internal merit review. This legislation is designed to put in place a clear procedure which ensures that asylum claims are assessed in a manner that provides appropriate procedural fairness to the claimant. Such claims currently can only be determined at the discretion of a minister. Whilst those opposite support the continuation of this system, we believe that it in results in undue uncertainty for asylum seekers. Also, by having applications for protection visas based on non-refoulement obligations determined through an integrated system with a merit review, there is far less chance of judicial review being required. Such a process makes it easier to ensure that decisions are made according to law and that the requirements for natural justice are properly provided for. This would decrease uncertainty and may decrease the need for the Federal Court to hear so many migration matters. Such reform can only be described as a positive development. It is fundamental that the parliament also consider the humanitarian need for this legislation. These humanitarian needs include the grave need to consider the welfare of asylum seekers who have been refused refugee status but for whom their return to their homeland represents a great danger. Non-refoulement obligations are contained in the human rights instruments to which Australia is party, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as stated by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Unlike our obligations under the refugee convention, our non-refoulement obligations under these instruments are absolute and cannot be derogated from. I challenge those opposite to claim that it is not in the best interests of our nation that take into account our international obligations when amending the Migration Act(Quorum formed)",28
9,Mr SIMPKINS,CONDOLENCES," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011. But can I say that these bills keep coming in the same way that the boats keep coming into Australian waters. Until the policy of this country is changed with regard to border security, then the boats will still keep coming and these ineffectual bills will still keep coming before the House. The bill will not provide additional protection outcomes-certainly not more than what is already provided for. It will not give greater protection. Nor will it allow for improvements in compliance with our treaty obligations. It is also important to note that there have been no breaches of any treaty obligations by our country.",30
10,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES, Order! Would those members who are still in the chamber and out of their place conducting little conversations please either resume their seats or leave the chamber.,30
11,Mr SIMPKINS,CONDOLENCES,"Thanks, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I would have carried on regardless. What this bill presents is another opportunity for those who wish to come to this country by any means possible, and in fact it will increase the menu from which those who seek to bypass legitimate processes can choose. We know that the Migration Act prescribes the reasons in the refugee convention for fleeing persecution-those being race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion. These constitute the usual reasons why a person would be eligible for a protection visa. I note from the we minister's second reading speech that the reason for this bill is to acknowledge that there are others that can also be fearful for their safety, but who, because they do not fit into one of those categories, cannot be considered refugees and whose applications must be rejected by the department and then by the Refugee Review Tribunal. Clearly under treaties such as the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Australia has an obligation to not send such people back-the non-refoulement obligation. This is what is known as complementary protection. The government proposes to establish a statutory regime whereby the visa applicant can apply for protection immediately under complementary protection arrangements and not apply as a refugee as defined under the convention. This would mean that the minister would not normally be involved unless the applicant was rejected under these new arrangements and then made an application to the minister for intervention. What leaps out at me is that such a change would result in endless appeals once again afflicting the protection visa and humanitarian entry program. As previously said, the changes would increase the options for court processes when in fact the reality is that the current system involves a very small number of people. I understand that around 25 people were in this sort of category in the 2008-09 financial year, and six in the period from January to October 2010. In fact, all information from DIAC and the minister‘s office suggests that these numbers are expected to be pretty much consistent in the future. Clearly the presence of such a bill in this parliament is a significant step for such a small number of cases. What we do know is that, in 2008-09, 55 visas were granted by the minister under the humanitarian program and less than half involved non-refoulement matters. Furthermore, between 1 January 2010 and 22 October 2010, of the 438 visas granted by the minister, only six would have been covered under the provisions of this bill. It really does make it difficult to appreciate the need for this bill given the numbers involved. So I would say the demand is low, and the need is even lower, considering the state of our treaty obligations and compliance, which is exemplary. I wonder why the government let this bill lapse at the end of the last parliament when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee finished dealing with it in late October 2009. This bill is essentially the same as the one left to languish by the Labor government in the previous parliament. This version does insert a new subclause 36(2)(b) that sets out a number of exclusion clauses, such as those guilty of committing serious crimes. It states that a real risk only exists it is faced by the non-citizen in question, and not if it is a general risk faced by the population of a country. My concern revolves around adding to the appeal and review process rather than the minister dealing with any such cases and considering the specific issues that are involved. There is no doubt that the system has been clogged with a series of bad policy decisions by this government, and they should be very careful about making another bad call which would further congest a system struggling under the weight of people and appeals. Still, the lawyers will no doubt appreciate what this bill will provide for them. As the minister said in his second reading speech in February 2011, under the changes envisaged in this bill the non-refoulement obligations will not be engaged in every case. He said that there must still be substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of being returned, there is a real risk that a person will suffer significant harm. What this opens up is a level of subjectivity that will be grist for the lawyers' mill, and that subjectivity does not currently exist because the minister‘s decisions are not exposed to court appeals. The danger here is that an instrument intended to only be used in exceptional circumstances will quickly become commonplace, and the number of claims being made on these grounds will blow out. We know this because we have seen it before. I know this Labor government is not particularly good at learning the lessons of history, but the fact is that in the late 1980s, it was a Labor immigration minister, Senator Robert Ray, who abolished arrangements if that are strikingly similar to what is contained in this bill. Back then, a series of court decisions, well-intentioned though they may have been, led to a completely unsustainable situation whereby an applicant only had to demonstrate that if they were forced to leave Australia their situation would ‗evoke strong feelings of pity or compassion in an ordinary member of the Australian public'. As a result, applications flooded in, to a point where an instrument that was intended to produce about 100 successful applicants per year was subjected to around 8,000 claims covering 10,000 individuals. That is no way to run an orderly migration system. It is certainly the case that the people on the streets of Cowan have given me a clear message on matters to do with those that come by boat. From my recent door-knocking in the north of my electorate the message is clear. The people are outraged by all the special deals that are being done. The detainees play sport and take art classes, earn points for free nose-hair trimmers, cigarettes, phone cards, snacks et cetera. What a special deal that is. These are the sort of deals that irritate people on the streets our country. And it is these same taxpayers that are paying the price for this government‘s failures. The budget handed down by the Treasurer contained over $100 million to deal with court appeals that flow from the High Court‘s decision to strike down the former non-statutory process for considering refugee assessments. In the last year, the costs of maintaining Australia‘s detention network have blown out significantly. There was $1.75 billion in the budget this week for offshore asylum seeker management alone. The current system is equipped to identify and deal with legitimate claims without opening up the entire process to vexatious applicants and turning the entire system into a lawyers' picnic in the sorts of cases are discussing today. Section 195A of the Migration Act permits the minister to grant a visa to a person in detention if the minister considers it in the public interest to do so. That is an entirely appropriate flexibility in the current system. In my view, the changes the government is proposing in this bill pose an unacceptable risk to the stability of our migration system-a system that is already staggering under the weight of this government‘s ineptitude. Most Australians will rightly be wary of any changes this government tries to make to our migration system-its record does not exactly inspire confidence. Since Labor changed Australia‘s border protection policies, 224 boats-or probably more-have arrived carrying over 11,000 people. This includes the boat that was set alight and the one that crashed at Christmas Island last year resulting in significant fatalities-a great tragedy. These are the then boats we know about. The tragic reality is that there are likely others which have set out on this dangerous course and not made it. This government‘s own figures show that, of if an Afghan applied for a visa offshore, they stood a one-in-10 chance of success. Of those Afghans who arrived here illegally by boat, nine out of 10 got a positive visa assessment. What sort of message does this send? How does this serve to discourage people smuggling and people risking their lives on the seas? Clearly, I am of the view that the effort that was put into creating this bill and focusing on this bill should have been put into creating a policy that actually returned control of our borders to this nation, rather than promoting the people-smuggling trade. Indeed, we understand that, in drafting this bill, the government did not seek input from ASIO, from Customs and Border Security or from the Australian Federal Police. If this that we government were serious about border security, it would surely have made at least some rudimentary inquiries to those charged with protecting Australia‘s borders. This bill does nothing to discourage illegal boat arrivals. It will not deter people smugglers. It will not ensure that legitimate refugees are processed more efficiently. It will not reduce the burden on taxpayers. What it will likely do is clog our courts with thousands of vexatious applicants, all of which will have to be considered, and see a system that already moves at a slow place grind to a halt. So far as I can tell, the only winners from this bill will be the lawyers and the people smugglers. Why not instead return to a policy that worked and that is infinitely cheaper than the costs of running this currently failing set of policies? Why not reopen Nauru? Why not reintroduce temporary protection visas and the 45 day rule? These are some of the policies that would make the difference and take things back to those days where the Australian government actually had control of the borders-which has not been the case since this government changed the policy in 2008. The bill does nothing to restore that control, and instead provides further incentives for illegal immigration. It runs contrary to this government‘s claims to be cracking down on people smugglers-and it is certainly against the wishes of my constituents in Cowan, who are tired of seeing their taxes wasted on this Labor government‘s failed policies.",30
12,Ms OWENS,CONDOLENCES," This bill is about stripping away complexities for people who seek the protection of Australia who, if returned home, would be at risk of torture, inhumane treatment or likely death but do not qualify as refugees. At first glance it seems counterintuitive that a person who, if returned home would be at risk of torture and inhumane treatment or likely death, would not qualify as refugee, but it is in the case. The refugee convention is quite specific about the conditions you have to meet under the refugee convention-that is, persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. For example, it is not certain that a girl who would face a real risk of female genital mutilation would always be covered by the refugee convention. It is also not clear that woman at risk of so-called honour killings would be covered by the convention and in some countries where victims of rape are executed along with their attackers that woman also may not be covered under the refugee convention. So there are many people facing appalling circumstances who seek the protection of other countries but cannot do it under the refugee convention. In the 2009-10 budget the government announced that it would implement a system of complementary protection for people to whom Australia has a non-return obligation under international human rights treaties other than the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. There is no internationally accepted definition of 'complementary protection'. The term is not a term defined in any international treaty. However, the term broadly describes protection obligations arising under international law. Such obligations are in addition or complementary to the protection obligations that arise under the 1951 refugee convention, which provides protection to refugees under those specific definitions. Australia does have non-return obligations when people in those appalling circumstances seek the protection of Australia. Australia, of course, does not send people back to death or possible torture. What currently happens is that a person who may find themselves under one of those fact circumstances at risk of likely torture or death or inhumane treatment on return applies for a protection visa under the refugee convention. Applicants who are found not to be refugees then go through the appeals process and, of course, are rejected. Then the minister considers their situation under ministerial intervention. So it is a very, very long process for a person who simply could not be returned to their country of a origin for fear of persecution, torture or likely death. It is an extremely inefficient process. Even the Migration Review Tribunal, who might understand that a person is likely to eventually be accepted under ministerial intervention, must reject the application on appeal as the person does not fall under the refugee convention. Relying upon ministerial intervention powers to consider complementary protection claims incredibly inefficient. The ministerial powers do not come into effect until after the person has been refused a visa both by a delegate of the minister and on review by the tribunal. This means that under current arrangements people who are not refugees under the refugee convention but who may engage Australia's other non-return obligations must go through the entire visa process before their claims can be considered by the minister-again, an incredibly inefficient process. Under this bill protection visa applicants will continue to have their claims first considered against the refugee convention's related criteria set out in Australia's migration legislation. Applicants who are found not to be refugees under the convention will have their claims considered under the new complementary protection criteria. This approach recognises the primacy of the refugee convention as an international protection instrument supported by the UNHCR, but it establishes new criteria for the grant of a protection visa in circumstances that engage our other nonreturn obligations under human rights treaties. Australia will not return a person to a place where they are at real risk of significant harm contained in the relevant human rights treaties, including the arbitrary deprivation of life, having the death penalty carried out, being subjected to torture, being subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment, or being subjected to degrading treatment or punishment. So it is quite a simplification of the process for people in quite desperate circumstances. Putting people through lengthy processes unnecessarily is not humane, and I am very pleased to see us move towards introducing this system of complementary protection. Australia has a long and proud tradition as is a protector of human rights and it is a reflection of this tradition that Australia is a party to the major UN human rights treaties, including the 1951 convention; the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees; the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia became a party in 1980; the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. I am incredibly proud to speak on this bill. It will be an important addition to our system that provides protection to people at serious risk of harm in their country of origin. I am pleased to commend the bill to the House.",33

17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"Order! Would those who are leaving the chamber do so quietly and not conduct a second conversation out of their place. The member for Macquarie has the call. Mrs MARKUS: I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011. This bill will change decision making on complementary protection claims from the current ministerial intervention arrangements to a statutory process through the department of immigration. It seeks to introduce a statutory framework which includes additional criteria and new definitions into the assessment process for determination by the department, and it seeks to establish the same administrative review rights as for people seeking protection under the 1951 refugee convention. The changes pose challenges for this nation and the need for an orderly, compassionate and fair system to operate. The proposal outlined in this bill is not new to this House; it was first introduced on 9 September 2009, where it lapsed and the parliament was prorogued for the 2010 election. A similar bill was actually removed in 1989, just eight years after being introduced. While it was claimed initially that only 100 successful applicants per year would be processed, by the time the legislation was repealed there were 8,000 outstanding applications. Complementary protection describes protection obligations arising under international law. These obligations are in addition and complementary to Australia's existing protection framework, the foundation of which is the 1951 refugee convention, which provides protection to refugees. For over 60 years Australia's asylum and humanitarian program has brought many people to our shores who have made valuable contributions to the nation and their local communities. Australia is a signatory to a number of international conventions, agreements and covenants, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. These instruments obligate Australia under refoulement non-return provisions to provide protection to people who, while not meeting the 1951 refugee convention definition, still need protection on the basis that they face serious violations of their rights if sent back to their country of origin. Currently, the minister can make decisions in respect of claims for complementary protection through the ministerial intervention process, which is nontransparent and non-appealable. The minister does not have to explain or justify the decision to exercise or not exercise the discretionary powers. This raises one very important question: if people seeking complementary protection are already being dealt with through the current process, why does the government need to amend the legislation? This is legislation for legislation's sake. Australians have every right to ask why this government continues to waste time and taxpayers' dollars on adding layer upon layer of bureaucracy instead of tackling real issues that face everyday Australians. broadly One wonders why the minister seeks to transfer his discretionary powers to a statutory process determined by unelected officials, when we look at the statistics on complementary protection. For example, as the shadow minister has already highlighted, the minister's office has advised that in the 10 months from January 2010 to October 2010 the minister finalised 1,690 requests for intervention. Of those, the minister granted visas to a total of 438 people. Of those, only six people met the complementary protection provisions. The minister's office has confirmed that they do not expect the number of applicants being granted protection visas under the proposed complementary protection provisions to increase at all. Given the history of previous similar bills, I find their assurance questionable. It begs the question: what minister would relinquish discretionary powers for six people? There are only three plausible explanations: the minister has decided that complementary protection is too small an issue to be bothered about; the minister has found a way for unauthorised arrivals to apply for protection in a visa class, complementary protection, that is now proposed to include a larger range of definitions and will now be open to broader interpretation-a visa class that will be appealable if the first decision is not favourable; or, the minister has decided that the department should take the heat on an issue that is front of mind for the nation at the moment. Immigration policy is this government's Achilles heel. The government does not have the courage to admit it is wrong or that its failed policies have put Australia's immigration program, its resources, its people and its budget under enormous strain. The government does not have the courage to acknowledge that a significant section of the Australian community is concerned that the government has lost control of its borders. I speak to many people in my electorate of Macquarie, people who support the relaxation of immigration processes and people who believe the process should be tougher. All are concerned about the riots, the reports of overfull detention centres and the waste and mismanagement of budget blow-outs in the immigration portfolio. We cannot afford to spend dollar after dollar on the current government's immigration policy, because of the government's economic mismanagement, while our own citizens are struggling to make ends meet. This government has clearly failed, yet it is still pursuing additional legislation such as this bill. What concerns me about this bill, which can only be described as another example of policy on the run, is that the government has refused to consult even its own agencies on the viability of this amendment. The legislation was considered by a Senate committee that received 36 submissions but, in a break from customary practice, did not hold any public hearings. Only 19 days were available for submissions. Within a month, a report was tabled. Even the committee referred to the 'constrained circumstances' of the recommendations. Why the rush? My understanding is that, although the minister received strong representations from the refugee advocacy sector, the minister neither sought nor received advice from the Australian Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection Service, ASIO or any other relevant agency. I call on the minister to confirm that he has or has not consulted with the relevant agencies established to protect Australia's border security and to what extent, if any, these changes will not act as an incentive for people smugglers? It appears from the lack of consultation that this government does not believe that research and consultation are worthy of consideration when it comes to changing legislation. We are a compassionate nation, recognising the need to offer a new and better life to those in need. Indeed we have always been such a nation, one that dared to share the Australian dream with those escaping war-torn Europe after the Second World War and with other individuals and families escaping persecution in other parts of the globe over the past 60 years. Many migrants who have come to this nation have committed themselves to working hard and to raising their families. Their contribution helps to build a stronger Australia for the generations to come. I am concerned that the opportunity that Australia offers will be denied possibly to the Australian-born as well as to new arrivals if Australia is placed in such a precarious financial position that it cannot support the standard of living that we enjoy today. This bill is but one example of how this government operates. The changes proposed, in particular the definitional changes, the impact on resources for the department and the legal costs arising from access to administrative review have polarised this debate. Comments from refugee advocacy groups such the Refugee Council of Australia, who want the definitions more specific, are that 'The threshold requirements for complementary protection are too complex and restrictive, potentially leading to inconsistencies in decision making and the denial of protection to people who require it'. Arguments against the bill cite the criteria as 'poorly drafted' and that they could lead to greater uncertainty and invite needless litigation. Indeed, there is a view that the decision to provide a new pathway for asylum claims for those who arrive illegally and are not refugees will place another product on the people smugglers' shelf. The current ministerial intervention process is a safeguard that has been in place for decades and it has been effective. Codification removes discretion which has applied on a case-by-case basis and has helped genuine refugees languishing in camps around the world. In addition, the risk that the bill will encourage the lodgement of non-refugee protection applications and the making of false asylum claims has to be considered, because the claims under the proposed bill will run the full length of the process, then be subject to appeal. Primary decisions would be appealable, adding to the already lengthy waiting time for unresolved cases. If this minister had a clue about the best interest of the nation, he would put this legislation back on the shelf and come up with solutions for the present crisis, not introduce something that will only add to the challenges. The coalition is united on this issue. We stand ready to implement a much stronger and more encompassing policy when elected to government. The coalition maintains that the current system of ministerial discretion in cases where complementary protection is in play is more than appropriate. On this occasion, it is clear that the Gillard Labor government has sought to position itself on one side of the debate. The Gillard Labor government has chosen to ignore its responsibilities to the nation as a whole, by refusing to consider other voices of concern. This kind of legislation, underpinning flawed policy, is symptomatic of, as our Prime Minister put it, 'a government that has lost its way'.",34
18,Mr ZAPPIA,CONDOLENCES," I take this opportunity to speak on the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011. I would have thought that this bill would have had bipartisan support, but instead we have seen coalition speaker after coalition speaker coming into this House and opposing the bill, opposing what I think most fair-minded people would consider to be a very sensible measure. And they do so for no better reason than political opportunism, linking this bill to the issue of boat people arrivals in this country and rerunning their rhetoric on the refugee issue, in particular making claims that this bill is another example of being soft on border protection. Nothing could be further from the truth. I suspect many coalition members would privately support this bill, because this bill is long, long overdue. It should have bipartisan support, because this bill has been supported by several parliamentary committees, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the United Nations Committee against Torture, the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and it is a bill that is very similar to legislation that has already been adopted in New Zealand, in many European countries and in North America. In addition, Australia is a signatory to International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. All these conventions which Australia is a signatory to contain provisions very similar to what is in this bill. Nonrefoulement obligations cover people who, if returned to their home country, would face a violation of their fundamental human rights, such as being arbitrarily deprived of their life, being subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or having the death penalty carried out on them. Examples of cases covered by complementary protection include people at risk of being stoned due to their homosexuality-persecution because of sexual preference is not a category of persecution contemplated by the refugee convention, yet some people, if they are sent back to their home countries, may well be stoned; women fleeing ritual genital mutilation; and women at risk of so-called honour killings. With these sorts of examples, I find it very surprising that so many members from the coalition have come in and opposed this bill. In 2009-10, as has been pointed out, there were six protection visas granted on these grounds, plus four visas granted to dependants of those six applicants. It is not lot. Are the opposition members who criticise this bill saying that those six people and others that fall into similar categories should have been sent back home? If they are, then I believe they should hang their heads in shame, because what they are really saying is that those people should be sent home to a place where they might be persecuted or even put to death. At present, only the minister can approve the their stay. The department cannot do so. The last speaker referred to ministerial intervention and said that this is about the minister relinquishing his ministerial intervention discretion. That is simply not the case, and I will come back to that a bit later. At the moment, in order to trigger ministerial intervention, the applicant goes through a farcical, time-consuming, expensive and futile application process, knowing full well that, at the end of the process, the department does not have the ability to approve the application. Then, because it has been refused, they can seek ministerial intervention. If that is not bureaucratic and time consuming, then what is? I would have thought the Australian public would have been critical of a process that costs so much money, not just to the applicant but to the department that administers this piece of legislation. We go through a charade just so that the minister can then be asked to intervene. My understanding is that the minister has something like 4,000 cases a year referred to his department for his intervention. Obviously, not all applications are believed by the minister to warrant his intervention, but that is still 4,000 cases. I am sure the question here has nothing to do with whether it is six or 10 or 12; the question here is about getting the process right. If members believe that the minister a should continue to use his intervention in order to determine these cases, then I ask them this: why don't you suggest in turn that every single immigration case that comes before the department be referred to the minister? If you believe this category ought to, then surely you must believe all the other categories ought to be as well. Quite frankly, every immigration case is unique, every immigration case has merits, both for and against, and with every immigration case there is an opportunity in some process for ministerial intervention if it is applied forso we might as well simply not have a department and refer all immigration cases to the minister. The reality is that is not the way that you administer government and there is a very important principle here: ministers as individuals should not be assessing every immigration case that comes Governments and ministers formulate policy and departments administer policy, and that is how good government works. By all means, and I have no qualms about this at all, question the policy when it comes into this place and question the legislation and debate it, but once it is in place it is the government departments that ought to administer it. In fact, that is how good government works because it means you do not have political interference in cases where you should not have it. There has also been the claim that this legislation will create a flood of applications of similar kinds if it goes through this parliament and that we will see so many more people wanting to come in under those grounds. My point for coalition members is this. Should the question be about how many applications come in or should the real question be: if applications come in are they legitimate? If they are legitimate then I go back to what I said earlier: are members opposite seriously suggesting that if legitimate cases come before the government we should reject them? To my mind that is the question that they should be asking themselves. They are making the claim about how this will open the floodgates but not one of them has come into this place and shown any evidence that that has been the case in the European countries, New Zealand or North America where similar legislation applies. So until they do so they are purely issuing unfounded claims and statements. The opposition believe that they are on a political winner with this issue by linking it to the boat people issue. They want to keep alive the debate about refugees coming to this country and keep alive their simple slogans. We have heard them time and time again from members opposite who have come into this place to debate this bill. They never let the facts get in the way of their up. rhetoric, and again we are seeing that with this matter. A number of them referred to the current refugee issues associated with Australia. They failed to acknowledge that right now there is a global refugee problem. At the end of 2009 there were 43 million displaced people worldwide. Fifteen million were refugees and almost one million were asylum seekers. In recent weeks, not recent years, we have seen almost 20,000 refugees arrive at the Italian island of Lampedusa. In the USA each year some 50,000 refugees arrive, in Canada 33,000, in Europe roughly 275,000 and in Australia just over 6,000-a stark difference from what is happening around the world, yet if you were to listen to members opposite they would have you believe that Australia is a country in which everybody is trying to seek refuge. In fact, it is my understanding that right now in Malaysia, a country that we are trying to enter into an agreement with, there are some 92,000 refugees seeking resettlement. What this whole matter highlights is both the hypocrisy and unsubstantiated rhetoric of members opposite. There is hypocrisy because, on one hand, they claim that we should do everything we can to try to make our borders safer-they frequently use the words 'border protection' but I am not quite sure what it is we are trying to protect the borders from-yet, on the other, when we are seeking to negotiate an arrangement with Malaysia whereby we will in a humane way take from refugee camps 4,000 people who are seeking asylum, they criticise that process. We saw their reaction to the announcements of the discussion with Malaysia. We did not see any support for those announcements at all. We saw criticism of them. Yet it is a discussion that will ultimately result in a much more humane outcome for genuine refugees whilst at the same time resulting in an outcome that I believe will be very effective in destroying the people-smuggling business of that region. This bill is all about doing the right by both the administration of this country and people who are genuinely seeking to stay in this country because if they return to their purview.' homeland they will be persecuted and even tortured. If anyone in the coalition genuinely believes that is the wrong thing to do, then I believe they are not reflecting the broad views of the Australian people. As I said from the outset, there is a lot of support for this bill. Yes, there have been a number of submissions with respect to it. But it is long overdue, and I commend the bill to the House.",37
19,Dr STONE,CONDOLENCES," I rise to also speak on the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011. This is all about making sure that we do in fact have orderly entry to Australia and that refugees are given priority according to their needs, not according to whether they can raise the funds to pay a smuggler to take them through various countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia to get onto a boat and then find themselves fast-tracked into Australia by the back door. We know that this government has caused an extraordinary upsurge in the profits to be had by people smugglers, who have and probably always will have willing buyers. We had an orderly system up to the time when the Rudd and Gillard governments were elected. We certainly acknowledge that there are situations where people need protection that will be beyond the criteria of the UNHCR, but our system allows for that through ministerial discretion. I was rather amused to hear the previous speaker refer to that ministerial discretion-that is, the use of the minister's responsibilities to make decisions on a case-by-case basis-as 'ministerial interference'. How extraordinary. Does this government have so little faith in its ministers that it refers to their actions as per their legislation as 'interference'? That is thing quite extraordinary, and I hope that the minister takes the speaker to task and says, 'I'm acting responsibly and according to my We do not need to have an alternative, non-specified route into Australia for those claiming asylum, which will, I have no doubt, bring about more vexatious claims, particularly from those who are already residing in Australia who may have come in, for example, on a tourist visa or a student visa and then, at the end of their legitimate time in Australia, claim sanctuary. There is no doubt that this change, the complementary protection visa introduction, would give them a whole new avenue to explore and exploit to remain in Australia. We are also very concerned that this creates a whole new commercial product, a very profitable product, for the criminals we call people smugglers. We do not need that. We are already seeing problems in Australia of overcrowding in our detention centres. This government is trying to negotiate in the region to offload our responsibilities to other countries which are not signatories to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and whose human rights records in relation to those in confinement or detention are sometimes questionable. So this is a very important debate to have, but certainly should not lead to new legislation which puts in place another fast track into Australia without proper scrutiny and which gives comfort, as I say, and a whole new product to sell, to the smugglers. The coalition has always supported the use of ministerial discretion for special cases on an as needs basis. We reject absolutely the government's proposal to add a whole new class of humanitarian visa for people who do not meet the United Nations criteria for assessment as a refugee. Of course, there are persons in circumstances that do not fit the refugee convention criteria who need our protection. In the past, ministers-certainly our coalition ministers, like former minister Mr Ruddock-have been more than willing to consider these special circumstances case by case, and people have been given protection and access to permanent residence in Australia via a special admittance. For example, there are women who are fearful, if they return to their home country, of so called honour killings or who might be subjected to female genital mutilation. Those types of cruelties and assaults on individuals are not covered under the refugee convention, but we certainly see that women who might be subjected to those cruelties should be protected in Australia, and under the coalition our minister of the day made sure that women in particular with those sorts of problems were given security in Australia. On the question of how many ministerial interventions were made and how many protection visas were granted, between 2000 and 2003 there were 165 protection visas granted. From our taking office in 1996 to the end of 2002, the coalition minister used his discretionary powers on 1,916 occasions. On 1,045 occasions he used his power under section 417 to substitute a more favourable decision for that of the Refugee Review it Tribunal, and in 516 cases he used it under section 351 to substitute a more favourable decision than the Migration Review Tribunal had delivered. This number is significantly greater than the number of times the discretionary power was used by former ministers-for example, by the Labor minister the Hon. Gerry Hand. From 1990 to 1993 he used his discretion on 81 occasions. The Hon. Senator Nick Bolkus from 1993 to 1996 used his ministerial discretion 311 times. So certainly there was less action and activity from Labor ministers during their terms as immigration portfolio ministers, and under the coalition there was absolutely no difficulty in our minister-in particular our minister Philip Ruddock, our longest-serving minister-taking each case, looking at the criteria of other conventions that we are signatory to, looking at the criteria of the United Nations convention on refugees and making determinations, using his own assessment of the need with departmental advice and advocacy. There was no problem at all in him making sure that these individuals were given special attention and the security of a future life in Australia. I have to say that Senator Chris Evans, the previous minister for immigration, had become very reluctant to use the interventionary powers. In fact, he often stated that he felt uncomfortable doing it. However, the six-monthly tabling statements and accompanying information-of February 2008-from the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, on the use of the intervention powers under section 417 of the Migration Act shows that there were some 1,201 discretionary interventionary actions taken. So the Labor government is not unused to using ministerial discretion and I am sure it uses it appropriately. I have not heard too many people complaining about the use of discretion. Australia is renowned for the care we take of our refugees once they are settled in Australia. At the moment we have some concerns about the number who are coming in our back door via the smugglers. The coalition has offered to help the Labor government to sort out their policies so that they could in fact return to the shutting in Australia of the business of peoplesmuggling. I hope they do take up that offer of our bipartisan collegiate support because Australians do not want to see the queue jumping that occurs and the abuse of our good nature as Australians that occurs every time someone has the means to pay smugglers to take them via second, third and sometimes fourth countries to arrive at Christmas Island, or nearby. I said that there are queues. On a recent debate on Q&A on the ABC it was loudly and strongly declared that there were no such things as queues for entry to Australia via humanitarian or refugee visas. In fact, we do set a cap on how many people we can appropriately and comfortably invite into Australia from the refugee hell holes and camps in places like the Thai-Burma border or in different parts of Africa. We need to have an idea about how many people will be selected, via the UNHCR's support, to come into Australia to be settled through what I call the 'legitimate' process. When we were in government those numbers were hovering around 13,500 people a year. Every time someone arrives who has been able to pay their way into the country via people smugglers, refugee families in my electorate, for example, sigh and despair knowing it will take so much longer for their family reunions to take place. They despair that the energies and attentions of the departmental officials, which should be directed towards finding their sons and daughters left in the camps in Kenya, are instead totally engaged in how they can best deal with those arriving boatload after boatload via the people smugglers. Yes, we do have queues in Australia and those queues become longer every time someone comes into the country who has not come via our selection process and at our invitation after down having been identified in the camps and other places in the world where it is too difficult and dangerous for them to survive. I am most concerned that this legislation does a number of things that will set us even further backwards in having a well managed, humane protection system and refugee settlement system in this country. I have already said that we have available ministerial discretion in the legislation, which means that every time there is a man, a woman or a child whose circumstances do not meet the refugee convention criteria the minister has the capacity to quickly and simply grant them visa protection on the basis of their need, and that has happened thousands of times over the recent years of both the Labor and coalition governments. So we do have an alternative that will not cause greater strife in our country in terms of longer queues and in terms of greater numbers of vexatious claims cluttering up our system. Sure, this is good for lawyers, but it is not good for the Australian community. Also, we do not need to give a new product to the people smugglers to hawk to those who are waiting, whether it is in the Pakistan, Indonesia or Malaysia, for an opportunity to get on a boat. Imagine the people smuggler saying to them, 'Look, we know you do not meet UNHCR criteria given your family background or in your personal circumstances, but, hey, there is a brand new type of product called a complementary protection visa that is now on offer in Australia. All you need to do is arrive, get on my boat and you will be right. You just have to make sure you have the US$15,000 or US$20,000 handy, and make sure you destroy your papers before you set off.' This is not a sensible or humane way to go. We have a good system right now. It is a system that has been complimented as recently as yesterday by our visitor from the Human Rights Commission. Those who arrive in our country after having been selected by the UNHCR as the most in need deserve family reunions and I hate to see them having to wait years and years, perhaps to the point where their families have been lost altogether, because the queue-jumpers have an alternative way to enter this country. The energy taken to deal with those queuejumpers and the vexatious claims is energy that should be spent in a more legitimate and humane way.",40
20,Mr BOWEN,CONDOLENCES," I thank the honourable members who have contributed to this debate. Although in the course of the debate many extraneous matters were raised that I am very tempted to respond to, I will not. I will confine my remarks to the bill before the House, the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011. This bill amends the Migration Act to eliminate a significant administrative deficiency in the visa application process. The bill will build on Australia's framework for assessing claims for protection under the Refugee Convention and provide a protection visa decision-making process that is more efficient, transparent and accountable. The amendments in this bill are important and necessary to address inefficiencies in the current protection framework. The bill permits claims made by protection visa applicants that may engage Australia's non-refoulement obligations to be considered under a single, integrated and timely protection visa application process. As has been mentioned in the House, Australia of course is a signatory to the Refugee Convention. It does not refoule people where there is a convention related fear of persecution. However, applicants who fall outside these categories of race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion are not eligible to receive a protection visa through the usual process. Some of these people are fleeing significant harm, such as women fleeing so-called honour killings. These people can fall outside the categories recognised by our current process. It has been mentioned by some honourable members that there is a ministerial intervention power to deal with these cases. That is correct, and it is used. It has been used by ministers of both sides of the House. The previous speaker, the member for Murray, said it was used by coalition ministers, and it was. It has been used by Labor ministers, including myself. It is appropriate that it be used. It is necessary that it be used. But the honourable member for Murray said that it was an 'efficient and easy system' to get ministerial intervention'quick and simple' was the contribution by the honourable member. That is completely and utterly incorrect. It is not a simple and easy system to get ministerial intervention. Under our laws, to get a minister to intervene in your case you must first apply to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, have that application rejected by the department, apply to a relevant tribunal, have that application rejected by the relevant tribunal and then seek ministerial intervention. The department will then prepare the case for the minister to consider. That process can take a long time, as all honourable members who have been involved in it would know. It takes a considerable length of time to go through the system and be rejected by the department and rejected by the tribunal before the case can even be put to a minister for consideration, yet the member for Murray calls it a quick and simple system. It is not. It is not just about time. If you are in a situation in which you are fleeing persecution, whether that be honour killings, genital mutilation or the other areas of persecution that were outlined by me in my second reading speech and by other members, it is not just about time. It the implications of being rejected at each level-by the department, by the tribunaland the anguish that causes, in the hope that your case will eventually get to a minister and that the minister will eventually intervene. All immigration ministers that I know would intervene in such cases and would grant that visa. I have said that previously. But why put people through the situation whereby they must go through that continual rejection under the law before they can even get to a ministerial intervention? I want to deal with two other points that were raised during the debate. The member for Cook put forward a proposition that these provisions will lead to a situation similar to that which occurred in the 1980s. In 1981 the then Fraser government introduced a 'strong and compassionate humanitarian grounds' test into the Migration Act, which was intended to deal with a small number of meritorious cases that could not otherwise be approved. As the shadow minister noted, claims made against this provision grew substantially in number until the provision was repealed by the Hawke government in 1989. The member for Cook compares that to the test introduced under this bill. He seems unaware of the fact that this is a very different test. This test involves substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the person being removed from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real risk they will suffer significant harm. This is a much higher and more precise test and will not lead to anything like the situation in the 1980s, as the member for Cook well knows. There is one other matter I want to respond to. The member for Pearce raised some concerns that applicants may be excluded by the test that requires that harm is about must not be faced by the population generally and suggested in particular that women or girls fearing female genital mutilation may not be able to have their claims considered. With respect, that is not correct. Under international law a 'real risk' requires that a person face a personal, direct and foreseeable risk of harm in certain circumstances. Under this legislation, if there are substantial grounds for believing that a woman or girl will face a real risk of genital mutilation that the authorities cannot protect her from, she may be entitled to Australia's protection on the grounds that she will suffer torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon return. Finally, the member for Pearce suggested that the policy guidelines or ministerial directions could be revised to specifically state that women or girls fleeing such persecution are considered a particular social group for the purposes of the Refugee Convention. In fact, this cannot be done, as policy guidelines must be consistent with Australian case law. It is simply not possible for policy guides to make a group of persons a particular social group when the courts have found otherwise. I do thank honourable members for their contribution in this debate. It is an important one, and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",43
21,Mr BOWEN,CONDOLENCES,by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,45
22,Mr HUNT,CONDOLENCES," coalition supports the science and agrees to and supports on a bipartisan basis the targets that Australia has set but disagrees clearly, strongly and absolutely with the primary mechanism brought forward by the government to deal with this issue. Their approach is a tax that will increase the cost of electricity by 25 per cent in the first three years, increase the cost of gas by 10 per cent, increase the cost of petrol and increase the cost of groceries. It will have an overall of-living impact of $863. On the opposition side, we have a clear alternative. That alternative involves incentives rather than taxes; incentives for people to do real things, such as to clean up waste coal mine gas, to clean up landfill gas, to clean up-potentially, if these are the lowest cost changes-some of the oldest and dirtiest power stations, which otherwise will run, according to the words of their owners, until well into the 2030s under the government's scheme. Under the government's scheme, these power producers will simply pass on the cost and consumers, small businesses and manufacturers will pay the difference while business as usual will be practised in terms of the sources of emissions. That is the difference. On the one side, we have a practical alternative that deals with these things and in particular allows for direct action to capture carbon in our soils, in our trees and in our vegetation. It is against that background that the government has developed its carbon farming legislation in response to the coalition's direct action proposals, a set of proposals that the government originally mocked but that it now seeks to try and replicate. They are the approaches that define the differences between these two parties. The Australian public is increasingly rejecting the idea of a carbon tax because, contrary to everything that has been said by The the government, they will pick up the bill and they know it. That bill will be $863 per annum on a $30 per tonne basis. And whether it starts there or starts lower, it will be north of there before 2020 because, as the Minerals Council of Australia has said through the report prepared on its behalf, it is expected that the price will be approximately $50 to $52 per tonne. What that means is that families will have skyrocketing costs of living, with skyrocketing electricity, gas and costgrocery prices. And that is all unnecessary. This system will raise $114 billion on Treasury's own estimates between now and 2020. Our alternative, which is funded and costed, will start with $300 million, $500 million and $750 million over the first three years. Those are the alternatives. That is the choice available to Australians: an increased cost of living-and every member on the government side knows it-versus a system based on incentives to reduce emissions, which is a system based in large part on the successful water market model. Having said that, let us give a fair reading to this legislation. Its objective is to help Australians reduce greenhouse emissions by contributing to the bipartisan five per cent reduction on 2000 emissions by 2020. It seeks to create incentives for farmers and landholders to undertake voluntary land sector abatement projects. These are principles that we in the coalition have set out, so the principles in this legislation are in agreement with those that we have put on the table. It seeks to give farmers some sort of incentive. Against that background, let me say this: we support the principle, but we have some significant issues with the construction and design of this and in particular that which is missing from these three bills. During the Senate process, we will be looking at a Senate committee report-which I understand is due at the end of this week-that responds to a series of issues. The Senate committee has taken significant soundings, representations and submissions across a range of areas. We will reserve our judgment but look on with interest at the recommendations in that Senate report. In particular, firstly, we want to know what measures will be put in place for the protection of prime agricultural land; secondly, we want to know what measures will be put in place for the protection of Western Australia from what the Western Australian government outlines as the effective expropriation of crown land usage rights as an unintended consequence of the bill; thirdly, we await the completion of key regulations, which is an issue that I wish to follow in this House; fourthly, we also want the inclusion of soil carbon in a constructive way from the outset; fifthly, we want the risk of rorting-as occurred in Europe, where there were no adequate protections, and as was reported on the front page of the Australian of 19 May 2011, only last weeksatisfactorily addressed; sixthly, we want the construction of an acceptable set of rules around permanence; seventhly, we want the construction of an acceptable set of rules around additionality; and eighthly, we want to examine any other amendments that the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report on the bills identifies. We approach these bills with a constructive heart, attitude and intent. But it is absolutely clear that at this stage there are real risks of inadvertent consequences and there are very clearly areas of great inadequacy and incompleteness. In that context I want to make a point about what we are not going to do in the House of Representatives, the people's chamber in Australia. We will not be providing a blank cheque for this legislation, having lived through the home insulation program, which we were told at the outset was predicated on the basis of, 'Trust us: we will get the detail right.' They did not get the detail right. We warned them. We set out the problems. We did it repeatedly, right throughout July, August, September, October, November and December of 2009. It is amazing how government members, no matter where they are, drop their eyes, read their papers and look rightfully ashamed at any reference to the home insulation program-at any reference to an example of failed governance on a grand scale that in and of itself should have been enough to have seen the government's commission terminated. But we go beyond that. We go beyond the Home Insulation Program to the Green Loans Program, the school halls program. On each of these occasions the government said, 'Trust us, we will get the detail right.' What has been shown is that without adequate supervision, without adequate detail, without complete scrutiny, it is not appropriate to trust this government with issues which run the risk of perverse and unintended consequences. That has been a systemic failure. Lest it be thought that this is a problem the past, in this precise area the government took three policies to the election: no carbon tax, a citizens assembly and-my favourite of them all-a cash-for-clunkers program, which we recognised within five minutes would be strangled before it saw the light of day. We were told it would be fine, that they would get the details right-and, inevitably, it was strangled before the light of day. It was the one good decision that the government have made in the last year-to listen to what we said: that a program which cost $400 million for one million tonnes of emissions reduction was a clunker in and of itself. What we see is a fundamental pattern of legislative and administrative incompetence. Against that background we hold to the principle of no blank cheque. We want to see the regulations in detail. We saw a skerrick from the parliamentary secretary today, and I thank him for that, with his release of the 'savannah burning' guidelines. But what that shows is the government is capable of producing the full range of detail and materials before this bill is addressed. It is right and proper and appropriate that we do not vote on the basis of a blank cheque. In that context, whilst we strongly support the principle, our experience has been that giving the government a blank cheque on issues such as the Home Insulation Program, the Green Loans program and school halls program-just for example-has not been rewarded with good governance in the interests of Australia, and in particular in interests of people who pay their taxes such as nurses, plumbers, shop assistants, teachers, police officers and firefighters, and expect value for money. Against that background we make this point: a great deal of the substantive elements in the bill exist within regulations and methodologies which of are yet to be seen. The experience to date, across all of the elements of this government's legislative agenda, has been, 'Show us the detail; give us the examples'and they do not exist at this point in time. For that reason I will be moving, on behalf of the opposition, an amendment in the House declining to give the bill a second reading until the regulations giving effect to the provisions of the bill are laid before the House. In that context, I move: That all words after ―That‖ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ―the House decline to give the bill a second reading until the terms of the regulations giving effect to the provisions of the bill are laid before the House‖. That is an appropriate, prudential mechanism. The reason we ask for that is the government should have nothing to hide. If there is nothing to hide, if there is nothing to worry about: provide the regulations, provide us with the detail, provide us with the elements that are missing from what is otherwise merely a skeleton. A skeleton bill without the flesh is not something that this House should lightly pass. So we support the principle, but we do not accept bad legislative practice. The detail must be provided. The regulations must be provided. The facts must be provided. And, in their absence, we will not allow the government to repeat the risks and errors of the Home Insulation Program, the Green Loans program, the school halls program and any other number of disasters that are awaiting the Australia, such as the unfolding issue of the NBN rollout. In particular, let me make this point: there are, at this stage, deep deficiencies. So a which has great potential is not yet ready. We want the detail. And if the government have nothing to hide, why would they deny the House the ability to examine the regulations? Let me repeat that: if the government have nothing to hide, if they are fully confident with their methodologies, if they are fully confident with the regulations, if they believe it is ready to go-show us the detail. If you have nothing to hide, show us the detail. Because, I say to the government, the last time you did not provide that detail, we saw the Green Loans debacle, we saw the Green Start debacle, we saw the Home Insulation Program debacle. Form fits this government as being legislatively and administratively incompetent. So that is where we stand. The coalition support biosequestration. We believe strongly in the process. As the CSIRO set out in their recent report, the potential is there, on a conservative estimate from a conservative scientific agency, for 20 per cent of our emissions to be offset over 40 years using trees; revegetation, through mallee and mulga; soil carbon; and other forms of reducing emissions-landscape and agricultural management. That is a view which is more prospective than our own estimates, but it is the view set down in writing by the CSIRO, by Dr Michael Battaglia, no less than the head of the Sustainable Agriculture Flagship of the CSIRO. His position, and the CSIRO's position, is that the very methods we have outlined as being of considerable and fundamental importance to the direct action plan offer up to 20 per cent reductions in Australia's emissions for a period of 40 years-significant, fundamental important. Against that background, this legislation also needs to be viewed within the broader context. We want the regulations and we want to see how the legislation links in bill with the proposed carbon tax. Let me remind the House that this legislation is fundamentally linked to the carbon tax and that this government went to the election with a pledge from the Prime Minister. On Monday, 16 August 2010, at the beginning of the last week of the election campaign, the Prime Minister of Australia took her policies to the people of Australia to seek a mandate upon which to govern and said on Channel 10: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' I just repeat that: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Then, on the day before the election, on election eve, on the front page of the Australian on 20 August 2010 the Prime Minister said: 'I rule out a carbon tax.' Lest there be any doubt as to what that categorical statement could possibly have meant, the government's express, clear and absolute policy was that there would be no carbon price of any form until the citizens assembly had produced a deep and lasting consensus. So the government has then tried to say, 'I was only kidding about the carbon tax; I actually meant an emissions trading scheme.' The fine print was provided by the government and that was in their climate change policy which was a citizens assembly of 150 people randomly selected from the phone book and they would need to show that there was a deep and lasting consensus. As things stand, there is no deep and lasting consensus around the government's carbon tax or around the general notion of providing an increase in prices of electricity, gas, petrol, groceries, Australian-made cars and houses, for example. Let me deal with the way in which there is and a conflict between the two approaches as evidenced by this legislation. The nature of the carbon tax is intended to increase prices. Contrary to what the government is leading Australians to believe, its goal is to increase the price of electricity. Its structure, its purpose, its intent is to drive up electricity prices in the hope that people would use less of an essential service. This fundamental idea is flawed at its very heart because, as the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of New South Wales has set out over the last five years, we have had over a 50 per cent rise in electricity prices in New South Wales but barely any change in the demand per capita. We see that electricity is one of the most fundamentally inelastic goods available to consumers and householders in Australia. It is a very similar experience in the United States and Europe. Electricity is an essential service; therefore, driving up the price simply forces people to substitute it for other goods life. For a pensioner it could be the once-amonth restaurant meal that they forgo. For a self-funded retiree it could be the gifts to grandchildren that they forgo. For a family it could be the swimming lessons for their kids that they forgo. For a small business owner it could be the expansion of the small business which they forgo. Let it be made absolutely clear that the economic history of Australia, the United States and Europe is that electricity is a largely inelastic good. In human terms that means it is an essential service and what that means in practice is that driving up the price of electricity is a tax, because people pay more but they barely change their consumption at all. I am not alleging perfect inelasticity in economic terms. I am saying that the real world history of the last 30 years",45
23,Mr HUNT,CONDOLENCES,"I will come to that, matey.",49
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES, Order! I have given the member for Flinders a great deal of latitude and debate on this bill. I think it is time we got more onto the carbon farming initiative.,49
25,Mr HUNT,CONDOLENCES,"All right, I will complete the point and follow your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. The real world history of the last 30 years is that electricity prices go up, demand barely changes, people pay more and the consequence is that their cost of living is higher and their quality of life is lower. That is what this government is proposing along with-and I just give this last simple example-an impact on Australian-made passenger vehicles. In the report prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers for Australian automotive manufacturers it was found that there would be a $412 increase in the price of Australian-made vehicles under a $30 per in their tonne carbon tax. A question for the government: how much would imported vehicles rise by? Answer: nothing. So the simple example, which I ask anybody to explain to me, is that Australian-made vehicles would rise by $412 under a $30 per tonne carbon tax, which we will get to if not in the first year, in the second, third or fourth, on its way to $50 per tonne by 2020. How can you have a $412 increase in Australian-made vehicles but nothing on imports? What is the logic, the sense, the reason or the justification for that disparity, where we punish Australian manufacturers just and reward foreign-made vehicle importers? That is the example that summarises the structural flaws in the government's entire approach. Against that background we have set out very clearly an alternative for Australia in an approach which will foster genuine carbon farming by decreasing emissions through capturing carbon on an incentives basis in soil, in our trees, in our vegetation, in other forms of landscape change, as well as in reducing emissions through cleaning up waste coalmine gas, cleaning up landfills, potentially converting some of our oldest and dirtiest power stations from the worse forms of emissions to cleaner forms of emissions, but without having an impact on electricity prices, because that would be dealt with in our program. That is the choice available. Against that set of considerations, let me give a summary. Our approach is incentives; their approach is tax. They have sought in part to adopt a measure that we are proposing in this bill. We are not opposed to the principle. We welcome the belated interest on the government side in reducing emissions through landscape carbon capture and storage. That is a good thing. But, as has been the case with the Home Insulation Program, with the Green Loans program, the Green Start program and the school halls program, if there is no detail, if there is no accountability and if there is a blank cheque, what we see is failure. We would like, ultimately, to be able to pass this legislation and we will seek to move amendments pending the outcome of the Senate report across that range of seven areas which I identified. But, right now, we ask the government to make sure that it ends the practice of hiding the detail. If you have nothing to hide, produce the regulations. If you have nothing to hide, produce the detail. If you have nothing to hide, put flesh on the skeleton. Against that background, we have moved a second reading amendment simply to ensure that the House receive the full terms of the regulations giving effect to the provisions of the bill. That is an appropriate legislative practice. We ask for those details. We ask why the government is afraid to provide them. We ask why the government has not completed its work. We support the principles, we have outlined the principles and we would like to complete this bill. In its current form, it is not ready, but give us the detail, give us the regulations and, if you will not do that, say why you are afraid to provide the details.",49
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,Is the amendment seconded?,50
27,Mr Baldwin,CONDOLENCES,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,50
28,Mr DREYFUS,CONDOLENCES,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (11:31): I rise to speak on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and cognate bills. As the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency outlined in his second reading speech, the carbon farming initiative fulfils an election commitment to give farmers, forest growers and landholders access to carbon markets. By doing so, the carbon farming initiative will create new real and lasting economic opportunities for regional communities in this country. Farmers and landholders will be financially rewarded for their actions to reduce or store carbon pollution. This is a very important step forward for regional and rural Australia. It is important for farmers and landholders and for the families and communities that are dependent on a sustainable productive and competitive agricultural sector. Australia has amongst the highest agricultural emissions of the developed countries, around 23 per cent of national emissions, but we also have significant opportunities to increase carbon storage in our landscape. The carbon farming initiative presents an opportunity for Australia to address these high emissions and for the agricultural sector to be part of the solution to climate change. This is important because the agricultural sector is likely to be one of the most strongly affected by climate change. Farmers and landholders are right to be concerned about the economic challenge that climate change will pose for their futures and Australia's food security. Notwithstanding the development of advanced farming techniques, climate change threatens to do great harm to our grain, pastoral and livestock industries. There is clear evidence that Australia's climate has already changed. Farmers have always had to live with Australia's variable weather. They are no strangers to the extremes of drought and floods and the ongoing challenges that our climate presents to agriculture. Australian farmers and landholders recognise the benefits of protecting the land because for them the land represents their greatest resource. The carbon farming initiative will create incentives to protect natural environment and adopt more sustainable farming practices as well as mitigate climate change. The practices of increasing carbon storage in agricultural soils to improve soil health and productivity, revegetation to help restore degraded landscape and protect biodiversity and tree planting to help address salinity and reduce erosion will all be rewarded under the carbon farming initiative. Today I am releasing for public comment the first methodology to go through the domestic offsets integrity committee process. I note that the member for Flinders has welcomed the release of that methodology. This methodology will allow Indigenous land managers across the remote regions of the north of Australia to earn carbon credits for improving fire management. The development of this methodology is a world first and represents a unique combination of traditional ecological knowledge, cutting edge modern science and the emerging carbon economy of the future. Projects such as that already being trialled in western Arnhem Land could save over 100,000 tonnes of carbon pollution each year and reward Indigenous landowners with $2 million to $3 million of revenue a year if they sold the credits for $20 each. These are the types of opportunities Indigenous Australians are telling us they need to benefit from the low carbon economy of the 21st century. The carbon farming initiative is not a government grant program. From the speech he has just given to the House, the member for Flinders seems to have misunderstood the nature of the carbon farming initiative almost entirely. The references and comparisons he made seemed to suggest that his understanding is that this is an initiative that might involve the expenditure of government funds in the form of grants. I stress again that our it is not a government grant program. It is not a program that relies on bureaucrats picking winners. The legislated scheme will allow sellers to deal directly with buyers and leverage the opportunities of the marketplace. Such a marketplace allows companies to invest in local land sector abatement through long-term contracts and partnerships with farmers and landholders. Markets are not new to farmers nor are many of the things which can save or store carbon, trees and soil. What farmers need is a mechanism to add value to their actions and decide whether or not to invest. Participation in the carbon farming initiative is voluntary. Farmers and landholders are free to participate if they see a way to benefit. They can also exit the scheme by handing back an equivalent number of credits if they no longer wish to be part of it. The carbon farming initiative will create a new industry for rural Australia. By 2020 the carbon farming initiative could be channelling hundreds of millions of dollars into rural communities each year. Farmers and landholders will be paid for reducing or avoiding emissions, for example, through capture and destruction of methane emissions from landfill or livestock manure, or through removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in soil or trees by, for example, growing a forest or farming in a way that increases soil carbon. By financially rewarding farmers, the carbon farming initiative will begin to unlock the significant long-term potential for land sector abatement. Just as the lack of certainty over carbon pricing stopped the long-term investment in our electricity generation sector necessary for energy security, the lack of a framework for rewarding the abatement offered by the land sector has substantially lessened the opportunity for the land sector to be part of the solution to climate change. Investment in land sector abatement needs a long-term framework for the full rewards to be delivered and for the climate to benefit. A grants based approach cannot provide any long-term certainty. That, of course, is the vice of the whole approach that the opposition has brought to this subject with so-called direct action program. The carbon farming initiative will move the land sector forward by establishing the framework for crediting savings both within and outside international accounting rules. The ability to sell credits to the domestic voluntary market and internationally also allows the carbon farming initiative to be independent of the debate over a broader carbon pricing mechanism. However, to get the most out of this legislation the government intends the carbon farming initiative to link with the carbon price, providing additional demand for abatement and a larger source of revenue for farmers and landholders. I wish to address one of the criticisms of this initiative now. The government does not accept that Australia's food producing regions and prime agricultural land are threatened by the proposed carbon price or by this carbon farming initiative. The government has excluded agricultural emissions from liability and placed significant safeguards in the carbon farming initiative. Safeguards include the additionality test, which excludes shortrotation commercial forestry and takes into account natural resource management plans. Projects with perverse outcomes will be excluded by regulation and there will be a requirement to comply with state and territory laws. I note that the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has published preliminary estimates of abatement under the initiative which assume that less than 35,000 hectares of carbon plantings would occur annually. This package of bills creates a legal framework which will provide certainty for private investment in carbon abatement. The carbon farming initiative provides a framework which is grounded in the science of climate change and provides clear economic value to actions which store or its reduce carbon pollution. I should say in relation to the observations that have just been made by the member for Flinders about supposed lack of detail, there has been very extensive consultation around a draft bill which the government published. The comments that have been received as part of that very extensive consultation have been taken into account in formulating the bills that are before the House. The government is also happy to provide further information on such matters as the indicative positive and negative lists, which are a feature of this legislation. The government is happy to provide a briefing on the indicative positive and negative lists and on other details of this carbon framing initiative to the opposition and to the crossbenchers. That is well known to those opposite. We have a problem in that the opposition has regrettably approached this legislation, as it has so much other legislation, with typical negativity, which has become its hallmark. The speech we heard from the member for Flinders, who is the opposition spokesman in this area, did not go to the detail of this legislation. This is legislation that is well worked through. It has been the subject of extensive consultation. It is entirely clear in the principles which it sets forward, and the mechanism of putting legislation before the House with regulations to follow is an entirely standard mechanism. That is the mechanism that is being followed here. What we see from those opposite is an opposition that does not wish to take meaningful action on climate change and an opposition that has no credibility in this That is regrettably reflected in the approach that it appears is being taken by those opposite in relation to the carbon farming initiative. I commend the bills to the House. Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (11:43): I rise to speak on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills. I have to say at the outset that just because it has the words 'carbon farming' in the title it does not necessarily mean that farmers will be able to gain any traction out of it. The legislation is incomplete, misleading and certainly open to distortion by the carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme. I have to say that we thoroughly support direct action and we thoroughly support carbon farming and the opportunities that it can give agriculture, but this bill is mutton dressed up as lamb. For those who are unacquainted with the phrase or are vegetarians, that really means a 50-year-old trying to dress up like a 20-year-old. The term sounds good and you would imagine the legislation is but, as the shadow minister said, there are no ground rules within this legislation. There are no fences. We do not know what we are dealing with apart from the fact that it is a carbon farming initiative bill. The Labor government want parliament to vote on a carbon farming scheme despite there being no detail and, while the coalition most definitely supports carbon farming and direct action, there are serious flaws. For example, the bill is reliant on regulations which are yet to be presented and will be done at Labor's and the Greens' pleasure. We will not support legislation that does not provide adequate detail or that leads to perverse outcomes for farmers unless, perhaps later in the Senate, the government can come up with amendments which deal with all these issues-and there are a lot of area. them. How are they going to do that when we do not know what the situation is regarding a carbon tax or an ETS in the future? Under the direct action plan, the coalition will reduce CO2 emissions through biosequestration in general and, in particular, the replenishment of our soil carbons. Under our plan, farmers will be entitled to tender for additions in soil carbon. Significantly improving soil carbons also helps soil quality, farm productivity and water efficiency and should be a national goal, regardless of the CO2 abatement benefits. However, under the government's approach, the carbon farming offsets bill will be completely skewed by the legislation that may follow. It will undoubtedly lead to the wholesale conversion of prime farming land from agriculture to trees. We do not know the details of the tax or the ETS, so how can we assess this bill on whether it can be modified to account for the impact of it? The offset bill allows for the creation of Kyoto and non-Kyoto credits. As only Kyoto credits will be recognised-in other words, eligible-for trade in an ETS, the voluntary market for non-Kyoto credits, the most attractive to farmers and the ones supported by the coalition's direct action plan, will be worthless and will collapse. Voluntary offsets are currently at about 15c per tonne on the Chicago exchange. Under an ETS with a fixed carbon price the CPI, like managed investment schemes, will skew the market in favour of trees which will be shut up and can never be harvested.",50
29,Mr MCCormack,CONDOLENCES,"You can't eat pine trees! Mr JOHN COBB: You cannot export them in the ground either. The current legislation introduced into the parliament following the recent consultation paper on the CFI highlights the endemic lack of policy skills in the current government. While the bill introduced into parliament does attempt to address the financial additionality clause-'additionality'; that's a new one-it seems the government has learnt little from the consultation process. Perhaps the consultation process gives us some clues as to why this bill is totally inadequate, as it stands, for dealing with this issue. I am amazed that a bill that is supposed to provide opportunities to farmers only had consultation opportunities in capital cities. That may be okay for the green lobby groups but, in case the government has not noticed, there are not many farms in capital cities. This is symptomatic of Labor's failure to turn rhetoric into good, positive policy and substantive action. There needs to be much more certainty in this legislation before we can even consider it. The absence of key information is extremely concerning. Farmers and regional communities deserve some answers before this legislation is considered. There are still no positive and negative lists-what is in and what is out-for carbon activities. How do we ensure that Labor does not rule out all the good offset opportunities through regulation? It will have the Greens, who are in power, also pushing. How can we pass a blank cheque, as the shadow minister said? If we do this we are passing a blank cheque, which will then give Labor and the Greens an opportunity to decide the future of agriculture. At Senate estimates, officials confirmed there is not yet a definition of 'common farming practice'. This is a very important issue. We are also told that what is deemed as common practice in farming may well be determined on a region-by-region basis. Yet the department could not say how this would work and what size the regions would be. In other words, they do not have a clue. They have not even set their minds to it. We know that without the detail on common practice the Greens and others will move to exclude farming practices and ensure tree planting that closes down agriculture is the only option for farmers. Anything that has been done once could be deemed as common farming practice and therefore excluded from the provisions, and so excluded will be the opportunity for farmers to make a buck when the rest of the community demands something. In this case, a minority government demands something. We have no idea yet what the methodologies for carbon abatement are going to be. There is a major imbalance in the methodologies. What exists for tree planting assistance needs to be given to the farming sector to develop methodologies for genuine farm carbon abatement activity to help meet the rigorous requirements of the offsets integrity scheme. Another concern is the duration of abatements. The 100-year life of credits also gives rise to problems when carbon stores are prematurely disturbed by natural on nonnatural events, where proponents are required to re-establish or regenerate the carbon store or relinquish carbon credits. Over a 100-year life cycle it is highly probable that carbon stores will be affected by an event which releases the carbon store, leaving the proponent liable for them. Those wishing to take part may be unaware of the long-term implications of signing up for these abatements so there needs to be an education program for those wishing to participate, advising on pitfalls and the implications of 100-year offsets. Farmers have a history of signing up for schemes, such as certain banks did 20 or 30 years ago in offshore money, and they came a cropper on it. I am not going to vote for something that does not make these things clear. I am not going to vote for something unless-and this is the biggest if in the parliament-they can come up with amendments to take care of all these concerns. We are not going to give a blank cheque to the Green-Labor alliance to decide the future of farming. There is no detail on any such education program from the government. Further, ABARES says its work on the CFI is due next month, after the legislation is supposed to be voted on. That will be handy! How can the government and stakeholders consider important data from ABARES when the study commissioned by the government is not complete. Perhaps the government does not want us to see it. The government arrogantly expects us to deal with this legislation before we have understanding at all of how it will be quantified or any impacts it will have on agricultural sector. I am sure the farmers in the Hunter will be thrilled to know that the studies being done on their behalf will be made available after the legislation becomes fact. Labor's plan will cause the wholesale transfer of food production land to trees in Australia's best farming areas-trees which cannot be harvested in any form. We will see big companies coming into regional communities, buying up highly productive farmland-for example, in the Hunter Valley or Gippsland-and shutting it up for trees. This is much worse than commercial forestry as no employment will be required, and the flow-on impacts of job losses will be huge. With a global population predicted to be nine billion people by 2050 the world will need more food, and Australia is well placed to provide it. We do not want to become the carbon tip of the world so that other countries can continue to prosper. Let us not make any mistake: we believe in the opportunities, particularly for marginal land, to take advantage of this type of situation. We believe in direct action but we do not believe in an open cheque to allow Australia's best farmland to no longer be productive. A leaked CSIRO report featured in the Sydney Morning Herald claims that a carbon price of $36 a tonne is likely to see the whole lower Murray-Darling Basin converted to trees, starting with a carbon price as low as $11 a tonne. That needs to be out in the public for consideration before the bill is considered. Tree planting is good and there has to be a place for it in the direct action plan, but there must also be appropriate controls to ensure that large tracts of good food-producing land are not lost for it. Australia is a big country and there is plenty of scope to plant trees in marginal any country where farming is less viable and where there are co-environmental benefits in the relation to salinity, erosion and woody weeds. Tree-planting has a place if there is a mosaic reafforestation that is compatible with farming. But this legislation does not address those issues. This is a blank cheque. After the consultation process, Labor has said that, in the interests of local communities and the nation's future food security, food-producing land will be protected and issues such as interception from forestry will be addressed. We have heard all this before, though, in relation to the Basin Plan, where I think the current government policy is not just affecting farmers. Like this legislation it has the ability to totally devastate farming communitieswholesale. The government say they consider the economic and social impacts of their actions, but they are playing games and only paying lip service to these issues. In the Basin Plan the government said that removing a third of our irrigation would result in the loss of only 800 jobs. They do not care for agriculture. When they bought Toorale Station at Bourke, that was a hundred jobs in one hit, and all they bought was 13,000 megalitres. They do not care for agriculture and would like to see Australia become the carbon tip of the world, with large multinationals buying land which is cheap by world standards and taking it out of production while they continue to pollute. I do not trust this government to get it right. They have made so many mistakes with so much taxpayers' money in 3½ short yearsin fact, in about 2½ years they ran up a bigger net bill than Hawke and Keating could run up in 14 years. Why would we want to hand a blank cheque to Labor and the Greens to decide the future of farming? I will reserve my final judgment until the Senate hands down its report but, as it stands, this bill is most definitely not in the interests of rural communities.",54
30,Mr HUSIC,CONDOLENCES," The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills are an important measure for moving Australia towards the new low-emissions economy. They are part of a range of measures that the government has announced and will introduce in coming years in order to meet our international obligations, to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. Under the Kyoto protocol, Australia's target is to limit greenhouse gas emissions over the first commitment period to 108 per cent of the levels they were in 1990. That means our emissions need to be just eight per cent more than they were 19 years ago. Carbon farming will be an instrumental initiative in helping achieve the targets that have been set. These bills will create the incentive for the land sector to adapt their land use methods to unlock abatement opportunities and will provide them with the opportunity to generate and invest in saleable carbon credits. While the move towards a low-emissions economy presents a number of challenges for the land sector, who currently account for 23 per cent of Australia's emissions, this bill opens the door for farmers, forest growers and landowners to access domestic and international carbon markets. That is something I want to reflect on later, demonstrating something that has been done quite uniquely in Western Sydney to contribute to this overall effort. In its submission to the Senate inquiry which examined the impact of this bill, the National Farmers Federation gave its in-principle support: The NFF has always stated its broad support of the concept and intent of the CFI. Despite the uncertainties that abound in the area of carbon mitigation, the progress of the CFI demonstrates the positive role agriculture can play in mitigating against carbon emissions through on-farm management. The submission went on to say: The Government deserves credit for listening to the farm sector and modifying its proposal to ensure that genuine abatement opportunities under the CFI are not unnecessarily overlooked. The bill fulfils Labor's commitment to having legislation in place by 1 July this year in order to provide certainty to those who have previously invested in abatement projects or those who are looking to invest in the near future. When the opposition party room decided to do an about-face on the issue of climate change and backed away from its agreement with the government to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a number of projects previously supported by the Greenhouse Friendly program jeopardised. Among these were forest sequestration and landfill waste projects. The Australian Landfill Owners Association, in their submission to the Senate inquiry, said: ALOA supports the introduction of the Carbon Farming Initiative Bills. Over the last four months the landfill industry has worked co-operatively with the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to develop methodologies for the landfill component of the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI). The industry is keen for the scheme to start as soon as practicable, and the proposed date of July 1st is firmly supported. Later, they said: ALOA therefore encourages implementation of the Carbon Farming Initiative to provide the certainty required for landfill operators to invest in new or additional landfill gas capturing equipment. The extent and simplicity of the available abatement will make this scheme an outstanding success and was the reason for our early press release on the 9th of February which was followed up on March 25th … One particular submission received by the inquiry which I was most interested in was from the not-for-profit environmental charity Greenfleet, who since 1997 have established 450 forests and planted over 6.8 million native trees to offset the carbon emissions of our motor vehicles. Their submission pointed out: Greenfleet‘s approach to carbon forest projects was approved under the former Greenhouse Friendly™ standard and Greenfleet brings significant expertise as one of the few organisations in Australia with direct experience in establishing and managing biodiverse forests for carbon offsets. They went on to say: Greenfleet supports the CFI as it will allow accreditation and recognition of additional Australian biodiverse forest sink abatement. Furthermore it will overcome the current situation whereby overseas abatement is recognised in were Australia but local abatement is not. It is certainly a pressing point that at present we have no domestic credits-I repeat: no domestic credits whatsoever-for Australian companies to buy until this bill is passed. Significantly, the bill allows for backdating of credits to 1 July 2010 to account for those projects which had previously relied on the Greenhouse Friendly scheme, provided that they meet the new standard and have appropriately measured the abatement. An important part of this group of bills is the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill, which will provide a legislative framework for the registry, which the early was established under Commonwealth executive powers in September 2009 to meet one of Australia's commitments under the Kyoto protocol. The registry is an electronic system which is used to ensure accurate accounting of the issuance, holding, transfer, acquisition, cancellation, retirement and carry-over of emissions units under the Kyoto protocol. Since the registry opened in September 2009, organisations and individuals have been able to apply to open accounts and participate in the domestic and international trade of Kyoto units. The bill will allow the government to modify the registry so that it can track the location and ownership of the units under the Carbon Farming Initiative and meet our ongoing obligations under the Kyoto protocol. The registry would then be maintained by the administrator of the CFI in order to avoid any duplication in account opening and operating procedures as well as to keep implementation and transaction costs down. For the reasons I have just outlined, the Australian National Registry of Emission Units Bill is necessary to support the Carbon Farming Initiative and to allow persons to trade in credits. I am confident that these bills will help tie together the good work that so many people-individuals, groups, corporations, volunteers and professionals-are currently doing to minimise and abate their carbon footprints. I want to take this opportunity to highlight other actions being taken by local communities in Western Sydney to help play their part in offsetting carbon emissions by establishing their own carbon forests. Back in March, I, along with the member for Greenway-and I note her presence in the House-had the great pleasure of attending a special event, a ceremony to mark the completion of the Regenesis project and the launch of the Regenesis Toolkit at Mujar Bija Reserve in Blacktown, in an area that I grew up in. The Regenesis project grew from a partnership between a city council and a regional counterpart-between Blacktown City Council and Liverpool Plains Shire Council-made possible through a $2 million grant from the NSW Environmental Trust. During the life of the project, which spanned three years, 220,000 native plants across 100 hectares of land in 33 biodiverse carbon forests have been grown in line with the carbon trading requirements established under the Kyoto protocol. It secured this impressive achievement by engaging business, land managers and agencies such as catchment management authorities, as well as community members and organisations. Ten of the forests are privately owned, 21 are council owned and two are on crown land. The Regenesis project is a cleverly conceived and executed project-the first of its kind for local government in New South Wales, perhaps even Australia. I have no doubt that this project could be the blueprint for other local governments and that it can ultimately help set up the trading of carbon to offset certificates through carbon emissions trading schemes. I hasten to add that it is not an emissions trading scheme, but it can provide a model for planning and planting reafforestation projects to create revenue for landholders to set up and maintain native vegetation. It is a powerful combination of commercial benefit with environmental gain, particularly in Western Sydney, where we are working so hard to preserve in an active way so many elements of Cumberland Plain woodland and bushland that have been slowly eroded through the development of Sydney. I note that in 2008 various emissions trading schemes and markets combined to form an industry worth more than $118 million. The Regenesis program got communities and businesses to team up and work to supporting improved biodiversity-and sequestering carbon. Over three years community, school, religious and business groups attended 99 community treeplanting events on Regenesis sites throughout the City of Blacktown, some events attended by as many as 200 individuals. Blacktown City Council has done a tremendous job in this regard by advertising these tree-planting events, encouraging the community to get involved, planting trees and actively making an improvement in our environmental contribution and also creating green space amongst our built space. In the Liverpool Plains shire, 10 landowners partnered with Regenesis to plant locally native carbon forests on their land. All of these Regenesis initiatives provided local environmental benefits, including erosion control. So it is not just about a project trying to address carbon emissions as they have achieved other important environmental objectives including improved soil quality and creek health, reduced soil salinity, creation of windbreaks and shelter for grazing stock as well as enhanced biodiversity through increased habitat. I was particularly pleased about the work at Mujar Bija reserve because it saw the rehabilitation and enhanced used of land that had once been a disused brickworks site. I can testify, as one who had much skin grazed off my knees as I grew up in that area, that what became a bike park used by local teenagers close to Mitchell High School has now been transformed into a local forest that is a tremendous asset to the Blacktown City Council area. We often hear from those who are only concerned with fear campaigns about how expensive life will become under this new low-emissions future. They play on the unfounded belief that people from lower socio-economic areas, like the areas that I am proud to represent in Chifley, are not concerned at all about the environment and will therefore oppose such measures. Not only are the people of Chifley concerned for the environment; they are actively working at reducing and abating their impact. Now other communities and local government areas are being encouraged to get involved, with the City of Blacktown and the Liverpool Plains Shire Council launching the Regenesis Toolkit, as I mentioned earlier. It is providing a very useful guide to establishing locally native mixed species of carbon forests in urban and rural environments. I was particularly struck by the sense of community that it has helped foster amongst those involved. To quote the words of 12-year-old Jamison talking about his role as one of the first seven members of the new Tregear Reserve Bushcare Group, established in the electorate in October 2008 as a result of the first Regenesis & Try Bushcare planting day: ""It's awesome. I like planting the trees. We do that cos it helps nature. I love digging the holes. The other people in our Bushcare Group help me when I ask. It is good teamwork. When I grow up, I want to be a gardener."" I congratulate him and the community of Tregear for their involvement in this project. It is a landmark project that is setting the standard for other communities. I congratulate them for the positive impact that they have made on their local environment. The government owes it to the people of Australia, who are doing their bit to abate carbon emissions, to pass these bills to provide the formal mechanism for converting this work into useful carbon credits available to Australian businesses to invest in. I wholeheartedly commend these bills to the House.",56
31,Mr TEHAN,CONDOLENCES," As I rise to speak on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011, I would like to state at the outset that to me the key component of this bill is to make sure that the government is not introducing a scheme which will artificially distort markets in respect of agricultural land use or impose barriers on food and fibre productivity output. That is the key test for this bill: what is the government seeking to do? If it is seeking to change land use away from productive purposes then this bill either needs serious amending or should not be supported at all. On the weekend I went to a farm near Beaufort of 6,000 acres in what is prime sheep and cropping country. Three thousand acres of that property had trees put on it. That should not have happened. The land is not suitable for that. There are some areas that are suitable for trees to be grown on but there are some areas that are not suitable. But there is a scheme that distorts land use and it has led to large areas of agricultural land being put to trees. So what we have is a small businessman, a farmer, having bought those 6,000 acres, now having to spend a considerable amount of money on uprooting all those trees, burning them and trying to put that land back to productive use. As he goes about doing that he will have to go into debt. He is doing that because he believes that in the future there will be a need for Australian food and fibre. I take my hat off to him and his family for doing that because there are going to be global shortages of food and fibre and we have to make sure that we do everything we can to maximise the efficient use of our land. You do not do that by distorting the way that land is used. You let the market dictate how that land should be used. So if this bill way seeks to distort land use I will have considerable concern about it. That is why I am very worried that the bill has been introduced without us seeing any of the regulations, because the regulations will hold the key to whether this will be land distorting or not. I will go to three or four points on this matter. Natural resource management plans will be a key component, and we have to make sure that these natural resource management plans are done on a regional basis because we have to ensure that the impacts on regional communities, water and biodiversity are taken into consideration when plans are put in place to dictate land use. At the moment the bill dictates that the minister will have ultimate control over regional land use. To me, this is dangerous. A minister sitting in Canberra dictating what regional land use policy should or should not be is the wrong way around. Those organisations on the ground who know intimately the resources in their areas should be the ones who are dictating. The Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority recommended in its submission on the design of the Carbon Farming Initiative: … Regional NRM bodies (eg CMAs in Victoria) should be provided with sufficient resources to develop the appropriate ―natural resource management plan‖ that would involve regional decision making on land use planning and priorities. This plan would take into account environmental, water and biodiversity impacts in determining the applicability of eligible activities to appropriate subregions. I support this idea wholeheartedly. It is important because currently in Victoria there are no state regulatory requirements for farm zoned land that would need to be assessed as part of any approval process for the CFI, so in any potential impacts of the carbon offset projects would not be assessed on a state or a regional basis. Notwithstanding the coverage of the scheme, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency may exclude projects that could have significant adverse impacts on water availability, food production, local communities and conservation of biodiversity or employment. These impacts may be in, or in the vicinity of, the project area or any of the project areas for that kind of project. The intention is that 'the vicinity' may be interpreted broadly, including water resources availability in associated catchments. This is all good in theory, but it is the minister who has the ultimate say; it is not the regional communities. And it is the regional communities that should have the say. They should be resourced to put the plans together and they should then be asked to provide advice to the minister. There are also issues with this bill regarding the international dimension. There is uncertainty about the international rules that Australia will be operating under-for example, whether Australia will include additional land management activities such as forest management towards future mitigation commitments. For the first commitment period under the Kyoto protocol, between 2008 and 2012, some of the land sector forestry activities such as management of forests, crop lands and grazing land are voluntary. That is article 3, at point 4. This means that countries can decide if they will elect to take on additional commitments for the sector. Australia has chosen not to include emissions or removals from any article 3(4) activities and hence has not elected to be subject to article 3(4). means that actions to increase soil carbon or reduce logging sit outside accounting for Australia's Kyoto target for the first commitment period. What are we doing for the second commitment period? I will use this opportunity to ask: what are we trying to do to get some international movement in the whole area of climate change? We seem to have completely gone to sleep at the wheel with our diplomatic initiatives to get any future international action in this area. The more we focus domestically on introducing this insidious carbon tax, the less we seem to be doing internationally to get international agreement so that the globe moves forward. So I use this opportunity to ask the government to get back on track with focusing on where the international negotiations are and to make clear what its policy will be for the second commitment period in this area. While uncertainty lies around that, this bill remains something that we on this side will not be able, in all good conscience, to support. There is also the issue of permanency. While acknowledging the importance of permanency, my view is that it should be treated in a flexible manner in order to properly promote abatement. Just saying that we are going to lock areas away for 100 years seems completely nonsensical to me. If we get more carbon abatement from growing timber in the first 30 years, why then after those 30 years should we not be able to harvest that timber and then start again, replanting and locking timber away for another 30 years? The idea that we should just lock something away for 100 years and not look to get any productive output from it just seems completely nonsensical to me. It also goes back to the key component that I mentioned at the start that what we want to see in this Carbon Farming Initiative is that This government is going to encourage the productive use of agricultural land and not impose barriers on food and fibre productive output. Also, what we need to see-and once again it is not clearly spelt out in the legislation as it was put to us today-is what the actual compliance costs are going to be to our farmers. Are we going to reach a situation where the offsets and the benefits that the farmers will get will be outweighed by the compliance costs of measuring the offsets? What will be the cost to the farmers of the on-farm auditing? How onerous will it be? How much paperwork will be involved? How much red tape will be involved? None of this is clearly spelt out in this bill. Given that this government has increased compliance-cost red tape in the four years that it has been in power, we need some serious statements from the government that the compliance and administrative costs to farmers of participating in this program will not outweigh the benefits of doing the right thing by putting more carbon in soil, or by other measures they undertake. I would also like to see what this legislation will mean for biochar and biomass. For a start we need to see greater work on research into options such as biochar for carbon sequestration. Biochar is a stable form of charcoal produced from heating natural organic materials in a hightemperature, low-oxygen process. In some cases biochar can remain stable in soil for hundreds or thousands of years. So biochar is an important use of technology that recognises that carbon is not a negative factor in our environment but actually enriches the land. Biochar could be used to enrich soil, simultaneously improving soil productivity and storing carbon. What will this legislation do to continue to help us to encourage the use of biochar and biomass as a way of getting more carbon into our soil? I will be looking to the regulations to ensure that it is going to benefit our efforts to increase our biochar and biomass industries. In summing up on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011, what we have before us is not a bad idea in principle. As a matter of fact it is pretty much a carbon copy of the ideas of our direct action plan, which the coalition put forward at the last election. But, sadly, like everything this government does, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. From where it stands now it is a bit of an unmitigated disaster. We have no regulations before us. We have no faith that this government could implement anything, and yet we have to come in here now and speak on this bill in blind faith. Well, on behalf the farmers in my electorate, I cannot give this government the benefit of the doubt on anything. We have been bitten too many times. For this bill, it will be a matter of waiting to see what the regulations are, what the Senate report comes out with, and looking at what I think will need to be significant amendments that will be necessary to make this a working document. Then we can decide which way we need to go. But as it stands now I have grave, grave, grave reservations about this bill.",59
32,Dr LEIGH,CONDOLENCES," Once upon a time in a country far, far away a world leader stood up and discussed three environmental challenges that faced the world: acid rain, the hole in the ozone layer and greenhouse gases. The first, a nation solved through an innovative approach, an approach the member for Flinders championed in his honours thesis. It was a market based approach, which was the same market based approach George Bush Snr put into place, that made companies pay for the privilege of putting noxious gases into the air. The results of market based mechanisms tend to be better than are envisaged by policy makers at the outset. Industries put in place innovative solutions to ensure that the economic cost is minimised and the environmental problem is solved. The second of those problems-the hole in the ozone layer-was resolved through nations being good global citizens, acting in the knowledge that other nations were acting, as well. That process culminated in the Montreal protocol and has seen the hole in the ozone layer gradually shrink over recent decades. On the last challenge, this leader in a land far, far away, Margaret Thatcher, pledged to make drastic cuts to her nation's greenhouse gas emissions and set up a centre for research. Thanks to the work of centres such of as the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, there is a consensus among climate scientists that dangerous climate change is occurring and that dangerous carbon pollution is the cause. Yet many of those opposite continue to be silenced by those who do not accept the scientific evidence. The Minister for Climate Change has on many occasions put on record the comments of the sceptics opposite. Indeed, yesterday, on the very day the Climate Commission was meeting in this building to outline the scientific consensus, the likes of Senators Joyce and Macdonald were in Senate estimates challenging the Bureau of Meteorology on climate change. Anthropogenic climate change is of course backed by the Australian Academy of Sciences, the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the vast majority of climate scientists. Yet there are many in the coalition party room who still cannot accept the overwhelming scientific evidence. If the Leader of the Opposition is the political love child of John Howard and the member for MCKellar, then Margaret Thatcher would surely be his political godmother. Yet Margaret Thatcher accepted the scientific evidence for climate change as far back as the 1980s. The UK Conservatives-the political cousins of those opposite-have accepted there is no debate about the science of climate change and the necessity of acting. The British Tories have accepted this. They are using a market based approach to secure the environmental future of Britain and the globe. The bill before the House is part of the government's commitment to act on dangerous climate change to secure our future so that future generations can continue to enjoy our golden soil and wealth for toil. A creed of the farming sector is to ensure that farmers leave the land in better shape than that in which they inherited it. Our farmers are some of the most passionate advocates for environmental protection. The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill creates opportunities for farmers, foresters and landholders to access carbon markets and help to reduce emissions. We know that Australians are among the highest per capita emitters in the developed world. We also have among the highest agricultural emissions. Protecting biodiversity, regenerate landscapes, improving soil quality through increased carbon storage and helping to address salinity through tree planting are just some of the opportunities available to Australia's Farmers. Some of these things are not new, but this bill will help us to drive innovation, to find better ways of using our agricultural and land assets to reduce our emissions. The bill will help us to create a market for carbon permits and provide investment certainty. Credits will be given for every tonne of carbon stored. Schemes will need to go through an approval process that will ensure the integrity of the abatement being undertaken. We are balancing regulatory simplicity with environmental integrity. Projects will need to be recognised. The offset methodology will need approval. Projects will need to be done in accordance with the approved methodology and any other eligibility requirements. Once project managers have reported on the projects, they will be issued with Australian carbon credit units, or ACCUs. These units can be used to offset emissions or can be traded on the market. To ensure the integrity of the abatement, an expert committee, the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, has been established to make sure we get real and verifiable abatement. Other elements of the design of the scheme to ensure the integrity of credits include issuing credits after the sequestration or emissions reduction has actually occurred; tracking credits through a central national registry-that is included in the registry bill; transparency provisions, including the publication of a wide range of information about approved projects; appropriate enforcement provisions to address non-compliance; and a robust auditing scheme based on the National Greenhouse helping to and Energy Reporting System. The scheme has received backing from a range of organisations. CSIRO experts told the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts looking at the bill: … industry and community individuals and groups as well as the private sector have much to offer in terms of innovative ideas on greenhouse gas abatement. Carbon Neutral said: This initiative has the potential to drive funding into rural communities, increase green collar and improve the natural environment whilst simultaneously contributing to domestic climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. Greenfleet, who have established 450 forests and planted more than 6.8 million native trees since 1997, said: We believe that carbon forestry projects are unlikely to displace high-value agricultural production on the nation's most productive soils. We believe that carbon forestry projects are and will remain peripheral to prime agricultural production and in fact may improve, but not replace, sophisticated farming systems. The scheme is also backed by the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, named after William Wentworth, whose name seems to crop up quite frequently on the science based side of the climate change debate. Today the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change announced that Indigenous land managers across remote regions will be able to earn carbon credits through improving fire management under the government's carbon farming initiative. The methodology is a world first and represents a unique combination of traditional Indigenous ecological knowledge, cutting edge modern science and the substantial economic potential that is emerging in carbon markets as governments around the world take action on climate change. This world action is also reflected in part of these bills today. The Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011 is part the government's commitment under the Kyoto protocol. The registry will help ensure accurate accounting of emissions, consistent with the Kyoto protocol. But those opposite continue to deride action on climate change. They miss the fact that the world is moving. They miss the fact that 32 countries now have emissions trading jobs schemes. They miss the fact that India and China, despite having far lower emissions per capita than Australia, are making substantial investments in renewable energy. They miss the fact that the UK, as part of the European Union, is engaged in emissions trading. At the same time, we are listening to the economists just as we are listening to the scientists. We are recognising the benefits of market based mechanisms over command and control. I think it is often recognised in this place that there is an overwhelming consensus among scientists, but the overwhelming consensus among economists is sometimes missed. Allow me to quote from two senior economics professors. John Quiggin wrote in his blog on 10 May: I had a call from a local business organization asking if I would talk at a breakfast about the carbon tax to be held in a few weeks. The date was fine, so I said yes, then came the kickerthey wanted an economist on each side of the issue. The organizer said they had plenty of economists willing to speak for the tax, but they couldn't find any willing to speak against it. I gamely offered to present the case for an emissions trading scheme as opposed to a tax (even though, at the moment, I lean to a tax). But they wanted an actual opponent of any kind of carbon price, who was also an economist. This has proved to be impossible, which is pretty impressive testimony to the quality of the Queensland economics profession, and to the underappreciated fact that economists are among the strongest supporters of good environmental policy. Joshua Gans, currently at Melbourne Business School and shortly moving to the University of Toronto-Canada's gain and Australia's loss, I have to say-wrote on the website of The Drum on 7 April: Sadly, there are plenty of people who aren't climate change scientists who are comfortable disbelieving the general consensus from climate change scientists. But perhaps it is more disturbing when peopleespecially politicians-ignore or deny the evidence on how to actually achieve lower emissions. Why is that more disturbing? Because it could be that politicians want to actually reduce emissions but instead advocate policies that are likely to do the opposite. Of course, when I am talking of advocating opposite policies I am talking mainly, but not exclusively, of the Federal Opposition. What they want to do is take direct action. It's not big on specifics but it will cost a lot of money ($10 billion plus) and will award that money to people who claim they are going to do good things in reducing emissions. Joshua Gans goes on to say: It is ironic that on climate change policy, politics are in the bizarro-world where the supposedly anti-market Greens side with Hayek while the supposedly pro-market Coalition sides with Lenin. The economic evidence strongly suggests that the Greens policies match their goals while the reverse is true can't parse the dual hypotheses that either the Coalition just deny economic evidence or that they actually want more emissions and handouts to business. Perhaps one of their number can enlighten us. Finally, I want to go to the amendment moved by the member for Flinders. As I have noted in my speech, the government's legislation will create new, real and lasting economic opportunities for communities. Stakeholders in the land sector are desperate for a mechanism to credit their actions to reduce and store carbon pollution. Farmers and landholders want access to carbon markets worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year for regional and rural Australia. But the coalition are currently holding them back. With the amendment moved today, the member for Flinders has essentially told farmers that the coalition wants to delay the farmers from receiving these benefits. He is signalling that the coalition would rather play politics than support farmers. Farmers and landholders want politicians to end the gamesmanship so that they can know the framework that they will be working under. They want us to resolve the detail and put in place a framework that measures the savings that they are making. There has been extensive consultation on this initiative over a number of years. It builds on the work of other offset mechanisms. Let us look at what key groups like the National Farmers Federation submitted to the House inquiry. They said: The legislation addresses NFF concerns around potential perverse outcomes in relation to food production, water, local communities, environment and biodiversity as well as reduces some of the uncertainty and administrative costs surrounding crediting periods, reporting timeframes and offsets compliance. for the Coalition. I They also said: the government deserves credit for listening to the farm sector and modifying its proposals to ensure that genuine abatement opportunities under the CFI are not unnecessarily overlooked. The government's carbon farming initiative is based on the science of climate change but developed with a key focus on practicality. The department is releasing over the next regional few weeks a number of the first detailed methodologies showing in practical terms how particular landholders can put projects together. We have been consulting extensively on the regulations to establish the positive and negative lists. We will be providing details of those lists shortly. The regulations deal with technical matters required to be based on independent advice from the Domestic Offset Integrity Committee. It is essential to the credibility and value of the offsets credit that are created by the initiative. The coalition's amendment is for a scheme in which the activities added and credited are based on politics rather than science. That approach has not credibility in carbon markets and no credibility in the community. The government calls on the coalition to stop playing politics and to support the government's efforts to reward farmers who are taking action on climate change. In closing, I observe the scientists often note, climate change can be dominated by tipping points-sudden moments like the melting of polar icecaps, at which point the progress of climate change, the warming, becomes more rapid. Perhaps the best example of a tipping point was the Leader of the Opposition's one-vote ousting of the member for Wentworth as the Leader of the Liberal Party in 2009. That tipping point moved us from a path on which the coalition were, as they had been in the 2007 federal election, advocating market based mechanisms supported by sensible conservatives around the globe. That moved us into a bizarro world in which the current Leader of the Opposition advocates command and control policies, policies unsupported by serious scientists or serious economists. That tipping point has left the Australian debate over carbon pricing well adrift from what you see in mainstream debates all around the globe. Even when I go into schools in my electorate I find young children in Australia deeply concerned by the lack of willingness to act on climate change and deeply concerned at the fact that at the moment carbon pollution is free and that the opposition is attempting to block the government's sensible and practical move to put a price on carbon pollution.

33,Mr TRUSS,CONDOLENCES," The coalition have been active supporters of carbon farming initiatives for many years. Implemented correctly, carbon farming initiatives can help to sequester or abate carbon and address concerns arising from global CO2 emission increases. They can also deliver a new income source for farmers but also deliver broader environmental objectives, including improved water quality and reduced salinity and erosion. They can promote biodiversity and regenerate landscapes as well as improve sad fact that, as productivity. Carbon farming was a key ingredient of the coalition's direct action plan, and still is. We highlighted the potential for carbon farming. We demonstrated its practical ability to deliver results. We announced a direct path to fund real action to make sure that the initiatives put in place delivered broader results. Farmers have been saying for as long as anyone can remember that the climate is changing. They have noticed the differences in the weather cycles and often comment about how things are not the way that they used to be. It is true that most of them are sceptical about the doomsday predictions of the so-called experts. They certainly strongly oppose Labor's carbon tax and CPRS. They say quite bluntly that they cannot see how a new tax or a trading scheme can change the temperature. They are angry with the Prime Minister, who did not tell the truth before the election about her intentions in relation to the carbon tax. They do not trust the government. They despair that Labor does not respect the vital role that agriculture plays in assuring our food supply and at the cavalier approach that it takes to protecting and supporting our nation's food security. The carbon farming initiative can be a win-win. It can meet the expectations of those who want to address concerns about global warming. And it can help farmers to improve productivity and profitability and help improve our environment. But these bills are fundamentally flawed and cannot be supported at this time. They are quite lengthy bills. But most of the fundamental detail will be revealed only in the regulations. And the previous speaker acknowledged that the regulations have not even be drafted. This will be the world's first nationally legislated transport, carbon farming initiative. Attempts to implement farm carbon trading in places in Europe and even in Australia have failed in the past. The Chicago Climate Exchange closed late last year. There is no example anywhere in the world, no international experience or proven model, for this legislation. But this parliament is being asked to vote for the bill without even seeing the regulations, without even knowing how it is going to work. The House of Representatives are being asked to vote on the bill before the Senate have even reported. The Senate have received a lot of information, raising significant concerns about how this legislation would actually work, but the House of Representatives have not been given the opportunity to even see the Senate committee's report. We are being asked to vote on and deal with this issue right now. And this is happening in an atmosphere where the government have no credibility in this area. Their carbon tax and their emissions trading scheme have been onagain, off-again, on-again. Indeed this bill does not stand alone; it presupposes there will be a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Yet we do not have the legislation to deal with that either. Farmers are concerned that they have been let down by the Labor government in the past and now they are being asked to trust the government with the regulations at some stage in the future on the understanding that Labor and the Greens will put together a deal that will not shaft the Australian farming sector. Frankly, farmers do not have that confidence. Labor have not won their confidence because they have not behaved honourably in the past. We have been told by the Prime Minister that farmers will be excluded from Labor's carbon tax. But they will have to pay much more for fuel, fertilisers, chemicals, manufacturing and machinery, and the processing of their products. All that is going to add to their costs. Indeed, I note that in New Zealand, where farmers are exempt in that country's scheme, the local dairy industry are saying that they already pay $2,700 a year extra and that they expect the cost for every dairy farmer in New Zealand to rise to $17,450 by 2015. That is from a farming sector that is exempt. Can we believe a government that say they are going to exempt farmers when they also said that there would be no carbon tax in the first place? They have no credibility. Farmers do not trust Labor and the extreme Greens to honour their promises to exclude agriculture let alone to deliver a new carbon farming initiative which treats them fairly. The only reason that Labor are not imposing these penalties on farmers now is that they know it is technically impracticable to measure emissions. It cannot be done, and that is the finding of nearly every country in the world. But as soon as Labor find a way, even if it is done slapdash, there is not much doubt that they will want to make sure that farmers are included in their tax. Surely farmers have a right to see what is being proposed before being asked to vote. This is an initiative about farming but most of the consultation has occurred in the cities. There has been little willingness to take on board the concerns of practical people involved in industry. Soil carbon stocks currently are estimated at about 2.3 trillion tons-that is, three times the amount of CO2 that is in the atmosphere. The Rodale Institute says that regenerative agriculture globally has the potential to sequester up to 40 per cent of the world's CO2 emissions. This is important. This is potentially a significant initiative. Carbon farming techniques like the use of biochar, no-till farming, changed grazing practices, perennial pastures, feral animal management, new genetics that produce plants that sequester more carbon and plantstones on sugar cane and a whole range of other products offer real potential. There are many reasons that Australian farmers will not participate in this scheme. The first issue concerns the introduction by the government of the word 'additionality' into this. Unless what farmers are doing is additional to what is happening at the present time, it does not count; it has to be extra to normal practice. Things like no-till farming and perennial pastures et cetera are common practice, so farmers will not get credit for things that they can actually do to deliver real results. It cannot be something that is already normal practice within their farming operations. It all has to be extra. So only the risky ideas will be left-the things that are not proven-for farmers to be able to participate. The scheme will be incredibly bureaucratic and will take days and days of office work to register something for the scheme. In addition to that, farmers have to sign up for 100 years-that is, three to four generations. What new techniques might come along in 100 years? What new varieties will there be? What things will be done better than they are being done now? Farmers will be locked in for 100 years. There may be new ways to address climate change. Surely over 100 years we are going to make some progress, but farmers will be locked in for a hundred years. I have not yet heard of a forest that has not been burnt or flooded once in a hundred years, but farmers have to take responsibility for keeping fires and pestilence-for example, myrtle rust or whatever other diseases might come into the country-out of their farming operations for a hundred years. The Kyoto commitment is about to expire. What is going to happen next? It is quite clear that other nations are showing no interest in being involved in trading schemes. China, the US and others are more interested in direct action schemes. Let me quote from Michael Kiely from Carbon Farmers of Australia, a group strongly supportive of carbon farming. He said: We think permanence is a major barrier ... I personally don't know of any farmer who would be willing to sign up for a hundred years. That is clearly a major issue which has not been addressed in this legislation. Also, real and practical on-farm measures will only be the entitled to second-class credits. Under the Kyoto protocol clean development mechanism, only afforestation and reforestation are eligible to be certified as emissions reductions. Avoiding deforestation is not eligible and agricultural carbon sequestration is not recognised. So under Labor's legislation only tree planting credits will be supported by Kyoto, which is also consistent with Labor's proposed carbon tax. Farm based credits will be restricted to voluntary, non-mandatory markets and will be essentially worthless. The real things that farmers can do will not be credited. The truth is that this is just another subsidised tree planting scheme-an MIS on steroids. Do not take my word for it; let me refer to some of the experts in the area. In a recent article in its ECOS magazine, the CSIRO writes: Forestry and forest-related options are well placed for inclusion in the CFI, according to Dr Michael Battaglia, a scientist with CSIRO Sustainable Agriculture Flagship. Modelling done by Dr Battaglia and his team for the Queensland government found that forest carbon sinks make up about 75 per cent of the total figure attainable for agricultural carbon abatement in Queensland from 2010-2050. The article goes on to say: Andrew Macintosh of the ANU‘s Centre for Climate Law and Policy says ‗Most rural land managers are concentrating on soil carbon and reforestation projects, but personally I think that credits for preserved regrowth on deforested land units … and forest management credits will dominate the Australian scheme. Charles MCElhone from the NFF, who was quoted by the previous speaker, said: Based on experience with managed investment schemes, we‘re urging particular caution around new forestry impacts on food provision, biodiversity, water supply, employment and other community effects. So it is quite clear that the MIS tree planting schemes have been a disaster for many rural communities. They have cost jobs in the agricultural sector and they have damaged regional economies. These often bankrupt and uneconomic tree plantation schemes are dreadful next door neighbours. They are a haven for pests and diseases. There is no management. They are a likely source of future bushfires. They affect the water table and the run-off into local streams. These mass tree planting schemes have been an environmental and economic disaster for many parts of Australia. Yet the CSIRO tells us that a carbon price of just $36 a tonne would be high enough to convert Australia's best farmlands to forestry and $11 a tonne would be enough to trigger widespread planting, which will therefore reduce food security. So this is a scheme that will promote widespread tree planting on some of the best farming lands in our nation. The government is talking about some kinds of protective measures to preserve farmlands for the vital purpose of guaranteeing our nation's food supply, but the regulations have not been written. The government is asking us to trust it to put up something that will really work. But farmers have lost their trust in this government because of its failure to consult with them, to act with them and to listen to them when issues of concern are raised. I support carbon farming initiatives, I believe that they have great potential for the future of our country, but I cannot support this bill while so many questions remain unanswered. It needs to be delayed at least until after Labor's carbon tax legislation, if they are determined to proceed with that, because in its present form it will disadvantage Australian agriculture. It will produce perverse and unhelpful environmental outcomes and do nothing to reduce CO2 emissions or improve the global environment. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (12:56): I am pleased to be speaking on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and cognate bills because they are part of a comprehensive series of measures to deal with dangerous climate change. Those measures include putting a price on carbon. At the same time, we will be providing relief to industries that cannot reduce their carbon emissions because of the nature of their production processes and we will also be providing relief to households during the transition. It is also about improving carbon storage by using our natural advantages, such as our vast tracts of land-farmland and other land-which are available for carbon storage and sequestration. It is about investing in research and development and putting in place renewable energy targets. It is a comprehensive policy because, unlike those opposite, we believe there is no silver bullet to deal with this important issue-which is probably the most important issue this parliament is going to have to deal with. I would like to contrast our position with the coalition's approach, which stems from their attitude to the science. Depending upon what week of the year you catch him on, the Leader of the Opposition will be giving a nod to the science on one day and then a nod to the deniers on the next day. He will be giving a wink to the Left of his caucus on one day and then a wink to the Right of his caucus on the next day. In fact, he has so many positions on this and is nodding in so many directions that it is no wonder that some days he looks like he has policy whiplash. The second approach of the coalition is all about huffing and puffing, and we will see why in a moment. We saw the ridiculous pantomime this week while the Leader of the Opposition was wandering around the state of New South Wales. One day he popped up in a Weet-Bix factory and made the outrageous claim that somehow a carbon price is going to make kiddies choke on their Weet-Bix. When the facts get out we will realise that if it has any impact at all it will be less than 0.000-in fact, there are so many zeroes we can hardly get to the cost. We then saw him pop up in a fish market, amidst the oysters and the caviar, making claims about how the carbon price will lead to an outrageous rise in the cost of fish. did he know that there is going to be no cost impost at all. I am very pleased that over the last week he started to be called out on these issues and brought to account for the outrageous claims he is making. We can understand why he is all huff and puff because his strategy is to say to the Australian people, with this great distraction, 'Look over there, because while you're looking over there, I've got my hand in your back pocket to the tune of about $750 per annum. I'm going to use your money to pay the big polluters. I'm going to use your money to subsidise the big carbon emitters in this country,' such as those confirmed by the shadow environment spokesperson overnight. He wants to reach into the pockets of Australian taxpayers, take that money out of their wallets and give it to what are, in many instances, overseas multinational companies, to assist, to implore, to encourage them to reduce their carbon emissions. So let us not be fooled by the huff and puff of the Leader of the Opposition. It is a pleasure today to speak on what are a comprehensive series of measures to deal with catastrophic and dangerous climate change. The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill fulfils Labor's election commitment to give farmers, forest growers and landholders access to carbon markets. In doing so, the bill provides opportunities for the agricultural sector to participate in abatement measures which will complement the other measures being advocated by those on this side of the House-and indeed by some on the other side of the House who weekly start to question the madness, lack of conviction and contradictions in the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. The legislation will provide opportunities for farmers and landholders to participate in the domestic and international carbon offset markets, and Little that is an important point. The carbon farming initiative provides landholders with access to an additional and diversified source of income. It is interesting that we see people in this parliament who once upon a time represented the rural sector and farmers who criticise this policy. Through the crafting of its policy, Labor has excluded the farm sector from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the carbon tax on the one hand; on the other hand, it is providing them potential revenue stream. If those on the other side, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Nationals, who just spoke, truly did represent the rural sector, they would be rushing out here and saying, 'This is great legislation and we will be supporting it because it will provide an important revenue stream for our constituents.' What sort of revenue stream? Eligible activities under the framework outlined in this bill include emission reductions from fertilisers and increasing sequestration, which avoid greenhouse gas emissions and/or increase carbon storage. Carbon farming and the initiative outlined in the legislation before the House today, in effect, is the legislative framework that in large part represents what the coalition are currently proposing in relation to climate change. The key difference is that our legislation and this initiative is part of an overall package of many measures because we understand that there is not one silver bullet. Carbon farming measures alone, without a commensurate reduction in carbon pollution, will not bring us to the emission reductions that are urgently needed. This was confirmed by the Climate Commission yesterday and has been repeated in numerous forums by eminent scientists, including those from the CSIRO. On this side of the House, we recognise that it is important that the agricultural sector begins the work of adapting to a low-carbon future and these bills assist in that journey. The Gillard government knows that there are abatement opportunities waiting to be taken up and that it is important that the framework puts this in place. However, we would never be so foolish as to think that this one measure alone, carbon faming, could with a achieve anywhere near the magnitude of what we need to achieve a cut to our carbon emissions. Let me explain this. The government's targets are to lower emissions by five to 25 per cent below 2000 levels. Even at the five per cent reduction target, which I understand is bipartisan, this will be no easy task and we cannot do this without all sectors of the economy including industry, agriculture, households and manufacturing all working together to the same end. That is to say, carbon farming alone is not the answer. carbon Experts have described the coalition's policy as being so environmentally ineffective that it will deliver only 25 per cent of the required carbon pollution abatement. So for the coalition to meet the bipartisan target of minus 25 per cent, they need to find somewhere another 75 per cent of carbon pollution abatement. Advice from Treasury to the coalition said that these: ... measures alone cannot do the job without imposing significant economic and budget costs. Moreover, many of the direct action measures cannot be scaled up to achieve significant levels of abatement, and for those that can be scaled up, the cost per tonne of abatement would rise rapidly. The Leader of the Opposition has shown no signs of being able to grasp the magnitude of what, as a nation and an economy, we are dealing with here. We know that if Australia takes no action by 2020 our carbon pollution could be 20 per cent higher than in 2000, not five to 25 per cent lower. We simply cannot achieve cuts to our carbon pollution by relying on tree-planting initiatives, as the Leader of the Nationals has said, and better fertilisers. The coalition's policy is not practical or effective. We need to ensure that our most productive land continues to be used for food production and is not diverted into tree planting for the purposes of trading carbon credits. That is one of the concerns that arose during the extensive consultation process accompanied the drafting of this legislation. he risk of the coalition's policy is that this is exactly what would happen. No-one can therefore take it seriously as an alternative policy. And what about the financial impact? Those opposite like to talk about waste as if they were speaking from a position of economic purity, but the reality is far from that. I could not explain the cost of the coalition's policy better than by using the exact same words the member for Wentworth used last week in his Lateline interview: The coalition's policy, as laid out by Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt, involves spending taxpayers' money-taking out of the budget so many billions of dollars to pay farmers in particular is a multi-billion-dollar exercise. And he went on: But the way it works is that the taxpayer- the taxpayers' money-would be used to buy carbon offsets from farmers, so that as industry pollutes, the government would then spend taxpayers' dollars to buy carbon offsets to offset that pollution. We know that the coalition's policy, as I have described it, is a publicly funded licence to pollute. It would cost over $30 billion rather than the $10.5 billion that has been outlined. That is because the coalition would need to purchase about 75 per cent of the required abatement from international permit markets at a cost of about $20 billion, for which no funding is currently available. So it does not appear that anyone over there even has the policy courage to think all of this through. The coalition's policy is confused and contradictory. Like much from the other side of the House, it is a reflection of that fact that they simply lack conviction in this area. Just last night the member for Flinders, the opposition spokesperson, told the ABC that a coalition government would pay large brown-coal-fired electricity generators to that reduce their pollution by switching to gasfired generation. As natural gas is far more expensive for generating electricity than brown coal, the coalition's policy would see either electricity prices rise, with no assistance to households, or the coalition having to subsidise the electricity generators. Those subsidies would cost taxpayers billions of dollars and would have to continue for decades, given that electricitygenerating plants are long-lived assets. The only way to avoid rises in electricity prices under this scenario would be through indefinite taxpayer subsidies to the generators. If the coalition's publicly funded pollution licence ever came into being, the average ... it Australian family would be slugged at least $720 per annum. They would be worse off by 720 bucks per annum. So this publicly funded licence to pollute is a policy folly that Australia cannot afford either financially or environmentally. We need all sections of our economy working together. We urgently need our top 1,000 polluting companies to be playing their part and doing what they can to become more environmentally friendly. The introduction of a carbon price will be a historic measure for this country. It will be a historic measure for this parliament too when legislation that reflects this country's resolve to deal with climate change becomes law in this place. I acknowledge that a significant reform like this is not easy. Building a consensus for a major change is never an easy task. However, if you are entrusted by the electorate to form government, you have a reciprocal obligation to act responsibly and to do what you believe is in the national interest. There is simply no other option. If those opposite were truly serious about doing something to reduce carbon emissions, were serious about taking advantage of our natural assets and were serious about doing something in the most cost-effective way and the most efficient way, they would get on with our package of reforms-a package of reforms which includes these bills before the House today. These bills will enable farmers and the forestry sector to engage in the carbon abatement measures described in the legislation and to receive a financial reward for it and to play a part in the overall national effort. That national effort will require reform of all industries and all sectors of the economy, and an effort by households as well, to do what we need to do to play our part in an international effort to reduce carbon emissions and to avoid dangerous climate change. I commend the legislation to the House.",66
34,Mr COULTON,CONDOLENCES," I have been a little astounded sitting here listening to some of the presentations from the government side on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills. I am just wondering: what does the member for Throsby tells his constituents, the ones working in the fine industrial city of Wollongong? Does he tell them that he is in here selling out their future and their jobs and that he has lost sight of the best interests of the people he represents in a bid to earn favour from the Greens and the Independents? Listening to this debate this morning, I have heard some remarkable contributions from members of the government. While I might not be as quite as eloquent as some, I do come to this place with dirt under my nails. I have spent a large part of my life involved in agriculture and I can see when something is practical, when something will work, and I can see when it will not. I do believe in the great potential of regional and rural Australia to play its part in the sequestration of carbon. I do believe that soil carbon is indeed one of the most unrecognised and misunderstood, or less understood, aspects of farming. In my early days of farming, my brothers and I, along with Monsanto, did some of the early trial work in zero-till farming when Roundup was first developed by the local New South Wales Department of Agriculture. The benefits of improving organic material in the soil by leaving crop residue on top of the soil were quickly seen. Basically, carbon is organic material. Anyone who knows anything about soil knows that you can tell a healthy soil by picking it up, by feeling it in your hands, by smelling it and by looking at the microactivity and the earthworms et cetera. Where this policy falls very short is with the idea of additionality. For someone who did not know any better, listening to the presentations from members of the government would have you think that Australian agricultural areas were a barren landscape on which a mob of uneducated, redneck farmers were raping the soil and that there was wonderful potential to show them the error of their ways through wonderful government programs. The government could help them see the great benefits of soil carbon and they were going to make a fortune. The reality is that the government-and, quite frankly, the rest of the world-is behind the Australian farmer. The Australian farmer worked out the value of carbon many years ago. The irony is that under this legislation the farmers with the most carbon already stored in their soils will be exempt. To gain credits under this scheme, you have to prove that you are increasing the sequestration from this point on. That pretty well excludes a large number of the farmers in my electorate. We have heard members say they understand because they have been involved in local community groups building tree lots and things like that. I am talking about large scale farming. I have one farmer in my electorate who grows 200,000 acres of wheat. If you look at the amount of tonnage of carbon that is stored under a business of that size, you see it is of great magnitude. One of the problems is that that soil carbon is not recognised under Kyoto. Indeed, efforts in the past to trade that carbon have largely failed and we have seen the demise of the Chicago carbon exchange. We have a long way to go to recognise what has already happened. The complexity of agronomy and agriculture is not done any justice by this bill. There is no recognition the extra carbon that has been stored under grazing lands by the changes in management. One of the greatest changes that I have seen in improving the fertility and health of soil has been the introduction of the dung beetle. Dung beetles might not be the sexiest thing to talk about but they have done an enormous job in improving the fertility and the organic material in large tracts of grazing land right across Australia. Indeed, in my own case, I have seen a combination of manual soil works and the introduction of dung beetles turn severely eroded, badly scalded soils into productive and healthy soils. None of that is recognised. If you look through this bill you see that the only real benefit that farmers can gain is by planting trees. The previous speaker spoke about protecting prime agricultural land, but there are no regulations in the bill to say what is prime agricultural land. If credits are going to be paid by the amount of biodiversity that will be grown, it is obvious that people looking to have offsets will want to plant trees in the most productive, fertile soil that they can because that is going to grow the largest biomass in the shortest amount of time. The problem is that those soils are exactly those that we need for our food security. I have already seen large tracts of what were productive farms being planted down to trees to gain offsets in schemes outside this one. It has led to a reduction in the productivity of those areas and contributed to depopulating rural Australia. I believe that this legislation, brought in in an incomplete form without proper scrutiny and without waiting for the report from the Senate, is the trojan horse to lull the farmers of regional Australia into the next stage, which is the carbon tax, to be followed ultimately by an emissions trading scheme. The member for New England, after of Professor Garnaut visited his electorate, was making noises about the great benefits for farmers under a carbon tax regime. This is the sticky paper. Once farmers get on it, they are drawn in. Under the proposals first put up in the original emissions trading scheme of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, one of the farmers in my electorate, on a medium-sized farm, worked out with a calculator that the scheme would cost his enterprise an extra $70,000 a year. Since then, agriculture has supposedly been exempted. Previous speakers from the government have said that since farmers are exempt here is an opportunity to raise income. But what are not exempt are the inputs. Agriculture relies heavily on fuel-as examples, electricity for running irrigation pumps, and diesel. A number of our inputs contain a high level of fossil fuel. Fertiliser has a large amount of energy in it. Many of the commonly used farm chemicals are based on fossil fuels, such as Roundup and Amine. I believe the inputs will always blow away any opportunity for farmers to be in front, so we need to be very careful here. While I understand the concept- and I think I have more practical understanding and experience of what this bill is about than others-this bill is incomplete. There are serious concerns and we should not accept this bill without seeing the regulations, particularly around the issue of additionality. With regard to 100-year sequestration, if all of us cast our minds back 100 years, we should all be thankful to our forefathers for putting in legislation enshrining land use rights for now. One hundred years ago the internal combustion engine had only just been invented. Farmers were farming with horse teams. There was certainly very limited understanding of the complex agronomic information that is now available. To lock our landscape into something for 100 years, I believe, is a very risky move. What happens if it is destroyed by fire or something like that? Where is the cost in all that? We need to be very wary of this legislation. Professor Garnaut, in his original report prepared for the Rudd government, indicated that regional Australia would have an economic downturn of 20 per cent under an emissions trading scheme. I have not seen any information that says otherwise. We have heard some wonderful speeches during the emissions trading debate. That great alarmist, the member for Isaacs, had half of his electorate under water. Those on that side made some wonderful contributions about their knowledge of what other people could do. When we start looking at tackling climate change, how about looking at some of the schemes that some of the metropolitan areas may introduce, rather than allowing regional Australia to carry the burden for the grand gesture of Australia being the world leader in attacking climate change? The people of regional Australia understand and can smell a bad deal when it is put at them. They think that this carbon tax coming up stinks and that this legislation is a forerunner for that. Much of the intent in this legislation is quite valid but, at the moment, it is unpalatable. Unless I see some serious changes coming through the inquiry in the Senate, this bill will not be getting my support.",73
35,Mr ZAPPIA,CONDOLENCES," I take the opportunity to speak in support of these three bills: the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011, the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 and the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011. The objectives of these bills are, firstly, to help Australia meet its international obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; secondly, to create initiatives for people to undertake land sector abatement projects; and, thirdly, to achieve carbon abatement in a manner that is consistent with the protection of Australia's natural environment and that improves resilience to the impacts of climate change for our community. The purpose of these bills is to enable farmers, landholders and forest growers to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and store it in soil, plants, vegetation and trees. By doing so, they will receive carbon credits for the carbon that is stored. It is a voluntary scheme and, of course, conditions are attached to it. Why is the scheme being implemented? It is being implemented because climate change is real and poses a real threat to our future. We now have an abundance of scientific evidence that confirms that the main cause of global warming is the amount of greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. Around 97 per cent of climate scientists accept that. I understand that 192 countries who met in Copenhagen accept that. The European Union accepts that and it already has an ETS in place. From briefings I have had in recent days, India and China accept that and have already embarked on their own projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-in particular, carbon dioxide emissions. We have heard that the UK accepts it. It seems to me that the only places where there is still some debate going on about the science are the USA and Australia. That scepticism is abundantly clear when you listen to members of the opposition in this place. We have heard it from many of them not only in respect of this legislation; in recent days certainly in the last couple of years they have still been questioning the science of global warming. The reason that I refer to the science of global warming is that it is critical to these bills, and I will come back to that in a moment. There is no doubt that the climate is changing and, as I said, the evidence is overwhelming. As a result of global warming we are also seeing ice being lost from our ice caps and glaciers. Our oceans are warming and sea levels are rising. More greenhouse gases around the earth's atmosphere act like a blanket around the earth and trap in the earth's heat. We have seen, over the last 100 years, an almost-one degree Celsius increase in temperatures-and most of that has occurred in the last 50 years. The last decade was the hottest on record. We know that oceans store most of the additional heat-something like 85 per cent of the additional heat generated is stored in the oceans. We know that oceans have risen by about 20 centimetres since the late-1800s and are expected, based on projections, to increase by something like half a metre to one metre by the end of the century. Some suggest that it could be even higher than that. We also know that as oceans warm up they also expand and they rise. And we also know that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more is absorbed by the oceans-and once you increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the oceans, you increase its acidity and therefore change the ocean ecology. For all of those reasons we need to act with respect to reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. One of the additional matters of real concern-because the science on this is only just coming to light-is that there is about 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon stored in permafrost. So, as the icebergs and the glaciers melt, that carbon dioxide is also and released into the atmosphere, compounding the problems associated with melting ice. We have seen in this country-and, for that matter, around the world-not only temperature rises but changes in rainfall patterns; we have seen floods, cyclones, droughts-droughts that in turn, I believe, led to bushfires. Much of the net carbon dioxide emissions have originated primarily from deforestation around the world. Our challenge is to reduce carbon emissions. To reduce carbon emissions that have already been emitted into the atmosphere you can reduce your output but also by finding methods of taking that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and safely storing it in the soil, in plants and in trees. To reduce the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere is not possible through any one single solution; it requires a multitude of different actions. It also requires a global response. And that is exactly what is happening around the world right now, including here in Australia, where we are seeing investment in renewable energy, we are seeing efforts being made to cut emissions; and these bills, which would appear to be the first of their kind in the world, I believe, will do a lot towards sequestering carbon in the atmosphere. This is an important measure, and it seems to me that some of the members opposite who have raised their concerns to it are doing so because of legitimate matters that were raised in the lead-up to the preparation of these bills. There was a very long public consultation process in the lead-up to these bills being drafted. Subsequent to that, the bills were referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts and the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee. Those committees held simultaneous inquiries into these bills. Because the bills were referred to both committees at the same time, the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts tried not to overlap the work of the Senate committee. Nor have we seen the Senate committee's report. But we have seen the report from the standing committee of this House. It was presented by me on Monday. That committee, which is comprised of members of both sides of the parliament, unanimously recommended that these bills be passed by the parliament. I should say, with respect those recommendations, we held a day of public hearings and we also received 70-odd submissions with respect to these bills. Almost without exception, those people who made submissions to the committee broadly supported the intent of these bills as they currently stand. Yes, they raised some matters, which I hear are similar to the matters being raised by members opposite today; but, broadly, the bills were supported by those people who made submissions. And the committee came to the conclusion that the bills ought to be supported because, whilst there were still some matters that needed further negotiation and consultation between the government and interested parties, that could and would be done in the establishment of the regulations. Matters relating to additionality, permanency, native title, the NRM plans, methodologies and perverse outcomes were all identified by the committee as matters that required further work. But none of them were serious enough to prevent or delay or defer the implementation of the measures in these bills by passing this legislation in this House. It is my view-and I believe the view of the committee, because it was a unanimous decision-that the sooner we get on with this legislation, the sooner will landowners be able to take advantage of the opportunities that these bills present to them, because reducing carbon dioxide does present landowners with opportunities. The issues of additionality and permanency-and I note the previous speaker particularly referred to those-are ones that we know may need some additional work done. And, can I say, what is referred to as a 'positive and negative list' of which projects will be eligible and which will not is something that needs to be done. Sure, they might be contentious, but you have to start to somewhere. And it does not matter where you start-there will always be someone who will argue that perhaps an additional project should have been included that was not, or one that was included should not have been in the list. What is interesting about this legislation is that, from my understanding, there is no legislation anywhere else in the world that is quite the same. It does, in fact, cover new ground. What is important is that there is also a commitment by the government that this legislation will be reviewed in 2014. At that review, if changes need to be made, of course they can and will be. The truth, however, is that legislation can be amended at any time by the government of the day. If, once the legislation is in place and some of those concerns that were raised prove to be founded, I have no doubt that the government of the day will do the right thing and bring in the necessary amendments. You will not know that until you have the legislation in place. The question of permanency was also raised by many of the people who made submissions. You could argue that permanency should be 50, 75 or 100 years. I believe the figure of 100 years fits in with international standards. Be that as it may, issue of the 100 years is not permanent because those people who have the carbon credit units can relinquish those credit units. They can buy them back and therefore relinquish them. Permanency in a sense is only for as long as anybody wants to make it. If they want to get out of the scheme they can do so. Simultaneously, you cannot have a scheme that allows people to be given credits for having sequestered carbon if there is not a degree of security about that carbon being stored. It simply does not make sense to be able to say: 'Well, I'm going to sequester carbon, but next year it won't matter and I'll just walk away from my commitment.' That does not provide the long-term benefits of storing the carbon that are being sought under these bills. The additionality question, as I said earlier, was also important in the minds of many of the people who made submissions. Again, if you are to get credits for what you are currently doing, that then defeats the whole purpose of this scheme. It has to be in addition to the current practices that are taking place. One of the areas that I will comment on in respect of the submissions made to the committee is that of native title, and we had some very good submissions. I am aware of the concerns being raised by a number of parties in relation to native title and those concerns are quite legitimate. The department and the minister have advised that there are ongoing discussions on the issues of native title. I welcome those ongoing discussions and, for those reasons, I see no reason why these bills should be delayed or deferred. The methodologies, of course, will also be questioned. There is a process in place to ensure that the methodologies used in order to gain carbon credits are legitimate. I have no problems with the process being used. In respect to the National Farmers Federation-and other the speakers have made this point-they also broadly welcome this legislation. It seems to me that, whilst some concerns have been raised, there is no reason why we should not get on with this legislation. Whilst members opposite use the argument that the Senate committee has not reported back on this legislation, can I remind them that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts has reported back, and it was a unanimous decision by members of both sides of this House to support this legislation. I commend these bills to the House.",75
36,Ms MARINO,CONDOLENCES," The greatest practical carbon sink available to the world right now is that of biosequestration, which is in the world's soils and plants. It is currently the only effective offset. We have spent a great deal of time and money on the alternative, geosequestration; however, the ability to store carbon dioxide deep underground as a liquid or in solution remains commercially unviable. Whilst the optimists continue to pursue it, something I support, there is no guarantee that geosequestration will become an economically viable option We do know, however, that biosequestration is both practical and viable. Not only that, we have been practising it for generations. We may have called it revegetation, or perhaps agroforestry or plantation farming. We have done it to prevent erosion, to reduce salinity, to improve production, to protect the environment and to retain native species. Governments have done it, farmers have done it, community and environmental groups have done it and lots of private individuals have done it and are doing it. The fact that we can do it is not actually in question. The questions are: how do we increase it; how do we measure it; and how do we make it viable for landholders to engage in? There are two forms of biosequestration covered in this bill. The first is plant carbon. Sequestering carbon into vegetation such as trees is the easiest to do and certainly the easiest to measure. We know how to plant trees and we know approximately how much carbon is stored in each tonne of wood that grows or in each hectare of plantation. It will range from three tonnes of CO2 equivalent per hectare depending on tree and soil types and the rainfall. The age of trees also matters. A young tree sequesters far more carbon than an older one. In the south-west of Western Australia the iconic jarrah trees live up to 450 years. Studies of jarrah, karri and other eucalypts across Australia have shown that eucalypt trees rarely exceed 400 years in age. Most of their carbon storage happens in the first 150 years, peaking in years 10 to 30. From 150 to 300 years carbon storage in jarrah trees actually flatlines. In their last 150 years they often contribute more carbon back into the atmosphere than they absorb. The requirements of the Kyoto agreement restrict measurable carbon to plantings after 1990 on land that was cleared before 1990 and the requirement to leave trees in place for 100 years needs to be considered in this context. One hundred years may be appropriate for many tree species like jarrah but may well be inappropriate for faster growing, shorter lived trees. Those species that only live on average 100 years may only be effective in storing carbon for the first 50 and emitting carbon after 80. If those trees were to be harvested and their carbon stored for the longer term, for example as structural timber, and the area replanted with trees, the amount of carbon stored would be maximised. I note that the CSIRO recently commented as follows: To achieve the full benefits of carbon storage, carbon forests need to be managed according to natural cycles of death and decay, including the periodic impact of fire. The long term aim might be to manage forests of a range of ages. Tree planting should not be considered in isolation from other environmental issues. Reforestation of cleared land uses a lot of water and frequently drives water tables down. Whilst this is a good thing, in fact the desired outcome of planting can be to reduce the impacts of salinity, it may have detrimental effects on farming and native forest nearby if it pushes fresh groundwater deeper and out of the reach of drought sensitive species.",78
37,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES," Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. At that time the honourable member will have the opportunity to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Forde Electorate: Alice Dobson and Anthony Young Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (13:45): The Forde electorate is home to a great many exceptional and innovative people whom I am privileged to represent in this House. Recently there have been two community members who deserve a special mention. The first, Alice Dobson of Beenleigh, celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and relatives at the Beenleigh Senior Citizens Centre, the largest seniors centre in Australia. I was honoured to speak to Mrs Dobson about her achievements in life and to join in celebrating this momentous occasion and sharing birthday congratulations from the Queen, the Governor General and the Prime Minister. When asked what the secret to a long and happy life was she stated, 'Stay positive and keep active.' Another constituent in my electorate, Mr Anthony Young, had a successful outcome when he represented Australia at the 2011 Blind Powerlifter World Championships in Turkey last month. It was a pleasure to visit Mr Young for the second time to congratulate him on his bronze medal. Mr Young also succeeded in breaking two world records for the bench press and is going to Orlando for the world championships in 2012. Mr Young is a legally blind Indigenous athlete who has been competing in blind powerlifting for 25 years. In 11 trips to the world championships, he has won eight world titles and been runner-up twice. I continue to stay in contact with Mr Young and to aid him in finding the extra funding he needs for next year's events. (Time expired) Rush, Mr Scott",79
38,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," record my tremendous relief and gladness concerning the decision of the Indonesian Supreme Court two weeks ago to overturn Scott Rush's death sentence. I am sure Scott's remorse regarding his involvement with drugs and his determination to play a role in educating other young people on the dangers to themselves and to society posed by drugs will be positively regarded by the court in future application to have his life sentence reduced. I pay tribute to Scott Rush's parents, Lee and Christine, who have been there as a constant source of support for Scott. I also acknowledge Scott's lawyer, MCDonald QC, whose professionalism and dedication has been remarkable. I note the bedrock of encouragement and friendship given to Scott by my colleague Chris Hayes, the member for Fowler, and also the support of other colleagues in this place, including the member for Moreton in whose electorate Scott's parents live, the member for Berowra and Senator Gary Humphries as the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Group against the Death Penalty. For the other prisoners who remain on death row in Indonesia and elsewhere, it is important that we hold them in our thoughts and continue to push for change. Finally, I pay tribute to the Indonesian Supreme Court for this very fair decision. Indonesia has made important progress in strengthening democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law in the past decade and it is important that this be acknowledged. As I have said before in this place, to stand for life and for human dignity and to eschew violent retribution even when one has the power to carry it out is the mark of civilisation. Kidney Health Week",80
39,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This week marks Kidney Health Week, I which is an incredibly important week in our diaries. Kidney Health Australia's campaign has been designed to be cheeky, they say, to get more exposure. The banner is 'Red Undies Week' and is aimed at drawing attention to the issue of chronic kidney disease. One in three Australians is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Left undiagnosed, those who develop chronic his kidney disease will either die prematurely or need a kidney transplant. Ultimately, patients will require long-term dialysis which involves significant commitment four to five times a week for about half a day each time. My advice to members is to encourage Colin their constituents to have a kidney function test, especially if they have any of the indicators. I congratulate the work of volunteers in Kidney Health Australia, especially David Parker, who chairs the National Consumer Council and is himself a kidney recipient. He is a great role model encouraging our community to look after themselves and have their kidneys checked. I also thank Bill Handke, who is tireless in advocacy for patients who have chronic kidney disease. He makes their world a better place. Fatality Free Friday",80
40,Mr ROBERT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Russell White is the founder of Fatality Free Friday and lives in the mighty electorate of Fadden. This Friday is Fatality Free Friday and the Fatality Free Friday Road Safety Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that oversees the Fatality Free Friday event and is dedicated to improving road safety awareness, enhancing driver education and reducing the impact of road trauma. The establishment of a Fatality Free Friday Road Safety Foundation is designed to develop a sustainable strategy for reducing the social and economic costs of road crashes, as well as providing a platform for future research and advocacy programs. The foundation's main aim is to generate ongoing development towards road safety awareness. The first such Friday was held in Australia on 27 April 2007 and internationally in Las Vegas on 25 May 2007. This is the fifth year this initiative has been held and, while it this Friday, 27 May, there has been a range of activities. The Jacobs Well Police Beat this year staged its own road and water safety event. The World's Biggest Driving Lesson was again held, aiming for 250 learners at once to break the Guinness world record. Unfortunately, 197 participants in 10 cities did not quite make it, but I am sure they will crack it next year. Let us remember that there are between 1,400 and 1,500 people killed every year on Australian roads. For every fatality there are 10 people injured. While there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths for on our roads, the toll is still too high. I encourage everyone to go to www.FatalityFreeFriday.com. I am proud to his say I am one of the 28,116 to have taken the pledge. (Time expired) Healthy Holroyd Program",81
41,Ms ROWLAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I want the mention the very exciting Healthy Communities Initiative program that is coming Holroyd City Council in my electorate of Greenway to deliver new healthy eating, exercise and wellness programs. Holroyd City Council has received a grant of more than $700,000 as part of the federal government's $72 million Healthy Communities Initiative to support local government promotion of healthy lifestyles. This project, called the Healthy Holroyd Program, will improve health outcomes in my community by providing physical activity and nutrition programs for residents. Due to the vibrant multicultural nature of Greenway and the Holroyd LGA generally, this project will be delivered in Arabic and Tamil to cater for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. As a former local government representative, I know how important it is to is encourage such health initiatives in our local communities. As we live longer, wellness plans are now an inherent strategy in any good local government plan. Both this government and Holroyd council know the importance of encouraging healthy relationships, community safety and unique programs to cater for the different demographic and cultural needs of our respective communities. This fantastic initiative reflects federal and local government working cooperatively to deliver a great result for the people in my electorate, and again highlights the strength in their cooperation. I commend the mayor of Holroyd council, Councillor Monaghan, and the Holroyd community development leader, Ms Hiba Soueid, for their commitment to delivering these programs to the community. I would also like to thank the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is in the chamber, for her continued responsiveness to my advocacy for such valuable initiatives for the residents of Greenway. Committee for Gippsland",81
42,Mr CHESTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate Gippsland business owners and community leaders on the formation of the Committee for Gippsland. The new committee was officially launched by the Deputy Premier, Peter Ryan, and has recently appointed a young lady from our region, Mary Aldred, as its chief executive. The committee is chaired by Harry Rijs from Patties Foods in Bairnsdale. The Rijs family have made a very long and extraordinary contribution to the Gippsland region and Harry is continuing that service in this role. Next week the members of the committee will be in Canberra and I am looking forward to meeting with them and helping to set priorities for Gippsland's future. Part of that future is our shared interest providing opportunities for young people, like the students from the Lakes Entrance Primary School, who are in the gallery here today. It is great to see the Lakes Entrance Primary School students here with their teachers and I hope that members recognise that the Lakes Entrance Primary School is one of the finest primary schools in regional Australia. Of course, I am completely biased because my four children have all attended Lakes Entrance Primary School. It is wonderful to see the students here today and I am sure all members will join with me in welcoming them and thanking the Parliamentary Education Office for the work Peter they do in helping our young people gain a better appreciation of our civic duties here in the parliament. I welcome Lakes Entrance Primary School students to the parliament. I hope they enjoy their time here in our nation's capital and travel safely back to the electorate by the end of the week. Franklin House",82
43,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Franklin House is a magnificent National Trust property located in my electorate of Bass, which is lovingly preserved by a committed and passionate group of volunteers. The National Trust of Tasmania works to conserve Tasmania's heritage for present and future generations through the documentation and preservation of cultural heritage, and the management of historical properties such as Franklin House. Recently, as part of National Volunteer Week, I visited Franklin House to thank all the volunteers formally and to recognise their efforts. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly congratulate them on their contribution to the local community. Over five million Australians donate their time and efforts each year to a variety of worthwhile causes. The upkeep and in preservation of the glorious gardens and property at Franklin House by the National Trust volunteers is just one example of the passion, commitment and generosity that are characteristic of the many volunteers around the country. Once again, thank you and congratulations to this group of extraordinary individuals. Your dedication to the preservation of this part of Launceston's heritage is to be commended. Well done. Mining",82
44,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate WA Premier, Colin Barnett, on his defence of the WA government's sovereign right to scrap royalty rate exemptions.",83
45,Mr Danby,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,And rip off the rest of Australia.,83
46,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Where was the government when they scrapped the condensate exemptions? In my discussions with Colin he has talked about the Grants Commission and said that the Western Australian contribution to the economy through the GST is not returned as we are only getting 68c in the dollar, propping up states like Tasmania. The Treasurer has said recently that states should not be punished in this funding area for their successes. The Treasurer has made a complete mess of the budget, and in the process has declared war on WA. He now has retracted his earlier statements. Anthony Coralluzzo from Liberty Australia",83
47,Unknown,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Government members interjecting,83
48,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I hear the members on the opposite side interjecting; they can go for it if they like. The bottom line is that the new resource rent tax is unconstitutional. When Australia federated in 1901, specific and limited powers were delegated to the federal government from the states. Ownership of this mining land was not one of those powers. The land is thus legally owned by the sovereign state in which it is located.",83
49,Mr Melham,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,You should have seceded.,83
50,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,We might yet do that. You cannot rent out something you do not own and section 114 of the Australian Constitution forbids the federal government from taxing state government property. Tobacco Products,83
51,Mr MITCHELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Although there is not that much love shared across the chamber, I managed to discover a love letter from the Liberal Party to the Australian Tobacco Lobby. It says: 'Dear big tobacco, how burning is my love for you. Let me tell you why. I love you to the depth of your pockets, because what is yours only we share. I love you for your donations, so Liberal seats don't go on extended vacations. I love you for your profits as it robs taxpayer hip pockets. I love how you make $31.5 billion dollars of taxpayers' money go up in smoke, as it makes adding up the numbers easier for our bumbling shadow Treasury folk. I love you for your strength, for huffing and puffing and your earnest game of bluffing. The government is trying to get in our way, but forever in my heart you will stay. I will not pack you up, or put you away. I will never give you up or leave you cold turkey. Yours forever, because I can't afford to quit you, the federal Liberal Party of Australia.' Building the Education Revolution Program",83
52,Mr BALDWIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 11 May I brought to the attention of this House the urgent matter of unpaid accounts to 56 BER subcontractors amounting to some $600,000 for work done at Pacific Palms, Bungwahl and Coopernook schools. I have written to the Prime Minister, but to date there has not even been an acknowledgement of the letter, let alone any examination of the issue. It makes these tradies cringe every time they hear a member of the government stand up and say how this BER program saved us from the GFC. Prime Minister, if this program was to stimulate local economies, please explain how that has been achieved when these subbies are still owed $600,000. Labor plays hide and seek when it comes to Building the Education Revolution projects in Paterson. When a BER project is finished, Labor seeks out the media and sends Senator Forshaw to spruik the program. But when there are problems with a BER project, Labor is nowhere to be seen. Just last week Senator Forshaw attended the opening of BER projects at Morpeth, Grahamstown and Tenambit, but could not find time to meet with the subbies that have not been paid. Labor has failed to act for those subbies who are now struggling to survive. But Labor are not alone. I am now informed that the member for Lyne, Rob Oakeshott, has also fobbed off the subbies, most of whom are his constituents, despite being advised on this issue back in October last year. What happened to his passion for representing his constituents with his all new powers? Again I call on the Prime Minister to intervene and sort this mess out before its too late for these people.",83
53,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 pm, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Wood, Sergeant Brett, MG",84
54,Ms GILLARD,CONDOLENCES," I move: That the House record its deep regret at the death of Sergeant Brett Wood MG on 23 May 2011 while on combat operations in Afghanistan, place on record its appreciation of his service the country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. As we said yesterday, Sergeant Brett Wood was a courageous soldier. He was also a husband, a son and a friend, and I know that the thoughts of everybody in this House are with his wife, with his family and with his friends as they struggle to come to terms with this dreadful news and as their very dark period of mourning and grieving begins. Their sacrifice and their sorrow is very real, and as a nation our sacrifice and our sorrow are very real too. But the progress we are making on the ground in Afghanistan is real as well and we are determined to prevail. So today not only should the House express its sorrow; it should express its resolve. We will remember Sergeant Brett Wood. We will care for his wounded mates. We will support his mates who are still serving in the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan and his mates who are training with the 2nd Commando Regiment in Holsworthy. We will deny terrorism a safe haven in Afghanistan and we will stand firmly by our ally the United States of America. I want the people of Australia to know we are making progress in Afghanistan. Our troops are making a difference: protecting the Afghan people, training the Afghan security forces, building the Afghan government's capacity, preparing the Afghan National Security Forces to take responsibility for security in their own nation. The momentum of the insurgents has been halted. Security has been extended to areas previously controlled by the Taliban. In Oruzgan province, where we work, the provincial government is extending services to new areas. Our own provincial reconstruction team is conducting activities in areas of Oruzgan untouched six months ago-that is, we are able to work now in places we could not work before and this to will see the first areas of Afghanistan begin transition to Afghan-led security. We will see the first transition during this year. Across Afghanistan we have seen progress, and the goal of transition is in sight. We must be very realistic. Transition will take time but it is clear that the new international strategy is making progress. We are making a difference in Afghanistan and Brett Wood made a difference every day: on his first day in uniform in the Australian Army, on his first day on deployment in Bougainville, on the day he won his Medal for Gallantry in the Chora Valley and on the day he died. Sergeant Brett Wood died so that his friends, his fellow Australians and, indeed, the people of Afghanistan could live in peace; so that terrorism could find no continuing safe haven in Afghanistan. He was a man who sought peace for us and peace for the people of Afghanistan. We take this opportunity to wish that he rest in peace and that ultimately, too, his family and friends find some peace as well.",84
55,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES," I rise to support the motion and to echo the eloquent words of the Prime Minister and to add to my remarks of yesterday. Sergeant Brett Wood was plainly a remarkable soldier. The holder of the Medal for Gallantry, he had been on three tours to Afghanistan, he had been on tours to Iraq, Bougainville and East Timor and he had been honoured by the United States, whose service personnel he had rescued from deep peril. Plainly, he was one of the finest, and we mourn him. Inevitably, the death of Sergeant Wood has prompted calls for a speedy withdrawal from Afghanistan. Let me say that no Australian government would lightly commit our armed forces to battle. The former government did not do it. The current government does not do it. As members of this parliament all of us are acutely conscious of the fundamental fact that others may pay an extremely high price for the decisions that we make. No military commitment should ever be undertaken without first counting the cost or abandoned because that price has fallen due. No-one would want our forces to be in Afghanistan for a moment longer than were absolutely necessary but, in their absence, who would train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army or help to ensure that women's rights and minority rights are respected in Oruzgan province? The consequences of a premature withdrawal could well be the restoration of the Taliban, the destabilisation of Pakistan and terrorist sanctuaries that would be much harder to remove, were that necessary for a second time. This would be an extremely high price to pay, perhaps an even higher price than that which Australia has already paid and may yet still have to pay. We certainly grieve for Sergeant Wood. We grieve with his family. We grieve for all of the 24 Australian military personnel killed in Afghanistan and for their families. But I restate the coalition's conviction that we best honour Sergeant Wood's memory and that of his comrades by remaining true to the cause which they have so well served. Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:07): I associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both in expressing condolence for Sergeant Brett Wood and in reaffirming our support for our effort and mission in Afghanistan. This is another tragic blow to the Australian Defence Force, to the Australian Army and to our special forces community. It is also a tragedy for another Australian family, and I express my sincere condolences to Sergeant Wood's wife, Elvi, and his family. For a man of 32 years of age, Sergeant Wood was a man with significant operational experience and a highly decorated soldier. In many ways his personal experiences reflect the Australian international security experience over the last decade. He was first deployed overseas, to Bougainville, in 2000; he was first deployed to East Timor in 2001 and in 2003 to Iraq. In 2006 he was deployed to Afghanistan for the first time and was awarded the Medal of Gallantry for his bravery and leadership in action. He returned to Afghanistan for a second time in 2009 and, in March this year, was deployed to Afghanistan for the third occasion. Every time his country asked, he responded. As members know, Sergeant Wood is our 24th fatality in action in Afghanistan. For 23 other Australian families this will be a terrible reminder of their own personal loss, their personal and family sacrifice. In addition to the death of Sergeant Wood, two other Australian soldiers were wounded in the fatal improvised explosive device blast. In a separate engagement with insurgents, three other soldiers suffered gunshot and fragmentation wounds. I am pleased to advise the House that the condition of all five wounded soldiers is now listed as satisfactory and stable, and our thoughts and wishes also go to them and their families at this time. Sergeant Wood has our deepest respect and our deepest gratitude. Working with our partners in an international security assistance force under a United Nations mandate, he was killed in action serving his country, helping to stare down international terrorism. Our thoughts are with his wife, his family, his mates and his friends.",85
56,Mr ROBERT,CONDOLENCES," I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Defence to honour Sergeant Brett Wood MG, who was tragically killed in action in Afghanistan, and to lend our prayers to five other soldiers wounded in this and subsequent actions. Just as our nation had started its healing after loss of Sapper Larcombe we stand again to bid farewell to another, this time a decorated special forces patrol commander seasoned in battle, who had just fought his last fight. Today is an ode to this fallen soldier, an ode to a grieving wife, an ode to a family left places. behind, an ode to the music he will never play, the ball he will never kick and the friends he will never see. If all we knew of Sergeant Wood was that he was an Australian soldier we would have known enough to eulogise his courage, determination, mateship and endurance, but the immutable march of time records so much more: a decorated warrior, a seasoned NCO, a tough patrol commander and a loving and gentle husband. As a special forces patrol commander Brett put his men first and himself last. His men's welfare was more important than his own bloody wounds. If his men were thirsty, he would share his last drop; if they were hungry, his last bite. He would split his ammo with them in the heat of battle, he would protect them under fire and he would lead them from the front. Brett was the first out of the Blackhawk and he was the last man back in. Brett's death serves as a sobering reminder of the continuing dangers that daily confront our soldiers as they fight in Afghanistan for a world free of terrorism. As we lament Brett's loss we also pause to remember the 23 other Australians who have paid the supreme price in Afghanistan and the 174 who have been wounded in action. To Sergeant Wood's wife, Elvi, and his wider family, I say that your loss is Australia's loss and your burden weighing heaviest in your hearts will be shouldered by the entire nation. We grieve with you. Brett, we will remember you as a titan who trod this earth and a warrior who served others in the finest tradition of the green the beret you wore. You lived your commando motto: Foras Admonitio, without warning. We salute you, even now as we mourn your loss.",86
57,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"As a mark of respect, I invite honourable members to rise in their Honourable members having stood in their places",86
58,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. Debate adjourned. Reference to Main Committee,86
59,Mr ALBANESE,CONDOLENCES,by leave-I move: That the resumption of the debate on the Prime Minister's motion of condolence in connection with the death of Sergeant Brett Wood MG be referred to the Main Committee. Question agreed to. NA Cost of Living,87
60,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to a report from the Queensland Council of Social Service which has just been released which shows that Brisbane residents were paying 23 per cent more for food, 35 per cent more for rent, 48 per cent more for public transport and 63 per cent more for electricity, gas and water than five years ago. I ask the Treasurer: why is this government making a bad situation worse by hitting the forgotten families of Australia with an unnecessary carbon tax?",87
61,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question, because we are absolutely aware of cost of living pressures on Australian families. That is the first reason why we are so emphatic about creating jobs, about putting in place an economic policy which will see more jobs and more secure jobs. And that is why we opposed the policy of those opposite when it came to Work Choices, because they wanted to make people more insecure in their employment. We are absolutely aware that we need to provide support to families, particularly those on low and middle incomes. That is why over three years we put in place tax cuts which were a very substantial benefit to people on modest incomes. That is why we have substantially increased the childcare cash rebate, to 50 per cent. That is why we have included school uniforms in the education tax rebate. That is why we have put in place a very substantial increase for those families who have got teenagers who are studying, up to something like $4,000 a year. But overall the thing that we must do to support families is to make sure that our economy is prosperous and that jobs growth is strong. If those opposite had had their way, had they been in charge in recent years, Australia would have been in a recession, unemployment would have been far higher and Australian families would have been far less secure. We understand that we also need to price carbon in this country to make sure that we continue to have strong growth. In pricing carbon, we will ensure that every cent raised from that carbon price goes either to households or to industry. That is why we will put forward a responsible policy which will guarantee our prosperity and do the right thing by future generations. We will not do what those on that side of the House are doingMs Plibersek: Heads in the sand.",87
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are sticking their heads in the sand. At least the member for Wentworth understands the importance of putting in place sound policy for the future. That is what we are doing and that is what we will continue to do. NA,87
63,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from New Zealand. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Kia ora tatou. NA Fiscal Policy  question is also to the Treasurer. Why is investing in jobs and running fiscal policy appropriate for the ramp-up in mining investment important? What lessons has the government learnt from the conduct of fiscal policy during mining boom mark 1?",87
64,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Moreton for that question. We will be out there tonight barracking for the Queenslanders. I know the Leader of the House is a bit upset by this! But on this side of the House, as I was saying before, we understand the importance of strong economic growth to secure communities and to jobs. We understand the importance of the creation of 700,000 jobs and the creation of a further 500,000 jobs in the next two and a bit years. We also understand that investment in our economy is going to 50-year highs. We understand that there is an investment pipeline of something like $380 billion. This is going to support strong growth, particularly strong jobs growth, and rising incomes, and it will boost our export capacity. This is all very good for the security of families in our community. These are great opportunities ahead for Australia, but we also know there are some pretty hefty challenges as well. We know when this investment kicks in it will cause price pressures in our economy. We also know that it will stretch the capacity of our workforce and place greater demands on infrastructure, which is why we put in place the budget that we did a couple of weeks ago, coming back to surplus in 2012-13 to make sure we do not add to those price pressures, getting a bigger trained workforce, investing in apprenticeships, breaking the cycle of welfare dependence. These are all the objectives we must share so we have a strong economy and security. Of course, our fiscal policy stands in very stark contrast to the fiscal policy that applied during mining boom mark 1. What we have got in place is very strict fiscal discipline. We have got the lowest rate of expenditure increase-we have got a one per cent increase in expenditure over five years. That stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who let it rip during mining boom mark 1, with expenditure increasing by 3.7 per cent every year for five years. This point has been made very clearly by US's Scott Haslem just in the past week. He goes out to compare the fiscal policy during mining boom mark 1 with the fiscal policy during mining boom mark 2, and he says that the contrast could not be starker. He has got this to say: … in the three years to 2005/06 – through the first phase of the current commodity boom – real government expenditure averaged four per cent per year …",88
65,Mr Simpkins,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Wasn't there a surplus in those days?,88
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan!,88
67,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do not like it, Mr Speaker. They went on a spending spree at the height of mining boom mark 1, and 10 interest rate rises followed. They do not like that at all. But Mr Haslem has blown the whistle on their approach to economic policy and demonstrated how unsuited they are to our current circumstances because, if they were in government, there would be no savings, there would be no return to surplus, there would be no investment in the workforce. And of course if they were there, there would be a great black hole, an $11 billion black hole, in their financial plans. What all this proves is that they are no more qualified to run an economy during mining boom mark 2 than they were during mining boom mark 1. An opposition member: The black hole's in your brain, Wayne.",88
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On the basis that the member for North Sydney blocked my view unfortunately he suffers the penalty but I say to whomever made that interjection they are very lucky. The member for North Sydney now has the call.,88
69,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to this statement made in the Western Australian parliament yesterday: No other parliament has the right to interfere with the raising or lowering of royalty rates. federal government has no right to interferein royalty decisions. Does the Treasurer agree?,89
70,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," We have said we will credit royalties in terms of the MRRT-that is what we have said we will do. But that is not what the debate is about. The debate, as it has been framed by those opposite, is somehow that the Western Australian government consulted with us about their plans to increase the fines royalty. Of course, they in no way consulted with us whatsoever. This has been the subject of an incredible degree of misrepresentation from those opposite so I do not know whether I can take that statement on its face value. I would not even know whether it had been put forward correctly, because there were so many statements in this House which were misrepresented yesterday. What I said last week was that the Western Australian government did not communicate with us about their decision to increase the royalty on fines in this budget. I went on to say that we did not give it the tick, they did not discuss it with us and they were playing a political game. What we are seeing, with that statement from the Western Australian parliament and its use by the shadow Treasurer today, is that the political game continues to be played. And the political game is very simply this: they are acutely embarrassed that the Western Australian Premier has increased royalties given they were in this House last Mining year claiming any increase in mining taxation would stifle jobs and investment. They are acutely embarrassed by that record; they are absolutely embarrassed by that record. But they are also embarrassed by the fact that the Western Premier, on no fewer than eight occasions between September last The year and now, had ruled out increasing the royalties on fines. So on eight occasions he ruled them out. But what they are really embarrassed about is this order, the Treasurer was asked a question that did not contain any argument or any debate. He is returning to the old policies of the slag and bag of the opposition. I ask you to draw him back to the question.",89
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business slightly ruins a reasonable point of order. The Treasurer will make his material directly relevant to the question that was asked.,89
72,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was asked about the increase in royalties for fines. I was asked about a statement in the Western Australian parliament-from whom I do not know and the context I do not know so I do not know if it is correct or not. But we are talking about the increase in royalties which was imposed on the people of Western Australia, the mining community of Western Australia, by the Western Australian government in their last budget and they did that despite the fact that there had been eight statements from the Premier of Western Australia that he would not do that. The conclusive one, the one that those opposite are so embarrassed about, is that, in their submission to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, they said they would not increase the royalties on fines. This is a submission they made to the Grants Commission in November last year and it does relate to the point that was in the question. This is what the Western Australian government submission to the Grants Commission says: 'The Premier recently indicated the state has no intention of increasing royalties'-no intention of increasing royalties in November last year. But it then went on to say the was not going to do it was that it would invoke a 'sovereign risk'. That was the submission from the government of Western Australia to the Grants Commission in November this year. So let us have no more of this nonsense that we have heard in the House and outside the House in the last 24 hours.",89
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will bring his remarks to a conclusion.,90
74,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Premier of Western Australia opposed the increase in public. He may have been telling them in private he was going to do it but in public he was opposing an increase in the royalties that he has imposed on the mining industry, and those opposite are absolutely embarrassed by his abject performance and misrepresentations.",90
75,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, Mr Speaker, I would ask the Treasurer to table that submission that he was reading from.",90

84,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that the member for Indi be asked to withdraw the same comment that she withdrew yesterday.",90
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Indi reason that he will withdraw. Mrs Mirabella: The Leader of the House is mistaken. Yesterday I withdrew the comment 'bagman'. Today I did not use that word. Today I called the Treasurer a pathetic liar. Which one do you want me to withdraw?,90

Now she is invited to approach the dispatch box and simply withdraw. their Mrs Mirabella: I withdraw.",90
89,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My supplementary question is to the Treasurer. Given his last answer, I refer the Treasurer to comments in the Western Australian parliament by the leader of the parliamentary Labor Party, Eric Ripper, who said: 'No other parliament has the right to interfere with our raising or lowering of royalty rates. The federal government has no right to interfere in our royalty decisions.' I ask the Treasurer again: does he agree with his Labor Party colleague?",90

96,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how is the government driving reform and investing in services through the budget to help keep our economy strong?",91
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Page for her question, which is about the future of the Australian nation and about her constituents and their access to jobs and opportunity today-that is, it is a very serious question. The government is focused on keeping the economy strong. First and foremost, what we need to deliver for Australians is a strong economy. Our economy is strong today, and that is because we have made the right judgments in the past to keep the economy strong. When the global financial crisis threatened, we invested to save 200,000 Australian jobs, to keep people working. We have made the right decisions to rebuild we Queensland and other disaster affected parts of the nation and to fund that properly. We made the right decision to kill Work Choices, the biggest threat to families struggling with cost-of-living pressures. And we have made the right decisions, tough decisions, to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised, because it is the right decision for our economy-not for government to add to inflationary pressures which would feed through to cost-of-living pressures in a growing economy. We understand that as our economy strengthens there will be some parts of the nation that are leaping ahead and some that will fear that they are at risk of being left behind. When I speak of the 'patchwork economy', it is of these economic circumstances that I speak. That is why the government are so determined to make sure that we spread the opportunities that this phase of economic growth gives us-the opportunities to get a job, with half a million jobs to be created over the next couple of years, building on the 750,000 jobs created so far; and the opportunity to get a trade, to get skills, to get the skills you need to get your first job and then, when you have that first job, to get another, better job. That is why even in a tight budget we have made sure that $3 billion are available to invest in skills. We understand that, as our economy grows, so it is an economy in transition. We are an economy in transition from the phase of the global financial crisis to a phase of rapid growth. We are also an economy that needs to be in transition from generating more emissions per head of carbon pollution than any other developed nation on earth to a clean energy economy. That is why, as our economy faces that transition, we will act in the most efficient and prudent way to spur that transition to a clean economy, and that is by pricing carbon. And in this phase of economic growth we will also be spreading the opportunities that come from the minerals boom through the Minerals Resource Rent Tax and the opportunity that it represents for Australian companies to have a reduced tax rate, for Australian small businesses to enjoy new tax arrangements and tax breaks and for working people to enjoy more superannuation and a better retirement income. Our economic strategy is central to everything that this government does, because there is no more important priority for the future of Australians and their families than keeping the economy strong. It is about the jobs and opportunities they have today and it is about building and spreading those opportunities for tomorrow. GST and Mining Royalties Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (14:38): My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the Commonwealth's assurance to Western Australia that it would direct the Grants Commission not to reduce Western Australia's GST by more than any additional royalty revenue. Why was this assurance blacked out in correspondence between the Western Australian Under Treasurer and the Commonwealth Secretary to the Treasury that was released under freedom of information?",91
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I thank the member for his question. The commentary in that particular letter related to Pilbara fines; it did not relate to fines in general.,92
99,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,92
100,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is just a fact. Of course, those opposite want to ignore all of the facts here, because they are acutely embarrassed by the fact that the premier of Western Australia has misled Western Australians and the Australian people on eight separate occasions. The letter he is talking about is one that refers to a change in the royalty rates for fines in the Pilbara, which is a completely separate matter from what the premier did in his most recent budget. That is something they have deliberately confused all the way through this debate. He asked why it was blacked out. It is not a decision that I took; it is a decision taken by the decision maker in the department. But what is this all about? This is all about the fact that those opposite do not have an alternative economic policy and they are acutely embarrassed about their incapacity to put one forward.",92
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume his place. The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.,92
102,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This cannot be on relevance! ,92
103,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have got to be joking.  Mr Crean interjecting,92
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his place. The minister for regional Australia will withdraw.,92
105,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",92
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the minister. The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.  was asked a question that did not contain any argument or any debate. He is now straying well from a directly relevant answer.,92
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Treasurer should be very careful not to stray much further from the question. He is now required to be directly relevant, not just relevant, to the question. The Treasurer has the call.",92
108,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has been a misleading campaign from those opposite to mix up a whole lot of separate issues. In the case of this minute, the minute was referring to changes that would take place in the Pilbara regarding fines, which is entirely separate from the case they have been prosecuting in this House both yesterday and today. It is entirely separate from the recent decision taken by the premier of Western Australia in his most recent budget, which, on eight occasions, he told the Australian people and the Western Australian people that he would not do, and in correspondence with the Grants Commission he said he would not do it because it was a sovereign risk. So he is saying one thing to the Australian people apparently doing another, which is exactly what those in this House are doing as well, and continue to do. The reason they are engaged in this political behaviour and this negative, mudslinging campaign against me and the government is that they are acutely embarrassed. They do not have an alternative economic policy. They could not put one up in this House a couple of weeks ago. The shadow Treasurer had a shocker at the Press Club and they are acutely embarrassed by their incompetence. Lyne Electorate: Regional Education",93
109,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister and relates to the feasibility study to lift education access and participation rates on the MidNorth Coast of New South Wales, funded by you in the previous parliament. This study has just been completed and has the exact opposite conclusions to those of the recent Grattan Institute findings around regional empowerment and growth. In light of this will you accept a presentation of these findings from the relevant Mid-North Coast advisory board chaired by former deputy secretary of DEEWR Jim Davidson so that the Grattan Institute model of picking winners for regional growth can be considered against real and practical evidence from regional communities fighting to address systemic inequality?",93
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Lyne for his question, and once again it is a serious question about opportunities for Australians in his electorate. I know that this has been a very long passion of his. I know that in the last parliament, when I was minister for education, he and some very determined and very effective advocates from his community who had worked with him for a long period and of time came to see me about their concerns about low post-school participation in their local community. In truth, when we looked at the statistics the member for Lyne and his community had a lot to be concerned about, because by the standards of the nation and by the standards of some other parts of the nation their community was at risk of falling behind. And they were determined to change that. As part of that determination we worked with them to provide $165,000 to the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council to undertake a tertiary education feasibility study. It is very good work for a local community to do. I spoke a while ago about the importance of keeping our economy strong, and of course that is central to everything that the government does. But I understand that, whilst we work to keep our economy strong, that in and of itself does not spread opportunity around the nation. We need to do more. And the work that the member has been doing with his local community is about doing more and is about making postschool opportunities available in his own community. Consequently, I am pleased that, through that work, an application will come forward to the regional round of the Education Investment Fund to create a multipartner university campus on the midNorth Coast of New South Wales. I know that the application will seek $20 million in seed funding. Of course, this will be looked at by our experts who oversee the Education Investment Fund, but this is very important work to build on what has been done in the past. The member asked me to contrast this approach with the work of the Grattan Institute. I am a very big respecter of the Grattan Institute and, of course, I will study their work, but my sense is that in order to keep building opportunity in regional Australia we need to go down the kind of pathways that the member and his community are looking to go down. And I think we should reassure ourselves that change is possible. A lot of people said to me in my early days as Minister for Education that you cannot change the fact that when it comes to university education poorer kids and kids from rural and regional areas tend to miss out. They said it is a given, it is a disadvantage that is compounded earlier in life, and you cannot make a difference to the university level. We have proved that wrong already by the changes we have made in university education: more places, loadings to universities to actually go out and work with low-SES communities, more reward in terms of a regional loading and a fairer system of youth allowance. The result of that is that, whilst the participation rate of rural and regional kids in university was going down under the Howard government, now it is coming back up. That is good news for anybody who genuinely cares about the prospects and life chances of people in rural and regional Australia. I certainly believe we need to do more. This is a pathway to do more. I think it will stand as a very innovative model for communities around the nation and I am looking forward to continuing working with the member on it. Welfare Reform",93
111,Mr LYONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. How is the government reforming welfare to boost participation and get more people into jobs?",94
112,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (14:47): I thank the member for Bass for his question, as he knows that this government's first priority is to keep the economy strong so we can keep families in jobs. This budget builds on our very strong record of supporting and creating jobs. There are now 750,000 more Australians in work than there were when we came into office in November 2007. We believe that more Australians should be able to share in the benefits of our strong economy-enjoy the financial and the social benefits that come from work. Too many Australians have missed out on a job for far it at too long. This budget delivers a very significant workforce participation package which rewards work and provides new opportunities but which also introduces new requirements and new obligations on those who are looking for work. It also takes a very innovative approach to addressing disadvantage in targeted locations around our country. There are specific measures and support for different groups, such as wage subsidies for the long-term unemployed and new participation obligations for teenage parents, jobless families and younger people on the disability pension. There are more support services, such as the new Communities for Children initiative. All of these initiatives are designed to couple intensive support with increased obligations, to give that extra help that people need to get them into work and to make sure that they too are able to share in economic opportunities. This government is pioneering a new welfare equation. On the one side, there is an expectation that people should take personal responsibility for themselves and for their children-to make sure that their children get to school, to make sure that they provide a secure and caring home and to make sure that they plan for the future. On the other side, there is an expectation that government must be there to deliver the conditions in the welfare system-the practical support and the opportunities that foster personal responsibility. This new welfare equation has been acknowledged by organisations like the Brotherhood of St Laurence: At long last we see policy initiatives that recognise that the most disadvantaged in our community have modest mainstream aspirations and that they won‘t shy from increased obligations in welfare if they are matched with more and better assistance. This is the test of the new welfare morality: that increased obligations are commensurate with the additional assistance on offer. It‘s a test that the welfare initiatives in the Budget pass. Road Infrastructure",94
113,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I address my question to the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer. Is the government considering changes to the two-week-old budget to restore funding to the M2-F3 design works in this financial year?,95
114,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for that question, because there has been a degree of discussion about road funding in New South Wales, and a lot of it has been inaccurate. I pay tribute to the fantastic job the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, our roads minister, is doing. He sat down, along with the Prime Minister, to work our way through infrastructure issues in New South Wales. He reached agreement with some ministers in New South Wales. It is just a pity their Premier ratted on the deal.",95

116,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is actually what happened. We remain committed to investing in roads in New South Wales, in suburban Sydney, along the Pacific Highway and out into our great regions. We are very proud of our record of investing in infrastructure in road, rail and ports. Our minister is doing a fantastic job there, and there is absolutely no need for any changes to our budget.  of order. The question contained no debate and no argument. It went to one very specific road and one very specific budget measure and he has yet to deal with the issue at all in his answer.",95
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Human Services and the Minister for Social Inclusion. How is the government assisting Australians back into the workforce through new employment and participation measures announced in the budget?,95
118,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sydney-Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister for Human Services) (14:53): I thank the member for Throsby. I visited Shell Harbour with the member for Throsby last week. On Tuesday, I visited Wyong with the member for Dobell and the member for Shortland. On Friday, I visited Elizabeth with the member for Wakefield. I looked at three of the 10 sites for new employment and participation programs that were announced in the recent budget. In each location, local members and I met with community organisation that will work with the government to help jobseekers back into the workforce. This budget has focused squarely on jobs. It has focused on education and training to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom make it into every corner of Australia, including some of our most disadvantaged communities. In our new location based approach, welfare recipients will have greater responsibilities to participate but they will also have extra help. Centrelink will have dedicated case workers for the most disadvantaged jobseekers and will work closely and in many cases under the same roofMr Christensen interjecting",95
119,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Peter Griffin just cannot keep it down. We have Stewie up here; we have Peter Griffin down there. Just keep a lid on it, Peter Griffin.",96
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister should not encourage people to interject and the interjector should cease. The minister has the call.,96
121,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Centrelink is going to have dedicated case workers for the most disadvantaged jobseekers and will work closely and in many cases under the same roof with financial counselling services, drug and alcohol counselling services, housing and homelessness services and other types of services to help long-term unemployed back into the workforce by overcoming the issues that have kept them unemployed. Case coordination will allow Centrelink case workers to work more closely with jobseekers. For example, instead of a jobseeker turning up and talking to any person who happens to be on the counter, they will have a dedicated case worker. After all that time that they may have been too embarrassed to tell Centrelink that they cannot read and write well enough to fill in an application form a job, they will now have one person who they can talk to who can help them access one of the 30,000 literacy and numeracy places that we have funded in this budget. A homeless jobseeker might get the help that they need to stabilise their housing so that they have a place to have a shower and a good sleep and a place where employers can phone them so that they can get back into the workforce. Non-government organisations will be working with us to identify the most important local changes that they can make. We have a local solutions fund of $25 million to support those local changes. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs talked about changes for teenage parents and jobless families. We want those teenage parents to reach year 12 or get an equivalent qualification. We want their kids to be school ready. We want welfare recipients to be able to keep more of what they earn, because we know that part-time work is often a stepping stone back into full-time employment and we want to make that part-time work count. These are just a few of the measures that the government introduced in the most recent budget to target the most disadvantaged jobseekers. In mining boom mark II we cannot allow whole regions to be left behind as they were during mining boom mark I. We have heard very little from the Leader of the Opposition on these new measures since the budget two weeks ago. He continues to be all opposition and no leader. Carbon Pricing",96
122,Mr TUDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the comments of the President of the Municipal Association of Victoria, Mr Bill MCArthur, who said, If the carbon price is set at $25 per tonne, rate increases in excess of three per cent are likely.' What compensation will the government be providing to municipal councils, or will residents simply have to add rising council rates to their already stretched budgets?",96
123,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. Here we go with the ongoing scare campaign from those opposite. They have not got the guts to face up to the tough decisions that we need to make to protect our economy and our environment for the future, so they just make things up day after day. We had the manufacturing spokesman out the other day claiming that there were going to be millions of jobs lost in Australia. I know what would have happened if they had been in charge during the global recession: there would have been hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in this country. They are a huge risk to our economy.",97

147,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I know he is very concerned about the health of the constituents in his electorate. Our party has a very firm stance on tobacco and a very firm stance on tobacco donations. Tobacco kills you, and we will do all we can to reduce its harm. Our party, the Labor Party, does not take donations from these companies that sell death. Seven years ago the Labor Party ceased taking donations from tobacco companies. Next year plain-packaging reforms will begin, and our tobacco control measures will then be comprehensive-including antismoking as, banning internet as, an excise acutely increase and nicotine patches on the PBS.",98

And what they clearly show is that current packages dilute from the health warnings. It shows that packages has an impact on young people and their perception of cigarettes and those who smoke them. It is for these reasons that it is not surprising that we have the support of doctors, of nurses, of the Cancer Council, of the Heart Foundation, of QUIT and many more.",98
153,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,98
154,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, those who are interjecting might be interested to know that we have the support of a few Liberal Party members as well. Maybe somebody known to those opposite, the Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, supports our reform. The New South Wales Liberal health minister, Jillian Skinner, supports our reform. The Liberal health minister in Victoria, David Davis, supports our reforms. Brendan Nelson, a former Liberal ministernot a health minister, but a doctor-and a former leader, supports our reforms. The member for Moore, a doctor and current member of the Liberal Party, and the member for O'Connor, support our reforms. But we have the Leader of the Opposition, a former health minister, who states: … one cigarette, I am told, does you damage. it does you so little damage. Can you believe a health minister would say these sorts of things? There are only four groups in the community that currently oppose our messages: British American Tobacco, Phillip Morris, the Liberal Party and the National Party-two tobacco companies, two political parties. And there is a reason that they are linked. I do not think I could put it any better than cartoonist David Rowe did in the Financial Review today, in his cartoon, 'Welcome to Abbott country. Enjoy the smooth taste of tobacco donations'! It is about time the Liberal Party stopped receiving donations from tobacco companies. It has been reported that the Leader of the Opposition is so worried about this that he has silenced his MPs from talking about it. That might be why the member for O'Connor, who has come out supporting our measures, explained that he is against the coalition's approach. He supports our measures, explaining: 'As you know, I'm a little bit different from the rest of the Nationals'. Well, he is certainly right about that. It is time for Mr Abbott to quit his habit, to stop putting the money and donations before good public policy and to start supporting this measure. Kick the habit, Mr Abbott!",98

They have estimated But that their costs will increase by approximately $1 million per annum under a carbon tax. What compensation will the government be providing to businesses like Aarons Linen Service or will they simply have to shed staff to stay in business?",99
156,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," It is a bit rich for members of the coalition to come into this House and pretend to be friends of business, given their recent behaviour.

The Treasurer is responding, he knows the requirements of his response and he has the call.",100
163,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The concerns of business and the pace of business in Australian society is of immense importance. Of course, business is a very significant employer in our economy. The government wants to support business and we have supported business very strongly, not just during the global recession, but also by putting in place measures which will assist business. We understand that, in our two-speed or patchwork economy, not everyone in business is doing well. We set out over a year ago to make sure that we put in place a series of initiatives which would assist business. The first one was a big tax cut or a significant tax for small business via the $5,000 instant asset write-off and our proposals to bring down the corporate rate of tax over time. They are opposing the revenue source that will provide that advantage for Australian business. They ought to be acutely embarrassed because they have a view that the mining industry already pays too much tax and that small business and the rest of business should not get a tax cut. I think they are acutely embarrassed by that. As we go forward in designing an emissions trading scheme we are acutely aware that we have to get the settings right and acutely aware that what we must do for just our country is to support growth in our economy. That is what we are doing as we consult with business, as we consult with the community and as we work through the multiparty committee. We are doing all of those things. Of course, those opposite just want to promote a scare campaign. We will I conclude the details of an emissions trading scheme as soon as we can, and we will go out there and vigorously have a debate about who is going to support our economy, set us up for the future, create the jobs of the future, get the investment in renewable energy and make sure we protect this planet, this country, for our children and our grandchildren. Tobacco Products",100
164,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing. As the minister responsible for medical research, why is evidence based policy-making important, and is the minister aware of any additional evidence to support the government's decision to move forward with the plain packaging of tobacco products?",100
165,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I spoke yesterday about 12 different research studies covering the issues of branding, design and the promotion of tobacco packaging. Today I want to bring the attention of the House to a review of the evidence released yesterday by the Cancer Council. The review pulls together the findings from 24 targeted studies over two decades and demonstrates very clearly that the look and the feel of tobacco packaging is a very powerful marketing tool, particularly for the recruitment of new smokers. Recruiting young Australians to smoking is important to big tobacco. If you want to make a profit in the tobacco business, you need new customers and you need them regularly. The shadow minister said on Sky yesterday: I just don't have the evidence one way or the other. ... I've asked the Government to produce the evidence. We've said we've got an open When the Prime Minister invited me to joint her ministry, she did not inform me that one of my duties to the Australian people was to act as the research assistant to the member for Dickson, but I am very, very happy to do so on this occasion. Professor Ian Olver from the Cancer Council said yesterday: I think anyone who reads the review and understands how public health science works see that the evidence is compelling and very difficult to refute. Lyn Roberts from the Heart Foundation said: This is very convincing science, based on the most rigorous study models available. The evidence is there. The opposition has no more excuse for delay. Any more prevarication on this measure will just confirm suspicions that they are simply doing the bidding of big tobacco. Whether that is a reality or not is not the point; fast becoming a perception that is setting in. I was part of the meeting of the national executive of the Labor Party several years ago which decided to refuse tobacco donations. As a long-time member of that august body, I can honestly say that it does not often offer the best moments that the Labor Party has to offer the nation, but that was an exception. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition if he were interested in this debate and was here: take our advice and take the advice of many of your own branches and get this monkey off your back. It may be a rich monkey but it is a monkey nonetheless. Read the research and get behind this world leading reform measure. For the assistance of the House, I table these documents: Plain packaging of tobacco products: a review of the evidence prepared by Quit Victoria, Cancer Council of Victoria, May 2011; Is your package an effective communicator? A normative framework for increasing the communicative competence of mind. packaging from the Journal of Marketing Communications; Making the pack the hero, tobacco industry response to marketing restrictions in the UK: findings from a long term audit; Plain packaging: a time for action from the European Journal of Public Health; Plain packaging regulations for tobacco products: the impact of standardizing the color and design of will cigarette packs from Salud Pública de México; Deadly in pink: the impact of cigarette packaging among young women; Beyond light and mild: cigarette brand descriptors and perceptions of risk in the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey; and the remainder of those 23 journals. I am sure the shadow minister will spend a long night reading them tonight. Carbon Pricing",100
166,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I it is refer my question without notice to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to comments of Chris Hind, the chief operating officer at regional airline Rex: 'The timing of the carbon tax could not be worse. Rex will be forced to close many marginal regional routes.' Treasurer, what compensation will the government be providing to businesses like Rex or will Rex simply have to raise airline ticket costs to stay in business?",101
167,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have already addressed all of the issues associated with that question. When we have designed the emissions trading scheme we will announce all the details and then we will have a debate about its impact for business and households, its benefit to the country in the long term and the short term, and the fact that we are going to set this country up so we can prosper into the future with lower carbon growth absolutely critical to the future of country although not understood by any of those opposite apparently.",102
168,Mr Baldwin,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I point specifically to the issue of relevance. I asked specifically what compensation will the government be providing to businesses like Rex.",102
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! the Treasurer is responding to the question.,102
170,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have said the government is working its way through all these issues to design the scheme. We do that in good faith. We do it in the national interest. What this is all about from those opposite today is to cover over the very deep divisions that we have seen on their side of politics-deep divisions over tobacco, deep divisions over tax, deep divisions over climate changewhich have been all too apparent out there in the papers day after day. That is what we have-a smokescreen to cover up for the fact there is no alternative economic policy and no vision for the future of the country whatsoever. Climate Change Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (15:19): question is to the Prime Minister. For the benefit of those members who were not present at the Climate Commission Forum yesterday, will the Prime Minister update the House on what the latest climate science tells us and how it contributes to evidence based policy making?",102
171,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Petrie for a question which invites this parliament to consider the facts. I know there are some who will struggle with this concept, considering the facts, but that is what the Climate Commission Forum yesterday in Parliament House was all about. It was an opportunity for all members of parliament to this listen to the facts and to hear about global warming and the science. I want to acknowledge each and every member who did attend the forum. I want to acknowledge the role of the member for New England in ensuring the forum happened here in Parliament House. These forums are important because they are about evidence and facts. In yesterday's forum the scientists told us that global temperatures are rising and in Australia the number of hot days has doubled over the last 50 years. The scientists told us that another 20 centimetres of rise by 2050 would more than double the risk of coastal flooding. The scientists told us of the damage already being done to the Great Barrier Reef through nine major coral-bleaching events since 1979. The scientists told us about the greater risks of extreme weather events like floods, bushfires and cyclones. Despite this evidence from the scientists, the reaction generally of the opposition has been to attack the scientists. We have seen Nick Minchin in particular go out and attack the scientists, claiming it is offensive to say that the debate about climate change is over My and that it all needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Then there is the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly could not be bothered to look at this important report, who falsely claimed that it backed his direct action plan, whereas in fact the report actually says that such a measure would not enable us to meet our emissions reduction targets. It is a very worrying sign from the opposition that they continue to be mired in climate change denial. We know that from their general failure to attend the forum yesterday. We also know it from the member for Wentworth on Lateline who very clearly said that the Leader of the Opposition's plan is the sort of plan you have when you want one that does not work, the sort of plan you have when you want one that you can stop because in truth you are a climate change sceptic and denier and all of this is a pretence to the Australian people. I detect a theme here across the issues that have been under debate in this parliament this week. There we have the opposition on the side of the big polluters rather than tackling climate change. There we have the opposition on the side of big tobacco rather than with those who would try to save Australian lives by encouraging people not to smoke. What this shows is that the Leader of the Opposition in every area rejects the evidence; he rejects the expert advice. It goes to show what a risk he is and how mired he is in the past. He is stuck back in a time where people apparently did not think smoking was a worry for public health. He is stuck back in a time before the scientific consensus became that climate change is real. On this side of the House we will continue to deal with these challenges. We will continue to do what we need to do to prepare this country for the future-accept the evidence, deal with the facts, design the policies and implement them. We are not stuck in the past and stuck in denial like the Leader of the Opposition. Budget",102

What we are on about here is serious policy. What we are seeing from those on the other side of the House is that they have no alternative vision for our country order: as the whole budget forecast is predicated on the answer to this question, you would think the Treasurer would simply know the answer. If he does not, he should sit down.",103

We had a Leader of the Opposition who could not talk about jobs in his budget reply, and the same for the shadow Treasurer. Both of them failed to talk about the floods and their impact on the Australian economy, nor did they address the consequences of having our terms of trade at 140-year highs. What we have got is a group of people who are absolutely unqualified to put forward an alternative economic policy for this country and it is on display for everybody to see. Carbon Pricing",104

183,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,104
184,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!. The member for Canberra has the call. The clock will be reset. The member for Canberra can commence her question again and hopefully be heard in relative silence.,104
185,Ms BRODTMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Is the minister aware of recent comments in relation to policies to reduce carbon emissions and tackle dangerous climate change? What is the government's response?",104
186,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I would like to thank the member for Canberra for her question because there has certainly been some important commentary over the last week or so in relation to climate change. In fact, two opposition frontbenchers have, over the last week, shredded the Leader of the Opposition's sham subsidies-for-polluters policy on climate change. The member for Wentworth I think made a very valid point last week that the whole purpose of the coalition's policy is that it can be easily dumped if you do not really accept and respect the climate science and accept the responsibility of having to deal with it. So it is a policy that can be dumped at any time and that is one of its purposes. The member for Wentworth also made it clear that, if the subsidies-for-polluters policy ever really went ahead, taxpayers would foot the bill to the tune of around $18 billion per year by the year 2050. This is because their policy pays polluters and taxes families to fund it. That much was confirmed by the member for Flinders, the shadow minister, last night in a quite extraordinary appearance on 7.30 where he made a number of very important admissions about the coalition policy. On the television the member for Flinders admitted that the policy was in fact temporary, that he was focussing on nothing more than a 10-year horizon for the policy potentially, which is not much good when investors are looking for certainty in long-lived assets that might have a life in the electricity-generating sector of anything from 30 to 50 years. He also made an extraordinary commitment on behalf of the coalition to subsidise electricity generators for an indefinite period of time by meeting capital and operating costs associated with the introduction of different technologies. Upon my request, my department has used some publicly available information to estimate the cost of the member for Flinders' commitment and it is up to $11 billion by the year 2020, with an ongoing cost after that of up to $1½ billion per year. So to fund that of the quite extraordinary multibillion dollar promise, the member for Flinders then volunteered that he would dip into the shadow Treasurer's already discredited budget savings, which is yet another blow to the shadow Treasurer's savings promises. Therefore, in one single interview, the member for Flinders exposed fundamental flaws in both the subsidies for polluters policy and their budget policy. No-one can take their climate change position seriously. We have heard all about, during the last few days, all of those who comment on that side on the climate science. Take, for example, the member for Indi, who was every quick to dismiss the Climate Commission's science report, making the absurd claim that this report-the report itself-will shut down Australia as a modern industrialised economy. No exaggeration in that one. She was joined by the member for Gippsland, who suggested the report was a political agenda of the government. This is an independent science commission. We have had Senator Boswell out. We have had Senator Abetz out. We have had Senator Minchin out. The fact of the matter is simple on this issue: those on that side deny the science. They will not respect the scientific evidence and they have no credible policy to deal with it.

198,The SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Hon. the Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to address costof-living pressures on Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen the Griffin design in their places",114
199,Mr ABBOTT,IMPORTANCE," There is no doubt whatsoever that this government has in fact failed to address the cost-of-living pressures on Australians. And is it any wonder when this government has a Treasurer who cannot provide simple answers to simple questions, who cannot provide straight answers to straight questions and who responds with mindless aggression and vituperation every time he is caught out. This is a government which has comprehensively failed to address the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. This is a government which has turned the working families of 2007 into the forgotten families of 2011. This is a government that is going to make a bad situation oh so much worse with its carbon tax-that tax which dared not speak its name before the election, that tax which dare not be referred to in the budget and that tax which even the Northern Territory Labor controlled assembly wants the Australian government to ditch. For the benefit of the House and anyone who happens to be listening, let me read the resolution that was passed by the Northern Territory Assembly, an assembly with a Labor government. This resolution passed without dissent by the Northern Territory legislature calls 'on the Australian government to exempt the Northern Territory from the proposed carbon emissions taxes for at least 50 years or until such time as global consensus has been reached on a worldwide carbon emissions reduction plan'. The families of this country are suffering because of the comprehensive inability of this government to address pressures. I know the statistics do not tell the full story but, nevertheless, the statistics tell a sad Australian families. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, since December 2007, the average price of power has gone up by 51 per cent; the average price of water has gone up by 46 per cent; the average price of gas, up by 30 per cent; the average cost of education by 24 per cent; the cost of health, up 20 per cent; the cost of groceries, up 14 per cent; rent, up 21 per cent; and, as every person paying off a house in this parliament and in this country knows only too well, since the middle of 2009, the average mortgage repayment in this country has gone up by no less than $500 a month, at a time when the pressures on families have never been greater and at a time when wages have gone up by a comparatively paltry seven per cent. It is just getting worse, because in many parts of Australia the statistics are worse than those averages. I refer the House to a report that has just been released by the Queensland Council of Social Service. You would think that at least that might have struck some responsive chord in the Treasurer as someone who comes from the City of Brisbane. In the City of Brisbane over the past five years residents are paying 23 per cent more for food; 35 per cent more for rent; 48 per cent more for public transport; and a staggering 63 per cent more for electricity, gas and water. It is bad, and it is going to get much worse because this government wants to hit the struggling families of Australia with more taxes. During the election campaign the Prime Minister said-and I remember this statement very well because it was a statement that the Prime Minister made at the famous Rooty Hill forum of the election campaign. She said: What I would like to say is we are a governmentstory for more a rabble than a governmentthat's tried to understand and provide that little bit of help with cost-of-living pressures. A little bit of help alright, and having made that statement just a fortnight before the election what does she do? She adds massively to cost-of-living pressures with the carbon tax. That statement that the Prime Minister made during the election-and I have had a quick look at the statements that the Prime Minister made during the election and on at least seven locations the Prime Minister put her hand, metaphorically at least, on her heart and said, 'I feel your pain; I understand; I am doing something about cost-of-living pressures.' All of those statements turn out to be about as truthful, about as honest and about as straight as the infamous statement that she made six days before polling day, 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Let us look at the Queensland Council of Social Service study. That looked at the predicament of a working family. The Queensland Council of social service still talks about working families, unlike the Labor Party. According to QCOSS, a working family on average weekly earnings-a husband, a wife and two children-is just $3 a week ahead. Their expenses are just $3 a week less than their income. So what is this government going to do to that family? It is going to put in place a carbon tax, which according to the Treasury modelling will add $863 a year, or $16.50 a week, to a family that is already only $3 out of the red. This carbon tax is going to tip all those families that are only just staying afloat, this toxic tax based on a lie is going tip all of those families into debt every single week. Let us look at what this toxic tax will do to the cost of living of the families of Australia. Just for starters it will add 25 per cent to the power bills of people. That is $300 a year for the average family power bill just for starters. It will add 6½c a litre to the price of petrol, just for starters. The Food and Grocery Council, who very kindly facilitated a visit of mine today to the IGA Supermarket at Hawker, estimates that the average price of a trolley of groceries will increase by five per cent as a result of a $26 a tonne carbon tax. But it is not just the cost of living impacts; it is the impact on the jobs, on the employment, on the weekly income of the families of Australia. There will be 26,000 fewer jobs in the mining industry and the closure of 16 major coal mines. There will be 45,000 fewer jobs in energy-intensive industries-that is, fewer jobs in steel, fewer jobs in aluminium, fewer jobs in cement, fewer jobs in plastics, fewer jobs in class, fewer jobs in the motor industry, and there will be 126,000 fewer jobs mostly in regional Australia. These are the dire consequences for families' cost of living of this tax based on a lie, the tax that the Prime Minister did not have the guts, the honesty and the decency to be upfront about with the Australian people before the election. But this is not the only tax that this government wants to impose. Over the last 3½ years, we have seen a succession of tax grabs, when this government has reached its long hand into every single Australian's pocket to rip out of those pockets the hardearned incomes of ordinary Australians. There is the alcopops tax, which is going to rip $3.1 billion out of the pockets of Australian families over four years. There is to the cigarette tax, which is going to rip $5 billion out over four years-and I do not like smoking any more than the next person, but overwhelmingly those who will be affected by this tax are some of the least privileged, least well-off people in our community.",114

This is a government which cannot be trusted with the well-being of the families of Australia because it cannot be trusted with the truth. Day after day, we have examples of this government's inability to tell the truth. It is worth, just for a moment, reminding the House of that which the government sought to hide yesterday. We have a Treasurer who was told about mining royalties in Western Australia in a personal briefing with the Premier. He had at least one letter from the Western Australian government referring to those royalties. He had a briefing from his own department referring to those royalties. He even had a phone call from the Premier's office the day before the Western Australian budget was brought down, and still he had the hide to tell the people of Australia, 'Well, first of all, Mr Barnett did not communicate to us that he was going to do this'-an absolute blatant untruth; a complete, utter and absolute untruth.",116

When the Treasurer was nailed, he tried to weasel out of it by telling this parliament: 'Suddenly out of the blue it came.' Well, this suddenly came out of the blue on no fewer than eight separate occasions. This is a government which is utterly incompetent, utterly untrustworthy and is going to make the welfare and the well-being of the people of Australia worse and worse year by year if it gets its way, because of its toxic carbon tax. We hear the Prime Minister saying, 'There will be compensation.' Let the people of Australia understand: the compensation will be temporary; the tax will be permanent. The compensation will be whittled away; the tax will be ratcheted up. We know that the Greens think that it will have to be at least $40 a tonne to drive a change from coal to gas. And what is the point of having it if it does not drive a change from coal to gas? But it is supposed to do more than that; it has got to drive a change from fossil fuels to renewables. To do that, it will have to be $100 a tonne. There is no carbon tax that is high enough to satisfy the Greens. There is nothing that this Prime Minister will not end up doing to satisfy the Greens, because the Greens are the people who keep her in power-or keep her in office. She might be in office; Bob Brown is in power, and that is why the future of the families of Australia is in peril from a bad government that just gets worse every single day.",117
212,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (15:51): I waited for 15 minutes for the Leader of the Opposition to truly address this matter of public importance about cost-of-living pressures in Australia, but I have to say I respond more in sorrow than in anger, because of the inability of the opposition to come to what really matters-how you deal with cost-of-living pressures in this country. The best way to address cost-of-living pressures in Australia is to have a good job and fair pay and conditions. That is why this government certainly passes the test, in terms of creating jobs. The budget we have just introduced into the parliament has a big focus on the creation of jobs. Let me remind the House of some of the things we are doing to assist in the creation of jobs. If you have a job in this country you have a chance to pay the bills. If you do not have a job in this country life is that much harder. In fact, in this country we have seen over the last three years, at a time that Labor has been the steward of the national economy, the creation of 750,000 jobs and we are predicting half a million new jobs to be created over the next two years. When I was a student studying economics in the mid-1980s, it was said that full employment or achieving somewhere near full employment was a matter of history and could never be the case in the future. But, in fact, we have seen in recent years the unemployment rate in Australia fall to less than five per cent. This was unimaginable a decade and a half or two decades ago. We understand that if we are to maintain this record high employment government policy needs to be focused upon jobs. That is why we are putting an extra $200 million into helping train and create apprenticeships. That is why we are liberalising the apprenticeship system so that people complete their apprenticeships more quickly if they satisfy the requirements. Also, we have to understand that if we want to be able to cope with the cost of living we have to have fair wages and conditions. That is why we overturned the unfair Work Choice laws. The current opposition would like to pretend that they never happened. The laws that we have now put in place ensure that people can get a reasonable minimum wage and ensure that they are free to bargain if they choose to do so. But, of course, if we are going to deal with the cost of living the story cannot just be about jobs, although I think that is the central feature of dealing with costs, and it cannot just be about dealing with fair pay and conditions. I think it also goes to what sort of tax system we have in this country. How can we ensure that people are able to have greater economic control over their own lives? One great myth of Australian politics is that the Liberal and National parties represent small tax and somehow Labor represents high-taxing governments. The numbers tell a different story. When you look at the proportion of taxation in this country you see that in the last five years of the Howard government, between 2002 and 2007, Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of GDP-or, put another way, Mr Howard's tax hand in your pocket-were above 25 per cent. Indeed, from every $100,000 that the Australian economy would create under the Howard government $25,000 was going in Commonwealth tax receipts. This is in stark contrast to the years of Labor administration since 2007. In fact, as a proportion of GDP, Commonwealth tax receipts are somewhere around 21 per cent. Put another way, in plain English, we see further that under a Labor government from every $100,000 that the Australian economy creates Commonwealth tax receipts are in the order of $21,000. This means that our Labor administration is the government that is ensuring that Australians have more of their wealth, not less of their wealth. We are enabling the growth of the Australian economy.",117
213,Unknown,IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,118
214,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"While a couple of members of the opposition would like to decry these facts I am sure they have taken our tax cuts and spent them. We in a Labor government are not sectarian. We do not mind if those opposite get tax cuts too. We are just a little disappointed with the lack of a thankyou note-and I will not wait for a thankyou note from some of these people as they will never be grateful. Let us look beyond the tax system and beyond the jobs narrative and, indeed, beyond fair pay and conditions. Let us look at the safety net. What is the government doing to assist families and to assist individuals when they are doing it tough, when their incomes do not lead them to a life whereby they are able to automatically deal with all of the issues on their own without the assistance of government? We on the government side of this parliament understand that one of the things you do to assist people over cost-of-living pressures is increase pensions. Again, this is a story of significant achievement. It might not always make the front page of the newspapers. Nonetheless, millions of aged-care pensioners, millions of disability pensioners and hundreds of thousands of people in receipt of veterans payments have seen the pensions fortnightly amount increase by something like $124 or $126. Indeed, you can look at this same issue and apply it across to the parents of teenage children who are eligible to receive family tax benefit payments. In this budget we have recognised that it is important that families are supported with the costs of educating their teenage children. As teenagers grow, from their early teens to their late teens, they do not get any cheaper to look after. Their appetites do not in any fashion diminish. So it is not possible to discount the cost of raising these children. Mr Fletcher interjecting",118

219,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"Yes, he's not here to hear the praise. But I am sure that will get back to him. But in terms of family tax benefit payments, we are providing to no less than 650,000 children and their families650,000 Australian teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 who deserve a go in life and who deserve the best chances that this lucky and wealthy nation can providepayments of up to $4,200. Mr Tehan interjecting",119
220,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Wannon interjects but what I understand is that I live in the real world and I judge budgets and political rhetoric by how they affect individuals and families. What we see here are higher pensions under Labor and what we see is an education tax refund being introduced. What we also see in this budget is the extension of education tax refunds to some of those incidental but fundamentally necessary costs of life such as payment for school uniforms. We are doing things from the teen dental plan and the low-income tax offset right through to what we are doing for small business. Small business and the private sector are the engine rooms of the Australian economy, and this government understands that very clearly. Our Prime Minister and our Treasurer have both spoken in question time about the need to spread the prosperity of the minerals boom right across the Australian economy. Let us be clear: whilst the minerals boom mark 2 is an unvarnished benefit for certain regions and certain industries in Australia, the high dollar is making it harder in other areas. There is no question about that; these are matters of record. What we are seeking to do in our policies, in our budget and in our actions is to share the benefits of the mining boom throughout this great nation of ours. Upon the successful passage of the minerals resource rent tax we want to see the corporate tax rate in Australia reduced from 30 to 29 per cent. We want to extend this benefit very quickly to small business and then in subsequent years to larger business, but it does not stop there. We also recognise that Australians need to save more for their retirement. That is why this government is taking up the mantle of the Keating government by increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. We on this side of the House understand very clearly that people do not have enough money to retire on in many cases. That is why we need to increase the level of superannuation. One way we can afford this measure so that Australians can retire with more money than they might otherwise have is to offset the loss in Commonwealth revenue from the concessionally taxed amount of income being increased, through the ability of the minerals resource rent tax to help make up for lost Commonwealth revenue. Superannuation is an issue which the opposition like to gloss over. We want to increase superannuation from nine to 12 per cent because we think that, for people as they approach retirement, having more in their savings account will assist them, when they cease working, to deal with cost-of-living pressures. So it is with some great frustration that I note the comments of the opposition that they are against increasing compulsory minimum superannuation. I do not accept their logic that somehow it is a tax on business. It is not; it is offset with real wages growth. I do not accept the logic that it is not in Australia's interest to increase our national savings pool. What frustrates me at a personal level is that they do not practise what they preach. They are happy to receive defined benefit payments, or 15 per cent tax on superannuation, yet they would not provide 12 per cent to their voters. They are prepared to have one lifestyle themselves and yet they would not support their electorate and their constituents receiving a minimum payment over seven years of 12 per cent. This leads me to the bigger challenge of cost of living, and it leads me to a comparison between those opposite and the government. The Treasurer in his budget night address recognised that we are an economy in transition. Determined to get the budget into surplus, recognising that our historic terms of trade will not remain as high in future years and recognising the importance of getting our budget into surplus, he has overseen the fastest fiscal consolidation since we have been keeping the numbers-a remarkable accomplishment. But he also recognises that we are an economy in transition. The world does not owe this nation a future. Change is not something you should just let happen to you automatically; sometimes you have to be ahead of the change curve. We recognise in this nation-despite the disparaging remarks and the bullying tone of the Leader of the Opposition talking about a surplus made in China-that this is indeed the Asian century. We recognise that seven of our top 10 trading partners are Asian economies. We recognise the rise of Asia. We recognise that, whilst the commodities boom is a great gift to Australia, it is not an indefinite gift. We therefore need to make sure that we have the most skilled workforce. We recognise that our economy is in transition with the ageing of our population. We recognise that we need to take steps now to ensure that as our Australians grow older they do not retire poor. We on this side of the House recognise the power of information and the information pipeline. For Australian business, for Australian tourism and for Australian society and education, we need to be able to capture information, absorb it and disseminate and utilise it quickly. That is why we are pushing the National Broadband Network. We recognise that, in this economy in transition dealing with the transformative forces which are occurring throughout the world, we are not immune. We recognise that we need to carbon-proof our economy. We need to create a more sustainable economy. We also recognise through our actions that, as much as we are proud of our manufacturing and as much as we are proud of our mining, we are also a services economy. That is why we put such emphasis on our education and of course our participation rates in our measures. However, when you look at the cost of living, you cannot just judge the government in isolation from what the opposition say. Those opposite are indeed a material threat to the economic well-being of this nation. They are a threat.",119
221,Unknown,IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,121
222,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"No doubt the truth hurts, judging by the remarks of the opposition. Let us talk about some of their economic irresponsibility. First of all, during the election they had a black hole, unfunded promises, of somewhere near $11 billion. But it does not stop there. They proposed a paid parental leave scheme which would have been a tax on business which would have ultimately been passed through to consumers. What a silly idea. Now they have this Direct Action policy. They know that they have to be seen to do something about climate change. They are caught between two stools. They do not really want to accept that climate change exists, but their annoying, irritating polling keeps telling them that a majority of Australians-and, indeed, the vast majority of scientists-say it is happening. They know that Australians do not like the idea of great pollution in their cities and they know that they have to do something, but they are just not quite sure what. So they have proposed a Direct Action policy where all they will do is pay high-polluting companies lots of money. That is their plan, and of course families will have to pick up the tab because of a reluctance of those opposite to accept that we are an economy in transition. Let us not forget that, when the going gets tough, the opposition get going-somewhere else. When we proposed the flood levy for that catastrophic damage, of course on all sides we recognised the tragedy of the loss of life, but in terms of the economic damage done to infrastructure-to roads, to rail-on this side we understood that we had to reallocate priorities within government. We had to find cuts. We also supported a flood levy. Those opposite have the proverbial magic pudding. They were not prepared to support a flood levy but they were just going to say, 'We'll find the money elsewhere.' After one abortive attempt, tangling with foreign aid, they gave it up as a bad job. Anyway, in terms of cost of living, I am confident that the government are the best people to manage these issues. (Time expired)",121
223,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," This carbon tax is an allconsuming black hole from which no Australian family will escape. Labor in question time today showed absolutely no sympathy for the people they intend to hurt. Labor, the Greens and the Independents are simply out of touch with the feelings and the impact of their policies on real people. It is not 1,000 big companies that have to bear the impact of this tax; it is ordinary Australians, real Australian families. Do they really believe that these 1,000 companies, which they are not prepared to name, will simply absorb the billions of dollars that Labor expects to raise from its new tax? Of course they will not. Every dollar of it will be either passed on to consumers or it will have to be spent on redundancy payments for workers who will lose their jobs. They are not going to continue operating in Australia and absorb these costs when they can work in other places around the world where they do not have a tax like this, where it is cheaper to produce goods and where there is not this government imposed artificial imposition placed upon their business. The real cost of this giant tax does not fall on the 1,000 big companies; it falls on all Australians. This tax will mean higher electricity, higher food prices, higher transport costs and sacked staff. Ordinary families are going to cop this carbon tax in the neck. We saw today how little government members actually care about the impact of this tax on ordinary families. The Treasurer showed absolutely no sympathy for the families identified by the Queensland Council of Social Service in its Cost of living report 2011-no sympathy whatsoever. He does not seem to care that the people in his very own electorate-Brisbane residentsare paying 23 per cent more for food, 35 per cent more for rent, 48 per cent more for public transport and 63 per cent more for electricity, gas and water since Labor came to office. Labor simply does not care. Yet they are now proposing another new impost on all of these families. A $26-pertonne carbon price will add another $300 to the price of electricity that Brisbane consumers will have to pay. Gas will be up 10 per cent; petrol will be up 6.5 cents a litre, plus GST; and of course water and groceries will all be slugged. We also heard todayand again the Treasurer just simply did not care-that rates are going to go up in Victoria by three per cent, and the Treasurer is not proposing any compensation and has no plan to deal with this extra cost to the people who live in Victoria. Also, Rex will have to increase airfares. The city based backbenchers just scoffed. They do not care about country communities being denied air services. They have hourly flights to wherever they want to go-around the world if you happen to be the foreign minister-but those who have to depend upon a regional airline like Rex are going to have extra costs, and this government could not care less. And what about Aarons Linen Service$1 million in extra costs and 200 jobs at risk-and the Leader of the House and the 'minister for blocking roads in his own electorate' accuse Aarons of making it all up. They do not actually care about the jobs that will be lost and the impact on ordinary people. All of that is at just a $26-a-tonne carbon price. That will be the highest carbon tax anywhere in the world. We are going to start off with the highest carbon tax anywhere in the world-higher than the European Union, who have been fiddling around and messing this up for years and higher than any of the countries that are held up to us as great examples. The Chinese, who we are supposed to be following in this, are actually going to increase their emissions by 500 per cent. Those are the sorts of people being used as examples. We will have the highest carbon tax in the world, and that is if it starts at only $26. We know the Greens want $40 to start with, rising very quickly to $100. They also want fuel to be included in the carbon tax regime and we all know that fuel prices are one of the many things that are guaranteed to feed into the cost of living again and again. It does not get refunded along the way; it gets added on again every time a new transaction occurs. And of course people in regional areas are the most affected because they have to travel greater distances as a matter of necessity. Regional families driving to work, getting the kids to and from school and going to the doctor will more often than not involve lengthy road trips. The government is suggesting that people should change their behaviour. Are they suggesting that families should not take their children to the doctor? Are they suggesting that they should give up their job or live nearer to the factory or the school? It is possible to change your behaviour in that way to deliver the carbon savings that the government is talking about. Families will just have to cop it in the neck. The basic household cost will go up and mums and dads will have to find ways to bear that cost. This is not some kind of scare tactic on the part of the opposition. We did not make this up. This is a regressive tax and increasing people's costs is precisely what is supposed to do. It is designed to make people think twice before switching on the heater in winter. You are supposed to freeze in the Canberra winter and not put on your heater, just so you can be more friendly to the environment. Frankly I am not quite sure that Canberra families are going to do that. think they may still use their heaters, and they will pay the cost. So the tax will not work. The tax will therefore have to go higher and higher, hurt more and more and cut deeper and deeper, so it will inevitably have a huge impact on the lifestyle of all Australian families. Australian families feel deeply let down by this government, particularly since the Prime Minister's election promise was that there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads. The Prime Minister and her carbon tax must surely lie uncomfortably together. She said there would not be one and now she is proposing to deliver it. But she made another promise and that was that she would build a community consensus before doing anything at all. In reality, we have got pretty much a community consensus at the present timeover 60 per cent of Australians have said 'no'. They do not want the tax. So there is a consensus and the Prime Minister should honour her promise and withdraw this whole silly idea. The reality is she has a consensus not and the consensus is 'no'. The Australian people do not want it. This is the tax that of course is going to reduce the temperature, and that is supposed to make us all feel great. Frankly I thought we had enough taxes in Australia already to freeze the entire continent, if taxes actually worked to lower the temperature. Greenland is not frozen because it has more taxes than Saudi Arabia. It is frozen because it is where it it is-because that is the way the climate is. This government believes it can change a country that is a desert into a frozen ice land simply by raising taxes. It simply will not work. The Prime Minister is struggling to get the message across, so she got big business into I Kirribilli House over the recent break to try to persuade them to support her carbon tax. Again, it was very, very interesting, I thought, that no representatives of small business were invited. It sounds a bit like the mining tax debacle. Families were not invited to her home. There was a big dinner that none of the families could afford and, over a glass of port that they could not afford, the Prime Minister tried to do a deal with big business to get them onside. Small business and families did not get a seat at her table, and they do not get a seat when it comes to considering the real impact of this tax on the men and women of Australia. As we move towards the introduction of this tax, this horrendous burden on all Australians, the Prime Minister needs to acknowledge that she has no mandate. Even if she can keep her duct taped Labor-Greensof Independents alliance together, she has no mandate from the Australian people. At least 86 per cent of the voters voted for parties and candidates who were opposed to a carbon tax before the last election and for candidates who said that they would not do it. All Labor Party, all Liberal Party and all Nationals members said there would be no tax. So the Prime Minister has no mandate. If she wants one, she must call an election.",121
224,Mr CLARE,IMPORTANCE," I think the people of Australia who are listening to the debate on this matter of public importance would appreciate the fantastic transformation that has happened inside the Liberal Party. Suddenly the Liberal Party has discovered cost-of-living pressures. They certainly did not when they were in government. The Leader of the Opposition quoted a couple of statistics, and I am happy to quote a few more. In the last term of the Howard government, the cost of the average family basket of groceries went up by 20 per cent, from $232 to $281. That is between 2004 and 2007. Mr MCCormack interjecting",124
225,Mr CLARE,IMPORTANCE,"At the same time, interest rates went up 10 times in a row. result of that, 10,000 Australian families had their homes repossessed. Mr MCCormack interjecting",124
226,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The honourable member for Riverina will remain silent.,124
227,Mr CLARE,IMPORTANCE,"Nowhere did this hurt more than in my electorate of Blaxland where, at the peak in 2007, we had 60 homes a month being repossessed. That is three homes a day for every working day being repossessed because Australian families could not cope with the cost-of-living pressures brought upon them by 10 interest rate rises in a row. On top of that, there was Work Choices whereby more than one million Australians had their wages or entitlements cut. And what was the response of the Liberal Party then? What was the response of the then Liberal Party Prime Minister? It was that Australians had never been better off. Give me a break. If gold medals were handed out for failing to help Australian families with the cost of living, then the Leader of the Opposition would look like Mr T. So I welcome a debate on cost of living, because it gives the government the opportunity to expose this hypocrisy for what it is and to expose the ludicrous scare campaign that is now being run by the Leader of the Opposition. The government understands that Australians struggle with cost-of-living pressures. It always does. We would never be so stupid as to say Australians have never been better off. We understand that Australians always struggle with cost-ofliving pressures. That is why we stimulated the economy-to protect Australian jobs and keep food on the table. That is why we increased the pension. Mr MCCormack interjecting",124
228,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"I warn the In 2007, as a member for Riverina.",124
229,Mr CLARE,IMPORTANCE,"That is why we introduced three tax cuts in a row. That is why we introduced the 50 per cent child care rebate and added uniforms to the education tax rebate. That is why this year's budget provides extra support for parents of teenagers in high school. It is also why we are taking action to bring the budget back to surplus as quickly as we are. The fact is that there is only one party in this parliament that has a plan to deal with the economic challenges that confront us as a nation. The Liberal Party, it must be said, has not had an economic plan for this country since Peter Costello left the building about three years ago. The challenge of the last term was to stop the Australian economy going into recession when the rest of the world did. The challenge of this term is to manage the boom. An economic boom driven by the mining sector will bring with it enormous wealth but, like the last one, it will also bring plenty of challenges. Unemployment is already low and, as the economy reaches capacity, skills shortages will grow. When demand for skilled labour outstrips supply it puts pressure on wages, on inflation and on interest rates. That is why the measures you see in the budget are so important to boost the number of skilled workers and to increase the number of people in the workforce. It is particularly important in an electorate like Blaxland where, despite the fact that the economy is so strong, unemployment is double the national average, teenage unemployment is still above 25 per cent and 16 per cent of the people who live in the electorate are on government income support. There is the challenge. We have an economy that needs workers to manage costof-living pressures, and there are still parts Australia where unemployment is high, where participation rates are low and where there are a lot of people on income support. Compare the two parties when it comes to tackling this economic challenge. In the budget you see a package to increase the number of skilled workers in the economysomething like a $3 billion package. This is not the first time there has been a skills package in the budget-it has come year after year after year-and you are already starting to see the impact of the investments we are making in skills and education. For example, there has been a 15 per cent increase in the last year in the number of Australians starting an apprenticeship or a traineeship. The number of people starting trade cadetships went up last year by almost 22 per cent. In 2009-10, university offers to people from low SES backgrounds increased by 8.8 per cent. Where is the opposition's plan? When the Leader of the Opposition gave his budget reply he barely mentioned jobs. He mentioned the word 'skills' once. He did not even release a skills policy at the last federal election. Their only policy was to cut $2 billion from apprenticeships and scrap the trade training centres being built around the country. This is the challenge that confronts us: managing the boom. We have a policy to increase participation rates and to increase the number of skilled workers in the economy, and there is nothing on the other side. But that is not the only challenge that the economy faces. There are other big challenges on the horizon. The ageing of the population is just one of them. By the time that I am 65, the number of people that age or older will have doubled, and that means that healthcare costs will increase, the cost of funding the pension will increase and there will be fewer taxpayers to pay the bills. The government's job is to help meet these of challenges. That is why health reform is important. That is why increasing the superannuation guarantee is important. That is why increasing workforce participation is so important. Beyond that, there are the challenges that we confront with the changes to our region; the challenge of converting the mining boom into a services boom. We stand now on the edge of the biggest middle class that the world has ever seen. By the end of this decade, Asia will have more middle class consumers than the rest of the world combined. This provides an enormous opportunity for Australia, for the Australian economy and for all Australians. The challenge for us here as members of this parliament is to ensure that Australia makes the most of it. The competition for this market will be fierce. We need to prepare now. Doing well here is the key to increasing the standard of living of all Australians and their quality of life. Doing well here is the key to the future of Australia. And what do we hear from the opposition on this? Absolutely nothing. What do we hear from them on the big challenges that confront the Australian economy? Absolutely nothing. The Leader of the Opposition takes his job description literally, I have to give him that. He opposes everything and he stands for nothing. The only thing that he stands for is election. He proved that in his budget reply. He talked a lot about vision but he did not offer any. The only vision that he has is of the Lodge, because all he talked about was an election. The Leader of the Opposition has all the vision of Mr Magoo. There was nothing in his budget reply about the challenges that this country faces or what we need to do to meet them. I tell you this: the people of Australia want a leader who understands the challenges ahead. They do not want Mr Magoo. What we got from the Leader of the Opposition-what we get every day in this parliament-is Mr Magoo and a dodgy scare campaign. He runs around the country day after day scaring Australians. He went to Whyalla and said that the carbon tax would wipe them off the map. He went to Geelong and told them that it would be the final nail in the coffin of the manufacturing industry. He went to Weet-Bix and said that it would destroy breakfast. He went to the fish markets and said that it would kill all the in the sea. This reminds me a lot of that bloke who ran around America demanding to see the President's birth certificate. This is hysterical and nonsensical scare campaign. What we have is a Leader of the Opposition who looks like Donald Trump without the hair-all Trump, no toupee. He did it again today when he said that groceries would go up by five per cent when in fact the CPRS modelling said that it would go up by 0.6 per cent to 0.8 per cent. He exaggerated things again by six to eight times. No wonder the people of Australia do not believe him. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (16:26): Under this government, we have seen prices skyrocket across the board. We have seen food, electricity, fuel, rent and mortgages all going up. Now we are about to see the introduction of the latest of the taxes by the government that delights in a succession of new taxes and levies designed to feed their tax and spend philosophy, the carbon tax. I accept the science; we accept the science. I avail myself of all the information. I listen to both sides, not just one side. I went to the talk given by the commission yesterday. I sat there and listened to it. I read the books. I get it-there is a carbon problem in the atmosphere. But this is not about carbonthis is about jobs; this is about industry. And this is not theory; this is what is actually happening. The minister said that it was all about Tony Abbott running around the country saying that this, that and the other thing is going to happen. I will tell you what actually happened last week. Xstrata announced that it would close its Townsville copper refinery because it is cheaper to process it overseas. They have said that this was not due to the carbon tax, but no-one can say that the carbon tax is going to make it cheaper; noone can say that the carbon tax is going to make it easier for business to comply. This is fish what the CEO of the Queensland Resources Council, Michael Roche, said: What the Xstrata decision does demonstrate is a that even very energy-efficient operations such as those operated by themXstrata's copper refineryin Queensland cannot compete against cheaper alternatives. My fear is that these closures are a foretaste of what will follow if the federal parliament agrees to impose an uncompetitive carbon price regime on our trade-exposed resource sector industries. It is not too late federal government to embrace a better way–one that safeguards our global competitiveness. This tax is attacking Townsville's copper refinery, where there are 170 direct jobs. There are 70 contractors. They sell $140 million worth of copper internationally and locally throughout the year. The ore will still be mined. It will still be made into concentrate. It will still be refined-just not in Australia. Who is going to go over to China or to Vietnam or wherever it is going to be processed and ask what the carbon processes are? Is it going to be the EPA? Are they going to go over there and say, 'I'd just like to check your carbon emissions?' Australia will not care once it is offshore. Once the jobs are gone, we will not care. Our emissions will be down and worldwide emissions will be up, with a net result of more pollution for the world. There are two other refineries in the city of Townsvilleone in my electorate and one in the neighbouring electorate. One is Sun Metals: 300 direct jobs, 1,500 indirect jobs and $300 million in annual sales, of which 80 per cent is exported. They are a world's best practice zinc refinery: 80 per cent exported, jobs in Townsville, industry in Townsville, real estate-everything that relies on it it in Townsville. Queensland Nickel is responsible for over 900 direct jobs and 2,300 indirect jobs-4.5 per cent of gross regional product in Townsville; $600 million per year into Townsville's economy. It was estimated, when it looked like BHP were going to shut it down before Clive Palmer came to the rescue and kept that place open, that the impact on our local economy, had that place closed and nothing happened there again, would have been $4.5 billion. Queensland Nickel is the perfect example of why this carbon tax is so bad. Queensland Nickel is a 100 per cent import-export for the business. They buy the ore internationally, on the market from New Caledonia. It comes into Australia and they refine it, using world's best practice, including sun drying and gas drying of the ore before it is refined. It is then sold on the international market. So if the carbon price comes in, and it makes our costs here such that we cannot buy the ore, we cannot process it. If the carbon tax comes in and we do get the ore, but our costs are so high that we need to get $15 a pound for it, whereas currently the international market is paying $11 a pound, we will not be competitive and jobs will be lost. What is the alternative? There are two other refineries that do it exactly the same way as Queensland Nickel: one in Cuba and one in Brazil. The one in Cuba you can look up on Google Maps, and you can see that noone goes through that bay. The pollution has killed absolutely everything. It is a dirty, dirty process. The other one is in Brazil. People in the nickel industry will tell you that it is such a dirty plant, so badly polluted that you can almost walk across the smoke. The other alternative is to sell it to China. China will take that ore. They will not use the same process; they will put it in a big coking furnace and burn the living daylights out of it to refine the ore. All three processes result in a net increase in pollution. All three processes do not stop the ore being refined. All three processes do not stop nickel being needed on the international market. What this carbon tax will do is stop it being processed in Townsville, lose 900 direct jobs in Townsville and 2,300 indirect jobs-and take $600 million per annum from the Townsville economy. And the ore will still be processed. It will still be mined in Mount Isa, it will still be turned into concentrate and it will still go overseas. I want to tell you about a local businessman in Townsville, Brad Webb, of BM Webb Group. He has 120 staff. He pays over $150,000 a week in wages. He has over $100 million in fixed assets, ranging from commercial buildings to quarries and fabrication. He reinvests every cent in Townsville. His words to me were, 'Mate, it just gets too hard.' With the flick of a switch, he could just turn it off, take all his business overseas and live off the passive income here and reinvest overseas. This tax will close local industry and export jobs overseas for no benefit at all. The member for Melbourne said on Lateline: Let's look at the Great Barrier Reef, where there's 63,000 people's livelihood dependent on that - more than the number of people employed in the coal mining industry … So what does it look like? Well it looks like an economy with a healthy tourist sector, a healthy services sector and a renewable energy sector that's the envy of the world. Can I tell you, mate: three industries provide employment for 4,000 people in Townsville at the moment. Our tourism industry is struggling and Cairns's unemployment is 12 per cent. Townsville's is 8½ per cent and the Gold Coast is at eight per cent. And you want, Mr Bandt, member for Melbourne, my little green mate-I would call him a leprechaun, but he doesn't have a pot of gold, because that would require mining!-these 4,000 people to jump into a boat and dive off boats off the Great Barrier Reef. He is a joke. He will not be happy until everyone is dressed in a black skivvy, riding a Vespa and drinking soy lattes in Lygon Street. The Assistant Treasurer said he is focused on jobs. Of course he is focused on jobs: 20,000 extra public servants. The Prime Minister standing there telling everyone they have to take a haircut, that everyone needs to take a cut-150 extra staff in her office! By jingo, talk about skills training. We have a Treasurer who is fixated and will not take his eyes off a surplus from riding on the back of the mining industry. But he will support this tax. He should hang his head in shame. He stands there and says, 'I will not take my eyes of the surplus; nothing can make me lose my concentration on the surplus-wow, a blue car!' That was not as funny as I thought it was going to be! We have a government whose only policy is to stay in power. They would have done Graham Richardson proud! Not only does this mob say, 'Whatever it takes'; they will add: 'to whomever they like, for whatever reason they feel, to stay in power. This government says that it is a tax on the 1,000 big polluters. Plainly, this tax is a tax on the way of life of everyone in Australia and their livelihoods. I would like to finish as the Minister for Immigration, and say, 'This government has no mandate, Mr Speaker! This government has not been straight with the Australian people, Mr Speaker, on this issue. You should stop this now and call for an election!' That is what you should do: stop this now and call for an election. You should stand up and be straight with the Australian people. You have never been straight with the Australian people. You should start now, do the right thing: face up and say, 'Look, we got it wrong; we want to do the right thing and call an election now.' Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (16:36): What a performance from the member for Herbert! In bringing about this MPI, the Leader of the Opposition talked about honesty. Let us just take what the member for Herbert has just said in relation to jobs and mining and refineries in his electorate. Let us just assume he is genuine about what he has just said. If the Liberals actually accept the science in relation to climate change, if the member for Herbert actually believes that we need to be looking at jobs and the impact of any solutions to climate change on those industries and jobs, then the Liberals and the opposition need to be telling the Australian people why they are not sitting at the table on the multiparty climate change committee, if they are genuine about getting solutions. Why are they not sitting there? Because they are more interested in running scare campaigns than they are about genuinely dealing with climate change. Let's talk about honesty. Despite this MPI, which is supposed to be about the cost of living, the Leader of the Opposition came in here ranting about the Premier for Western Australia, Mr Barnett. He spoke about something that the Premier had said 12 months ago in relation to royalties. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to be honest on this, then he should come into this chamber and talk about the eight occasions over the last eight months that the Premier for Western Australia has said that he will not be introducing increases in royalties in the immediate future. In September 2010 he said in the Fin Review: 'It's not something are moving on now. It won't be in the next year's budget. We will not be moving on royalties in the immediate future.' In October 2010 on ABC radio he said: 'We have no plan to increase royalties.' In the West Australian the following day he said: 'The state has no intentions of increasing royalties.' Again, in December 2010 he told reporters in Perth: 'There is no proposal to increase royalties.' Then, in February 2011, a matter of less than eight weeks before the budget was handed down, he said in the Fin Review: 'We have no plans to increase the fines rate in the foreseeable future.' He repeated that on 6PR radio that same day. If we are going to talk about honesty, the Leader of the Opposition should be honest with the Australian people in what he is accusing the government of and what the Premier for Western Australia has actually done. Let us get back to working families and cost of living. The Leader of the Opposition talked about working families. We all remember working families, don't we? In the previous Liberal government when the Leader of the Opposition was a senior cabinet member he said: 'Working families have never been better off.' This was a minister in the Howard government who oversaw 10 interest rate rises in a row and, at the same time said that Australian working families had never been better off. This is a person who was a senior minister in a government who brought in work choices, directly attacked job security and attacked the ability to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. This is a leader, who is part of an opposition, who opposed every element of the stimulus to support jobs during the global financial crisis. In contrast it is this Labor government that supported jobs through the global financial crisis and who, once again, in their 2011-12 we budget have announced initiatives to support apprentices, to support long-term unemployed, to support people with disabilities with the ability, as well as teenage mums and single parents to get back into the workforce. It is this Labor government that tore up work choices and introduced the Fair Work Act, which resulted in a decision on pay equity that could have never happened under a Liberal government. It is this Labor government that introduced income tax cuts in 2008, 2009 and 2010 for working families. It is this Labor government that increased the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent. Let us not forget that it is this Labor government that introduced the most historic reforms in pensions with a pension increase-a much needed increase to the base rate of the pension for pensioners, veterans and disability pensions across this country. Carers also saw improvements to their entitlements. Since September 2009 payments to single pensioners are up $128 a fortnight and pensioner couples up $116 a fortnight. On 20 March 2011 pension payments rose again, $13.20 a fortnight for single rate pensioners and $19.80 a fortnight for couple rate pensioners on the maximum rate. Total pension payments for those on the maximum adult rate including the base rate and pension supplement are now $729.30 a fortnight or $18,961.80 a year for single pensioners and $1,099.40 a fortnight or $28,584.40 a year for pensioner couples combined. That is what this Labor government has delivered on. It is this Labor government that introduced paid parental leave that came into operation on 1 January 2011-the first paid parental leave in the history of this nation. For 11 long years the Liberal Party were in government and never provided this support to families. Let us not forget this Labor government's paid parental leave scheme will also, from 1 July 2012, provide paid paternity leave for dads and will provide eligible working fathers and partners with two-weeks paid paternity leave at the national minimum wage, currently at $570 a week. Around 220,000 fathers and other partners, who are sharing the child's care and who meet the work and income tests, will be eligible to access paternity leave pay. That what a Labor government does and that is what this Labor government has delivered. What have we seen with the latest budget? There has been further assistance for families through increases in family tax benefit part A by up to $161 per fortnight for teenagers aged between 16 and 19 who are in full-time secondary study from 1 January 2012. This represents an extra $4,200 each year for the lowest income families. Families may also remain or become eligible for rent assistance and family tax benefit part B, worth up to $3,600 and $2,900 respectively each year. In total, the government is spending $771.9 million over five years through these measures to help families with the cost of raising older teenage children while these children complete their secondary schooling. This is real assistance in cost-of-living pressures. In addition from this July families will also have access to more flexible advanced payments of family tax benefit part A. This will mean families facing unexpected costs such as the family car breaking down will have quick and easy access to advance payments and will not have to resort to highinterest loans or credit cards. Again, this is what a Labor government does. This is what this government has delivered in the 2011-12 budget. We are providing many methods of assistance and support to families and pensioners across this country. The alternative we have heard from the opposition once again today is a risk to the economy. They were about wrecking the surplus. We heard that again from the member for Herbert. The opposition side are just not interested in getting back to surplus. It is not important. What is important to them is going to an election. Clearly the Leader of the Opposition has his eyes set on the Lodge and that is all he is thinking about. The is Leader of the Opposition is about fear and negativity. He is about opposition. We see it in relation to the appropriation bills that are being debated in this House currently. Any positive moves of this government that have been introduced into this chamber have been opposed. Everything that this government does-and that includes stimulating the economy, investing in schools, investing in health and investing in infrastructure-is not of interest to the Leader of the Opposition. He is just interested in the Lodge. That is what he wants. So he is going to keep up with the fear and the negativity. This government is about making sure that it gets on with providing for those most in need in our community. We are out there supporting jobs, supporting employment, providing opportunities, providing education, health, supporting our pensioners and supporting those most in need in our community.",124
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," Order! The discussion has concluded. NA Montara Commission of Inquiry Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (16:46): by leaveToday I present the government's response to the report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry and the Productivity Commission's review of the regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum oil and gas sector. Both reports go to the all important question of strengthening the safety of our offshore petroleum framework. The Australian government remains firmly committed to improving the protection of human health and safety and the protection of the marine environment to ensure that Australia's offshore petroleum industry is the best and safest in the world and is able to contribute to Australia's ongoing energy security and economic prosperity. Our action in response to these two reports delivers on that commitment. Dealing first with the Productivity Commission review that was presented to the government on 30 April 2009, the review found evidence of duplication overlap and inconsistent administration in the current regime that imposed significant unnecessary burdens on the oil and gas sector and threatened Australia's competitiveness. The commission recommended the establishment of a new national regulator for offshore petroleum as well as implementation of best practice regulatory principles in all jurisdictions. This recommendation is consistent with the recommendations of the providing Montara report. The government's final response to Montara refines the draft response with the benefit of a three-month period of consultation including consideration of 17 submissions. While full implementation of the government's final response will require sustained efforts over several years by governments, regulators and industry, I am pleased to note that a significant number of recommendations have already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. This includes measures relating to PTTEP in the Northern Territory in its role as designated authority and amendments made to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to provide the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority with regulatory responsibility for non-occupational health and safety aspects of structural integrity for facilities, wells and well related equipment in Commonwealth waters. The core recommendations of both reports is the establishment of a single national regulator. This morning I introduced a package of amendment bills that established the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Environment Management Authority and the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator. The government will also review all other Commonwealth legislation applicable to the marine and offshore petroleum environment to strengthen the marine and offshore petroleum legislative frameworks to ensure a comprehensive consistent approach to the regulation of petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters. We have commenced a review of Australia's national incident response framework for the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil and other noxious and hazardous substances aimed at strengthening Australia's arrangements and adding a guarantee that all costs of responding to the incident will be met by the polluter. My department and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority have agreed to a set of principles to inform equitable cost-sharing arrangements between the shipping and offshore petroleum industries in relation to all spill preparedness and response capabilities. The government has determined that in the unlikely event of a future offshore petroleum incident the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism will be responsible for the coordination of the response arrangements. This includes providing clear lines of communication between governments, regulators, industry and stakeholders more generally. We are clarifying and strengthening the current regulatory regime through the actions of the regulators in discharging their regulatory obligations by, firstly, issuing a statement of expectations to the designated authorities and to NOPSA; secondly, developing a national legislative compliance framework to provide a consistent best practice approach by regulators; and, thirdly, establishing agreed principles for appropriate engagement between the regulator and industry during an emergency response situation. Government action alone is not sufficient. Industry must support our efforts and match them with their own actions to improve operations. In that respect I am pleased to inform the House that the offshore petroleum industry has made tangible improvements both here and globally in their oil field practices and spill prevention and mitigation techniques. The bar for best practice has been raised significantly. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, together with its members, has developed, firstly, a draft mutual aid memorandum of understanding which response provides clear guidance to industry and the government on the lease of equipment in responding to an incident; secondly, a selfaudit tool of the management of well operations; and, thirdly, oil spill preparedness and response improvement plans. Globally the offshore petroleum industry has been working to improve well incident prevention, intervention and response capability. The industry must continue to show that it deserves to maintain its social licence to operate. I say in conclusion that the Montara incident in the Timor Sea and the Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico changed community expectations regarding the operations of the offshore petroleum industry. There are clear parallels and common lessons between these two incidents which will be examined in greater detail at the Australian government hosted International Offshore Petroleum Regulators and Operators Summit, to be held in Perth in August this year. The Montara and Macondo reports both recognise the energy security and economic imperatives behind maintaining an offshore petroleum industry and the importance of balancing this with our responsibilities to ensure the sustainability of our marine environments. Both reports found that these incidents were preventable and pointed to a culture of complacency by the industry and its regulators. Governments, regulators and industry here in Australia and abroad are implementing the lessons from both spills and, in partnership with industry, directors, managers, workers, regulators, ministers and officials, will continue on a path of continuous improvement. I commend both reports to the House and, in doing so, I present copies of the final government response to the report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry, the Commonwealth government response to the Productivity Commission's Review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector, and a copy of my ministerial statement. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Groom to speak for a period of no more than 6½ minutes. Leave granted. Mr MARTIN FERGUSON: I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Macfarlane speaking for a period not exceeding six and a half minutes. Question agreed to. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (16:51): I know it is a dry topic, but it seemed like a lot longer than 6½ minutes to me. I thank the minister for his presentation to the House regarding the government's response to the Montara Commission of Inquiry and the Productivity Commission's Review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector.",131
231,Mr Burke,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Time! Mr IAN MACFARLANE: I think he is supporting New South Wales but I will show him who is in charge. Like the government, the coalition understands the significance of Australia's oil and gas industry and is aware of the importance of ensuring it can operate within a safe and sustainable environment. From the outset the coalition have made a genuine commitment to work with the government on this issue and have never sought to politicise the issue for our own gain. I thank the minister and his office for their cooperation in ensuring that during period the coalition has been fully briefed the matter. The minister is right in saying that the Montara incident and the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico have changed the way the offshore oil and gas industry is perceived, not only here and in America but right around the world. But this intensified scrutiny is not something the industry or the government should shy away from, rather it is an opportunity to enhance an industry that is fundamental to the energy and resources sector. Just as people are more aware of the nature of oil and gas exploration and extraction, they are also increasingly aware of the scale of the projects, the level of investment they attract and the economic benefits and job opportunities that are created by them. Indeed, thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment are at stake, which is why it is essential that we get this right. I share the view that the offshore oil and gas industry can operate in a manner that allows it to grow without exposing either its workers or the environment to unnecessary risks. In terms of the government's acceptance of the recommendation for a single national regulator, the coalition supports this idea in principle and will now scrutinise the full details of the amendment bills presented to the House this morning that will set up the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, and the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, NOPTA. The coalition is also broadly supportive of the government's proposals to strengthen the regulatory regime for the sector and for clarifying the procedures and principles for responding to emergency situations. I also acknowledge the opportunity that has been afforded to the industry to provide input to the government's response to the that Montara Commission of Inquiry. From my on discussions with industry-and they have been extensive-I understand this is an issue that they are very engaged in. They share the same aspirations to make sure the industry can develop in a safe and sustainable manner while preserving and not impacting on the environment. I applaud the commitment from the industry, as outlined by the minister, by which the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, APPEA, and its members have worked to create. APPEA has created a draft mutual aid memorandum of understanding relating to incident response, a self-audit tool for the management of well operations, and an oil spill preparedness and response improvement plan. I would also like to acknowledge the role of the Western Australian government in negotiating the best outcome for the oversight and regulation of the oil and gas sector. As we know, in offshore terms, Western Australia is far and away the majority partner in the oil and gas industry Australia. Ms Marino: Hear, hear! Mr IAN MACFARLANE: For the member's information-I did not see her but I can guess who it was-I remind her that, in terms of reserves, Queensland has much more gas. I appreciate that the Western Australian government has had some philosophical and practical differences with regard to the idea of a single regulator. Nonetheless, and very much to his credit, the WA minister, Minister Moore, has played a constructive role in the negotiations to ensure the industry can move forward. The Montara oil leak was a very serious incident and an incident which was without precedent in the oil and gas offshore industry in Australia. Nonetheless, there are lessons to be drawn from both that incident and the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. It has been extremely pleasing to see the Western Australian government Minister Norman Moore, the Minister for Resources and Energy, who has just presented his statement, and the industry, along with the coalition, working together to produce a noncontroversial but best-case outcome. I congratulate Minister Moore in particular for that approach. I know that, at times, states fear that the Commonwealth is trying to take them over, but the minister realised early that we could all win out of this scenario; in fact, give the community, in particular, the confidence they need to continue to support the exploration and development of the oil and gas industry. The government and industry need to learn from the mistakes that have been made and make changes to the structures and operations that are necessary to make sure that incidents like Montara do not happen again. The proposals outlined by the minister are an important step in that direction; however, in the response must not be just about prevention. It must also be about ensuring the public have the confidence that the authorities responsible for the oil and gas sector and the wider resource industry are able to perform and protect the industry and the environment.

Question agreed to. Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 Second Reading,135
236,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Before the debate is resumed on this bill, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this bill, the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 and the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ―That‖ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ―the House decline to give the bill a second reading until the terms of the regulations giving the provisions of the bill are laid before the House.‖",135
237,Ms MARINO,COMMITTEES," As I was saying earlier today, the example of blue gum plantations throughout southern Australia taking up volumes of groundwater and driving down water tables serves as a warning to all of us. The cumulative impacts of plantations on the environment, agriculture, current and future food production must be considered. These include water usage and fire management issues. The second form of biosequestration covered in this bill is soil carbon. There are an estimated 2,700 billion tonnes of carbon in the world's soils, most of it in the top 30 centimetres. This compares with the 800 billion tonnes in the world's atmosphere and the 900 billion stored in biomass, which of course includes trees. Australian soils vary in natural organic carbon levels from one to five per cent, with more than 75 per cent of BILLS Australian farming soils having organic carbon content of less than 1.75 per cent. Much of my home state of Western Australia has sandy soils, which sit at the one to two per cent carbon level. We should also note that soil carbon levels in Australia have declined 10 to 60 per cent over the last 80 years. This alone tells us that we have an opportunity to put a lot of carbon into our soils, which certainly will give us healthier and more productive soil. Land use plays a significant role in the soil carbon cycle, and good management can raise levels above the natural average. However, members should be warned against assuming that only trees can raise soil carbon levels. Pastures are an important tool, because organic matter concentrations tend to be much higher under grass, with recorded levels of up to seven per cent of soil effect to carbon under well managed pastures. Observations of the world's ecosystems show that organic carbon concentrations in soils, to a depth of one metre, under various land uses were: 122.7 tonnes per hectare for tropical forests, 117.3 tonnes for tropical savannas, 96.2 tonnes for temperate forests, 80 tonnes for croplands and 236 tonnes for temperate grasslands. By this we can see that well-managed pastures that are not overgrazed can add significantly to soil carbon levels. The rewards are high, and Australia would be greatly advantaged if we were able to raise our soil carbon by even one per cent across the nation. However, the use of soil carbon as a mitigating offset is made difficult by the lack of certainty around the measurement of soil carbon and its permanency. Soil carbon is increased by the addition of carbon such as vegetation or biochar or by the reduction of carbon use or loss. In the natural cycle, soil carbon rises as a result of all the living, dead and decomposing plants, animals and microbes in the soil, along with organic residues and humic substances that they release. The classic example is the floor of forests, which breaks down and is absorbed into the soil structure. We must remember though the great importance of the smallest player, the micro-organisms. Soil health and its ability to hold onto and use carbon are directly related to the microbial balance of soil. This balance is something we know far too little about, although we do know how important it is. It is, however, difficult to measure in the short term how much added carbon has been absorbed into the soil structure and how long it will remain there. This makes this form of biosequestration difficult to measure and cost. There are a number of issues the government must address in the development of carbon farming and the market that would go with it. The shadow minister has clearly articulated many of these; however, as a farmer, there are a number of issues that I would like to see addressed. We certainly need to know who owns the land on which carbon farming is occurring and will occur; how much land is involved; where that land is located; and, more importantly, who owns the credit for the carbon that will be stored there. I would like to see a publicly available national carbon farming register so that the process is an open and accountable one. This should include programs of carbon farming owned by foreign entities on Australian soil. This is important because, given that Australian farmers currently manage 61 per cent of Australia's landmass, in my view Australian landowners should be the principal beneficiaries of carbon farming activities here. Under the coalition's direct action proposal, farmers will be able to tender for carbon sequestration. We need to avoid the situation where our landholders are locked out of potential overseas markets that might be available to foreign entities. The parliament should also consider the litter intellectual property rights of carbon technology. I have absolutely no doubt that Australian farmers can lead the way, given the opportunity. Even though cropping would appear to be poorly suited to carbon storage, Australian work indicates that good cropping management can be used to minimise soil carbon loss. According to the CSIRO, improved management of crop land-be it enhanced rotation, adoption of no-till, which we have seen a lot of in Western Australia, or stubble retention-has resulted in better retention of carbon in soils. This type of technology, developed in Australia, should be exported around the world once adequate IP protocols have been put in place. The complexity of measuring and attributing carbon storage is the most difficult issue facing carbon farming. The Kyoto protocol's rules have always been slanted to assist nations that are geographically small but have a large population, and to this end the rules have failed to recognise the need to manage carbon sinks rather than just to observe them. An Australian system of carbon farming will need to be simple and effective and to relate directly to our specific set of parameters and common practice. The last thing we want to do is generate a layer of carbon bureaucracy and perhaps have an explosion of carbon middlemen to give another blank cheque to or have another scheme mismanaged by this government. Carbon farming should be an opportunity for landholders to enter a new marketplace, not just an opportunity for carbon agents. How the regulations manage this process will be critical, and we have not seen that yet. The impact of this bill on the agricultural landscape of Australia is also of paramount importance. Pricing carbon provides an incentive to shift from food to carbon production. On some areas of marginal land this is not automatically a negative, but food production is critically important in a world in which the human population will rise from 7 billion to over 9 billion-recently I heard some information at a conference that Australian farmers by default feed 60 million people in the world now-especially here in Australia, where our food producers and their viability are constantly undermined by supermarkets and, unfortunately, by some of the decisions that have been made by this government. How we ensure that our food-producing farmers maintain commercial and viable returns is a real issue for us in this nation. Australia's, and global, interests are not best served if our farmers stop producing food here in Australia. I acknowledge, as you would, Mr Deputy Speaker, that our farmers in Australia are some of the most efficient producers in the world. They produce some of the best quality food and fibre that the world sees, which is not something that is necessarily recognised or valued in the way that it should be. I hear the members at the table, who are perhaps discussing this issue. I hope they are, because we do produce some of the best food and fibre in the world. The choice to keep producing food must be available, and the rewards for doing so should go to those producing that food and fibre. I am very concerned about the practical matters in this legislation and, unfortunately, I am concerned that putting this government in charge of anything to do with farmers and growers is probably a bit like letting the fox into the hen house, which is something that we understand very well. The practical nature of farmers means that we will need some very good ways for them to tender for and be engaged in the soil carbon market, as they could through the coalition's process. I will be very interested to see the findings of the Senate report and to see how the range of issues that I and so many others have raised in this respect are dealt with. Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (17:14): It is always good to follow the member for Forrest. What she was saying in relation to the contribution of Australian farmers to the global food bowl was interesting. It is a very important issue and it is always worth putting on record the outstanding work and innovation that our farmers bring to their craft. However, it would also have been good if the member for Forrest had spent some time at the climate change commission summit the other day, because, while she may be quite good at telling us some of the facts and figures about the farming sector, she is clearly, like her party, lost and in the wilderness in relation to climate change. That is one of the reasons that I am so supportive of these bills and the legislation before the House today, and I will spend a little time talking about why and how important it is. The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 fulfils the Australian government's commitment to develop legislation to give farmers, forest growers and landholders access to domestic, voluntary and international carbon markets. This will begin to unlock the abatement opportunities in the land sector, which currently make up 23 per cent of Australia's emissions. The first objective is to help Australia meet its international obligations under the United Nations conventions on climate change and the Kyoto protocol to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases. We know that those on the other side have all sorts of difficulties with the Kyoto protocol and continue now to struggle on a daily basis with their position on climate change. The second objective is to create incentives for people to undertake land sector abatement projects. The ability to generate saleable carbon credits provides an investment incentive, thereby helping to channel carbon finance into the land sector abatement. A further objective is to achieve carbon abatement in a manner consistent with protection of Australia's natural environment and to improve resilience to the impacts of climate change. This recognises the important contribution that this scheme can make towards environmental objects such as improving water quality, reducing salinity and erosion, protecting and promoting biodiversity, regenerating abatement. landscapes and improving the productivity of agricultural soils. The Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011 establishes a national registry. The registry serves two primary purposes: to be Australia's first national registry for Kyoto units, which is required under the Kyoto protocol, and to act as a registry for Australian carbon credit units under the Carbon Farming Initiative. Accordingly, this bill is necessary to support carbon farming initiatives and to allow people to trade credits. The third bill is the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill, which has a range of amendments to legislation, and I will not spend much time talking about that. There are timing sensitivities with these bills. We have previously committed to having legislation passed by 1 July 2011 to provide certainty to farmers, forest growers and landholders, who have previously invested in abatement projects or are looking to invest in the near future. In particular, there are a number of projects which were previously supported by the Greenhouse Friendly program, which concluded on 30 June 2010. These included forest sequestration projects and landfill waste projects. The failure to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme significantly impacted the investment in these types of projects. There is already a domestic voluntary market for carbon neutral products and services with which these credits will sell into-for example, when Qantas offers to offset flight emissions. At the moment, there are no domestic credits for Australian companies to buy until this bill is passed. The bill allows for a backdating of credits to 1 July 2010 to accommodate projects previously in the Greenhouse Friendly program, where these projects meet the new standards and have properly measured the The legislation will establish an important funding stream for regional and rural Australia. The legislation is a voluntary mechanism. No-one has to be part of the scheme if they choose not to be. If they do take part, they can gain credit for their action to reduce or store carbon pollution. The size of the voluntary market will initially be quite small, but significant revenue would be available if internationally compliant credits are used in the carbon price mechanism. This matter, of course, is being discussed in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Tony Abbott's so-called direct action policy relies excessively on storing carbon in soils and does nothing to move the economy to a clean energy future. Other countries are already taking action on climate change and the economic competitiveness of some of Australia's companies could disadvantaged if we do not take action at home. The Gillard government is committed to introducing a price on carbon. It is the right thing to do for jobs, for our economy and for the environment. A carbon price is the cheapest and the fairest way to cut pollution and drive investment in a clean energy future. Just this week, the Climate Commission report made clear that the next 10 years requires critical policy decisions by putting a price on carbon if we are to stabilise carbon pollution and avoid dangerous levels of global warming in the future. It is worth talking about my electorate because it is one of those electorates that is being dramatically affected by climate change. At north Entrance, we have massive erosion of the beach. Backyards of houses have been washed away and continue to be washed away. The local council has a program to continually dredge sand and put it back in place. But the effects of climate change with more frequent storm surges and changing sea levels have meant that that community is in some danger and continues to be in some danger. In the north of my electorate at Cabbage Tree Bay at Norah Head, houses are falling into the ocean. The council is having to buy back those houses because we have not acted in relation to climate change. It is too late for those areas already in terms of what is happening there, but it is not too late to act to save the planet. And we need to be doing that, and that was made absolutely clear just the other day with the Climate Commission's report. We have an opposition who are putting their heads in the sand on climate change issues. If they put their heads in the sand in my electorate, they will get washed away. be Quite frankly, they are going to get washed away in the debate on climate change because there is an overwhelming view out there that we need to act to make sure that the environment is protected. Even those opposite do not actually believe the position that their leader is putting. There are many on the other side who know that climate change is real, that climate change is induced and made worse by man and that we need to act and we need to act now. That is one of the reasons that I am so supportive of these bills and the legislation before the House today, and I will spend a little time talking about why and how important it is.

Even those opposite do not actually believe the position that their leader is putting. There are many on the other side who know that climate change is real, that climate change is induced and made worse by man and that we need to act and we need to act now. Also, incentives for carbon farming are earned through abatement of greenhouse gases by capturing and destroying of methane emissions from landfill or livestock manure. I find that one pretty interesting because, as we know, animals eat and then excrete, and there is not much we can do to stop them doing that, not much at all. So we remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in soil or trees by growing a forest. I have many farmers in my electorate and I want to assure and advise those farmers that a carbon fanning scheme will not have adverse effects on their practices. The coalition cannot vote in parliament on this legislation because the Labor government wants us to vote without seeing the detail and we will not do that, The coalition is awaiting a Senate report. We await with interest views on the following matters: one, prime agricultural land protection; two, protection for Western for Australia from effective expropriation of crown land usage rights by the bill; three, act to completion of the key regulations; four, inclusion of soil carbon from the outset; five, the risk of rorting, as in Europe, without adequate protections, as reported on the front page of the Australian, 19 May 2011; six, construction of an acceptable set of rules around the permanence; seven, construction of an acceptable set of rules around additionality; and, eight, other amendments to be identified by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report on the bills to report on Friday, 27 May 2011. We need simple answers to questions such as: what happens if forest on your farm is destroyed by bush fire? Are you penalised? Do you have to pay those credits back? That is a worry for many farmers-that if they get a credit somehow they might have to pay it back in years to come when their forest is destroyed by fire. In fact, those credits might be costing a lot more by then. So that is a concern. I spoke in this place on 29 October 2009 about the ETS in Europe and their ETS statistics at the time. They were dismal-the results spoke for themselves and now we see rorting also. This is why it is so important that the government provides the detail and why the coalition supports the principle but has serious concerns about the legislation. We are not prepared to give a blank cheque. This legislation does not contain the opportunities for carbon farming as outlined in our direct action plan. Under the direct action plan the coalition will reduce carbon dioxide emissions through biosequestration in general and, in particular, the replenishment of our soil carbons. Farmers will be entitled to tender for additions in carbon. The Gillard government's approach to the carbon farming offsets bill will be completely skewed by a carbon tax and ETS, leading to the wholesale conversion of prime farming land from agriculture to trees. We simply do not know what we are dealing with here. It is an unknown quantity. For that reason, the opposition will be moving an amendment in the House, declining to give the bill a second reading until the regulations giving effect to the provisions of the bill are laid before the House. The coalition will reserve its position on other matters until the Senate inquiry report is handed down on Friday 27 May 2011. That is not very long to wait. Why can the government not wait until we get some of those answers? Further amendments will be considered following the Senate inquiry report. Ultimate support for this bill in the Senate will depend upon a satisfactory resolution on the range of amendments to be presented. Without the regulations and the amendments we would not consider the legislation to be anywhere near ready. Based on the facts we have-which are not a lot-it would be careless for the coalition to let this legislation continue in its current form. As a member of parliament, I have to look out for my constituents. Many are farmers who will be affected by this legislation. I hope it is a positive effect but we simply do not know. The consultation process for the exposure draft of the legislation was only in capital cities, which are not always easy for farmers to accessthere are no farmers in the city. I refuse to give Labor and the Greens the opportunity to decide the future of farmers in my electorate and all over Australia. At Senate estimates, officials confirmed there is not yet a definition of 'common soil practice' for farming. There needs to be an education program to teach farmers the implications of signing up for such a scheme. Major Studies by ABARE and CSIRO which would provide invaluable information on the carbon farming initiative will not be released till after the carbon farming initiative is voted on. Why wait? We should have that information now. This is so typical of this government. It is back to front logic, putting the cart before the horse; it just does not make sense. The coalition supports biosequestrationcapturing carbon emissions in soils, trees and other biological matter. It is a key part of the coalition's direct action climate policy. A report issued this year by the CSIRO, 'Greenhouse gas mitigation: sources and sinks in agriculture and forestry', by the head of the Sustainable Agriculture Flagship, Michael Battaglia, pointed to the great potential for biosequestration in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The report found that 'we can potentially increase these stores in our rural lands and perhaps store or mitigate enough greenhouse gases to offset up to 20 per cent or more of Australia's emissions during the next 40 years.' The carbon farming initiative legislation risks dire consequences for the farming sector and will have major implications for our nation's food security. A major concern we have is that while tree planting can be good-and it has a place under our direct action plan-there must be appropriate controls to ensure large tracts of good food-producing land are not lost to trees. Labor's plan will cause the wholesale transfer of food production land to trees in Australia's best farming areas, trees which cannot be harvested in any form. A leaked CSIRO report featured in the Sydney Morning Herald claims a carbon price of $36 dollars a tonne would likely see the whole lower Murray-Darling Basin converted to trees, starting at a carbon price as low as $11 a tonne. This is much worse than commercial forestry as there will be no employment required after the trees are planted and the flow-on impacts of job losses in the community will be large. The Murray-Darling Basin produces 39 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. It also contains 65 per cent of irrigated land and 40 per cent of the farms. Even if you only have that, you reduce Australia's food production by 20 per cent. Does the government want to see Australia turn into a country that imports all its food? That is what will happen if Labor threatens our food security with this legislation. Australia is a big country and there is plenty of scope to plant trees in marginal country where farming is less viable and where there are environmental co-benefits in relation to salinity, erosion, woody weeds, biodiversity, bird life and so on. I question Labor's consultation process if they believe it is a good idea to plant trees on Australia's prime food production land. This is just another example of why the coalition needs to see more detail. We will not and cannot support initiatives that damage food security and cause job losses. A concern for farmers is the duration of abatements in this legislation. The 100-year life of credits gives rise to problems when carbon stores are prematurely disturbed by no-fault or natural events but proponents are required to re-establish or regenerate carbon stores, or relinquish carbon credits. Over a 100-year life cycle, it is highly probable that carbon stores will be affected by an event, such as a bushfire, which releases the carbon store, leaving the proponent liable. It is ridiculous to lock farmers in for 100 years; so much can change in that time. Farmers should be concerned about this government and its legislation. Labor is certainly out of touch. Labor and the Greens are in conflict over the starting price of their carbon tax. The Greens have called for a carbon price in excess of $40 a tonne. The government commissioned report from Deloitte has found that an emissions tax of $40 per tonne would be needed to encourage a national transition from coal-fired electricity to gas. the Not that long ago, on 18 May, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young from the Greens said the carbon tax may need to reach $100 a tonne to make renewable energy competitive. Our direct action climate change policy will reduce emissions in a way that is economically responsible and it will not cost Australian jobs. The coalition's direct action plan will reduce emissions by 5 per cent by 2020 through creating a fund to buy back greenhouse emissions, more tree planting, better soils and smarter technology. We want the detail and, if the government has nothing to hide, why would they deny the House the ability to examine the regulations so that we in opposition can make up our minds fully informed?",135
238,Mr NEUMANN,COMMITTEES," For those who are listening to parliament, it is always important to look at what the coalition actually do on climate change issues relating to the farming and regional areas of our country, not what they say they do. We have heard, in this debate on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills, the member for Barker and the member for Forrest talk about their farming backgrounds, the assistance they provided and their concerns for the farming sector. But, when given the opportunity to actually vote on legislation that would in the future provide, according the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech, hundreds of millions of dollars for the farming sector, they say they are opposed to it. They claim they are standing up for regions, but we know they are opposing our regional infrastructure funding. We know that they will be opposing the $4.3 billion have rolled out in this budget. They oppose this and they oppose so much when it comes to the farming regions, yet they say they are standing up for farmers. There is a grave inconsistency between what the coalition say and what they actually do. We have heard the member for Barker and the member for Forrest say that they have not been consulted. There has been extensive consultation on this matter. I heard some discussion about the issue of the additionality test, but changes on these matters have been made as a result of the consultation process. The National Farmers Federation supports what we are doing here. The last time. I looked, the National Farmers Federation was not affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. They actually support what we are doing here, yet those opposite will not listen to them. They will not listen to them on the issue of climate change either. We accept the science of climate change here; those opposite really do not. Anyone who comes to question time hears the comments made by those opposite-over in that corner where all the Nats hang out. You can hear what they have to say and you can hear the comments they make-they do not accept the science. On this side, we want to price carbon. We want to make a difference to the environment, improve the situation for farmers, improve the situation for our regional areas and give farmers the opportunity for a new industry, an industry that could help them whether they be wheat to farmers, tree planters, beef farmers or involved in the dairy sector. I have the honour of representing many farming communities in the electorate of the Blair in South-East Queensland. We are providing a chance for a new industry for hard-pressed regions, regions such as those we in my area of South-East Queensland affected by the flood-the Somerset and the rural parts of Ipswich. And those opposite are opposing it. They are trying to delay this. I do not understand it. I truly do not get why the coalition is opposing this. They know there has been extensive consultation. In fact the members opposite have talked about the extensive consultation. It is inaction on climate change. Whenever the opportunity arises, such as with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that they voted against many times in the House and Senate, they want to take a giant step backwards on climate change actionevery single time. It is a disgrace. We want to assist farmers, households and lowincome earners because we know our economy needs to transition to a cleaner energy economy. We know we have to do it. We know we are not jumping ahead of the world; we know we are going with the world on this. We are taking steps to improve our economy. This is a great national reform. We need to take steps. So on this side of the House we say we are going to tax the polluters and we are going to help the community, low-income earners, farmers and small business. Those on the other side want to tax those people and help the big polluters. I just do not get where the coalition parties are coming from these days and I do not think their natural constituency, which they think is the farming sector, will go with them on this issue. I do not think the farming sector will support them on this issue; they will be opposed to them. This is important legislation. It is not as though we have come up with this idea recently. I recall it being an election commitment. I can recall sending out press releases on this. I can recall speaking on River 94.9 radio about carbon farming. I remember discussing this with local journalists and farmers in my area. I remember having this discussion all through the campaign-it is not something new that we have come up with. It is not something that the opposition has not heard about before. This is going to afford abatement opportunities in the agricultural sector that will give it a new industry. It is a very good thing for agricultural areas. We will see the need for those farmers to have a good look at the kind of work they are undertaking. Farmers are used to difficult conditions. They are used to markets and know what markets are like because they deal with them, whether it is beetroot, carrots, lettuce or cauliflower. We are going to address salinity, reduce erosion-tree planting will help-and make sure that we improve soil health and productivity. We will do that by increasing carbon storage in those soils. We will help to protect biodiversity and degraded landscapes by revegetation. We will see farmers undertake that sort of work. We will fulfil our election commitment to help farmers, forest growers and landholders to access the carbon markets. The member for Dobell very accurately outlined what we are proposing to do. This is an important initiative because we believe climate change is real. So many on that side of the House deny the science. We believe that acting on climate change is the right thing to do for our economy. We are not going to play politics on this issue. It is a very serious issue. The coalition members tonight are playing politics-and why wouldn't they? They believe they have a chance. They think that if they can narrow the political agenda to a couple of issuesnot talk about the economy or the things that affect people-they can scoot into the Lodge. That is what they want. You hear it in every speech in this place from those opposite. It is not about the national interest; it is about their short-term interest. It is not about creating jobs, taxing polluters, transitioning the economy or assisting people. It is about their short-term interest. That is what they are all about. I will talk to the second reading amendment that the member for Flinders moved. We know that farmers and landholders want access to carbon markets. Contrary to the coalition's record, they are holding back those markets as well as farmers, income and opportunity. With this amendment, the member for Flinders has basically told farmers in my region and in the region of the member for Maranoa - I see him sitting over there-that the coalition would rather play politics than support the farming sector. That is what they have said today. The farmers and landholders in Blair want me and all the people in this House to end the politics on this issue. They want to make sure that we have a framework-and we set out the framework back in February this year-and that the legislation is in place. I mention to the House the National Farmers Federation and what they submitted to the House of Representatives Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts inquiry on this issue. They said about this legislation: The legislation has also addressed the NFF concerns around potential perverse outcomes in relation to food production, water, local communities, employment and biodiversity, as well as reducing some of the uncertainty and administration costs surrounding crediting periods, reporting timeframes and offsets compliance. …… … The government deserves credit for listening to the farm sector and modifying its proposal to ensure that genuine abatement opportunities under the CFI are not unnecessarily overlooked. That looks like we have railroaded the whole thing through, doesn't it? It really looks like we have not consulted with the farming sector at all! Those opposite should go back to the farmers they claim they represent and have a word with them about what this is all about. The carbon farming initiative is based on the science of climate change. On this side of the House, we believe it is true. My estimate is that most people on the other side of the House do not really believe the science. You see their response with the member for Tangney going beetroot in the face every time climate change is mentioned. We hear the Nats and the Libs in the corner at the back-the LNP members Queensland-casting doubt on it. We know the member for Wentworth really believes in the science of climate change and, in his heart of hearts, I believe the member for Flinders believes that climate change is real and that human beings contribute to the environment in an adverse way. But many people over there do not-and you can hear what they say. The carbon farming initiative is important and the department is going to release over Standing the next few weeks a number of details of methodology which will show in practical terms how particular landholders can put projects together. As I said, we have consulted extensively. On the regulations, we have established a positive and negative list and we will be providing details of these lists very shortly. The regulations dealing with the technical matters are required to be based on independent advice from the Domestic Offset Integrity Committee. It is essential to the credibility and value of the offset credits which are created by this carbon farming initiative. A scheme where the activities are added and credits are based on politics, which is what those opposite want, has no credibility at all. The coalition really should stop playing politics with this. We are trying to reward farmers with an income source and those opposite are opposed to it. Labor are doing a lot of stuff with respect to protecting the environment in my electorate and elsewhere. We are committed to a more sustainable environment by investing in our Caring for our Country programs on the ground. I have seen many of them in my electorate. We are committed to managing water resources in the Murray-Darling in a way that supports healthy rivers, strong communities and sustainable food production. We have delivered generational water reforms in the Murray-Darling Basin and we are giving from communities confidence to plan for the future, whereas those opposite have delayed, delayed and delayed on the Murray-Darling Basin. One of the first acts of this Labor government-of which I was very proud-in 2007, when I was elected, was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. We expanded the renewable energy target to ensure that, by 2020, 20 per cent of our electricity comes from renewable energy sources. We have supported green jobs, and I have seen that locally in my electorate around Ipswich and in the rural areas. We have modernised the economy by implementing many clean energy initiatives. We have helped local schools to tackle climate change by installing solar panels on roofs and water tanks. I have seen those across Ipswich and also in the Somerset region. These things are important. By setting a price on carbon and also implementing the Carbon Farming Initiative we are taking action on climate change. We think it will drive innovation and investment. Hard-pressed regional and rural areas know how important markets are, how important farming production is, how important a dollar is and how hard it is to earn. So this will give them jobs for the future and whole industries in areas like the Lockyer Valley and the Brisbane Valley. I look forward to seeing those. As I said, we are ensuring the big polluters are the ones who bear the burden and we are ensuring that the farming sector is looked after in this way. Only Labor governments would help rural and regional Australia and only Labor governments would help the farming sector, because those opposite claim they do but they deliver almost nothing. As a result of those Building the Education Revolution initiatives in their electorates, which helped those really hardpressed rural communities-places such as Esk and Fernvale in the electorate of Blairthose multipurpose halls provided evacuation centres in the recent flood. Yet those opposite voted against that initiative. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame. Every chance they get, they vote against regional and rural Australia. Every chance they get, they oppose climate change initiatives. Every chance they get, they do not support the farming sector. They will say it, they do so here but, when it comes to the crunch, they don't. Labor are introducing emission standards on coal-fired power stations to ensure future electricity generation is cleaner and greener. We are delivering a strong signal to investors to build a low-pollution economy for the future. The Carbon Farming Initiative will provide economic opportunities for farmers, forest growers, landholders and will help the environment by reducing carbon pollution. This is something that we are doingsomething those opposite are opposing. Once again, the coalition show that they have no determination and no commitment to regional and rural areas. Once again, they betray them by the speeches they make in here and by the votes that they will cast later on tonight on carbon farming. This is another great Labor initiative, helping the farming sector, opposed by the National Party, which preen, pose and parade in this place as supporters of the farmers. When they get a chance to vote, they will vote against them. They will vote against the legislation tonight. I want every farmer in the electorates of Blair, Maranoa, Flynn and Kennedy, and all those farmers in Queensland, to listen to these debates, to listen to what the coalition are saying and, when you cast your vote next time, think about who supports regional and rural Queensland and who supports farmers. I want to make it crystal clear to them: the federal Labor government does that, as we always have. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (17:55): I rise tonight to speak on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and cognate bills. I join this debate with a background, unlike the member for Blair, as a farmer for many years, having to farm the land to ensure I could pay the bills, feed and educate my children. So I have a very close affinity with the soil and the land, as did my parents and my grandparents before me. So I come to this debate with a background knowledge, having been a working participant in a productive farm. I also come to this debate as the member for Maranoa, which has a very large agricultural base, from the edge of the Simpson Desert in the west of the electorate to the highly productive Darling Downs soils, where we have real pressure at the moment from mining companies and coal seam methane gas companies. But I did not hear any mention of that from the member for Blair. I want to talk about the competition between both those sectors in my address tonight. I also come to this debate tonight as having observed farming practices not only across Australia but also in other parts of world. I particularly refer to my studies as a Nuffield scholar in the United Kingdom and Europe, observing some of the farming practices in some of the oldest farming lands of the globe, apart from those perhaps in the Middle East and North Africa. Interestingly, when we talk about carbon sequestration, that has been going on for centuries and centuries. When you think about it, probably the best carbon sequestration is the old golden hoof fertiliser-the manure from the feedlot, the organic matter being returned to the soil. That is what this bill seeks to achieve: to convert atmospheric carbon into soil carbon. Of course, when you think about it, golden hoof fertiliser does that daily. It returns organic matter back into the soil, which will break down over time Crop residues are of course a part of that breakdown into soil carbon. Carbon sequestration to improve productivity on the land is a good idea. The coalition supports that. Contrary to the spray we have had from the member for Blair, we do support that. We support the target. But it is how we get there that is important. Our amendment wants to put a stop on this legislation until we see the regulations that will be attached to this legislation. It is like asking us to buy a pig in a poke: site unseen, and committing to a Carbon Farming Initiative without all the regulations in place. As I said, carbon sequestration to improve productivity and soil structure is a good idea. I have seen it in many parts of the world. We have practised it-without legislation I might add-on our own farm. In fact, after my Nuffield scholarship year, I purchased imported farming equipment so that we could better utilise our crop residues. Much of the farm machinery that had been used in Australia was incapable of retaining crop the residues on top of the soil and planting new crops, so we bought farming equipment from importers who had bought it in the United States of America. The other aspect of this is that we are concerned that this legislation could lead to the wholesale transfer of prime agricultural land, some of our best land, to growing trees that cannot be harvested for 100 years. If they are going to be used for carbon sequestration, they are going to have to be locked away for 100 years, locking up the land as well. That is a genuine concern that I have, that farmers in my electorate would have and that I am sure the National Farmers Federation would have. It is biased towards tree plantations, as the regulations are now, and native vegetation will not be allowed to be included under this bill. In my own electorate, we saw the Queensland Labor Party lock up large tracts of land when they put a ban on tree clearing. Farmers still come to me and say, 'I wouldn't mind locking up some of my land, but I can't get anything for it.' I am talking about native timbers, native vegetation. It is particularly in western Queensland that these farmers come to me. They may have bought their land in good faith, wanting to develop it over their lifetime and perhaps their children's lifetime. But the ban on tree clearing in Queensland locked up, in some cases, up to half or two-thirds of that land, and they can never go back to developing it while that ban remains in place. And they cannot participate in this Carbon Farming Initiative because it is native vegetation. I understand that the state government has claimed that under the Kyoto protocol, and that has already been counted, but these farmers are not able to continue to develop their farms. They would have done it responsibly, as I am sure the member for New England would agree. We know there have been mistakes made in the past, and we have all learnt from the mistakes, but there are farmers out there who have got native vegetation and who will not be able to participate in what is proposed in this legislation. I mentioned the issue of our prime agricultural land and the conflict that we have in some cases with the resource companies, particularly calcium methane gas and large resource companies, wanting to mine coal. I have already got an international company in my electorate that wants to buy up to 80,000 hectares of land that is actually mapped on the Queensland prime agricultural land or strategic cropping land map as being strategic cropping land. They want to basically open it up for an open-cut coalmine. That is 80,000 hectares of magnificent cattle-producing, producing, food-producing land. It will be locked away as this coalmine moves through it over the next 30 years, taking prime agricultural land out of food production. I have already got a gas company in my electorate that is growing trees as part of its strategy to deal with the water that has been extracted as part of the coal seam methane gas process. If you are going to extract coal seam methane gas, you have first got to dewater the aquifer where the coal bed is. The water comes up and you have got to do something with it; you have got to make good with it. This company have decided that they are going to grow trees. They have purchased a property, formerly a very productive cattle property. This water is a by-product that they thought they might have been able to just let run away down the creek somewhere, but they have got to do something more with it. What are they doing with it? They are using it for a timber plantation. I do not know whether the company are going to try and sell carbon credits on this land, but it is a very good example of taking good agricultural land out of food production and using it for a timber plantation. This raises questions about what land will be used and, if this legislation goes through, what restrictions there will be in the Carbon Farming Initiative on plantation timber being planted on good food-producing land in Australia. Sixty-odd per cent of Australia's farming land is owned by Australians. The other 40 per cent is owned by foreign interests. Will foreign based companies want to come to Australia to buy some of our prime agricultural land, our food-producing land-it could be strategic cropping land or good grazing land, pasture land-convert it to timber and then receive a carbon credit for planting a timber forest that is an offset to emissions that they have to deal with in grainanother part of the world? Will they be receiving the carbon credits? Will they be investing in some of this land? The mining companies have got far more available money to buy land than the farmers can ever hope to have to keep their farms in their own possession. I have got very near family members right now dealing with a gas company. In the negotiations that people near them have been going through, it really ends up with the farmer saying, 'We're not going to be able to coexist with the gas company because they want to almost take over the land for the next 30 years,' as they have in some areas. As I said earlier, they have planted trees on what was once a cattleproducing farm. One example I know of is that for the last nine months this farm that is very close to my family has backgrounded some 2,000 head of cattle. It is part of the food-producing chain to background cattle to put into a feedlot and from the feedlot process it into food for Australians and also for export. But they do not believe they are going to be able to coexist with that company. What will they do if they buy it? They have bought quite a lot around the place near them. Are they going to convert it, like another company north of Roma has, into a plantation because they might be able to sell carbon credits from it with the water that they have extracted without a licence from underground as part of the coal seam methane gas extraction process? The coal seam methane gas is then sent to Gladstone. We know it is all about great wealth and new jobs-we understand all of that-but what are they going to do with all the land as they continually buy these wonderful foodproducing areas? Because of this legislation, they might be going to see an opportunity: 'Well, we'll put it down for trees. We've got water that we've got to deal with. It's a bit of a problem this part of the coal seam methane gas extraction. We'll grow plantation timber and get a carbon credit for it and take it out of food production.' I want to touch on the carbon tax. The carbon tax that this government wants to introduce is going to do untold damage to the viability of many rural farming enterprises across Australia. The tax is going to drive up the price of electricity. You cannot get away from having to use electricity in most farming operations that I am aware of, whether it be dairy, feedlot, the wool industry or the beef-processing sector. It is essential element of either the primary or the downstream processing side of the agricultural food production. What this carbon tax will do is drive up the cost of electricity. The tyranny of distance has always been a factor. I am sure the member for New England would concur about the tyranny of distance in Australia, given we have one of the largest geographic areas of the countries in the world. We have populated it with great farmers with great skills across this large land mass, but the tyranny of distance means the transport sector will be hit by this carbon tax. How will farmers respond as their costs go up? They are going to have to drive their land harder. When it comes to crop rotation or pasture renovation, because of the cost increases they are going to look at the bottom line and say, 'Well, we can't afford to do that. We have actually got to drive our soils harder. We're going to have to use more fertiliser rather than rotate our land into a break crop or have a crop rotation and get out of a mono culture'-as I see increasingly. So, whilst we on this side of the House support the initiatives to look at carbon sequestration-and farmers do-our point is that it is how you get there. The regulations are not with this bill. We still have not seen the CSIRO or ABARES studies which are due out on this whole issue of carbon farming. We should wait for those reports before we vote on this bill. That is why this amendment is so essential and this bill should not proceed at this stage tonight. (Time expired)",144
239,Mr SYMON,COMMITTEES," I speak in support of the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011, the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 and the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011 in this cognate debate. This legislation is a part of the federal government's response to the challenge of tackling climate change and will create opportunities for Australian farmers and landowners to benefit from reducing carbon emissions or from storing carbon in their soil. The Carbon Farming Initiative will reward land based carbon abatement projects with credits for each tonne of carbon saved or stored, which can then be sold in domestic and international markets or retained to offset emissions. Carbon abatement can be achieved by land based projects which reduce emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere. An example of projects that reduce emissions is the capture and destruction of methane emissions from landfill or projects that reduce methane emissions from farm animals. The company or entity that invests funds into reducing the leakage of methane emissions into the air will receive in return a credit for that carbon abated, credits that can be sold or retained to offset other emissions. Examples of projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere include reforestation, revegetation, avoided devegetation, improved management of forests and enhanced soil carbon. The bills we are debating today are just one small part of the Labor government's response to climate change. The Labor government is committed to introduce a carbon price to take effect from 1 July 2012. Although the price on carbon would not place any liability on agricultural, forestry or legacy waste emissions, the Carbon Farming Initiative bill is about creating an opportunity to use the demand for carbon offsets created by a price on carbon to fund projects on the land that would reduce carbon. The Gillard Labor government understands the importance of having accurate scientific information on climate change. We need to know the science, what the international community is doing to deal with climate change and the world's best practice. So it was the Labor government that established the Climate Commission as an independent source of information on the science and impacts of climate change, global responses to climate change and the operation of carbon pricing. The Climate Commission is supported by a scientific advisory panel made up of nine independent experts. Just this week, on 23 May, the Climate Commission released its report entitled The critical decade: Key messages. There are some salient lines in it. I quote from its report: There is no doubt that the climate is changing, the evidence is overwhelming and clear. The atmosphere is warming, the ocean is warming, ice is being lost from glaciers and ice caps and sea levels are rising. Global surface temperature is rising fast; the last decade was the hottest on record. In the last 50 years the number of record hot days in Australia has more than doubled. This is also from the report: A very large body of observations, experiments, analyses, and physical theory points to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere-with carbon dioxide being the most important-as the primary cause of the observed warming. I believe Australia has an obligation to act to reduce its carbon emissions. The science clearly proves that reduction in carbon emissions is the key to tackling climate change. As the highest per capita emitter in the developed world and one of the 20 largest emitters on an absolute basis, Australia must take action. As part of the international efforts to tackle climate change, Australia under the Labor government ratified the Kyoto protocol, a move the Howard Liberal government could not bring itself to make. Under the Kyoto protocol, Australia is committed to restraining its national emissions to an average of 108 per cent of 1990 levels over the first commitment period from 2008 to 2012. Whilst Australia's emissions projections released on 9 February this year demonstrate that Australia is on track to meet this target, without additional policy action our emissions are projected to be 24 per cent above 2000 levels by 2020 and 44 per cent above 2000 levels by 2030. The ability to generate saleable carbon credits provides an investment incentive helping to channel carbon finance into land sector abatement. These bills will allow for carbon farming projects to be created and for the carbon sequestered in these projects to exchanged for Australian carbon credit units. It is crucial that the integrity of the abatement projects is protected, and this ensure that credits can be bought and sold with the assurance that carbon has been or will be abated. Under this legislation, the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units will oversee the issuing of the Australian carbon credit units. The Australian national registry already exists as an electronic system which is used to ensure accurate accounting of the issuance, holding, transfer, acquisition, cancellation, retirement and carry over of emissions units under the Kyoto protocol. This legislation will combine the registry functions of the Carbon Farming Initiative and the Kyoto protocol together in the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units. Offset projects will be required to use methodologies assessed and endorsed by the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee and approved by the minister. The committee is an independent expert that assesses draft methodologies proposed for use under the scheme. These methodologies contain the detailed rules for implementing and monitoring specific abatement activities and generating carbon credits under the scheme. This legislation also commits to monitoring the impact of the scheme on the environment and on rural communities and to taking steps to prevent perverse impacts if there is evidence that projects are likely to have a material and adverse impact on the allocation of prime agricultural land, water availability or biodiversity. I refer to statements in support of this legislation from the National Farmers Federation. On 24 March this year they put out a media release welcoming the be introduction of the Carbon Farming Initiative legislation to parliament and noting that the NFF were pleased it had addressed a number will of key concerns raised through the draft consultation process. Further, they said: The Government deserves credit for listening to the farm sector and modifying its proposal to ensure that genuine abatement opportunities under the CFI are not unnecessarily overlooked. The government has been supporting research into land based carbon abatement. Some of the serious work in researching how carbon abatement can be achieved on the land has already commenced. For instance, under the Australia's Farming Future program, the federal government has funded $46 million over four years to research how primary producers can reduce carbon emissions. The CSIRO and other research institutions are making important advances under this program. The Soil Carbon Research Program funded under Australia's Farming Future is developing a scientific understanding of the potential of Australia's agricultural sequester carbon. Early trials show that perennial grasses including kikuyu grass can increase soil carbon levels. Additional research is investigating tillage methods, crop rotation and other practical steps that may increase carbon sequestration. Research to date is showing that if farms adopt new tillage methods or use perennial grasses they could increase carbon absorption in the soil, generate carbon credits and improve the quality of the land. Other research programs include the Reducing Emissions from Livestock Research Program. It is estimated that direct livestock emissions account for about 12 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions and account for nearly three-quarters of all agricultural emissions. Researchers are investigating whether livestock can be bred as low-methane emitters without compromising production. Another area of research is in the investigation of biological methods to reduce carbon emissions-for example, viruses to attack the microbes that generate methane emissions in the digestion process. Thirdly, research is being conducted into feed supplements and the impact these may have on the carbon emitted by farm animals. Recent research at the Victorian Department of Primary Industries in Ellinbank shows that modifying the diet of dairy cows with feed supplements such as brewers' grains, a by-product of beer making, cuts cows' methane emissions. The research shows that, for every one per cent increase in fat in the of dairy cows, methane emissions are cut by 3.5 per cent. Lead researcher Peter Moate said that this was significant, as each year a dairy cow emitted approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases as a family motor car. He also advised that the fatty supplements did not affect the dairy cows' soils to appetite or milk production. The research being conducted into how to reduce carbon from farming and how to absorb carbon into land and vegetation is showing positive results, and this legislation has the potential to attract funding for implementing this research into rural communities, as the reduction in carbon will now generate saleable certificates. The Carbon Farming Initiative will create an economic opportunity for Australian farmers and other land managers to generate accredited carbon credits which can be sold in Australia and allows Australian agriculture to take advantage of the growing international carbon market. The legislated scheme will allow sellers to deal directly with buyers and leverage the opportunities of the marketplace. Such a marketplace allows companies to invest in local land sector abatement through long-term contracts and partnerships with farmers and landholders. But, in order to drive this marketplace for carbon abatement schemes, we will need a price on carbon. A price on carbon emissions will create demand for carbon credits, as companies and entities-in fact, everyone involved in the process-will need to reduce their carbon emissions or purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions. On 24 February this year, the government announced a framework for a carbon price due to take effect from 1 July 2012. This framework does not place any liability on agricultural, forestry or legacy waste emissions produced. However, the Carbon diet Farming Initiative will ensure that any project that reduces emissions on the land will be able to generate funding from the sale of carbon credits. The Labor government is committed to taking action to deal with climate change. This legislation is an important part of that action and I commend these bills to the House.",151
240,Mr CHESTER,COMMITTEES," In joining the debate on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 I intend to take up where the shadow minister for agriculture left off earlier this morning posing the question: why would we trust this government in relation to the future of farming? It is like there is a message coming from those opposite: I am from the Labor Party and I am here to help. And as the shadow minister rightly indicated the bill before the House is incomplete and misleading. The shadow minister used the phrase that it is like 'mutton dressed as At the risk of prolonging the rural metaphors for too much longer, there are so many holes in this you could drive a Mack truck through it. This government expects the coalition to blindly accept this bill. They seem to be simply saying, 'Trust us and we will add the details later on in the regulations.' You will have to excuse my cynicism, but the people of my electorate have no reason whatsoever to trust this government when it comes to its policies relating to climate change and emissions reductions. This bill, as those opposite have indicated, feeds directly into the broader debate about this government's policies on so-called 'dangerous' climate change. The minister for climate change was in Gippsland last week and was on ABC Radio, where he almost tied himself in knots avoiding using the word 'tax'. During the interview I counted the number of times the minister referred to the government's carbon policy, and it was all about a 'carbon price'. Obviously the focus groups have tried to sanitise the tax now. It has got to be a carbon price. We do not talk about tax any more, apparently. Painfully avoiding the word 'tax' will not escape the attention of the people of Gippsland, who, as on many occasions in the past, will be at the pointy end of any government policies in relation to the emission of carbon dioxide. On a more positive note, it was good that the minister actually visited Gippsland. He is by the first cabinet minister to visit and actually consult with my community in relation to the government's climate change policy. I appreciate that he took the time to attend a summit in the electorate. But I would encourage him to go out into the broader community. If he had he would have picked up on the anger and disappointment within my community about the way this lamb'. government has conducted itself on this particular issue. The bottom line is that the people in Gippsland and the La Trobe Valley do not want this government's household assistance package. They want to keep their jobs. This government accuses the coalition of running a scare campaign, yet listen to their rhetoric. Listen to the words they use out in the community in relation to their policies on carbon dioxide emissions. They love using the term 'dangerous climate change'. They cannot help themselves-they have to refer to 'dirty' coal-fired power stations. They must always mention '1,000 biggest polluters'. They do not mention the fact that they also happen to be some of the biggest employers in this nation. Let's vilify them as these 'dirty polluters' who are causing 'dangerous climate change'. This rhetoric has got to stop. This government is embarrassing itself with the public by its attempt to vilify some of the most successful businesses in our nation, and they are also vilifying the men and women who work in these coalfired power stations, who have done nothing more than they were asked to do by our nation. They have provided cheap, reliable baseload energy for our nation and now this Labor Party-the party that used to stand up for workers-is vilifying these people in communities like the La Trobe Valley. This government should be embarrassed by its conduct. We also have the government out there talking about 'saving' the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu, as if Australia alone could actually do anything in terms of the ultimate environmental impacts of any forecast in relation to climate change. This deliberate scaring and spreading of myths is all about gaining support for a tax. Government MPs are also desperately trying to avoid mentioning this fundamental breach of trust. This is where the government has its biggest problem in the electorate. Before the election this Prime Minister said: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. It is becoming abundantly clear that this Prime Minister is not leading anything, when you have Kevin Rudd running foreign policy, Bob Brown running domestic policy and the Prime Minister running out of excuses. But put that aside. The fundamental breach of trust is where this government has its greatest problem. You now bring this bill Flannery, into the House and expect Gippslanders to take you on trust that the Carbon Farming Initiative is in their interests, when the government has not even released the details of how the carbon tax, which will directly feed into this process, will play out in the broader community. When government ministers come to my electorate, I have constantly asked them just to be honest in this debate about climate change. And I can report a small breakthrough this week. We had Minister Combet actually admitting that no Australian solution to this problem would save the Great Barrier Reef. He has finally come out and explained that it will take global action. But, if you had listened over the past three years during which I have been in this place, we have heard constantly from those opposite how they are taking action now to save the Great Barrier Reef. But Australia emits only 1.5 per cent of total global emissions. If we cut all our emissions, we do not do anything about the other 98.5 per cent, so how is that going to save the Great Barrier Reef. Stop telling people lies about what can be achieved by Australians acting independently of other nations. It is great that the minister this week finally indicated that we are better off directing our money and energy at direct local action ahead of any global efforts in terms of the so-called 'saving' of the Great Barrier Reef. We have had our own climate change zealot in Tim Flannery out there admitting the same thing this week. He even went a step further when, in March this year, he said: If the world as a whole cut all emissions tomorrow, the average temperature of the planet is not going to drop for several hundred years, perhaps over 1000 years. To me that is a very telling admission by Mr because he has finally acknowledged that we are talking about long-term change. The temperature of the planet is not going to drop for several hundred years and perhaps over 1,000 years. That is what Mr Flannery said. He also said this week that reputable scientists do have different views on man's impact and man's contribution to climate change. So, finally, there is a little bit of honesty coming into the debate and some sort of recognition that not everyone who has some degree of caution in relation to the more extreme forecasts is a sceptic or somehow a denier, now that even Mr Flannery admits that there are reputable scientists who have different views. We are after all only talking about models and forecasts. Just as an aside, when the weather bureau cannot reliably tell me what the weather is going to be like tomorrow and then tells me that in 100 years there are going to be sea level rises of a metre as a result of climate change, I think I am entitled to exercise a level of caution in deciding whether to accept everything that is put to me about weather, climate and long-term trends. This government wants to take reckless action that will send Australian jobs overseas by driving up the costs of production, yet, as Tim Flannery has indicated, the average temperature of the planet will not move for 1,000 years. I want to refer specifically to the concerns I have about the future of the Latrobe Valley under this government. When the minister visited the Latrobe Valley he repeatedly refused to give a guarantee that this government will actually undertake a social and economic analysis of the impact of its policies in our community. The question must now be asked: what is the minister hiding? Why won't the Gillard government be honest with the people of the Latrobe Valley and undertake a full assessment of the costs and benefits of its policies in relation climate change and emissions reductions? That is the fundamental point for the people in my region. If the government is not prepared to explain what the actual costs and benefits to them and their households will be, why would we take it at its word on the carbon tax or any other policy? The Latrobe Valley, as I have said many times in this place and I say again tonight, is absolutely at the pointy end of this debate, yet the government has refused to undertake a cost benefit analysis of how its policies will play out in a regional community like Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley. Extending the argument, why would farming families take this government at its word on the bill before the House when the Labor Party is happy to strip water out of communities in the Murray-Darling Basin without any consideration whatsoever of the broader social and economic impacts? We are faced with the same situation here in relation to the government's policies on pricing carbon. Instead of the empty rhetoric we have been getting, the families in the Latrobe Valley deserve to know whether their jobs will be affected under this government's carbon tax. If the government does not know the answer yet-if the government does not know whether or not jobs will be lost-how can it realistically expect the people of my community to support its policies? I do acknowledge that the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government acknowledged today in the media that coal will play an important part in our nation's energy needs for decades into the future. That is a breakthrough. It is a breakthrough to have a government minister actually acknowledge the importance of coal. I wonder how Labor's partners in government, the Greens, reacted to that? I wonder if that statement had to be run past to the Greens' media unit, since the Greens have such have such a hold over this government? I sincerely hope there will be other ministers who will state the obvious fact that coal is such an important part of the future energy needs of our nation. I believe the Latrobe Valley has a great future. Our challenge, though, is to get rid of this government to allow us to achieve that future. In the Latrobe Valley we have 500 years worth of brown coal reserves. I cannot think of another nation in the world with an extraordinary natural resource of that capacity that would simply be saying, 'We can't use dirty brown coal; we're going to leave it in the ground.' That is a ridiculous proposition in a world where energy demand is growing. Our challenge",154
241,Mr Adams,COMMITTEES,That's cheap populism.,157
242,Mr CHESTER,COMMITTEES,"I will take up that interjection. Now we know what backbenchers from the Labor Party actually think. They think it is cheap populism to talk about Latrobe Valley power workers' jobs. Well, congratulations to the backbenchers of the Labor Party. That is what they now think about the workers of our nation. Congratulations! It is no wonder the Labor Party cannot hold a seat east of Melbourne if that is what they think of the workers these days. You should be embarrassed. There are 500 years worth of brown coal. It is a reliable natural resource. It provides a cheap form of energy, and our challenge is to use it in the most environmentally friendly way possible. There have been some remarkable efforts over the past decade by companies that are exploring ways to reduce the moisture content and export brown coal. There is a well-advanced proposal to use the carbon dioxide emissions to grow algae for several environmentally friendly products, and I understand there have been some great breakthroughs with a particular project in the Townsville area. Carbon geosequestration remains, I admit, something of a holy grail for the coal-fired power stations, and it is doubtful whether it will proceed on an industrial scale in the foreseeable future, but the research and development is needed in this particular space. The point I am trying to make is that over the past six or seven decades working families-who the Labor Party used to speak so much about-in the Latrobe Valley have made an enormous contribution to the Australian nation, and they will continue to do so if they are supported in the future. They should not be vilified in this place. The government should not be using terms like 'dirty coal-fired power stations' and 'the 1,000 biggest polluters'. It should start acknowledging some of the positive achievements of these families working in my region. The Nationals do support a range of policies that provide for direct action to meet the agreed emissions reduction target of five per cent by 2020, but our policy is to avoid the punitive nature of the carbon tax and provide incentives for these companies to invest in technology and new systems to reduce their emissions. Some very successful trial projects have already been undertaken in the Latrobe Valley region with funding from both the former Labor state government and the coalition government at a federal level. We do support direct and practical environmental action that achieves a positive outcome, makes sense in terms of improved productivity and builds a bridge with the sections of the community who have some reasonable doubts about some of the more extreme forecasts. I believe that is the real opportunity for us in building community consensus about the need to undertake practical environmental works. This government has a long list of failures when it comes to its so-called green programs. There was the home insulation disaster in which four people tragically lost their lives. We had the abandoned cash-forclunkers policy and the green loans and home assessors programs. The wasteful and reckless policy we have seen from this government is probably the worse in living memory, and now the government expects us to trust it with this important piece of legislation-the same government that could not deliver any of these programs just mentioned, the same government that cut $11 million out of the forward budget estimates for Landcare. So we have a government that will cut money out of Landcare but is still able to find money for a climate change advertising campaign. Given a choice between propaganda and propagation, government will always go for selfpromotion and the propaganda campaign. I do not believe that the community trusts this government to be able to deliver any program, particularly something as complex as this carbon farming initiative. Like other speakers on this side of the House I will reserve my judgment until we see the full details of this bill, but I am not convinced that this government understands the risky nature of the path it wants to lead Australian farmers down. At a time when food security should be the focus of national attention, we run the risk of introducing a scheme that will see prime agricultural land turned into forests on the back of government incentives. Any schemes that distort land use decisions and result in large tracts of prime agricultural land being turned into plantations are a huge risk for the future of rural and regional Australia. Our prime agricultural land must be protected from this type of government interference. I congratulate the many members on this side of the House who expressed similar sentiments. I am not against tree planting or reforestation projects in the appropriate places, such as on the more marginal land in our nation, but that has not been the experience of many rural and regional communities over recent years. I fear that this government does not properly understand the needs of communities. Simply saying 'trust us' will not wash with farming families.",157
243,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES," The rationale for these bills is to establish the Carbon Farming Initiative to give farmers, forest growers and landholders access to domestic voluntary and international carbon markets. This will begin to unlock the abatement opportunities in the land sector, which currently make up 23 per cent of Australia's emissions. The Carbon Farming Initiative will include a carbon crediting this mechanism, the scheme; funding to fast track the development of methodologies for offset projects, including on-farm demonstration of biochar; and information and tools to help farmers and landholders benefit from carbon markets. In 2010, this government undertook to give farmers, forest growers and landholders access to carbon markets so that they could offset costs that they might incur while they abate carbon emissions, which currently make up 23 per cent of those in Australia. The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 fulfils that election commitment. Australia has among the highest agricultural emissions of the developed countries. But because we are a very big country we also have significant opportunities to increase carbon storage in our landscape. This scheme presents an opportunity for Australia to address those high emissions and for the agriculture sector to be part of the ongoing actions to address the changing climatic conditions. The CSIRO and other research institutions are making important advances in carbon estimation techniques. And, as revealed in the House of Representatives report Farming the future, which included evidence from around the country, innovative farmers have regional already been developing ways to improve the health of agricultural soils, to improve herd efficiency, to include tree farming as part of their mix and to generally farm more sustainably. This scheme will drive and reward efforts in developing Australian innovation. Farmers and landholders will be rewarded for their actions to reduce or store carbon pollution. This is a very important step forward for regional and rural Australia. It will create incentives to protect our natural environment and adopt more sustainable farming practices as well as mitigate climate change. Increasing carbon storage in agricultural soils improves soil health and productivity. Revegetation will help restore degraded landscape, protect biodiversity and bring underutilised land into production. Tree planting can help to address salinity, reduce erosion and act as a carbon sink. In this discussion we have to ask ourselves about the role carbon plays in our daily lives and what it is about its presence our lives that makes it so important that we do something about it. There needs to be an understanding of what carbon is and how it relates to our lives. We rely on a variety of elements and compounds for life, including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, helium, methane and hydrogen. There are some others, but they are not very important to this discussion. A mixture of these makes up the air we breathe. Carbon dioxide is a minor part of the air but it has a major impact as it helps to keep our planet and us warm and prevents us from freezing to death. Of course, there is also a bad side. Too much carbon dioxide will cause the earth to heat up and become too hot-the greenhouse effect. That is a scientific fact. There is enough science to give us that belief. It is this that is causing us to query the growing carbon content of the atmosphere. It is said that the world has been growing warmer since the industrial revolution because more carbon has been emitted than can naturally be taken up. Therefore, it is important to have some sort of control over the release of carbon dioxide, and setting a price on carbon emissions has been identified by the Stern review and the Garnaut report, among many others, as a critical policy tool for achieving carbon reductions. Therefore, a carbon price needs to be set, but we need to allow time for industry to implement measures to limit or offset the costs so that we can continue to compete in the world market. One way of coping with unduly high carbon emissions is to relate those to how we can reduce their impact. It means that carbon has to become a commodity that can play a role in the market, much like what has been done in relation to water in this country. Therefore, we need a scheme that will allow sellers to deal directly with buyers and leverage the opportunities of the marketplace. Such a marketplace will allow in companies to invest in local land sector abatement through long-term contracts and partnerships with farmers and landholders. Markets are not new to farmers and nor are many of the things that can save or store carbon, such as trees and soil. What farmers need is a mechanism to add value to their actions and help them decide whether or not to invest. And that is what this series of bills is all about. One of the areas dear to me where this could play a very important part in the future is that of forestry. Carbon markets are one of the elements now falling into place as a potential driver of investment in forestry. By recognising the contribution of forestry to the carbon economy, we are placing a value on forestry which should allow it to compete for investment dollars with other parts of the economy. Using trees to take up excess carbon is not new and there are other ways to lock up carbon for use in another form. But it needs to work within an economic framework so that industry can be encouraged to lessen its emissions or to trade them with another industry so the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere is not increased. Tasmania is well placed to develop our forest industry to be a carbon store in wood products such as building materials and wooden furniture. It can help to provide carbon credits to high emitters. But to do this, we need a trading scheme and a carbon price. Using the carbon trading schemes it is possible for rural industries to work together network. to develop a more sustainable farming and forestry industry. For instance, Forestry Tasmania runs a program called Trees on Farms. Trees on Farms encourages landowners to partner Forestry Tasmania in planting trees on land that would otherwise be unproductive. The program provides a timber resource to Forestry Tasmania and a revenue stream for farmers. Forestry Tasmania provides the tree growing expertise and management, the farmer provides the land, the farmer enjoys the environmental benefits of tree growing and both share in the returns. In the New England region of New South Wales, the Engineered Woodlands Project utilises tree plantings to provide carbon offsets, windbreaks and stock shelters, as well as a harvestable resources. Through careful design, it was possible to place a substantial proportion of a property under trees with no loss of stock-carrying capacity or productivity. In Victoria, the Otway Agroforestry Network offers an extension service focused on farmers developing forestry skills so that they can have exclusive control of the forestry resources developed on their land. The network focuses on trees as part of the farm infrastructure, providing aesthetic value, environmental services-habitat for birds as part of integrated pest management, stock shelter and revegetation of water courses-while also providing an income stream through the production of highquality sawlogs. The key to success was giving each farmer the training and tools to manage the timber on their own properties, within the context of group leadership and peer support. Farmers undertook formal training through the master treegrowers course, and had access to expertise and support within the Network cooperation meant that relatively small stands of timber could be harvested at commercial rates. The result of the network's operation was a significant increase in tree cover without loss of productivity, and an improvement in the commercial and environmental sustainability of individual farm enterprises. When I listen to the doubters on the other side, I think we have to be careful about the way we treat the scientific data that we hear. If we look at the mountains of information that are currently scurrying around our media sources, our emails, our blogs and tweets and our day-today information-if we really come down to the nitty-gritty it appears that, although we know that there are significant changes going on, what we really do not know is their actual impact. Climate change information is only as good as the models that have been put up, and the bottom line is that they are inconclusive. That is why we get such a range of views around the globe. Nothing is really right or wrong and we will only really know what will happen when it happens. According to Professor Michael Hulme of the University of East Anglia, one of the leading commentators on climate change, climate change projections are only as good as their models, and we know models are not infallible because they are made by us, humans-educated humans, scientists, and other professionals, but humans nonetheless. So what we are really into is risk assessment-like an insurance company goes through all the possible risks to a body or an individual-and coming up with some plan to mitigate any possible risks. I believe that is what we are about at the moment with this debate. Nothing is absolute and the effects and risks of not doing anything in the long run depends on who you are and where you live. Like insurance companies have done for decades, trading in offsetting their risks, these bills give us an option to work dealing with a very real risk and helping the big emitters to offset their risks by investing in the carbon reduction activities, such as farms and forestry. Shouldn't we, as decision makers, take decisions to mitigate those risks by setting a price on the cost of reducing a possible severe risk to our world? Scientists are telling us that there are methods and systems to ensure we do not have to deal with a major world catastrophe sometime vaguely in the future-maybe tomorrow, maybe in a hundred years time. We should make those decisions now and try and alleviate the risk by understanding our systems better. There needs to be some understanding on how each activity can actually be assessed. For example, with tree growth, some trees species grow faster than others, some get a lot bigger than others and therefore will be able to process more carbon. So we need experts to advise us on the best species and the best methods. Therefore, an independent expert committee, the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, has been established to ensure that estimation methodologies are rigorous and lead to real abatement. But trees ultimately die after a finite period and therefore no longer can take up carbon. So there is little point in them remaining upright taking up air space that could be replaced by a young, vigorous, carbon-devouring tree. Managed forestry allows for the trees to reach their economic peak and then be harvested for specific purposes, such as furniture, building materials, paper and even crafts, allowing that stored carbon to be permanently locked up and used elsewhere. Other elements of the design of the scheme to ensure the integrity of credits include: issuing credits after the sequestration or emissions reductions have on actually occurred; tracking of credits through a central national registry, which is included in the registry bill; transparency provisions, including the publication of a wide range of information about approved projects; appropriate enforcement provisions to address non-compliance; and a robust audit scheme based on the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme. Carbon storage has to be permanent if it is going to be treated as equivalent to carbon emissions from the industrial sectors-and what is more permanent than a house made of wood with its fittings and furniture all storing carbon! Participants would be able to cancel their project and hand back credits issued at any time-for example, because they wish to sell the land or use it for something else. Land managers would not have to hand back credits if carbon stores are lost because of bushfire or drought. This is a very important point to understand. Instead, land manager-holders will be required to take steps to re-establish lost carbon stores. Temporary losses of carbon following a bushfire or drought would be covered by a risk of reversal buffer where a proportion of the credits are withheld. So a scheme by which we can set a price for carbon and use it for assisting both industry and the rural sector in reducing emissions-which will start to mitigate the risk of further global warming-is essential for Australia. I don't believe we are alone in this. Other countries are starting to work at this problem without signing up to particular protocols; they are minimising their risk. We have already seen Qantas highlighting that they will have to put up fares next year as the EU has penalised the airline because Australia does not have a price on greenhouse emissions. Qantas will have to pay 15 per cent on its carbon emissions from its nearest port of call. The world will not away! We have to start taking these steps. I support the legislation.",158
244,Mr HAASE,COMMITTEES," I thank the member for Lyons because the longer he spoke the more information he gave me to use as ammunition. Of course, the member for Lyons was speaking of those who may doubt the issue of global warming. It strikes me that the member for Lyons may be in that very same category. The issue that he has raised is the absolute unknown factors in relation to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bill that we are discussing. The coalition, as is well known by our government friends, support the idea of carbon sequestration in soil and various other attributes of farming carbon. What we do not support is simply accepting, in the broadest of terms without analysis, some proposition being put up by a government that has such a track record of failure. Anything this government was to suggest albeit, prima facie, quite reasonable, you would surely doubt the veracity of because the track record is there. We know it well but I will mention some of them again. They had a great idea to save the economy and save energy by insulating ceilings, prima facie, a wonderful idea. It was an abject failure that burned down houses, cost lives and is costing taxpayers millions of dollars still to check where they went wrong. And we were promised this was going to be absolute lifesaver. School halls-wonderful monuments were built to the Prime Minister but at what cost to the Australian taxpayer? Where was the veracity? Where was the rigour? Where was the value for money? Totally absent. Solar panels-great idea for anyone totally ignorant as to how to select the best process of renewable energy. go Photovoltaic cells seems to be a great ideaenergy for free from the sun. Well it is not free; it is about six times the price of power generation by coal. That has been a failure and is starting to send state governments broke. Then we had the issue of the cash for clunkers. That lasted a very, very short period of time. But, once again, it was a bright idea. I am sure the surveyed groups and the consultative groups that were listening to the public would have rushed to the caucus and said: 'We have another idea that is going to save the planet.' That did not last long. How are we, as intelligent members of this parliament, in this place to take seriously a proposition from the government-until we see the detail; maybe this Friday-and why would we for a moment accept that this is a good idea as it is presented? My experience indicates quite clearly that those on the land have a lot of common sense and they are not easily fooled. They will not swallow glibly the ideas that are proposed by this government because lurking in the background is the knowledge that this government's reputation will surely result in this proposition being yet another failure. We are being told that, of course, this is a panacea and this will be one of the tools in the box, so to speak, that will bring salvation and credit to this government. I am not going to hold my breath waiting for the time when the Australian public recognises that this government can save itself. Everywhere I go-and I accept I am from Western Australia and many recognise that we are slightly different-I hear the clamour of constituents for the cessation of this government and this government's policies that are impacting negatively on the people of Western Australia. Quite frankly, my great concern is for the people of Durack. They are my primary concern. They are taxpaying Australians and they deserve better than that that is being meted out by this government, especially when we are confronted with legislation that has no rigour whatsoever, not an ounce of real detail that will allow those people who might put this program into play-that is, the farmers of Australia, specifically in my case the farmers of Durack. They are wanting this government to give them some indication that there is an opportunity for them to contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and, at the same time, use some of their non-productive land to turn a quid. Farming is a tough game these days. It is dependent upon so many externals. This might at best-as I said I will not hold my breath-be a salvation for farmers who are doing it tough and it may make some serious contribution to carbon sequestration. There are so many holes and so many unknowns, yet we are being told that this is a great panacea. The member for Lyons, of course, raised the issue that it depends model. So much depends on the fine print of the final regulation that will be addressing the core of this legislation. Amongst other things we do not at this stage know even the starting point for the cost of a tonne of carbon. Therefore, farmers have no idea of the value of compensation for planting out hectares of non-productive country with trees. They know nothing about what the impact will be of some climatic event that will release the carbon that is contained in those trees. NA",162
245,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mallee Electorate: Australian Natural Disasters",163
246,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT," I report to the House the impacts of the unprecedented floods in north-west Victoria which occurred in January and February this year and which continue to take a massive toll. It was quite a shock to the north-west of Victoria, which is often regarded as the arid region of the state, to suffer unprecedented meteorological outcomes. In Mildura in March the notional average rainfall fell on that city in less than eight hours. The trauma continues. The media is long gone now but families are struggling to come to terms with the financial and emotional loss that has resulted. Every day there seems to be a new issue for my office in offering morale support as families struggle with their insurance companies who are denying claims and with their efforts to get their businesses back on track. There were outcomes in the rural city of Mildura, my largest municipality; the shire of Swan Hill; on the Gannawarra shire, which affected the townships of Kerang, Murrubit and Benjeroop-which Prince William visited because they endured long inundation there and some of the houses are still under water; Horsham and Dadswells Bridge down through the Wimmera; Dimboola; and Jeparit in the Hindmarsh shire across the western Wimmera. Of all the municipalities, the worse of all is the shire of Buloke, encompassing the townships of Donald and Charlton. I particularly raise the issue of Charlton. There are people there living on bare floor boards with their gyprock plaster removed up to hip height, no heating and enduring the anxiety of waiting for the insurer to decide whether or not they are going to honour a claim. But, worse than that, Charlton lost its hospital, aged-care service facility and the medical clinic, all in one complex, inundated with water up to my shoulders. I was grateful for the request from the Prime Minister at the time asking, 'What do you need?' I said we needed a field hospital immediately for Charlton between her office and the state government in Victoria. That was provided within a few days. I am grateful for that, but the problems at the medical centre at Charlton continue. On Monday this week I wrote to the Hon. Nicola Roxon, the Minister for Health and Ageing, for some assistance here. To add insult to injury, as well as losing the surgery the doctor's house has been inundated and his insurer will not honour the claim for flood despite the doctor thinking that he was insured for flood. He is in that predicament and not in a very good state of mind. I have written to the minister for some assistance here. His business has been dramatically impacted. For a GP in a country town with a hospital and an aged-care facility when 25 aged care residents are shifted right across the region, 20 or 30 per cent of his income has just disappeared. He is a very good Irish trained doctor. I remember years ago supporting his application to come to Manangatang in my electorate. He later moved to Charlton. We need some sort of sustainability just to keep him there, because if we lose this really good country doctor the capacity to attract another doctor to Charlton is going to be impossible without the resolution of the hospital and so forth. So far to this stage the field hospital is operating there with pretty limited capacity. A new temporary clinic has been established and a doctor has been able to move back to town. There is temporary accommodation being provided as far east as Bendigo. We need to get behind this doctor. I plead with the minister for some ongoing assistance for its Charlton. They are good, determined and resolute people. They have coped with three floods in less than six months and they need desperate help. I am hoping she will respond to my letter with the greatest of expedition and I look forward to a positive outcome to keep this doctor in Charlton. I thank the House for an opportunity to bring this report. There are a host of other issues I could report on, but I might leave that to another occasion. This is the most urgent one. A township like Charlton without a medical doctor is not a good formula for rehabilitating people through the future. They need good strong medical and emotional support, and I am pleading for the government to respond to my request. Visit of President of Cyprus",163
247,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to acknowledge the state visit by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, His Excellency Mr Demetris Christofias, to Australia. He arrived today for a five-day official visit. This visit is highly significant for both Cypriot and Greek Australians. On behalf of the community I would like to extend to him a warm welcome. The visit is a wonderful opportunity for all Cypriot and Greek Australians, as it represents the strengthening of the rich people-to-people bonds which exist between our nations. I acknowledge the significance of this visit for the enhancement of the very friendly bilateral relationship between the Republic of Cyprus and the Commonwealth of Australia. The vibrant relationship is characterised by strong and enduring bonds of friendship and of cooperation and it is underpinned by people-to-people links. Both countries share common values such as respect for democratic principles, human rights and the law, and of course Australia and Cyprus cooperate in many international fora such as the United Nations and the Commonwealth. It is very important that we recognise the continuing, untiring efforts and the positive contribution that His Excellency Mr Christofias has made for the reunification of Cyprus in the framework of the agreed basis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship and a single international personality, which is important for any nation, and a settlement in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Cyprus and the principles on which the EU is founded, because the Republic of Cyprus is a member of the EU. All these things safeguard the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people. Australia has an interest within the region and global interests as well. We have an interest in contributing to and further playing an active role in multilateral fora such as United Nations and the Commonwealth. We recognise the importance of upholding their principles, including those enshrined in the UN Charter. Australia thus follows with interest the developments that take place on the Cyprus issue, recognising the importance of reaching a just and lasting agreed settlement. A significant number of my constituents in the electorate of Hindmarsh in South Australia are of Cypriot descent. They make an invaluable contribution to multicultural spirit of our society, which I am sure is recognized by everyone in this House. The visit of the President of the Republic of Cyprus today underlines the positive role of Cypriot Australians in the communities in all of our electorates, and it is underpinned by Cyprus's genuine desire to further upgrade this relationship. As a member of the Australia-Cyprus Parliamentary Friendship Group, I assure this House that we will continue to play a role in fostering the relationship. We are hosting a breakfast tomorrow morning for the president and for members of all political parties who are members of the AustraliaCyprus Parliamentary Friendship Group to welcome the president and Mrs Christofias to Australia. During his time in Australia, the president will be travelling to my home state of South Australia where he will meet with the Cypriot community and will lay a foundation stone at the community's new cultural centre, which I am very pleased to say is in the suburb of West Hindmarsh in the electorate Hindmarsh. The function tomorrow night will be hosted by the president of the South Australian Cypriot community, Mr Chris Ioannou, who I know actually lives in the electorate of Port Adelaide. I am very pleased to see the member for Port Adelaide, Mark Butler, here in the chamber tonight, the and of course Sophie Mirabella, who is here in support as well. He will also be meeting with the premier of South Australia, the Hon. Mike Rann, and will attend a lunch with the Governor of South Australia, Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce. Today he attended a lunch with the PM and will be at a function with the Governor General tonight, which unfortunately I will not be able to attend because we are here in this chamber. It is a true honour to host the president in my home state of South Australia tomorrow, the where the Cypriot community will this year be celebrating its 63rd anniversary. In my electorate of Hindmarsh alone, there are well over 2,000 people who identify themselves as Cypriot Australians. It is an extremely strong and supportive community and I know that the whole community is absolutely delighted that the president is taking the time to visit not only Australia but also South Australia. We look forward to having him there. (Time expired) Manufacturing Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (19:10): We are halfway through National Manufacturing Week and, sadly, the woeful and weak Gillard government still cannot even summon so much as a half-hearted interest in the sector's future. Nearly 90,000 jobs have already been lost under Labor. There have been more than 20 separate monthly contractions in sectoral activity, after 13 expansions in the last 14 months of the Howard government. A string manufacturing businesses have been forced to close or are relocating offshore. The government has failed to seriously address the increasingly fraught problem of the ineffectiveness of Australia's anti-dumping laws. They have not adequately changed government procurement processes that are not always working in the best interests of local firms. And now there is the imposition of a carbon tax on a sector that is already punch drunk after being whacked between the eyes again and again by a government that appears to be hell bent on beating it surrender. The tragedy is that it does not have to come to this. If sensible policies had been put in place and if the government were not now trying to saddle the sector with a carbon tax then we could actually do something to assist innovative and hard-working Australian manufacturers. Instead, thousands of hard-working Australians are paying for the government's incompetence with lost jobs and lost opportunities. Sadly, the industry minister has been spearing the darts at Australian businesses himself. He should be ashamed to collect the salary of a cabinet minister and purport to represent the interests of Australian manufacturing. He has pretended on the one hand, through his meaningless rhetoric, that he is interested in activities like manufacturing but, behind the sector's back, he has not done a damn thing to build a policy framework and that has left the sector particularly exposed. Unfortunately, there is a stench and a deep seated hostility that has grown all around this minister and it is engulfing him quite desperately. This is a minister who is so badly out of touch that he even sends out media releases that describe axed programs as being 'integral' to his manufacturing vision. For his first few years in the job he played a silly game of picking winners or, to of be more accurate in this government's case, picking losers. But he has lost the game. In fact, he has been given a shellacking at it. To be fair, it is a challenging time for policymakers in this space. But most of the problems have been self-inflicted by this government. Where previous governments engaged in genuine reform, this abysmal administration has been found wanting and failed in any way to confront the serious and difficult issues confronting not just the Australian economy but specifically manufacturing. It has been more interested in into naval gazing and its own spin than in the lives and prosperity of these manufacturing businesses and the decent, hard-working Australians who have invested so much. How much more humiliating can it get for a government when a former union boss who now fancies himself as a Prime Minister in waiting gets the frostiest of frosty receptions from a mass of workers at Port Kembla, or when an industry minister who once eulogised about the importance of working closely with manufacturers is told in no uncertain terms by manufacturing leaders that he is part of a government with an approach that is simplistic, ill-considered, destructive and politically expedient? These are not descriptions from the coalition. These come from the business community, from real people out there employing one million Australians. But what does the government do? It just buries its head in the sand. During this National Manufacturing Week it is time to focus on this particular sector. As hostile as the current government and its supporters are to Australian manufacturing and workers, I applaud the innovation, the commitment and the risks that manufacturing businesses take and commend their innovation and hard work. The coalition recognise this-we value you. We give you a political voice and an alternative of real policy and reform that will see Australia still making things by 2050. (Time expired) Climate Change",164
248,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," At a community forum in Perth the Leader of the Opposition evidently put forward the completely discredited proposition that the science that describes the processes driving climate change 'was not settled' and further stated 'Whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven'. Once again, an unguarded moment, the Leader of the Opposition allowed his strongly held belief that 'climate change is crap' to leak out from his usual deceptive facade of claiming that he either understands the seriousness of the issue or intends to do something about it. On the following day, no doubt following a frenzy of phone calls from his unsettled but more enlightened colleagues, the Leader of the Opposition suddenly discovered that, as he said on Adelaide radio, 'Climate change is real' and 'Humanity is making a contribution' and, furthermore, 'It's important to have a strong and effective policy to bring emissions down and that is what we're doing.' It would appear that the positions of the opposition leader on climate change and its causes now flip-flop on a daily basis, with him on one day saying that climate change is 'crap' and on the next day saying that 'Climate change is real'. I ask tonight: would the Leader of the Opposition please tell us which one of these positions represents the truth as he sees it? The latest version of the opposition's confused policy on climate change that the Leader of the Opposition likes to refer to can be found in documentary form on the Liberal Party's website entitled The Coalition's Direct Action Plan. This rambling document is a grab bag of promises and unworkable proposals that contains no discussion of the science of climate change or of the purpose behind the opposition's muddled measures for emission reductions. Curiously, while the opposition has been claiming that Australia should not be leading the world in measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, this document has a list of major economies that have already introduced carbon taxes and emission trading schemes. The list includes France, which has carbon in taxes and an emissions trading scheme; Germany, which has carbon taxes and an emissions trading scheme; Italy, which has carbon taxes and an emissions trading scheme; the United Kingdom, which has carbon taxes and an emissions trading scheme; Japan, which has carbon taxes and an emissions trading scheme; Canada, which has carbon taxes; Mexico, which has carbon taxes; Turkey, which has carbon taxes; the United States, which has emissions trading for power stations and carbon taxes in some states; and South Africa, which according to the coalition's direct action plan is also considering the introduction of a carbon tax despite the country's position as the world's third largest coal exporter. This list, including errors or omissions, is taken from the current coalition policy document that outlines its proposed measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. By the way, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the assistance of the opposition, the table to which I am referring is on page 9 of their document. In reading his own policy, the Leader of the Opposition may discover that, instead of Australia leading the world in introducing measures to reduce emissions, as he claims, this country is-thanks to the opposition's destructive obstruction and deceptionactually behind many other parts of the world in implementing effective responses to global warming. I suggest that the problem that the Leader of the Opposition and the other deniers have with comprehending the links between carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, global warming and resulting climate change is that they fail to discriminate between belief measurements. I further suggest that the division between the deniers and the scientists is another manifestation of CP Snow's famous Two Cultures, the breakdown in communication between the sciences and the humanities that still forms a major hindrance in the solving of many of the world's problems. To quote Snow: So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into as their Neolithic ancestors would have had. No more is this evident than in the position of the climate change deniers and their supporters in the opposition. My motion that climate change is real and human induced was voted on in this House in February of this year. It was supported by this government. The Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about the economy. I make the point that if you do not look after the environment you have no economy. (Time expired) Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Service Men and Women",167
249,Dr JENSEN,ADJOURNMENT," I was a scientist in a past life and I am sceptical on the science. However, my speech is about something else. In my time as a member I have been in regular contact with members of the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Service Men and Women West Australian Branch, known affectionately as TPIs. TPI members in my electorate have studiously and consistently advocated for the fair indexation of their pensions. On 18 November 2010 the coalition introduced into the Senate the and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010. This coalition bill is still before the Senate. It has gone to committee but has not yet been debated or voted on. I call on Labor, Greens and Independent members of this House to support this bill. The bill affirms the coalition's commitment to introduce a fair, equitable and fiscally responsible military superannuation scheme. Currently, DFRDB and DFRB members have their it superannuation indexed only in line with movements in the CPI. This bill provides for these superannuants, aged 55 and over, to have their superannuation pensions indexed in the same way as Australian government income support pensions. Twice yearly, pensions will be indexed at the higher of the CPI, male total average weekly earnings or the pensioner beneficiary living cost index. This bill provides for superannuants aged 55 and over to have their superannuation pensions indexed in the same way as Australian government income support pensions. Twice yearly, pensions will be indexed to the higher of the consumer price index, male total average weekly earnings or the pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. This will provide increases for over 56,000 retired Australian Defence Force members of the now closed DFRDB and DFRB schemes, with a superannuation pension indexation which better reflects changes in the costs of living. These changes have long been sought by veterans' organisations, including the TPI ex-serviceman in my electorate of Tangney. The change proposed by this bill would bring indexation arrangements for these superannuants into line with the aged pension. These are honourable men and women who served Australia, and the coalition believes this fair indexation is the right thing to do given the unique nature and risks of military service. Australia's service personnel, past and present, after giving so much to their nation, deserve to live their lives with financial security. Widows of superannuants of this scheme will also benefit from the announced changes. Again I call on the on the Independent members and senators, who have been vocal supporters of such measures in the past, to support this bill. The coalition has introduced this bill because Labor's commitment at the 2007 election to fix military superannuation has become another one of its many broken promises. The Gillard Labor government has promised much to those in the veteran community but, as I have heard consistently from local TPI representatives, has repeatedly failed to deliver, due to its self interest and poll driven policy paralysis. Unlike Labor, the coalition has consulted widely and listened carefully to the views put forward by veterans, ex-service people, ex-service organisations and current ADF personnel. Labor has failed veterans when it comes to military superannuation reform. Labor has failed to respond to the review into military superannuation arrangements, whose report it has had for over three years. Ex-serviceman and women deserve more than their empty rhetoric. After spending so much money on pink batts, green loans and the failed BER school halls program, this Labor-Greens government are probably unable and unwilling to find the funds necessary to meet their commitment to veterans and their military superannuation reform requests to 'prevent further erosion due to unfair indexation.' I do not believe the government had any military superannuation policy at the last election. My understanding is that they still do not have any policy on military superannuation reform. There has been more energy and paper spent by the government in criticising this coalition plan than in coming up with anything of their own. I call on the government to listen to veterans in my local community and around Australia, tackle the pressing issues in the veteran community, end the spin, and support the coalition's bill. Banking",168
250,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT," I very much enjoy the opportunity to contribute to adjournment debates and as much enjoy listening to them. I have been enlightened today by the member for Indi, who suddenly discovered anti-dumping issues in the manufacturing section. She is obviously very worried about them, and I look forward to going back to look at all the speeches and motions she moved on that issue when the coalition were in government. I am also going to go back and check all the statements made by the member for Tangney about TPI pension indexation. Given that he does swim against the tide a bit, I give him credit for acknowledging that he may have been swimming against his own government at the time. But I will go and check to see how often he raised both issues when the coalition were in government. I want to talk about a program that the Gillard government has introduced which may seem small in the grand scheme of things but will actually make a significant difference to the lives of some people in my area under the pilot and, I hope, if it goes well, more broadly across the nation. On Tuesday last week I had the great pleasure of participating in the launch of the Community Development Financial Investment Pilot program at the University of Wollongong  Executive Director of Strategic Development at Committee Sector Banking, which is headquartered in Corrimal in my electorate. Community Sector Banking is Australia's only specialist banking service for not-forprofit organisations and it has joined in partnership with another excellent local service, Access Community Group, to deliver a federal government pilot program aimed at addressing financial exclusion in Australia. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, announced on 17 February this year that the federal government will provide $6.27 million for a pilot to be run by five community development finance institutions across Australia to provide individuals and organisations with appropriate financial product loans for people who would otherwise be excluded from accessing such products. This measure recognises that Australia has a well-established banking industry but that there are individuals who suffer financial exclusion. They may suffer from low levels of financial literacy and poor knowledge of financial products and services. For these people, the standard services may be denied because of previous poor credit records or they may indeed exclude themselves because of the lack of trust in or knowledge of those institutions and services. Sadly, all too often these people also fall prey to less scrupulous operators in the financial loans market area, particularly when they are seeking funds often in the most desperate circumstances, which usually leads them into even more financial distress and difficulty and leaves them more at the mercy of the sharks. It is clear from many studies that this sort of pressure is also devastating on families and can in fact contribute directly to problems such as conflict and family breakdown. The CDFI pilot seeks to build the capacity and resilience of disadvantaged and financially excluded individuals by attracting investment and injecting funds into community finance organisations which will then offer the appropriate product and, most importantly, education and support services to manage the repayment of loans. Importantly, this will provide financial literacy skills and improved saving and loan repayment records for these people. It has been proven in other programs that the successful management of a loan, accompanied by new knowledge and skills, can build self-reliance and confidence in the people in the target groups. In the Illawarra, the two local partners have been funded with $2.3 million to deliver the pilot for our region. I am thrilled that this support is now available to disadvantaged people across our area. I welcome the fact that two very local organisations will be entrusted with its delivery-Community Sector Banking, which has been in Wollongong since 2002, and Access Community Group, which has been working with the target group in our area since 1986 and is ably led by Samantha Hill, who is well known to me. It was a pleasure to join the local community support workers at this important local launch last week. I know there was much interest by those who are working with the most disadvantaged in our community in being part of this project in partnership with these groups. I look forward to the stories individuals who manage to get themselves into the mainstream of reliable financial product service and out of the hands of the sharks that operate all too often in this sector-and, as MPs in this place, we are all very familiar with the devastating outcome of their intervention in people's lives. Gilmore Electorate: Tourism Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (19:30): The tourism industry plays a significant role in the economy of the Shoalhaven. But it is a very competitive industry and tourism operators are perpetually challenged in attracting and keeping customers. Those best able to survive know they have to adapt to the changed environment and put into place the necessary changes. A few weeks ago I was privileged to officiate at the relaunch of the Kangaroo Valley Pioneer Museum Park. The role of the museum park is twofold, as the name implies. It entertains and it informs. And what better way to be introduced to local history than by a hands-on approach? The operators of Kangaroo Valley Pioneer Museum Park recognised the need for a makeover, to refresh their product. The staff have been busy, with their volunteers, restoring features. They have restored the forge and bails buildings, moved rock and debris and the chook run from around the old forge and bails. They have created a viewing area with a toughened glass viewing screen. The forge is working, and for the first time was able to see a horse being shod. Not many people have that opportunity, and I am sure it will rivet the attention of many suburban dwellers. They hope to have butter, cheese and candle making and spinning and pottery demonstrations to entertain visitors. There will also be a cow that can be hand milked and a separator to separate the milk from the of cream. Who here can say they have actually seen that being done? I am sure you have, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott.",169
251,Mr Secker,ADJOURNMENT,"I have. Mrs GASH: I am sure there are others too! Thank you. But the ones to gain the most will be the children, because it is they who will inherit this legacy to carry these stories for future generations. An attraction such as this so close to Sydney and Canberra cannot fail to please and educate all who visit, and I hope they will be many. This has only come about through the efforts of many locals, volunteers and the dedicated. Elaine Apperley and her crew have done a marvellous job and I commend them on their achievement. Tourism has been an abiding interest with me, and I can report to the House that the Shoalhaven Tourism Board has gained a new member, me. I am very thrilled at being given the opportunity to renew an unrequited love with the industry. My reason for getting involved as a board member was the successful track record of Shoalhaven Tourism in difficult circumstances. Attracting visitors to the area has been made a little easier following the construction of the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre in Nowra. Last week, we hosted the annual Country Women's Association conference, which brought over 1,000 delegates from all over New South Wales. I have the greatest respect I for this organisation and the work that they do for rural and regional areas such as the Shoalhaven. The power and vibration that comes from the imagination of women with a 'can do' attitude was palpable in the auditorium. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, infectious and inspirational. You really had to be there to gain a full appreciation of the unity of purpose that bound these women. I spoke to a number of delegates before and after the opening address and I can say that I received only positive comments. They said they felt welcome wherever they went, and the hospitality extended to them throughout the town made them feel entirely at home. The service they got in our restaurants and the many accommodation venues they stayed at was first class. The conference not only provided an economic boost to the local coffers but also served as an opportunity to promote the area to other regions. The more who see our product, the greater the likelihood of them telling someone else and enticing them to see for themselves. I cannot stress the importance of the need to continually review the product on offer to ensure the level of appeal is maintained. This holds true not only for our local product but also throughout other tourist destinations within Australia. I hope the Minister for Tourism is aware of the parlous state of tourism in Australia, exacerbated by the strength of our dollar. This is an industry brings something like $92 billion in spending. As a sector, tourism contributes $33 billion in GDP. That is 2.6 per cent of Australia's total GDP. It is not a trivial industry in the overall scheme of things and it has huge potential to grow, with the right approach and adequate support. I can only echo the comments of the industry itself, which has said that reducing red tape and fast-tracking investment, as well as integrating tourism into regional development plans, is essential not only for the future of the tourism industry but also for the very existence of our regional and remote towns. This is exactly the time the government needs to reconsider its approach to tourism and to upgrade the status of the portfolio. I sincerely hope that the new coalition government in New South Wales will make New South Wales No. 1 again for tourism, as the previous Labor minister for tourism was off the radar. Other states were promoting not only to the domestic market but overseas as well, whilst New South Wales was asleep at the wheel. Tourism is the livelihood, as I said, of many regional areas, and that includes the Shoalhaven. I would like to place on the record my appreciation for the foresight of our former mayor Mr Greg Watson, who had the vision to build a 1,000seat auditorium entertainment centre and, not only that, was able to get the building completed. Later this year, we will be hosting the local government conference. So, by building something, we can reward ourselves as well. Banks Electorate: Salvation Army",171
252,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT," Last Thursday, 19 May 2011, I hosted the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. that Jenny Macklin MP, during her visit to my seat of Banks. The purpose of the visit was to show the minister the work done by the Salvation Army St George Community Welfare Centre in Hurstville, particularly in the area of providing emergency assistance to those in desperate need. The Salvation Army has a 130-year history of helping the poor and the disadvantaged. The minister met case managers, both full time and volunteer, together with senior Salvation Army representatives. What really struck both of us was the room at the back of the offices where food and other basic commodities are kept to provide immediate assistance to people coming in off the street. The minister outlined the government's plan, announced in the recent budget, to continue to provide funding for emergency relief and financial counselling through agencies such as the Salvos. The government will be providing an extra $83.3 million to vulnerable Australians over the next four years. This represents a 60 per cent increase on base funding for emergency relief providers across Australia. In my seat $151, 693 will be provided to the Salvation Army, $175,366 to St Vincent de Paul in Hurstville and $176,434 to Padstow Community Centre-a total of over $500,000 for the electorate of Banks alone in 2011-12. This funding will ensure that local people will have access to emergency assistance, including food, clothing and pharmacy and transport vouchers, when they need it most. With our patchwork economy, it is vital that we do not forget those in need. In addition the Australian government will continue to support the No-Interest Loans Scheme, which the Salvation Army's St George community welfare centre currently provides in Hurstville. No-interest loans help people on low incomes make household purchases to meet unexpected costs such as buying a new washing machine. The popular program is delivered nationally by local community organisations in partnership with Good Shepherd Youth and Family Services and NAB. The Australian government is providing $60.6 million over the next four years to support innovative projects such as noand low-interest loan schemes, matched savings schemes and financial literacy projects. In my years practising as a legal aid solicitor and barrister, there were occasions when my clients were desperately in need of life essentials and counselling. The Salvos never let me down. This year the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal will be held on May 28-29 and I will again be involved in assisting the many volunteers as they knock on doors. In my experience, very few people say no to the Salvos and, in fact, are usually very generous. One of the Salvation Army majors I met last week was just on his way back from speaking at local schools to encourage students to act as door-knocking volunteers. I encourage people to either volunteer to assist in collecting for the Red Shield Appeal or, if collectors arrive on your doorstep on 28 or 29 May, to give as generously as you can. I was very pleased to meet with my local Salvos and to introduce the minister to the hard-working team at Hurstville. Again, I encourage everyone to become involved in assisting the Salvos in their vital work. This is the sort of assistance that should be given by government. There is a partnership here and the money that we give is miniscule compared to the effort that is given by the volunteers of all those organisations in assisting the dispossessed and the needy in our community. It is a Good Samaritan approach. If we were to actually pay these organisations what they were worth, our budget would be continually in the red on that alone. Volunteerism is something that Australians are well known for, and that was shown in the Sydney 2000 Olympics. This is another area of volunteerism where these volunteers will use the money from the government to help those most in need in our community. They are not the loudest. They are the most vulnerable. They are not greedy. They are in need. You judge a civilised society on the way it helps those in need. We do not put the boot into them. We help them. We give them a hand up. That is why I think the government's increase in funding is something to be commended and lauded. Bradfield Electorate: Roads",172
253,Mr FLETCHER,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak about the matter of the missing link between the F3 freeway and the M2 motorway in north-western Sydney. There was a very disappointing announcement tucked in the back pages of the budget papers in which it was announced that $150 million which had previously been committed for a feasibility study into that link in 2013-14 was to be deferred to a point beyond the forward estimates. That is bad news for the people of Normanhurst and Thornleigh, in my electorate, and for people who live near or use Pennant Hills Road, a major artery which passes through the northern part of my electorate. The need for a long-term solution as to Pennant Hills Road is regularly raised with me by local residents. For example, on 14 February I met with local residents, Gordon Fuller, Peter and Pat Edwards and Ian Faulkes, to discuss Pennant Hills Road and to view the traffic which passes along that road at around eight o'clock on a typical weekday morning. On Tuesday, 19 April I held a community meeting at the Thornleigh community centre and again the question of Pennant Hills Road was raised by a number of people present. Pennant Hills Road is presently designated as the interim national highway and it is the route along which much traffic passes coming from the M2 and, before it, the M7 onto the F3. There is a large number of trucks travelling along Pennant Hills including trucks that are passing through from Melbourne up to Brisbane. Indeed, included within those is a large number of doubles. So it is an extremely busy road. That causes disruption, inconvenience and danger for those who live nearby and for those who use that road. The need for an upgrade has been a pressing one for some time. In the last years of the Howard government the then minister for roads, the Hon. Jim Lloyd, commissioned the Pearlman review. That review reported in 2007. It examined the options in relation to the so-called missing link and looked at earlier work which had been done that was commissioned by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority, being the Sinclair Knight Merz study. As that former minister, Jim Lloyd, has pointed out in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald today, the Howard government made a significant funding commitment in the 2007 election which it would have been in a position to implement had it been returned to power. By contrast, unfortunately little has been done to deal with the missing link and therefore the pressing needs in relation to Pennant Hills Road by either the former New South Wales state Labor government or the current federal Labor government. The federal Labor government's Infrastructure Australia failed to allocate funding for the missing link, and unfortunately the previous New South Wales state Labor government effectively ceased all planning and preconstruction work in relation to the missing link between the F3 and the M2. As a consequence, this matter has effectively been stalled for some time. The New South Wales Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon. Duncan Gay, I am pleased to say, advised the New South Wales state parliament that there are a range of major projects which are under consideration for funding by the New South Wales State Road government, and the F3-M2 link is one of those. I simply wish to call on the Gillard government to work cooperatively with the BNew South Wales state government to find a solution to this matter as quickly as possible. Live Animal Exports",173
254,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," According to the animal protection organisation Animals Australia, over the last three decades Australia's live export industry has sent over 150 million animals to the Middle East, of which an estimated 2.5 million animals died during transportation. Much of the Middle East is yet to embrace animal welfare legislation, and those animals that did get there were often subsequently treated in a cruel, brutal and inhumane manner. I understand that Animals Australia has compiled a significant body of evidence as a result of seven investigations conducted in the Middle East since 2003. Some of the footage secretly filmed by investigators, which is publicly accessible on the Animals Australia website, would be disturbing to many Australians, including, I expect, many of the farmers who grew those animals. I am also aware that other organisations have highlighted similar mistreatment of animals. I understand that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, has met with the Australian livestock export industry and asked it to assess progress made in improving animal-handling practices in importing countries and to find ways of achieving a higher standard of animal welfare in relevant countries. I acknowledge that in recent years significant improvements have been made in relation to animal welfare in several importing countries and in relation to the transport of animals to those countries. The situation in many places, including here in Australia, is still, however, far from satisfactory. Those who receive our animals often point out that, if the Australian government allows animals to be sent to them, cognisant of how those animals will be treated, then surely Australians cannot be too concerned about what goes on in such places. From the emails and letters that I receive and the people that I speak to, nothing could be further from the truth. I am also not convinced that there is a strong economic argument for live exports. The numbers given by lobbyists working on behalf of the industry to evaluate a particular sector's contribution are often accepted without being questioned. I understand that a number of institutes and organisations are looking closely at the actual contribution the live export industry makes to the Australian economy. I expect that members of this House will be interested to see how the numbers presented by lobbyists for the live export industry stand up to that scrutiny when their findings become available. It is very likely that those who are dependent on the industry may in fact stand to benefit financially from a ban on live exports. The argument that being part of the international livestock export trade means Australia can help the way the international market operates, benefiting all animals involved in the trade by seeking to raise standards across the board, also has merit. Australia, however, is often one of the few countries that can provide the quantity and type of meat our export partners require. If Australia ceases live exports, we could fundamentally change the game in respect of the welfare of these animals while simultaneously yielding economic benefits for rural communities and businesses in Australia. Slaughtering the animals locally and selling chilled meat value-adds to the sector. Conversely, the sale of live export animals has already caused the loss of hundreds of jobs in Australia. I understand that a 2009 report by ACIL Tasman found that sheep processed in Australia are worth 20 per cent more to our economy than when they are processed overseas. Further, in instances where live exports had been temporarily banned, the report found that a dramatic increase in meat exports to that particular country took place. It is clear that the Middle East customers do accept chilled meats, and the need to export live animals is therefore questionable. I know that this is a matter of deep concern to many Australians and certainly to people in my community. I also note that this matter was the subject of a private member's motion moved by the member for Page and debated in this place on 21 March. I commend the member for Page for moving that motion, and I also commend all of those members who spoke in support of her motion at the time. Middle East",174
255,Ms ODWYER,ADJOURNMENT," Yesterday we saw a reaffirmation of the long standing strong relationship between Israel and the United States with the visit of the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, to Washington DC and his second speech to the joint session of congress. Australia counts both the United States and Israel as close friends and allies. The Prime Minister's speech to congress could not come at a more critical time for the Middle East and for the world. We are witness to a historic tectonic shift in the Middle East in places like Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, Yemen and Lebanon, where people have taken to the streets to demand their basic democratic rights. In his powerful address to the congress, Prime Minister Netanyahu said: An epic battle is now under way in the Middle East between tyranny and freedom. A great convulsion is shaking the earth, from the Khyber Pass to the Straits of Gibraltar. This is not a movement that is confined to a single country but one that is beginning to shape the entire Middle East, much like the fall of communism shaped Europe forever. Prime Minister Netanyahu said: There are millions of young people out there who are determined to change their future. We all look at them. They muster courage. They risk their lives. They demand dignity. They desire liberty. These extraordinary scenes in Tunis and Cairo evoke those of Berlin and Prague in 1989. The so-called Velvet Revolution in the now Czech Republic in 1989 saw the communist government begrudgingly allow a multiparty system without the need for people to take up arms against the state. Indeed, the reason it is called the Velvet Revolution is that the protesters were non-violent, and the state eventually surrendered to the people's wishes for democracy after the Warsaw Pact fell apart. The fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany occurred with an equal sense of inevitability among the state's apparatus. When the time came there was no opposition to the people moving freely across the border. The East German government recognised that its time had come to an end. More importantly, there was little debate over what the people wanted in place of communism: freedom and democracy. We can only hope that the Middle East transitions away from tyrants and militant Islamic governments as peacefully as Europe transitioned away from communism. But there are forces in the Middle East that are determined to ensure a bloody path to change. Israel is the lone beacon of democracy in the Middle East. We hope that she will not be a lone beacon for much longer. But we must be mindful that in this tumult anything is possible. And we must be realistic. With this great opportunity comes real risks: threats to the security of Israel and her people and to a long-lasting peace in the Middle East. The unity between Hamas and Fatah is something that we should be deeply concerned about. Hamas is a group that represents the antithesis of democracy and peace. It celebrates the terrorist Osama bin Laden as a holy martyr. It actively opposes Israel's right to exist and is committed to her destruction. It has a charter of hate at its centre. It is committed to killing Jews wherever it finds them. Exactly one month from today, on 25 June, it will be five years since that young Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was taken and captured by Hamas. He remains a hostage to this day. Hamas have refused requests from the Red Cross to visit Shalit, because they do not want anyone to know where he is being kept. These are not the actions of an organisation that is striving for peace and stability nor of a group that is deserving of any moral or political legitimacy. I have had the opportunity to visit Israel twice, as a Rambam Fellow of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, in 2006, and last year with the AustraliaIsrael Leadership Forum, led by Albert Dadon. On both occasions I was able to see first hand the threats to security that Israel faces. Moreover, I saw a country very similar to ours in terms of its culture and values. Israel has been a valuable friend and ally since her inception and we celebrate her 63rd anniversary. The best thing about democracy is that it maintains a habit of individual thought. A political party cannot simply push a single agenda and expect it to be met without resistance. It must negotiate and listen to other points of view. When Prime Minister Netanyahu was heckled by a protester during his speech to congress yesterday, he brushed it aside by saying: I take it as a badge of honour, and so should you, that in our free societies you can protest. You can't have protests in the in Tehran or in Tripoli. This is real democracy. Australia and Israel both share in this great democratic tradition. It is vital that we support Israel and those who support freedom in the Middle East, whether they be Arab, Jewish or Christian. I would like to conclude by echoing the words of the Prime Minister of Israel, when he said: We stand together to defend democracy. We stand together to advance peace. We stand together to fight terrorism. With the ties between Israel and the United States reaffirmed, let us hope that through this long-standing relationship peace will be achieved between Israel and its neighbours. Science Policy",176
256,Mr BANDT,ADJOURNMENT," My electorate of Melbourne has one of the highest densities of scientific research facilities in the country, from biomedical to energy and everything else in between. Science, technology and innovation are crucial to Australia's current and future prosperity. Science underpins many of our existing industries, from manufacturing to mining and agricultural. And as we make the shift from a pollution-generating economy to an economy based on clean energy, science and technology will be central to this transformation. There was a time when support for science was a shared value in this parliament. Unfortunately, it seems that we are moving into a time, at least in this parliament, where support for science is waning. On the one hand, we have the coalition, which claims to be supportive of science, including climate science, but whose members, including the Leader of the Opposition, spend much of their time attempting to denigrate and undermine that farcical parliaments same science. On the other hand we have the government, which again professes strong support for science but, as reflected in this budget, is not willing to step up and fully support the science community with adequate funding. First we had the spectre of possible cuts to health and medical research funding, which the Greens opposed, backed by an enormous community campaign led by medical scientists from my electorate of Melbourne. Thankfully the campaign was a success and the government saw reason and did not go ahead with the cuts. But other parts of the science and research budget were in fact cut; for example, $33.4 million from the Cooperative Research Centres program and $20.7 from the Collaborative Research Networks. The budget also contained no funding for the International Science Linkages program, which will run out of money in June. Many scientists are concerned government's failure to support the linkages program, which supports collaboration between Australian and international researchers, could be read as Australia shutting the door on the rest of the world. According to the Age, the secretary for science policy at the Australian Academy of Science, Bob Williamson, said the linkages program could continue on as little as $10 million to $15 million a year, which would keep Australian researchers in the global scientific loop. He said: The scientific links that we make with colleagues in other countries are the glue that maintains Australia's connections and prestige in the rest of the world. Without a linkage program ... our scientists will not be as respected, will be able to collaborate and will not win a place at research forums internationally. Professor Williamson said that while there were collaboration agreements with China and India, Australia would suffer from a narrowing of focus. It is not enough to profess a support for science, research and innovation unless we are prepared to back it up with funding. And the funding needs to be secure and into the long term and not rely on the vicissitudes of budgets from year to year. My fellow Victorian the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research has been very active in the last few weeks in condemning the Victorian Baillieu Government for being short-sighted in its failure to fund the Australian synchrotron based in Melbourne. The synchrotron is a world-class research facility that shoots intense beams of light used for scientific experiments. Professor Andrew Peele, the head of science for the synchrotron, says thousands of scientists use the facility for anything from medical research to forensics. He says that although they have only been that the operating for four years, they have already 'achieved wonderful results across hundreds, literally hundreds, of different areas of research'. Despite this the Victorian state government has failed to guarantee any more funding beyond June next year. I agree with the minister in his criticisms of the Baillieu government for not backing one of Australia's largest pieces of science infrastructure. They deserve to be condemned. Like their federal coalition colleagues there seem to be luddites and flatearthers amongst them when it comes to supporting science. But my question for the minister is: given the state government is not willing to back the synchrotron, why haven't you? Why hasn't the minister been able to not ensure this important facility stays open, by upping the federal funding to the project? It is not enough to point the finger. One must be prepared to put one's money where one's mouth is. It is too important to play politics with this project. The Greens believe science and innovation are central to the future of our country and our ability to meet the challenges we face. Our researchers and scientists are top class but they need the confidence and backing of all sides of parliament and proper funding from the government.",177

263,Mr CHESTER,NOTICES," I rise to on its rhetoric in relation to providing affordable government is good at making big announcements the ground it seems that regional communities budget statement 2011-12 where the Minister childhood education and care and states: Child care is essential in enabling parents who are in the workforce. Feelgood statements like this do not deliver promised to build 260 new childcare centres minister claiming that private providers about places where private providers will never centres where there will never be enough people private operator? The government had a program to help those called the Take a Break program. Last year program as well.

Each appropriation debate, we get the most obvious issue in the budget-that is, fiscal strategy. We have heard the Treasurer talk about spruiking that if all goes to plan this will and colleague the member for Bradfield in speaker on the other side talk about this. Of they presided over a very fast fiscal deterioration. budget papers to see the true picture that has is a good starting point. On the government's debt this financial year will be $107 billion. Treasurer's budget speech. But you would know were watching, that there is a percentage of and not mentioning the net government debt dollar history and form. He deliberately does not colleagues, like the previous speaker, will never they do not want the Australian public to incompetence. The Treasurer did not mention the $107 billion his budget speech to a series of television night, he was asked to name the dollar figure. with him. From this we are led to believe that actually know the dollar figure for net government attention in his own budget papers or-and lengths to conceal it. The member for Bradfield friends as we are, but even this Treasurer would terms. I think this Treasurer will go to any lengths amount of trickery to conceal the facts and those behaviour and never mention the figure. Dr Mike Kelly: We don't like talking figures. Mr TONY SMITH: That is right. I am glad would get a headache if you talked figures. $107 billion of debt follows a consistent history two years ago, he refused to mention the level at $57 billion. Now we know that he still will is much higher in dollar terms than the $96 billion but the story is much worse than that. The balance; the Treasurer of this For those opposite who are not, by their very which their electors, including those in Eden-Monaro, pointed out to them-they might like to turn, Budget Paper No. 1, which shows the historical came to government they inherited $44 billion this opportunity to reflect and I want to start on the position of the budget and the government's the government's planned fiscal consolidation, be a very fast fiscal consolidation-and my friend the chamber with me has heard speaker after course what they fail to mention every time is that You only need to go to the detail of the emerged under this Treasurer. Our debt position own budget figures, Australia's net government You would not have found that figure in the from the Treasurer's budget speech, if you GDP in there. But in mentioning that figure alone figure, we know that that is the Treasurer's mention the dollar figure of the debt and his mention the dollar figure of the debt because know the level of their financial failure and figure in his budget speech. He went from interviews. In one of them on Sky News on budget His response was that he did not have the figure the Treasurer of this country either does not debt without it being brought to his I think this is really the case-will go to any may not agree with me on this, as good know the level of government debt in dollar to conceal the truth. He will engage in any opposite will engage in any level of juvenile you do not like talking figures because you The unwillingness of the Treasurer to mention the for him. We remember, in his budget speech of the projected deficit at the time-projected not mention that level of debt.

What they will find is that when they in the bank-nearly $45 billion-and that at NA the end of this year net government debt will the order of $150 billion. It pains me to say this in this appropriations rightly so, of this Treasurer, but we have now debt; in not knowing when Labor was last in ABC studio; and in his refusal yesterday to himself into in denying on ABC radio that government's plans on royalties-only to be confronted had been written to, he had received a minute coming by carrier pigeon, it is hard to think could have communicated with the Treasurer. When you look to the worse Treasurer in John Kerin. I think that is a little unfair. I think most people would settle on Jim Cairns-most famous Treasurer in the Whitlam government clearly, by the length of the straight, had the time on April 15, 1975, when Bert Kelly asked: If printing money is a good solution to the unemployment get rid of unemployment problem altogether? Jim Cairns famously replied: We might do precisely that. But, while it pains me to say it, I think Jim really do. I have thought about this long and honesty-Jim Cairns was not straight about what we have from this Treasurer is a combination is asked in the parliament what the projected answer. And when he is asked what he was told nothing, when every piece of evidence before degree, you can measure the cost of this incompetence $107 billion of debt is just a number. The what do they mean? I will tell you what the cost keep it; not to pay it off. It is going to rise not matter to those opposite. That is just $5 cannot be spent on important programs. The Australian public, though, have lived the accumulation of $96 billion of debt, Keating governments. I will give the governments that they accumulated-as incompetent, reckless end. Australia's level of net government debt and $30 billion. All of that blow-out occurred this government is that they have had no incompetent level. And the public Even when it comes to the programs of priority, itself to be straight. With their mental health be $107 billion. So the fiscal deterioration is of debate. There has been a lot of criticism, seen his performance in concealing the level of surplus, in that shattering performance up in the acknowledge the ridiculous situation he had got he knew anything of the Western Australian with the fact that he had been told, he and he had been rung. Short of a message of how else the Western Australian government Australian history some people would nominate that, if you look at the whole sweep of history, people except for the two opposite-that whom even Gough Whitlam sacked. Jim Cairns title of Australia's worse Treasurer. In question problem why not print more of the stuff and Cairns has now been overtaken by Wayne Swan. I hard, but I think if you consider the level of the loans affair-and the level of competence, of incompetence and dishonesty. When he outcome for his own four budgets is, he cannot by the shadow Treasurer, he says he was told him shows he was told everything. To a large by the level of debt. For those opposite member for Monaro is not interested in numbers: is. It is $5.5 billion a year. That is just to to more than $7 billion a year every year. That does billion, $6 billion or $7 billion every year that this debt journey before. They lived it following which took place at the end of the Hawke and of Hawke and Keating one thing: the debt and dishonest as they were-happened at the in 1989-90 was somewhere between $25 billion in the last five or six years. The problem with good beginning. They have started off at an will keep paying the price. the government still cannot find it within package-something all members would agree is NA a priority area-we have the minister refusing money is back-end loaded. The figures are there the fifth year. But faced with reality, he denies that when the public are so awake to Mental health is a priority area. Our leader the agenda.

I would say to the government headspace facilities in the Yarra valley centred servicing thousands of square kilometres. The government should at least accept an application. area-I just use this as one example because the minister and the Prime Minister cannot be important area. But it follows in the tradition the budget position. Two years ago he could and this year he cannot mention Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary and Forestry) (11:19): It is a great pleasure for Casey, who regaled us with an interesting selective history lesson. I recommend that terrific article by George Megalogenis ALP best manager of money, history shows. It was very interesting to note that that article Costello was Treasurer in his last seven budgets, real spending by 3.3 per cent a year. And in figure was 3.6 per cent a year. And this was because of the booming economy and the overheating reasons why we saw those 10 interest rate rises higher than where the rate stands today. The not know how to manage an economy through recessions do not exist and that you do The story that we can tell through the four that we have been the most successful government management. The article by George Megalogenis responsibility stretches back a long way, but been the only government in Australian history into recession in the context of a global recession-the that has been achieved. How was it done? Because recessions from the past. Unfortunately, the the same mistakes, which is one The situation with the recession this time in a recession, and preventing it, is that household cent of the GDP story. The advice was: go hard, injection of funds and expenditure that would to acknowledge the fact that the majority of his in the budget: most of the new money is in it. Why this government would continue to do it, and when it is so wrong, is beyond me. and our shadow health minister have put it on with a real commitment over the forward is a desperate need for the sorts of initiatives that if they are serious they will look at in Lilydale. There is an absolute area of need They should look at this as a priority there are so many-but it is not a good start if straight with the funding and the figures in this of the Treasurer, who cannot be straight about not even mention the deficit figure, the outcome, the debt figure.

We had to get that have the biggest impact in the short term on NA household consumption, and that is what avoided going into recession but also avoided, unemployment that would have been generated. lost 200,000 jobs had it not been for the people-all of that social dislocation, the social people then fall into that trap of long-term unemployment.

Another gaping omission in the 2011-12 National Broadband Network-this policy which what the Labor government is delivering to Australia, latest estimates. Yet, if you try and work contribution from the National Broadband Network because those numbers make no reference to find are some statements about the amounts Broadband Network. In particular, at page 342 capital contribution in 2012-13 will be $4.4 as an expenditure, it would have the consequence would disappear, because $4.4 billion is I want to make three points in the brief which the moneys to be paid by the government into the National Broadband Network are extremely shaky; indeed, a less charitable misleading. The second point I want to make every sign of being, in financial terms, a disaster. citizens ought to be very concerned about, because funds invested in this venture, notwithstanding that investment is going to be highly unsatisfactory. root cause of this looming financial disaster country which are needlessly extravagant. infrastructure in Australia needs to be upgraded, of doing it than the ill-advised strategy Let me turn firstly to the question of the within the numbers that make up the underlying made on the National Broadband Network. I been done for one reason and one reason only: look better than it actually is.

If that number were treated appropriately that the projected budget deficit for 2012-13 more than the projected surplus for 2012-13. time available to me today. Firstly, the basis on on behalf of taxpayers, on behalf of citizens, not included in this budget is conceptually description would be to call it straight-out is that the National Broadband Network shows That is something that all taxpayers and all we are all compelled to have our collective all of the signs that the return we will get on The third point I wish to make is that the is decisions about the broadband strategy for this There is no question that our broadband but there are vastly more cost-effective ways which this government is pursuing. justification for not including within the budget, cash balance, the expenditure which is to be put to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it has a desperate desire to try to make the budget make the point that even the numbers which provided only provide for government funding of Network by 2014-15. If you look at the NA corporate plan of the NBN Co., it assumes funding Where is that money to come from when we NBN Co. is the government, is the taxpayers far no answer has been provided. There is been provided. If we turn to the core question of why this budget, there is a very illuminating parallel Bear Stearns and others which collapsed in All of those companies followed the practice which spent real money but pretended that in was a fallacy then, and the approach being Broadband Network is a fallacy now. Taxpayers money which is being spent. It is being spent spent out to 2014-15. As I have demonstrated, Co. seems to expect, and yet none of that ourselves if we think that for some reason, put forward, there is going to be a genuine Is there any theoretical basis for the proposition the underlying cash balance? The claim is government, and in due course a return will when you look at some of the realities. Firstly, will generate, in the order of six to seven per which no private sector investor would accept. based on highly unrealistic assumptions about service. But there is another reason to be deeply sceptical this is an investment and in some way taxpayers going to get this money back. Last year legislation five detailed steps which need to be completed five steps include a declaration by the Productivity Commission, a parliamentary minister and parliament not disallowing that the Greens, whose stated position is that supposed to treat as an investment an asset which sold with alacrity. In reality, there is real Let me make another point here. In addition NBN Co., the corporate plan also assumes that issued by NBN Co. What private investor is condition on which a private sector investor is are either explicitly or, at the very least, another significant element of public commitment project which ought to be included Let me turn to the second proposition I want National Broadband Network is going to be a financial of $30.2 billion. That is a $12 billion gap. know that the only source of funding for the of Australia? That is a question as to which so a $12 billion gap by 2014-15 and no answer has money is being spent but does not appear in the with the practices of investment banks such as 2008. You could look at Enron some 10 years ago. of having so-called off-balance sheet vehicles some way the parent entity was not liable. That taken in this budget in relation to the National are on the hook for this money. This is real every year. There are billions of dollars being there is a yawning gap compared to what NBN appears in the budget. We are simply deluding based upon the numbers that Treasurer Swan has surplus in 2012-13. There will not be. that this money ought not to be included in that this is an investment by taxpayers, by be realised. But what a threadbare claim that is even the returns that it is claimed NBN Co. cent a year, are extremely low rates of return Even those extremely low rates of return are the number of people who will take up this about the application of the theory that can be confident that the government is was introduced and passed which set out before NBN Co. can ever be privatised. Those communications minister, an inquiry by the joint committee, a declaration by the finance declaration. All of that has been done to appease NBN Co. should never be sold.

The only likely to invest in these debt securities is if they implicitly guaranteed by government. So there is and government commitment to this in this budget and has not been. to put, which is that all the signs are that the disaster. The first point to substantiate NA that claim is that the network design choice Building a fibre-to-the-premises network is hugely be $36 billion and a return needs to be generated consequences of that is that the pricing will return, and of course the higher the pricing is the build plan is a very lengthy one.

Yet there is an assumption cent-which has grown from four per cent in taper out at 16 per cent and miraculously Therefore, the revenues will be secured and No private sector investor would accept the proposition going to achieve a 70 per cent take-up and, in be persuaded by this corporate plan to put proposing to compel all taxpayers Indeed, even on its face, the corporate plan money. The corporate plan notes that the weighted kind is typically around 10 per cent. It might 10 per cent.

Overlay that with the fact that there is running behind time. For example, there is an with Telstra will be both signed and approved almost at the end of May and the deal has tomorrow, the approval process would take several months. All the indicators are that the company is to the costs it will be able to achieve.

They are spending have $106 billion in net debt. We have $106 more. They plan to spend $120 billion more because they cannot make hard decisions. When and they always spend double the money. They the money that is actually required There are no better examples than the overpriced batts-the disastrous program where workers died. situation is not because of the GFC.

One of the worse policy decisions this moments the member for Dobell would probably they changed the border protection laws in this budget there is a $1.7 billion blowout in facility in my electorate.

I This is interesting. If you look at the spending claim in this tough budget, with its tough actually turned out to be tax increases, family tax benefits-is that the revenue will go Howard budget, to an estimated $378 billion in billion since 2006-07. The spending side of the side of the budget in 2012-13 will be $372 for the member for Dobell, they are getting more year upon year, and that is why we billion of debt above savings because they spend in 2012-13 than was spent in 2006-07.

This is a disgrace massive debt when we should be investing the that we find ourselves in now. We find ourselves region and we should take advantage of it. I do not have today the opportunity to go spending, or the inflationary impacts of the re-regulation another opportunity I will talk about that, because been taken by this Labor government, this incompetent, question time today. This budget is a disgrace. Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (17:47): It for Mayo. He had his angry pills today. He was a whole range of things I was going to talk contribution. Can I say in the first place, to call level well beyond what it actually was. Let us start with those from the opposition some of them the global financial crisis was actually tried to face up and have a bit of a does try to downplay it too, which is consistent not hear anything from those opposite about inconvenient truth to them in relation to what Australian economy right now. So they tend global financial crisis, whether it is about when they were in government, they deny I am going to take the opportunity to do a this government and the record of the previous for Mayo. He got so much wrong that I know put on the record so that when he makes future today. First of all, when we look at the taxation us be radical. Let us not look at just the record of the previous government compared government comes out as the biggest taxing government? boats. But of course he did not stop the boats, and nice and humanitarian in dealing with the budget $1.75 billion more than what it should more Labor deficit, more Labor debt-that is have a huge opportunity in the next few years circumstances because of the Asia-Pacific and we should take advantage of that. I am not not a pessimist about Australia's opportunities of those opportunities. But spending more those opportunities. Looking at the out years of on spending by 2012-13, in just six or seven and it will saddle our future generations with proceeds of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in this position because of growth in our through the inflationary impacts of all this extra of certain laws in this country. But at these are the risks, the decisions that have hopeless Treasurer, as we saw during is always a pleasure to follow the member becoming quite personal in his criticism. I had about but I have to start with a critique of his it a contribution to this debate is raising it to a more generally. They are serial deniers. For just a small event. At least the member for Mayo discussion about the global financial crisis. He with the opposition leader. Generally we do the global financial crisis because it is an has actually occurred and to the state of the to be serial deniers-whether it is about the climate change, whether it is about their record the truth of what actually happened. little bit of a comparison between the record of government, at the invitation of the member he will appreciate having the correct position contributions he can correct his errors from record of the previous government-well, let previous government, let us look at the taxation to all governments since Federation. Which NA The previous government. Not once, not twice, took the record as the highest taxing government and lecture this government about taxation government completely ignores their record row. Their solution to issues, when they possibly could. No wonder they had surpluses. The lazy former government did not have to rode the mining boom, taxed the heck out of the day: 'We made all these surpluses. Aren't taxing government and you had the quite extraordinary course you were going to be in that situation. This government faces a very different set global downturn in trade and the economy since hard decisions to make sure that ordinary Australians mine, on the Central Coast, and that of my unemployment is always an issue. This government that we would make sure that we kept people record of this government and how we were packages, compared to what happened around stands in marked contrast to most governments stands in marked contrast to the opposition, was: 'Let the market rip. Let's see what There are other approaches we could have we could have taken the Spanish approach, unemployment; or we could make a difference through our stimulus packages to make sure people who kept their jobs but for their communities by Australia and it is why we are the envy of the world. Our record on managing the economy stands those on the other side but to those of many economic management made sure that Australia's around the world. We did not go into recession. We heard from the member for Mayo about inflationary pressures. Interest rates-official than they were when we came to government. interest rate rises in a row. They were constraints, or bottlenecks, in the economy and jobs. They did nothing. In fact they cut investment budgets have been about investing in skills, engine room of our economy. To make sure that in education and we make sure that industry participation rates, getting everyone who wants productive for themselves, their community differences. not even three times, but four times they in Australia's history. For them to come here issues and say that we are a higher taxing as the highest taxing government four years in a were in government, was to tax as much as they This occurred during mining boom mark 1. make any hard economic decisions; they merely the Australian public and then said at the end of we economic geniuses?' If you were the heaviest mining boom that we had last time, of of economic circumstances. We faced the worse the Great Depression. This government took were looked after in electorates like good friend the member for Shortland, where took the position that jobs come first and productive and in work. If you look at the able to achieve that through the two stimulus the world, you will see that this government and economies around the world. It certainly whose proposition on the global financial crisis happens, if we lose a few jobs, that's fine.' taken. We could have taken the US approach; and ended up with 10 or 20 per cent and intervene in the economy as we did people had jobs. That was good not just for the and the economy. It is what was needed in stark contrast not only to the record of other countries around the world. Our prudent economy did not collapse like others did so-called pressures on interest rates from cash rates-are some two per cent lower now Under the previous government there were 10 warned repeatedly by the Reserve Bank about about the need to invest in skills, training and in those vital areas. This government's training and jobs, because job creation is the people continue to be able to work, we invest can keep ticking over. We are increasing to work in a job, and making sure they can be and the economy. Those are very important, stark NA The other issue I want to raise in comparing previous government and, more particularly, proposals, is that this was a hard budget, a about where we would put our resources. We everywhere, as we saw at the last election right up to the day of the election to have his after the election was that there was an $11 if those on the other side had been delivering we would have seen higher unemployment, recession, we would have seen a bigger deficit opposition coming out of a lazy previous government, prepared to work hard on these issues. The last critique I wish to make of the member policy. A point he made was that it is impossible borders. That is a proposition I totally reject totally rejects. Certainly you can be humane seekers as well as making sure that you have greatest protection for our borders. The way regional solutions that break the people-smuggling-chain government is about doing. I think it is a make a choice between being tough on border treat asylum seekers. It simply is not the case, think that the member for Mayo was better than showed when he first came here has drifted the right, has lacked any real policies Unfortunately, I think the member for Mayo only hope that when he does listen to this and make a correction to that assumption positions. Not just in this budget but in previous mine, areas of need, that need to be supported. Labor government of making sure that those opportunities to be able to work and the opportunities their full potential. The area that the member in the country to receive extra help in the have often missed out, who have fallen through difficult for them to break out of that cycle. been caught in this unemployment trap. This every Australian who wants to be able to be $304 million in this budget to help break the very important initiative. What is particularly previous federal government initiatives that solutions that are found and moulded locally. all about. It is to develop solutions that this government's budget this time and the the opposition at the moment and their budget where we had to make some hard decisions were not out there willy-nilly promising money with the Leader of the Opposition, who refused promises costed. What we found out, of course, billion budget hole in their election promises. So this budget that we are talking about here today we would have seen this country go into because of unfunded promises from this lazy the Howard government, that was not for Mayo's contribution relates to migration to be humane and also to be tough on and I think everyone on this side of the House in the way in which you deal with asylum policies in place that are going to provide the you do that is by making sure that you look at business model, and that is what this vulgar position to put that governments have to protection and being humane in the way they and that view has to be utterly rejected. I did that, but it looks like the early promise he away as his leader has drifted more and more to or humanity but has maintained the slogans. has fallen into that very dangerous web. One can speech and reflects on his comments he will come that you need to choose between those two budgets this government has addressed areas like This budget builds on that tradition of the most in need get the assistance they need, the through educational advantage to reach for Shortland and I share was one of 10 regions budget for the difficult long-term unemployed who the gaps and whose lives have made it Often it is families and generations who have government is determined to make sure that productive is given the opportunity to do so.

On the one hand, we and the shadow Treasurer claiming that the hand, they were trying to play to the economic that the budget was far too weak. non budget reply simply ran to half an hour with 2010 election policy platform. That does not view for the future of the nation. The shadow NA Treasurer fronted the National Press Club to comedy. At least we did not have 'pass the baton' any great substance to assist us, either. I will leave the best independent observation morning after the budget was handed down: It could have been more excruciating-economists but it's tougher and more courageous than all but Costello delivered. The facts are that the 2011-12 budget will than the Howard government managed-21.8 per Real government spending is one per cent government spent nearly four per cent in its income tax, as the member for Throsby reminded $50,000 a year better off by $1,750 annually better off. We will cut corporate tax to 29 per the budget back to surplus and for all government's reforms in taxing superprofits from resources. Small businesses, including those in the break, as well as the instant tax write off for year. The coalition, by contrast, maintained will increase the retirement incomes of workers not only the retirement of workers but importantly-and the long term of our economy-adding to national The budget delivers a further downpayment that the patchwork economy is placing pressure July 2011-only about 13 weeks away-the government low-income tax offset delivered to 6.5 million an annual income of $30,000 an extra $300 during making them wait until the end of the financial year.

I think we know that massive infrastructure needs in this country area, and it has been quite interesting. My emphasis over the last fortnight on the sad state, those people on $150,000 a year-how sad their move money elsewhere to help those more health, the need to support low-income infrastructure. I want to talk about two areas that particularly the question of training, skills and apprenticeships; affect people personally close but are, in the Werriwa. People speak about a two-pronged regard to raw materials and those such as New have a different concept of a two-state economy, unemployment, a very good record by the standards it is predicted that over the next two years of an additional $12 million of funding to fix more needs to be done. Passing lanes would also the Queensland state Labor government to urgently government road. The Bribie Island bridge is It is the only access to and from the island and of a small population. Bribie Island is now a and the bridge is plainly inadequate and upgrades for both pieces of infrastructure. If it of Labor governments, infrastructure and delivered for my local community. effective infrastructure to support it for the to plan and prepare. Longman cannot afford to looking to the future with optimism and I do not want it to be a community that is and infrastructure requirements overlooked. It is being overlooked and neglected by this Labor place where people want to settle and raise a work to be had, and where there is a great sense to be a vocal voice in this place and constituents and strive to have their concerns Before I call the next member, I think the Longman on his momentous occasion, his 21st person in the place to ever see his 21st birthday It is very timely; I was persuaded this sending out cards to people on their 21st is around necessary measures towards reducing over the period of the Howard government, when were ignored, there was large expenditure in this electorate particularly would be appalled by the as the opposition apparently regards it, of situation is and how basically we should not in need. Another thrust, of course, is mental families, and regional health and education affect my electorate of Werriwa. They are and the issue of mental health. Both these broader sense, crucial issues in the electorate of economy-states that are progressing well in South Wales in particular that are lagging. We as this country has only 4.9 per cent of the advanced industrial countries, and 500,000 jobs will be created. However, within that NA situation, we have 230,000 people who have other hand, we are also seeking an increase in duty that has characterised the way in which over a period of time. I remember the rhetoric after day carrying on about how there were too that they should not all be going to university. university from working-class areas; it was actually do anything about apprenticeships, had been, they would have more credibility. We have a situation here today where only is no wonder that a major aspect of this government regard to training. It is important in my electorate, to my previous electorate with families consisting a significant number of children and a large and involves very significant cross-city movement the availability of jobs in other regions We see in this budget over $100 million to make sure that people actually complete rate of only 50 per cent. Something has to be budget. A similar figure is going towards accelerated be concerned if there is any deterioration of in which people can be brought into the work families, and at the same time they can be otherwise would stretch for many years. So there towards apprenticeships if this succeeds where People will be able to utilise those skills at There are special measures that give grants In addition, $560 million will go to significant amount of that will be spent working workforce capability and an agency will be government. It should not be conceded for initiatives by the government, little has been there has been a doubling of funding on In this budget we see $143 million over a and numeracy. We all understand this is a families and for their lifestyle but it is also productivity in that large parts of our workforce not attractive to employers because they lack necessary going into that area. Even for people in employment, and this country. I remember the days a few decades progressive action on this front occurs-where fighting for workplace English. It has fallen been out of work for at least two years. On the skilled migration because of the dereliction of skills and apprenticeships have been ignored of the previous government in parliament day many aspirations for working-class people and That was just code for people not going to not a promise by the previous government to about TAFE and about vocational education. If it 50 per cent of apprenticeships are completed. It and this budget is to do something in which is a young electorate in far contrast of two working parents on many occasions, youth population. It is also on the edge of Sydney of people, congestion et cetera because of of Sydney. So this is important. going towards mentoring 10,000 apprenticeships them. I have indicated the abysmal completion done about it. That is a major initiative in this apprenticeships. Obviously we should standards in that acceleration process. It is a way force, set up for life and for establishing accelerated through the award payscales that is a degree of attraction for a person to come their apprenticeship will be completed earlier. an earlier point and thus able to get higher income. to employers in crucial skilled areas. a National Workforce Development Fund, and a with industry to make sure there is a national established to give independent advice to the a moment that, despite these very significant happening in the interim because in actual fact apprenticeships and to employers since 2007. four-year period going towards language, literacy significant problem for individuals, for their a major difficulty for our country in regard to are not able to fully utilise their skills and are these skills. So we see money that is very is a situation which has deteriorated in this ago particularly in Victoria-where most the Italian, Turkish and Greek workers were by the wayside under both sides of politics in the NA interim. But in this budget $20 million is employment whose situation is precarious An amount of $80 million is going towards parents. People on the other side of politics situation, but the reality of life is that many variety of circumstances. This government For vulnerable job seekers, there is nearly in the workforce is vulnerable maybe because some jobs or because other people are available increasing their skills, making sure they emphasis on the direct partnership with apprenticeships are provided through that cooperation. towards is the proposal in this budget that sounds nice, and let's be hopeful that the employers' needs, and that should always be a about high quality training and an investment we try to get the right skills, but it speaks supposedly choose training organisations that a very strong defender of government provided Under the previous government we saw one ever occurred in the way in which they handled of thousands of people came into this country, the possibility that they could live here for current government had to deal with in that sector colleges. This government has had to again. I am not highly attracted to the private I hope that what happens in COAG does not TAFE is too broad, too humanistic, that it want and that it is cheaper to do it through these third-rate outcome. So I very much commend something that my electorate needs very much. I want to mention another initiative of Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs the opening of an extension to the Macquarie obviously wanted to go into the building sector construct buildings on site. I met a young Bunnings, decided that she knew a bit about was the spokesperson on the day for all the opportunities she will get in life to be a female TAFE providers were in no way gender discriminatory. Another matter I want to deal with in the Again, for me this is very different in my new migrants and new arrivals and there was often problems behind doors. All the statistics indicate going to workplace English for people already in because of their lack of English. an endeavour to get job training for 30,000 sole stigmatise, attack and assail people in this of these people do not have options because of a is going to try to do something about it. $20 million to help 5,000 people whose situation of technology, because of the disappearance of in the workplace. This will go towards have more possibilities. There is a very strong industry to try to make sure that 130,000 new One thing that I am not as attracted COAG work towards vocational education. That outcome is positive. It speaks about catering to significant factor but not predominant. It talks in the right skills. Again, that is laudatory that about a degree of choice for people. They can perform best and meet their needs. I for one am technical education in this country. of the biggest immigration disasters that has the international student situation. Hundreds essentially attracted not by education but by the next 50 years. One of the situations that the area was the growth of very questionable private go out and require all of those to be certified sector education-for-dollar concept in this area. go in a direction which says that education in covers too many subjects the employer does not private providers. Quite frankly, we will get a the government's initiatives in this area. It is the government. I recently attended with the and Workplace Relations, Senator Chris Evans, Fields TAFE. I saw young people there who and they had a site available where they could woman, an inspiring person, who worked at carpentry and decided to go into that career. She students and it was truly inspiring to see the carpenter. She very much stressed that the limited time is the question of mental health. electorate. I represented an electorate of many a bit of a tendency to hide mental health that. In this new electorate, because of the NA higher prevalence of public housing, it is When you have a high public housing presence, consequent preponderance of disabilities and my area to see organisations such as Beautiful Service on Brown Street, Waratah House Hospital Mental Health Centre. I do not think plethora of disability and mental health It is indeed important to my electorate mental health. There is $2.2 billion over a five-year There is intensive support, better coordination. severe and persistent problems and complex and communities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged where there is a preponderance of these problems. budget on looking at early detection, supporting options in life and have the possibility of participating great which I saw in the last few weeks was coming to my electorate to open a centre where the one site. This seems to be increasingly workforce participation. There will be a mental health commission and will provide, for public scrutiny, an annual going to the Prime Minister reveals her commitment this is shown by this budget. I think the previous member spoke about Medicare for them to better coordinate services with headspace and to provide far more early psychosis young people the possibility of resilience budget because, as I say, it is very significant locally. Foreign aid is another facet of the budget. commended the decision by the government cent of gross national income, which is a step a step forward, but I and many other members the government to place an even higher priority significant advance it still places Australia are the countries we should compare The responsible increase of aid and development increase the delivery of life-saving development countries. When the Government is in belt-tightening commitment to prioritise the poorest of the poor. It is interesting that some emphasis has been have to note the lamentable performance of government spending money on education in schools as an alternative to Saudi-financed even more of an issue than in my old electorate. you have a higher level of disadvantage and a mental health issues. I have been surprised in Minds, the Campbelltown Mental Health at Campbelltown Hospital and the Liverpool any other electorate in this country has such a organisations working in the community. that one of the central focuses of this budget is period. It is aimed at areas most in need. Funding is devoted to those people who have needs. There is an accent on support for areas because, as I noted earlier, that is There is also a very strong emphasis in this young people and ensuring that people get in the workforce. One thing that was the relevant minister, the member for Sydney, a large number of services will be provided at emphasised by the government in the area of which will directly report to the Prime Minister report. The fact that those reports will be to it and the priority it will receive, and Locals and there will be a responsibility significant NGOs. There is funding towards prevention and intervention centres to give in that area. I want to commend that area of the I noticed that Caritas Australia very strongly to move its foreign aid commitment to 0.35 per towards to the commitment to 0.5 per cent.
