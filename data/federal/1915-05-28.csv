1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"The Minister of Defence is reported to have said yesterday, replying to something that had been said by Senator Millen regarding statements of Admiral Jellicoe, as to the want of munitions of warAs far as the remarks about the statements of British statesmen and British naval and military leaders were concerned, it had to be remembered that there was a good deal of bluff in war, and some of those statements were, doubtless, meant for German consumption. Will the Prime Minister take care that these remarks, which are insulting to British statesmen, and to British Naval and Military leaders, are censored, so that they cannot be cabled Home?",4
2,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"I do not think that the expression is ideal, but I shall bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and ask him to reply to it . Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - Can anything more calculated to discredit our preparations be conceived?",4
3,Mr KELLY,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the re-constructed Imperial Cabinet contains a Minister for Munitions who holds an office which has been specially created to expedite the manufacture and despatch of munitions of war? Is the right honourable gentleman of opinion that the statement of a responsible Minister in Australia that the appeal of the leaders of our Army and Navy at the front to the men in British workshops to hurry preparations in order to increase the efficiency of the forces in the field, is only bluff, ought to be cabled to England? Will the Prime Minister prevent that statement of the Minister of Defence from being cabled to England pending the Minister's reply to the question of the Leader of the Opposition ?",4
4,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"I do not propose to stop the sending of any message that the cable censors may think f it to pass, and shall not intervene unless directed to do so by the House. I do not admit the inference' that has been drawn from the statement of the Minister' of Defence. The questions are based on political rather than national considerations. Mr. JOSEPH Coos - The Minister's statement had only one meaning.",4
5,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,There is a political vendetta against the Minister.,4
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,No .,4
7,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"If there is, it is being waged by members sitting behind the Prime Minister. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. CAPTAIN BEAN'S REPOBTS - BROADMEADOWS CAMP : CASES OF SICKNESSINFORMATION RESPECTING CASUALTIES.",4
8,Mr BURCHELL,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"Has the Assistant. Minister of Defence received official reports from Captain Bean regarding the operations at Gallipoli? We have had one r(!p.n-fc, which came to hand very late, hut no second report has been made public.",4
9,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,I am not in possession of any further report.,4
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"Has the Assistant Minister of Defence seen the statement attributed to Captain Bean,' in this morning's newspaper, that 30,000 Australasians went to the front at the Dardanelles? Does the honourable member consider it wise that our censor should permit the world to know the number of troops operating at the Dardanelles?",5
11,Mr MAHON,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,That is not the* total number there.,5
12,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"I have not read the statement referred to, and have nob seen everything that appears in the press this morning. I do not know that the information has any bearing on the position at the front.",5
13,Mr FENTON,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"Has the Assistant Minister of Defence the information which he promised the House two nights ago in regard to the number of deaths and accidents, and the extent of sickness at Broadmeadows Camp since its inception ?",5

15,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"In view of the anxiety of relatives of wounded soldiers to obtain information regarding them, will the Assistant Minister of Defence consider the desirability of providing a direct. telephone line to the Base Records Office, and thus prevent unnecessary delay?",5
16,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"The suggestion is worthy of consideration, and I shall consider it . EXPORT OF COAL.",5
17,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the restrictions imposed on the export of coal to South America still exist, and that they hamper our coal trade to an extent that has caused a large amount of unemployment? Is he aware that one steamer has been - waiting in Newcastle for some weeks for a cargo of coal, but cannot get it beeause of these restrictions ? As the Pacific is now clear of enemy vessels, ""will the right honourable gentleman take steps to get the Admiralty to remove these restrictions, in the interests of the coal trade of Australia S",5
18,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"I am aware that restrictions on the export of eoal from Australia are still in force, and have fected our coal trade, though I am not aware of the case of the particular vessel referred to. The Government has inquired of the Admiralty, on frequent occasions, if it can see its way to remove in part the restrictions which it has imposed. MILITARY PROCESSION.",5
19,Mr BRENNAN,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"It is stated in the newspapers that a military procession will pass through the streets tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock. As the arrangements for this procession do not seem to have been completed yet, will the Assistant Minister of Defence take into consideration the fact that a large patriotic and charitable demonstration for the relief of distressed Belgians and Servians, for which great preparations have been made, at considerable expense, is to be held in the Royal Park at 2 o'clock, and will he endeavour to arrange that the procession Bhall not clash with that demonstration ?",5
20,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,I shall bring the question under the notice of the Minister of Defence. LEASE OF SHALE PROPERTY.,5
21,Mr ATKINSON,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,"I ask the Minister of External Affairs if it is correct, as stated in the Bulletin of 20th May, that Dr Wade has strongly urged the - Commonwealth Government to buy the Railton LatrobeCompany's leases and works in a shale proposition. If the statement is correct, can the Minister inform the House what is the decision of the Government in regard to the matter?",5
22,Mr MAHON,STATEMENT BYMINISTER OP,T he statement is not correct. NA REGULATIONS.,5
23,Mr GLYNN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"On looking through the War Precautions Regulations, I notice that regulation 54, which deals with powers of arrest, has been substituted for a former regulation, which was No. 9, and provided that a competent - Naval or Military authority, or an officer of Customs, might arrest, without warrant, any persons whose behaviour was of such a nature as to give reasonable - ground for suspecting that he had acted, was acting, ox was about to act, in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the Commonwealth., or to authorize the arrest where an offence had been comaf- mitted. The regulation which has been dropped impliedly gave the right of trial to the man who was arrested. I wish to know whether this right has been deliberately withdrawn, or whether the amisaion is an oversight? Will the Attorney General have the matter looked into?",5
24,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Regulatio n 54, as well as all the other War Precautions Regulations, is governed by the following instructions to the Naval and M i l i tary officers, and to the Defence Department generally, which are set out in regulation 31. The ordinary avocations of life and the joyment of property shall be interfered with as little as may be permitted by the exigencies of the measures required to be taken for securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth, and ordinary civil offences dealt with by the civil tribunals in the ordinary course of law. 2. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as affecting the rights to trial by a civil Court of persons, other than alien enemies or persons subject to the Naval Discipline Act or to military law, for offences against the Act.",6
25,Mr GLYNN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I referred, not to offences, but to arrests on suspicion.",6
26,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I bad the second paragraph which I have read inserted in order that the right of civilians to civil trial might be set out .clearly.,6
27,Mr GLYNN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I do not think that it is clear that that right is being preserved.,6
28,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I think that it is, though there may be something in the honourable gentleman's point. carefully through the regulations one by one, and made a number of alterations, and, in my opinion, the effect of regulation 54 is not to in any way impair the right of civilians to a civil trial.",6
29,Mr GLYNN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I wish to know only if the Attorney-General will look into the matter, and see whether a mistake has been made.",6
30,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I shall do that.,6
31,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I desire to ask the Attorney-General if , when he is perusing regulation 54 of the regulations referred to by the honourable member for Angas, he will direct his attention to regulation 55 to ascertain if it is not a fact that the naturalized subjects of countries allied with us in this war may be interned in definitely without any right of trial, and without any recourse to the H i gh Court, such as is given to persons of German blood under the next regulation?",6
32,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I would direct the honourable member's attention to subclause 2 of clause 3 of the regulationsNothing in these regulations shall be construed as affecting the right to trial by a civil Court of persons, other than alien enemies or persons subject to the Naval Discipline Act or to military law, for offences against the Act. Tbat is quite clear, and I should advise that the Minister bad no authority in thatregard. STORES ANDAMMUNITION .",6
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence inform me en- whether a Mr Albert Borchard, of Sydney, bas been appointed by the Defence Department to inquire into the stores and munitions in stock in Sydney? Can he tell us anything about the appointment?",6
34,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,There is no truth in any statement that Mr Borchard has been appointed to any position in the Defence Department.,6
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether Mr Albert Borchard has been requested to nominate appointees to the Department of Defence in Sydney?,6
36,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is quite a different question.,6
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member might have told me that before.,6
38,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I answered the right honourable member's question. He asked 1 me whether Mr Borchard had been apI went pointed to a position in the DefenceDepartment, and I said that he had not. Mr Anderson, whilst examining the accounts of the Department of Defence, with a view of reporting to the Government, informed the Minister that it would be wise to put on some men to take stock of certain goods in Sydney. He was permitted to carry out this suggestion, and he recommended that two. men whom he knew should be employed for the work at a salary of £ 4 per week.",6
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It was not Mr. Borchard's recommendation ?,6
40,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Mr Anderson recommended two men, and they have been emploved by the .Department. They will conclude their' work about tomorrow.",6
41,Mr KELLY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Will the Assistant M i nister of Defence state whether the Defence Department has sought the advice or the belp of Mr Borchard in Sydney in any connection whatsoever in relation to the matter referred to this morning ?,6
42,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Mr Borchard may have been seen by Mr Anderson; I do not deny that. But Mr Borchard baa nothing whatever to do with the DefenseDepartment. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Did Mr Borchard or did he not nominate any one for these positions ?,6
43,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"He may have done ohat, but the men engaged by the Defence Department to take stock are not Germans or Austrians. That is the answer to the honourable member's question.",7
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It is not.,7
45,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It is. I know what stock? the right honourable member is driving at.,7
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Then why did not the Minister answer my question?,7
47,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Why does not the right honourable member come into open ?,7
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"In asking Assistant Minister of Defence a further question, without notice, I wish to conmay gratulate the Government on the way they cry *' Wolf ! """,7
49,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Order ! The right honourable member must not cast any Section.,7
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will restrain from seeking to cast reflections upon the Opposition.",7
51,Mr JH CATTS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The Leader of the tion. Opposition is making insinuations.,7
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am insinuatof the question. ing nothing. I should like to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence if Mr. Albert Borchard, accountant, of Sydney, has nominated men for the positions which he has referred. That is a plain question.",7
53,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I am not aware whether he has nominated persons to these positions.,7
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Will the Minister inquire?,7
55,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I can tell the House that Mr Anderson ascertained from Borchard where he could obtain two who would be competent to carry out this work. Let us be quite plain-spoken this matter. The Leader,of the Opposition has heard it said that Mr Borchard is a German?",7
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I understand that be is. I have heard that he is.,7
57,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is why this years question arose ?,7
58,Mr KELLY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Of course, it is.",7
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Is it not a proper question ?,7
60,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Certainly , but why for the Belgians? not come right out into the open? I have been asked whether the Department of Defence has employed Germans to take stock of certain goods in Sydney.",7
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I made no such inquiry.,7
62,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am here to say that we have no Germans taking stock in the Defence Department. Mr Borchard may be a German, but he is not engaged in the work.",7
63,Mr BOYD,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Are his nominees taking,7
64,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Mr Anderson, in acting for the Department, may have had a conversation with Mr Borchard. I am the not going to say that he did not.",7
65,Mr KELLY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable gentleman the .has just said that he had.,7
66,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Yes ; Mr Anderson have asked Mr Borchard if he could nominate two men for this work. That may be quite true; but the point with which I am concerned is that the two remen who are carrying out this work for the Department are Britishers, whereas the question put to me was intended to Ministers convey the suggestion",7
67,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Order ! The honourable member must not debate the ques,7
68,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I know the meaning,7
69,Mr KELLY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence see that in all future appointments to his Department, recomto mendations from Germans are not accepted aa the best that could be made for service in it?",7
70,Mr FISHER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"If the honourable member will permit me, I shall answer that question. This Government will treat according to its merits every recommendation made by every person who is allowed his liberty, and who is an honest man. Mr We shall employ in the Public Service men only those whom we think will protect the service of the people and the honour in and greatness of the country.",7
71,Mr JH CATTS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence state whether it is not a fact that Mr Albert Borchard is the leading public accountant in New South Wales, that he has been for many a naturalized British subject, that he has repudiated the action of Germany, and has held a great demonstration at his private residence to raise funds jjtr. JENSEN - I believe that Mr. Borchard is employed by the Government of New South Wales in a very prominent position.",7
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,He is one of the most prominent accountants in Sydney; there is no doubt of that. Assistant Minister of Defence aware that it is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that the Sydney City Council is considering whether it should not relieve Mr Borchard of his appointment under that municipality 1,8
73,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is a matter in Which the Sydney Municipal Council is free to exercise its own judgment. It has nothing to do with me or with the Government.,8
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"B y way of personal explanation, I should like to say that I asked the question of the Minister in terms as impersonal and free of bias as I could make them. I do not know Mr Borchard. I have no interest in asking the question except the public interest; and, if it is a fact that Mr Borchard is, as he is represented to be, a man unimpeachable in character and in every way fit to be employed by the Government, I shall be glad to hear it.",8
75,Mr JENSEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Mr Borchard is not employed by the Government.,8
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I may inform the Minister that quite a number of things are said in this communication which has been seen by me, and I have altogether ignored them, but I claim that it is my right to ask a question when I consider that public interest requires matters to be cleared up without any innuendoes from Ministers or anybody else.",8
77,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The honourable member for Parramatta rose to make a personal explanation because of interjections across the chamber. From time to time. I have allowed many questions to be asked which I considered to be irregular, but when it becomes necessary for an honourable member to make a personal explanation as a sequel to an irregular question, I feel that it is my duty to take action. A question is asked, and answered, whether rightly or not is not for me to say. Then five or six further questions are founded on the original one. My predecessor in this Chair refused to allow this procedure, but I refrained from taking that course, desiring to give honourable members the fullest opportunity of obtaining information; but, if this form of question is to continue in the irregular way in which it is developing, I shall feel obliged to take some action to protect the House from itself, unless the House orders me to do otherwise.",8
78,Mr FISHER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I desire to say Is the that,8
79,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member may speak only by leave of the House. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to make a statement ?,8

82,Mr SPENCE,MAIL CONTRACTORS AND,"I announced when the question was under discussion last week the decision at which the Government had arrived. We are seeking necessary detailed particulars before definitely deciding on the amount. As honourable members are aware, the cases vary, but I hope to have the matter dealt with in a day > or two. PORT OF SYDNEY. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether, in view of the inconvenience and delay caused to shipping by the prohibition against entering the port of Sydney between sundown and sunrise, which compels passenger and other ships to remain outside the heads all night, the Government will consider the matter of reviewing the prohibition, having regard to the fact that the Pacific is at present free from enemy warships?",8

85,Mr FISHER,MAIL CONTRACTORS AND,"The Government have remitted to the Attorney-General, for immediate action, the question of the character of the investigation by the court martial and the procedure followed. It will take action to deal with the whole question, quite irrespective of what the opinion furnished on that question may be. I think we want, first of all, to ascertain whether the inquiries were made according to prescribed rules, but whether they were or were not so made, the Government will take action to secure a thorough and impartial investigation of the whole matter. NA CHARITY MOVEMENT IN SYDNEY.  ister noticed that a movement is on foot in Sydney to approach America with a view to raising charitable funds for our returned soldiers, and that the Premier of* New South Wales has telegraphed to the various State Premiers invitin g their assistance in the organization of a big scheme to raise funds for this purpose? Does he not think that this is a reflection on the Federal Government?",9
86,Mr SPEAKER,FUNDS FOR RETURNED,Order ! The honourable member must not debate the question.,9
87,Mr FISHER,FUNDS FOR RETURNED,We are not taking part in any such charity organization.  after our own returned soldiers without asking the United States of America to help us? Is not the Federal Government in a position to provide for them without Mr Holman's proposed intervention ?,9
88,Mr FISHER,FUNDS FOR RETURNED,"I have in following the honourable member's question. If any organization, charitable or otherwise, is engaged in philanthropic work, we shall assist it in every sible way, but this Government cannot, as a Government, get behind every organization .

92,Mr JH CATTS,WOR KS ATTHEFEDERA L,"I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to a question I asked yesterday concerning works at the Federal Capital. I asked SOLDIERS. the Minister of Home Affairs when he would be prepared to make the general statement regarding those works which he promised when I asked a previous question. The honourable member answered sharply that he had made that general statement on the day after I asked the question, but he would have no objection to repeating the statement again. That reply made me look rather foolish. I have referred to Hansard to see what general statement the Minister had made, and I found that a week after I asked him that question he answered one question which was put to him by Mr Charlton and another put by Mr Austin Chapman. As those answers represent the extent of his general statement, I do not think there was any necessity for the honourable gentleman to give a reply yesterday by which he tried to make me look foolish.",9
93,Mr ARCHIBALD,WOR KS ATTHEFEDERA L,"I had not the remotest idea of making the honourable member appear foolish, and if he considers that was the effect of my reply I some difficulty apologize to him.

113,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Denison) [12.15]. - - I was referring last night, when progress was reported, to the shipping that came into the port of Hobart last year. The tonnage of the New Zealand Shipping Company's twelve boats was 72,104 tons, and the light dues paid under the existing system were £300. Under the proposed Federal system of 8d. per ton, the light dues paid by that company would be £2,404. The inward cargo on those boats amounted only to 8,244 tons. The total number of steamers of the two companies-Sha w Saville and Albion, and New Zealand-wa s twenty-five. The total tonnage was 162,642 tons, and the light dues paid by the two companies to the port of Hobart were £625. Had the proposed Federal system been in existence, they would have paid £5,422. The outward cargo on those ships in 1914 amounted to 58,605 cases of fruit, 697 passengers were landed at Hobart, the through passengers for New Zealand numbered 10,258, and the coal bunkered was 5,239 tons. If the Department insist on putting these heavy light dues on the ships, the companies will have to put up their freights by 7s. a ton to cover the extra cost. The port cannot stand it , and the result will be that the ships will not come to Tasmania. The Mayor of Hobart, Mr W. M . Williams, a business man, has stated that the people passing through Tasmania spend £30,000 a year there. It will be disastrous to Tasmania if these dues are allowed to be inflicted on us. To show the unfairness of the proposal, a ship may come to Fremantle, pay 8d. a ton, and then trade right round the coast for three months, calling at every port, and using every light along the coast.",12
114,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,Do you suggest that the charge should be made so much per trip ?,12
115,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,It is not for me to make suggestions. That should be done by the highly paid staff which the Minister has to help Sim.,12
116,Sir ROBERT BEST,STATEMENT SHOWING,But has the Minister issued any scale of tonnage 1,12
117,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"We know all about it : These are the regulations likely to come into force if we do not fight them. I shall do my utmost with, I hope, every honourable member from Tasmania, to prevent this injustice being perpetrated upon us. A ship trading round Australia uses every light on our coast, but the majority of the ships entering the port of Hobart will use only two or three lights. These vessels come straight from the Cape to Hobart, where every provision is made for them, and then proceed to New Zealand. All they have been asked to pay in light dues is £25, whereas under the new system, such a vessel as the Ionic would be called upon to pay £216 17s. 4d. The Marine Board of Tasmania has laid itself out to cater for this traffic, and it has paid well; but the trade will b© simply paralyzed by the introduction of the new dues.",12
118,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,Why does the honourable member ask for this differentiation?,12
119,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The reason is that it is not necessary for these boats to call at any port in Australia other than Hobart, because the cargo they bring for Launceston is carried over the Tasmanian Government railways for the same inclusive freight as to the former place. A pier, unequalled in any port in Australia, has been built at Hobart for the accommodation of these vessels. At the end of this pier there is a depth of 64 feet of water, capable of accommodating a Titanic, and vessels can enter the port at any time. The Minister has asked me to rrfake a suggestion, and, in my opinion, there is nothing to prevent the Department levying what I should describe as a port-ofnall charge. What I mean is that such vessels as I have described would pay a due of 3d. at Fremantle, and a similar *um at each port at which they happened to call; and this would dispose of the Minister's objection that a boat for ""Queensland would have to pay dues at ihalf-a-dozen ports. If these vessels used all the lights on the coast, there would be no objection to the proposed charges, but there is every objection when they happen to use only one or two. To show how the Marine Board of Hobart is trying to develop this trade, I may say that they are willing to giy,e up dues on the river lights, which do not come within the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Customs; and their main reason for this concession is that the charges under - the new system are so high that in all probability it would be impossible to get vessels to call.",12
120,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,The new system is not in operation yet. v,13
121,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am glad of - that, and I am going to make it so "" warm "" for the Minister that, if I can manage it , the new system shall not come into operation. This is not a party question, and I am here to fight in the interests of the little island State, which does not receive overmuch from the Commonwealth.",13
122,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"That will not do !  £900,000 ?",13
123,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Tasmani a was - entitled to every shilling of that £900,000.",13
124,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,Not one penny !,13
125,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am sure that the Minister, and his highly efficient will show of what they are capable, by 4*oing deeply into this question, and giving Tasmania, at any rate, a fair deal. Last year was a bad season in the southern part of Tasmania, but, nevertheless, by the steamers I have mentioned, there were despatched 58,605 cases of apples. In the previous year 120,000 were sent away.",13
126,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"About 500,000 cases were sent to Victoria.",13
127,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am glad to - say that Tasmania sends about 1,000,000 cases to the ports of Australia; and yet honourable members ask, ""Where is Tasmania?"" Why, Tasmania has to supply New South Wales with potatoes for the half-year, not to mention the fruit that is sent to Queensland; and, further, when - the Queensland people become physical - wrecks they resort to the island State in order to build themselves up. Yet we are asked, ""Where is Tasmania?"" For about three months in the year every available man in the waterside unions is required to work the ships; and they meet the occasion loyally, working as long as thirty-eight or forty-eight hours at a time. In the winter, however, there is a slump, and large numbers of fine, able bodied, willing men are unable to find employment. What can be done to retain these men at the ports if the boats cease to call ? And when the summer arrives, how is the necessary labour to be obtained ? I appeal not only to the Minister, but to the Government and the House, to give Tasmania fair consideration. I know that it is the intention of the Department to improve the lighthouse service of Tasmania; and I may say that if it had not been the intention of the Commonwealth to take over the lighthouses, the State Government, in conjunction with the Hobart Marine Board, would have inaugurated a better system of lighting on the west coast. In my opinion, the shipping trade of Tasmania will increase if proper facilities are afforded; and there is every warrant for the arguments and suggestions I have submitted, the because the Government of Tasmania is barnessing up a power the like of which does not exist in any other part of Australia. We have on the great lake a splendid hydro-electrical system. During my trip through Switzerland I saw nothing to equal it , and I am credibly staff, informed that the Government will be able to sell electrical power to anybody requiring it at a price lower than any other body can sell similar power in any State. A company is in process of develoDment with the object of making calcium carbide. We have the limestone adjacent to the river I spoke of. We can get coke quite easily from Newcastle, and with the electricity produced by the means I have mentioned, we shall have all that is necessary for the production of calcium carbide. All this will increase the trade of the port of Hobart, and I feel sure will do much to make for further progress in the State, provided ib is not hampered in the manner that this proposal contemplates. I only wish to refer to one other matter, and I shall be very brief. I do not know the conditions under which lighthouse-keepers generally are living at the present time; but when this matter is being dealt with I hope that an investigation will be made so that we shall be able to know how these people spend their leisure hours, in order that everything may be done to make their lives much more tolerable than I am afraid they now are. There are a large number of magazines taken at intervals from the Parliamentary Library table. I do not know what becomes of them, but if it 'is possible for some of these magazines or for some books to be sent to these lighthouse-keepers, something will have been done to cheer their lonely lives.",13
128,Mr LIVINGSTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,They already have a library arrangement in other States.,14
129,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"It is a very poor one, I think.",14
130,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"It is a very good one in some States. ,",14
131,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,I am simply repeating the words of one of the lighthouse-keepers to me. He said the loneliness of the life in some of our coastal lighthouses is dreadful.,14
132,Sir ROBERT BEST,STATEMENT SHOWING,But the occupants are changed about; they are not in one place for any length of time.,14
133,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,In some of the States they have been in the one position for as long as thirty „years.,14
134,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"That is one of the reasons why I welcome the prospect of the Federal Government taking control, for it appears to me that each State has a different system. In many cases, also, leave of absence has not been forthcoming as it should have been to these people, who should be entitled to some relaxation from the noble work they are doing.",14
135,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Do not you think should cost a little bit more, then?",14
136,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Of course, it will cost more. I am not complaining of the Minister paying his officials big salaries, but as I pointed out last night an increase of from £12,000 to £34,000 requires explanation. At the same time. I do not wish it to be understood that I am opposed to the expenditure of money for the purpose of making the conditions under which these lighthousekeepers live somewhat better.",14
137,Mr FENTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,Do you know anything about the education of their families?,14
138,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I have only hearsay evidence on that question, and it is not very favourable. The Minister may know more about it than I do, and I do not wish to say anything further than that I hope that every opportunity will be given to the lighthouse-keepers to educate their children.",14
139,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,I cannot tell you much about the education. I can tell you a good deal about the lack of it.,14
140,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I hope the Minister will do what he can to make some provision in this regard. We give scholarships to young people who live'inother parts of the Commonwealth, and; I think some means might be discovered of educating the children of lighthousekeepers at the expense of the Government. It would pay the Commonwealth, because they would turn out better citizens. In conclusion, I hope the Minister will not take anything I have said as personal. The subject is one that is near to me, because X am desirous of seeing Tasmania in general, and Hobart in particular, progress, as I think they should progress. I do not want to see anything done to stop industry or to prevent that which brings about national progress everywhere. I do not want to see commerce or shipping interfered with, as is likely if this proposal becomes law, for I feel sure it will have a disastrous effect upon Tasmania, and! be the means of putting the State back: many years. I hope the Minister will"" give.the matter his earnest consideration,, and that he will be able to make a statement to the House that will alleviate the fears that have grown up that Tasmania is going to be crushed out by this newsystem. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: (Parramatta)[12.27] - I only want two minutes, init order to repudiate some of the very scandalous statements that were made by the honourable member last evening concerning myself and my Government. I merely made a friendly interjection, when the honourable member turned on me with hisusual ferocity and told me of the thingsthat our Government did not do for Tasmania, of the neglect we had shown towards that State, and of the things which the present Government had done. I have had to withstand a good deal of adversecriticism in Tasmania by the honourable member and his party, but I have always done my level best to help that State. _ The best proof of that will befound in the fact that we gave Tasmania. an additional £400,000, which, his Government refused to give.",14
141,Mr FINLAYSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,And then they did not bite.,15
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"No ; it simply means that in Tasmania, as in many other places, there are men who are so obsessed by class warfare that they shut out of their minds every consideration of.State.",15

144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Well , there is the answer.",15

149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am willing that it should cease, sir; but, really, my honourable friends opposite live in glass houses in relation to all matters, and, therefore, they should stop throwing stones. I come back to Tasmania. Ever since I have been in this Parliament-and I challenge the honourable member to find a scintilla of evidence to the contrary",15

155,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,I was referring to the lighthouses.,15
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Tasmani a has an infinite and continuing advantage. Not only that, but I believe that my Government was the first to give Tassition, mania a sleeper contract, which was fused by the Pisher Government.

It took steps to see that she got a very much better mail service over the water than the Fisher Government' had given her.",15

163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"It is just about time that this clap-trap about the attitude of this deponent and his Government concerning Tasmania ceased. And now, to crown all, the honourable member goes on to answer himself beautifully. After saying what we would not do for Tasmania, and what the present Government is going to do, he quotes the lighthouse charges that were in vogue when the Cook Government was in office, and is demonstrating what an enormity it will be to Tasmania if the Fisher charges are imposed.",15
164,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT SHOWING,"In personal exI wish to say that I had no intention of referring to the right honourable gentleman last night until he made "" this insulting interjection- "" Let us go",15
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,Is that insulting?,15

I am very strongly tempted to follow the lines just adopted by the Leader of the Oppoand make a few remarks in regard reto his statement about class feeling and feeling, but the time is short. My purpose in rising is to get some information about the Estimates and the lighthouses. I am very sorry indeed that there has been so much delay on the part of the Commonwealth Government in taking over the charge of the lighthouses. 'A start was made, and now'I understand action is postponed until the 1st July of this year.",15
169,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,We hope to take them over then.,16
170,Mr FINLAYSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Her e is the position which appeals to me. The total expenditure provided on the Estimates for the current financial year is £61,999. That covers the salaries of 293 or 294 employees. If the Commonwealth has not taken over this service-;",16
171,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,We have not paid the money.,16
172,Mr FINLAYSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,Then the expenditure will not be as it appears on these Estimates ?,16
173,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Oh , no.",16
174,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,You cannot put up new lighthouses without providing for their maintenance.,16
175,Mr FINLAYSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The erection of new lighthouses is a different matter. I regret very much that it is not proceeding more rapidly than it is. The coasts of Australia are exceedingly dangerous, and with the growing size of steamers they are becoming increasingly dangerous. The northern coasts of Queensland, in particular, are dangerous, and though an effort was made by the previous Minister of Trade and Customs to erect two lighthouses there, I understand that very little progress has been made.",16
176,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,You put him out before he could finish them.,16
177,Mr FINLAYSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Why is not the work being finished ? On page 146 of these Estimates there is an expenditure of £530 on salaries noted in regard to No. 2 District, which extends from Torres Strait to Cape Moreton, but there is not a hint or suggestion as to the person for whom, or the purpose for which the money is expended. Careful particulars are given as to the contingencies, but no information is given as to the salaries of officers. The same thing occurs on page 147.",16
178,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"There is an officer up tliere, vou know. Mr ""FINLAYSON - Why is it not specified? A sum total of £485 is set down on the page, but there is nothing to indicate to honourable members the purpose for which the money is spent, by whom it is received, or indeed whether there is any justification for the expenditure. Careful particulars as to contingencies are given in regard to No. 3 District, which includes New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and Bass Strait. Items as low as £ 1 are particularized under that heading, but regarding what is done with the £485 for salaries we know nothing. The total expenditure for last year was £6,031. I do not think that is a very heavy expenditure, considering the importance of the work. The probability is that the expenditure for this year, although £61,000 is provided, will not exceed £10,000 or £12,000. What possibility is there of the lighthouses being taken over by the Commonwealth on the 1st July, and what progress is being made with the erection of the new lighthouses, which, to my mind, are urgently required ? That information I would like to get from the Minister. May I say a word now in regard to the questions raised by the honourable member for Denison? Some four years ago I put myself in communication with the State Premiers, and, without exception, they favoured me with some very useful information in reply to questions. I discovered that in all the States there were some arrangements, more or less well organized, for the provision of libraries, magazines and newspapers to the various lighthouse-keepers, but there was a considerable divergence in the methods adopted for ensuring a regularity of the exchanges, and particularly in regard to the transfers of the men. In some of the States there was a very good system, and in others a very loose one. The main point which needs to be borne in mind is that special consideration should be given to the men in the more isolated places, which perhaps the Government steamer only visits once in two or three months. Where the families are grown to school age and have to be brought to the mainland to be educated, special arrangements in regard to leave of absence to the men ought to be made. I think that, as a rule, two months is considered a fair time for a man to occupy a position in an isolated lighthouse. The same thing applies to other conveniences which we know the men engaged in this work have to sacrifice. It is too early for us to criticise what may be done. But it is not too early to express the pious hope that the Minister, in making regulations for the taking over of the lighthouses from the States, will provide for the regular and frequent interchange of hooks, magazines, and newspapers, and «.bove all will make such arrangements as will permit the education of families by transferring married men from the more isolated stations to places convenient to schools.",16
179,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,That is done now in some of the States.,17
180,Mr FINLAYSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"No b in all. The Commonwealth will establish a uniform system, and we hope that it will be at least equal to the best system now pre-vailing. Married men with families ought to receive special consideration.",17
181,Mr WISE,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Gippsland) [12.52] - There - are two matters for which I ask the Minister's consideration. The Lighthouses Act provides that where practicable lighthouses shall be connected with the nearest telephone exchange. At the present time many lighthouse men and their families .are isolated, and are thus put to serious inconvenience and danger when illness occurs. The other matter does not strictly - come under the Department of Trade and - Customs, though it affects those in the lighthouse service. I ask the Minister if he will see that, before voting takes place in connection with a parliamentary election or referendum, arrangements are made for the recording of votes by lighthousekeepers and their families. In my electorate, about twenty-six persons were un-able to vote at the last election. The .nature of their duties prevented these persons from attending the polling places. Whatever objection we may have to some systems of voting, we should see that these persons are not deprived of the highest privilege of citizenship, the right to take part in the government of the - country.",17
182,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Franklin) [12.54]. - The honourable member for Denison has brought forcibly before the Committee the wrong that will be done to Hobart and to Tasmania if certain proposed light dues are charged on oversea shipping touching at Hobart but at no other port in the Commonwealth. The effect of these - charges will be to prevent that shipping from coming to Hobart as surely as if it were prohibited by an Act of Parliament. I know that the figures presented by the honourable member are authentic. Under the present proposal, light dues which now come to £25 will be increased to about £260, and 25 per cent, of the revenue from freight on the cargoes usually carried will be needed to pay them. The difficulty which faces the Minister is the objection to getting away from a uniform charge. No doubt if a vessel called at each of-the principal ports of Australia, and was charged £25 for light dues at each port, she would have to pay in all more than the sum that I have just named. But the charge to which I object will be made on vessels which come direct to Hobart from oversea, land passengers and mails for Tasmania and the other States, and take on board coal for the continuance of their voyage to New Zealand. If this charge is persisted in-, these vessels will probably evade it by coaling outside the harbour. I am certain that the Minister is not wedded to the departmental proposals, and I hope that now that the facte have been pointed out to him, he will not sanction a charge which would be so prejudicial to Tasmania. Possibly the new charge may be less than the old for vessels calling at a number of ports in different States, but it will be very unfair if applied to vessels calling at one port only. For years the people of Hobart and Southern Tasmania have been doing all that they can to secure and maintain a direct service from overseas. The port charges of Hobart have been so light that when Lloyd's recently published a list of the shipping ports of the world, Hobart appeared on it as the cheapest port in existence. As the honourable member for Denison has pointed out,' splendid wharfs have been constructed at Hobart, at which the largest vessels can load fruit with despatch, wharfs of which any State might well be proud. The shipping is brought close up to the city, and vessels can lie with their bows touching one of the principal streets. But if the proposed charge is levied, the direct service of steamers between Tasmania and other parts of the world will be stopped. That would be a serious blow to Tasmania. For one thing, all heavy freights from abroad would then have to be landed at Melbourne or Sydney, and brought across to Tasmania by an Inter-State steamer. There would then be double handling and double wharfage to pay, which would be a great hardship on the business people of Hobart, and on those in country districts who use heavy machinery. At the present time the existence of a direct service from London keeps the Inter-State charges within bounds. Were that service to atop, Tasmania would be at the mercy of any shipping monopoly. This would be disastrous, not only to the general interests of the State, but also to the waterside workers at Hobart, who now get work in connection with the despatch of the oversea steamers at a time when Inter-State traffic is slack, and there is little else to do. Indeed I often wonder how they manage to get through the winter. I do not think that this House would allow any Government to do an act of injustice to a State such as would be involved in the shutting off of that State from oversea communication. Oversea intercourse is of vital importance to the trade of an island State like Tasmania. If there is one thing more than another that is necessary, it is direct communication with the outer world. The increased cost of labour, of living, and of production make it necessary to reduce the cost of transport as much as possible.",17
183,Unknown,STATEMENT SHOWING,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,18
184,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"During the luncheon adjournment I was asked by an honourable member why any special consideration should be extended to Tasmania. At the risk of repetition, I should like to point out'that these vessels come from England, vid the Cape, direct to Hobart, and then proceed to New Zealand. Hobart is their one Australian port of call. I believe that the result of these charges will be to absolutely prohibit these vessels from calling at Hobart. ""Under the Navigation Bill, oversea vessels now carrying passengers between the mainland and Tasmania will be prohibited from doing so. Tasmania and Western Australia will be directly hit by the provisions of that measure which prevents English liners from carrying passengers between the States and along their coast. In addition to this disability under which these two States will suffer, the Department now proposes to impose prohibitive lighting charges which will absolutely deprive Tasmania of the only oversea trade that she has, and will inflict upon her an injustice that I am sure this Parliament upon consideration will not tolerate. I know that the Minister has been looking into the matter, and I recognise the objection which all Departments have to any departure from a uniform system. When this matter was first under consideration I suggested that the fairer course to pursue would be to make a port charge.",18
185,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,A charge at every port?,18
186,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,Yes .,18
187,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,For every trip?,18
188,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"No . I would have a minimum and a maximum charge, and would provide that after what was considered to be a just amount had been raised no further charge should be levied. I would, for instance, make a port charge on every vessel touching at Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane; a charge in respect of every port at which it called. If that were done, the £25 per vessel now being paid under existing conditions at Hobart would be found to be far more than was thus secured.",18
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,There should be no profit made out of the service. MR MCWILLIAMS - NO .,18
190,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,It is not intended that there should be any profit.,18
191,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I do not think that it is desired to make a profit. We want to act fairly as between State and State. Speaking from memory, I think there are oversea vessels calling at Brisbane that do not call at the other State capital ports.",18
192,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,But they probably used every light on the Australian coast in? getting to Brisbane. They could not reach that port without using a dozen lights.,18
193,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The vessels to which I am referring as calling only at Brisbane do not come round the Leeuwin and go up north, but work their way round from the south.",18
194,Mr BURNS,STATEMENT SHOWING,The oversea vessels calling at Hobart and proceeding to New Zealand would use only one or two lights.,18
195,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Includin g the Derwent light, which will not be taken over, they use only three Australianlights. They simply call at Hobart to coal, and to land passengers for Tasmania as well as a certain number of passengersfor other ports who are transhipped by the Inter-State boats.",18
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT SHOWING,How many lights would they use in reaching the Derwent?,18
197,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"They would not use any Australian lights until they struck the South-West Cape light. They come direct from the Cape. This is very serious matter for Tasmania. I this line of steamships is shut off as undoubtedly will be by these charges, Tasmania will be deprived of the only direct communication that it has with the outside world. All oversea goods for mania will have to be landed at Melthe bourne and transhipped by the Interhouses, State boats. There will, consequently, two handlings, two rates of freights, and costly charges to provide for before they reach their destination.",19
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT SHOWING,That is what they want.,19
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am sure that Tasmanian it is not what this Parliament desires, and I believe also that the Minister realise the just-ice of our claim, and enormous handicap to which Tasmania is now being paid. will be subjected if these charges be made. The present charge will be multiplied more than ten-fold. Some of the vessels now paying £25, as they have been for years past, will have to pay £260 in respect of the one trip. Such a charge is so monstrous that I wonder at any Depoint partment daring to put it before Pareven liament. I have no desire to labour this matter. I think a fair case has been made out for the consideration of the Minister, and I am very hopeful that will see that some radical alteration made in respect of these charges. I he does, he will prevent honourable membut bers doing that which they dislike to appealing from the Minister direct to House for a recognition of the justice of fixed. their claims.",19
200,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [2.26] - The GovernTreasurer, ment, in approaching the consideration of this matter, found themselves face face with the problem of fixing the house charges on such a scale as make thab branch of the Department pay for itself. The lighthouses will be ferred to the Commonwealth, I hope, the 1st July next, and the charges it is proposed then to bring into operapress tion will be on the basis I have just mentioned. It is not expected, however, that they will be sumcient to meet whole of the expenditure on lighthouses as well as pay interest on the value the transferred properties. The honorproceed able member for Denison, in estimating the amount spent in Tasmania at the present time at £12,000, did not allow one penny by way of interest on the value a of the buildings now being used. A ref sponsible officer of the Department of it Home Affairs, acting on behalf of the Federal Government, as Colonel Miller did, in respect of the other transferred properties, will determine, with a repreTassentative of the other side, I presume, valuations to be placed on the lightland, and equipment taken over. be Assuming that they are valued, in the case of Tasmania, at £100,000, that means that an additional £3,500 will have to be provided for in respect of interest. There will also be an increase of £500 in the cost of the upkeep and repairs of lights, whilst the salaries proposed to be paid under the rates fixed by will the Commonwealth Public Service Comthe missioner will be about £1,200 more than",19
201,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"But if these vessels are prevented by prohibitive charges from calling at Hobart, the Department doing will lose all this revenue.",19
202,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I shall deal with that in due course. It is estimated that if these charges be made there will be a loss of from £10,000 to £12,000 per annum in respect of the lighthouse service of the whole Commonwealth. It is he not thought that the Commonwealth is should be asked to bear that loss. This f matter was before the late Government, no decision was arrived at, because do: the arrangements were not sufficiently the advanced to enable the charges to be The departmental files show, however, that the question was before the right honourable member for Swan as and also, I think, before the present Leader of the Opposition when to he held office as Prime Minister. The lightlate Government were trying to deterwould mine upon what basis the lighting charges should be fixed, but nothing was transdone. When we took office, we had to on deal with the matter, and it was after I which had given notice through the public of our intention to make a charge of 8d. per ton per quarter on every vessel usino any Australian port that an the objection was received from Tasmania. The peculiar position of vessels which call of at one port in Australia only, and do not to other Commonwealth ports, but to another port oversea, was pointed out to me by a deputation attended by the honourable members for Franklin and Denison, and I have, in the course of interviews, admitted the justice of the claim that these vessels should have different treatment, and stated that I thought that in their case we could reduce the charges by half. Therefore, I think that we can meet their position by a substantial reduction in the charges. The suggestion put forward by the honourable members for Franklin and Denison that the charge should be so much per trip would hit Tasmania if no maximum was provided.",19
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,I said ^hat there should be a maximum.,20
204,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The Loongana, which makes a trip three times a' week, would probably pay more than any other vessel by the States? in the Commonwealth.",20
205,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,That is a ferryboat service.,20
206,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"But that ferry-boat uses four or five lights. I am not in favour charging so much per ton per trip. There ployed in these isolated places. should be a quarterly basis. The only other objection is that raised by the Zealand company in regard to its vessels which travel between America and Sydney. These vessels pass one light only, and do attended lights. the whole of their business in Sydney, as that is their port of destination. account the Government consider that there should be some differentiation tween vessels using one port only en route to another port outside Australia, the and vessels coming to any port in the monwealth. The question ""of the treatabout ment of the people employed in the lighthouse service has been raised. I sider that the Commonwealth has a greater responsibility in regard to these people than in regard to other persons who are not in its employment. Their position is different from that of people who go out into isolated places and make homes for themselves; they are compelled to reside in these spots, which are remote capes, promontories, or islands.",20
207,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT SHOWING,Where there are no picture shows.,20
208,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Not only are there no picture shows; unfortunately, there is very little facility for education. I that we all realise that the Commonwealth has a responsibility in that direction. We must see .that the children of thes"" Commonwealth servants who are isolated on capes or islands do not grow up ignorance, and when we are taking over a new service, it is our duty to see that we provide the means of giving education to the children of those employed by us. For this reason the cost of the service will probably be higher than it was under State control, and I say this without any desire to cast any reflection, upon what the States have done in this direction.",20
209,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,No one can object to the cost being increased on that account.,20
210,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,There will be increased cost also in regard to some of the wages paid. - Mr SAMPSON - Is the Minister taking over the whole of the fees now collected,20
211,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"No ; the States will not give them up, but I shall make that position plain in a moment. I am now of dealing with the position of the men emThe suggestion of Commander BreWis is that New we should have unattended lights wherever it is possible to do so, provided that they are as suitable and as reliable as",20
212,Mr BURNS,STATEMENT SHOWING,How do our charges comOn this pare with the former charges?,20
213,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I do not think there is bevery much difference. The vessels upon which they will fall mostly are those of tramp class. In regard to the question Com- . of the honourable member for Wimmera, the time the Lighthouses Bill was passed, the State of South Australia, con-'' which has always been charging light dues, commenced to call them port dues. Precisely the same amount of money was collected under the new title. The name was changed so that there would be nothing to hand over to us. On the 30th July, 1914, a letter was sent out to the different States by my predecessor, the on honourable member for Darling Downs, and New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland agreed to hand over their lights to the Commonwealth; while during the last week or two I have seen reprealso sentatives of Tasmania, Western Austhink tralia, and South Australia, and they have verbally told me thab their lights will be handed over to the Commonwealth on similar conditions, though this has not actually been done so far. We in have not been hasty in the matter; we have already waited for nearly ten months and have not yet got the lights. Therefore, I have given notice today of my intention to ask leave to bring in a Bill next Wednesday for the purpose of amending theLighthouses Act with the object of allowing the Commonwealth to take over these lights if they are not surrendered. Of course, if we can get them without passing the Bill it will be an advantage.",20
214,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,Some of the States should be pleased to give them up.,21
215,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"They do not seem to be in a hurry about it. I hope that it will not be necessary to pass the Bill, and that we shall receive word that the lights will be handed over. Western Australia and . Tasmania have already agreed to surrender portion of the dues they collect, but the other States have not said anything in regard to this matter. Western Australia will discontinue to charge half the dues collected, and Tasmania the dues charged for lights other than local harbour lights, which will remain under the control of the State.",21
216,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,Wester n Australia has practically given up its dues because they were inconsistent with the Act.,21
217,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Wester n Australia and Tasmania have agreed to surrender the dues as stated above; but the other States which have been collecting the money have not shown any desire to hand over anything, and if the ship-owners find that they are being charged double rates the fault will not be ours.",21
218,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"If Western Australia and Tasmania hand over half their dues, and we impose our rates, what will be the total impost?",21
219,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Thes e States do not propose to hand over the dues to us. They propose to remit to the ship-owners portion of what they now charge. Of course, their charges added to ours will increase the total charges upon the ship-owners.",21
220,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATEMENT SHOWING,Tasmani a will need to take off all the dues she collects if anything like the charges proposed to be imposed by the Commonwealth are enforced.,21
221,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The Government do not propose to make any profit, and if the States will remit their charges I do not think that the impost will be any heavier generally than the previous State charges.",21
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT SHOWING,^The States will not remit their charges.,21
223,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"We cannot help that. At four or five Inter-State conferences resolutions were adopted asking the Commonwealth to take over this service. A Bill was introduced into the Senate, first of all, by the honourable member for Kooyong in 1909, when he was a member of that House. It was eventually passed in 1911, and preparatory work has been in progress ever since. Lights have been altered in a number of cases, and other lights have been constructed. The honourable member for Brisbane asked today for information as to what lights were in course of construction on the Queensland coast. I know that the Wilson's Promontory light, which is passed by more ships than any other light in Australia, was brought up to date about twelve months ago. The lights at Fort Point and Point Emery, on the Northern Territory coast, were completed and lighted last week, whilst the construction at Cape Don was commenced one month ago. With regard to the lighthouses north of Cooktown, the foundations at Dhu Reef have been completed, and the tower is in course of construction. Six other lights and towers on that portion of the coast are being constructed in turn. The light tower at West Point, Tasmania, is under construction.",21
224,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,Will the Queensland lights be finished this winter?,21
225,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"We hope that they will be completed before the hurricane season *sets in. The work can be conducted on the reefs only at certain seasons, and when the hurricane season sets in the vessels and men are compelled to return to the nearest port on the mainland. Last .year they were paid off at Cooktown, but they are at work again in the endeavour to complete the operations before the advent of the next hurricane season. It is expected that three lights north of Cooktown will be completed this season. It is not intended to do the whole of this work at one time, but to spread it over a period of six years. That policy is in accordance with the suggestion I made to Commander Brewis in 1911-12, firstly,.in order that there should be no undue financial strain, on the Commonwealth; and, secondly,, because, having got together a body of men skilled in this work, they could be utilized at the various sites in turn. I think it was through this proposal to apread this work over six years that the Ship-owners Federation got the idea that we intended to pay during that period the whole cost of the lighthouses which the - Commonwealth took over from the States, and that the allowance for depreciation would be fixed accordingly.",21
226,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,The light dues you are fixing contemplate a revenue that will pay the depreciation charges.,22
227,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The estimate is that the whole cost of maintenance-that is, lights, wages of employees, and the expenses of the vessels which visit the lights-wil l amount to from £10,000 to £12,000 more than we shall receive in revenue, after allowing a small amount for depreciation. It is not proposed to make any profit out of the lighting .service, nor do I think we should - attempt to do so. If it is found by experience that the proposed charges will leave us a profit, I shall advocate that they be reduced to a rate which will no more than enable the service to pay for itself. But we do propose to make the conditions of the men engaged in this work as comfortable as possible, and we :are hopeful of being able to arrange for a. periodical transfer of officers so that their children may have, an opportunity of getting education, which they have not 'had in the past. The honourable member for 'Gippsland suggested that arrangements - should be made whereby the lighthouse officials may record their votes at election time. I will bring that suggestion under the notice of the Electoral Department, in order to ascertain if such arrangements - can be made. The proposal may present difficulties, but, if it can be carried out, I certainly think that we should give an opportunity to men whom we send to out-of-the-way places to record their votes. . If there is any other point on .which honourable members desire information, I shall be pleased to give it .",22
228,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Darling Downs) [2.56]. - In regard to light dues, what the Department tried to do when I was in charge of it was to induce the States to remit the dues which they charged, because there was a great danger that the public would be taxed twice for the same - service. We urged the States to avoid duplication of taxation. At the Premiers' Conference in 1914, a statement was submitted which showed exactly the expenditure of the various States on this service. It was shown very clearly that the States have been grouping the light dues with the harbour and tonnage dues, and that it is very difficult to separate and re-allocate them. The Premiers promised to look into the matter, but I understand from the Minister that the answers received have been unsatisfactory. Any default on the part of the States in this respect must not be attributed to the Minister. The only danger I see is that of making the dues excessive. The light dues paid by the shipping community will be added to the freights and passenger fares, so that ultimately the charge will fail upon the people who are exporting, as well as those who are importing. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will carry out his expressed intention, and, instead of trying to make a profit out of the service, reduce the light dues as low as possible, if he finds that the revenue is increasing. I should like to ask the Minister if he proposes to give three months' notice of the proposed new rates ?",22
229,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I gave that notice at the end of last December, and specified a rate of 8d. per ton. The Union Steam-ship Company's representative called on me and pointed out how unfair this chargewould be on the company's vessels calling at Sydney.",22
230,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,Has the Minister made any arrangements with the States as to a basis of valuation for the properties to be taken over ?,22
231,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Mr Godwin, of the Home Affairs Department, has that matter in hand at the present time.",22
232,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,"In the past, owing to the acquisition of certain properties without a prior agreement as to the basis of valuation, serious difficulties arose in connection with the valuation of one of those properties, and I would suggest to the Minister that, in order to avoid similar complications arising again, he might get the Home Affairs Department to make a tentative arrangement with the different States, not for the purpose of a complete valuation at the present time, but for a basis of valuation at any future time.",22
233,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I understand that a conference is now being held between a representative of the Commonwealth, in the person of Mr Godwin, I think, and representatives of the States, with a view to determining the method of valuation.",22
234,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am glad to hear that. It will save the Minister trouble in other respects. Then I would like to ask the honourable gentleman whether due precautions will be observed, with a view to ensuring the transfer of all officers at present position. in the Service, so that there may be no unemployment?",23
235,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,We have not taken over any officers yet.,23
236,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,"An alteration was made in the Act for the express purpose of safeguarding the positions of many of these officers throughout the States. For years they have been employed in lighthouse work, and any sudden dislocation of this service would be a very serious matter to them.",23
237,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am assured by Director that he does not know of one case in which an officer in the Service will not be taken over. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 90 (Navigation), £2,891.",23
238,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,Darling Downs) [3.3]. - I should like to know when the Navigation Act is likely to be proclaimed? This is a question which was often put to me by the present Minister when he was in Opposition.,23
239,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.4] - I may be permitted to remind the honourable member that the very first question which his leader put to me last night was, ""When does the Minister propose to proclaim the Navigation Act?"" The position is that, as a result of the Maritime Convention which sat shortly after the loss of the Titanic, it has been found necessary to bring in an amending Navigation Bill. That measure has been passed by the Senate, and is now before this Chamber. The Government consider that it would not be wise to proclaim the Navigation Act until that Bill becomes law. A Director of Navigation has already been appointed, as has also a Chief Clerk. The latter was appointed about a week ago, and applications have been invited, with a view to - filling the positions of Examiner and Surveyor. These applications are now being considered. Work is in progress in the matter of preparing regulations, and I may remark that these regulations will in themselves form a very thick volume. Under the Navigation Act there will be ten times more regulations than under any other Act.",23
240,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,I am glad that the Minister now realizes the difficulties of the,23
241,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,I recognised them before. My chief complaint was that the late Government did nothing in reference to the appointment of a Director of Navigation. We hope to proclaim the Act as soon as possible.,23
242,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Darling Downs) [3.7]. - The creation of a Navigation Department by the Commonwealth will mean running an entirely fresh Department concurrently with the existing State Departments. The intention of the late Go the vernment was-as soon as a Director of Navigation was appointed-to get into touch with the States, with a view ""to preventing unnecessary duplication of work, and to organizing the Department upon a uniform basis throughout Australia. I should be glad to know if any progress has been made in that direction. We do not desire to superimpose a seventh Department upon the existing State Departments.",23
243,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,I said the same thing about the Bureau of Agriculture.,23
244,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,The establishment of that Bureau ought not to result in the duplication of work. The idea underlying the enactment of a Commonwealth Navigation Act was to secure uniformity throughout Australia. If we create a separate department and run it concurrently with the State Departments our action will not conduce to the best interests of navigation.,23
245,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.8] - I am not sure whether my honourable friend made representations to the States upon the matter to which he has referred. However, I thank him for his suggestion. In the filling of official positions in the Navigation Department, I can assure him that regard will be had to the men who are holding offices in the State Departments at the present time. Their claims to positions created under the Navigation Act cannot be ignored. Everything - which can be done to work harmoniously with the States in this matter will be done. Proposed vote agreed to.

Of this number, eleven deaths occurred at Broadmeadows, and the rest, I take it , occurred in hospitals.",25
268,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT SHOWING,Fro m illness contracted at the camp?,25
269,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Yes , I think so; but, as the honourable member will see, the death rate is very low, considering that there has been an average of over 8,000 men in camp during the whole of the time. This information, I think, w i ll completely refute a lot of those wild statements which have been made.",25
270,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,There is nothing like the facts.,26
271,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The total number of deaths during the four weeks ending 22nd May of this year has been thirteen. Of this number, five occurred at Broadmeadows, and eight, I suppose, in the hospitals.",26
272,Mr BRENNAN,STATEMENT SHOWING,Has the Minister compared the mortality rate in the camp with the mortality rate outside?,26
273,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT SHOWING,"It will compare very favourably with the outside rate. the formation of the camp in August last, up t ill 25th May, the total number of cases of sickness has been 1,180, and the total number of sicknesses during the four weeks ending 22nd May, during the time when the bad weather was experienced, and when we heard statements about 250 at Broadmeadows, was only 185. Of that number there are in treatment at the Broadmeadows Camp five, and at the base hospital seventy-four. I want to say that if these figures are analyzed, as they should be, it wil l be seen that we have nothing to complain about with regard to the mortality or sickness at Broadmeadows, and certainly there is nothing to be alarmed about.",26
274,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,Have you number of deaths that have occurred South Greta during the last fortnight?,26
275,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I cannot say what they were, but I have given figures covering the four weeks ending 22nd May, and I can assure the House that we are doing everything possible to insure the health of the troops in camp. I think we ought to be very cases, well satisfied with the position as closed in the return, and certainly there is no justification for the allegations be made here? about cruel treatment of the men in camp, and no justification for those wild statements which have been hurled at the Government, and perhaps also medical gentlemen connected with the camp. The return, I am confident, will ease the minds of all persons in Austravery lia concerning the treatment which their four relatives are receiving at the camp.",26
276,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Hunter) [3.29] I desire once more to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the position figures of the coal-mining industry in the Newthe castle district owing to the shortage of to use them. [130]- 2 explosives. Since I referred to the matter recently in this House I have been, furnished with further information, and. I think it is my duty to lay the matterbefore the Prime Minister. I have received from the secretary of the Colliery Employees Federation a statement showing the number of unemployed in the* collieries in the Newcastle and Maitland districts, and also the state of the minesin regard to the shortage of explosives. The information forwarded to me showsthat in the various mines of that district there is a total of 2,931 men unSince employed or partially unemployed, owingto the shortage of explosives. The detailsare given as follows: Number Average Number of Name of Colliery. of Men Days Worked for last Affected. 24 Weeks.

278,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"That is the trouble, because we have no testing staat the tion. The letter goes onI t will be noticed that some of these collieries have worked half time, and others intermittently during the last twentyweeks, but having got in touch with the managers, they inform us that the prospects, ahead are anything but bright, and we can safely anticipate that from now on during this crisis we will have nothing less than 3,000 unemployed within our Federation. These are authentic, having been supplied by Log secretary, and you need not be afraid! For three or four years past, in this House, I have been urging the necessity for the establishment of a testing station, 90 that, at such a time as the present, we might be self-contained. On this point, the writer saysRepresentation has been made by the Colliery Employers Federation to the Federal and State Parliaments urging upon them the necessity of a testing station being erected in the State with a view of testing local manufactured explosives.",26
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,Eithe r that or modifying the Act.,27
280,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,On e thing or the other must be done.,27
281,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,Modifyin g the Act would not help us now.,27
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,I think it would.,27
283,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The letter proceedsJust recently a deputation waited upon the Minister of Mines, pointing out the urgency of the erection of this station, owing to the shortage of explosives at that time in the Newcastle and Maitland districts. The manager of the Westonite Company was on the deputation, and stated to the Minister that if a temporary testing station was erected he could then get on and manufacture explosives, and relieve the position that was so pronounced over the shortage of explosives. That is local manufacturingWe suggested to the Minister that an old tunnel could be temporarily erected whereby a test of the explosive could be made, but we have gone fully into this matter, and men we can safely rely upon assure us that a fair station could be erected for £3,000. The Minister, in reply, stated that he had given the matter every consideration, and was very much in favour of the erection of a temporary ing station, and would recommend immediately to Cabinet the advisability of going into this matter at once. Wo would suggest, in view of this statement, that the Federal Government co-operate with the State, and ask them what they are doing to relieve the unemployed over the explosives question. I suggest that the Prime Minister should get into touch with the States, ascertain what is required, and what is being done; and, further, that he should communicate with Sir George Reid in order to ascertain whether explosives could not be obtained from some manufacturing companies at Home, so as to relieve the acute position here. The question of a testing station could be discussed with the representatives of the States, and it ought to be, for it is, in my opinion, a national question. There ought to be a testing station for all explosives, so as to encourage manufacture .here, and, in times such as the present, render us independent of outside supplies. This is a most important question, worthy of earnest consideration. We ought, in the first place, to provide for the temporary difficulty, and then take such steps as will insure that Australia in the future shall, in the matter of explosives, be self-contained.",27
284,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Grampians) [3.35] - In regard to the return as to sickness at Broadmeadows read by the Minister, I asked a question some time ago as to whether the cases detailed were cases of what is known as ""bed sickness,"" or whether the men were able to move about. The usual course pursued in camp is to have a sick parade. The men who are reported by a non-commissioned officer as being sick, are marched in charge of a corporal to the hospital at a time fixed in Orders. The time is fixed, not by the medical officer, but by the camp authorities; and if a parade is fixed for 6.30 o'clock in the morning, that is not by choice of the medical officer, but by-order of the Commandant, who is solely responsible for routine matters. A triple report in relation to each case is made, and no man is seen or treated by the medical officer unless he is reported. We have heard that a medical officer refused to attend a man who had been sent down in the course of the day by some officer; and it must be understood that that medical officer was acting strictly in accordance with the regulations, which provide that attendance test- or medicine cannot be given unless the proper form is presented. Every man, no matter what his condition may be, who requires medical attendance or medicine, even though it be only a packet of salts, must have his name on the sick report; and if the whole of the names of those who are on the sick report are included in the return read by the Minister, I can only say that the sickness in camp is miraculously slight.",27
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,I much doubt if that is the case.,27
286,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I cannot imagine for a moment that there has been any selection of cases. The only distinctions are between men who go into hospital and men who return to the tents, or to light duty or whole duty. I impress on honourable members the fact that of the three reports one remains in possession of the medical officer, another in possession of the orderly corporal, while the third is placed on the file in the Regimental Office, and I cannot imagine that - out of these records selections have been made. I am sorry that the Assistant Minister did not say anything about the letter which was read here, and which I understand was handed over to him for inquiry.",27
287,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,That is too serious matter to quibble about until we get the facts. A person who has done that sort thing will have to answer for it.,28
288,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I hope so, although we had the respectability of man vouched for in the House.",28
289,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,"If , on inquiry, a person is found to have been mistaken in that way, there is a malicious and dangerous wrong; and we ought not to talk about matter until we have the judicial side.",28
290,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I am not we aware whether the Assistant Minister has"" obtained particulars.",28
291,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT SHOWING,It is being inquired into.,28
292,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,Do I underthey stand that the Assistant Minister is in possession of the letter?,28
293,Mr JENSEN,STATEMENT SHOWING,Yes .,28
294,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,I take a very serious view of this.,28
295,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,And so do I it is a great reflection on the medical officers.,28
296,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,It is worse than that.,28
297,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"It seems that one or two medical officers have given certificates of death, and have, under law of the land, rendered themselves liable to prosecution.",28
298,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,But there is a statement damaging to the interests of the courtry; and an enemy could not do worse.,28
299,Dr CARTY SALMON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"There is it just one other point I should like to tion. On a previous occasion I referred to the fact that cable messages had been received from members of the Forces abroad, asking their friends to send - to them, and that it had. come to knowledge that a number of these were bogus and fraudulent. Cables have sent purporting to come from members of the Expeditionary Force at Malta, while those men were still in Egypt; and, therefore, the messages were forged. ask the Minister to consider whether some means cannot be adopted to provide that such applications should come through the Pay Office, or some responsible officer who has some idea of the identity of the men. I only want the Government to protect those anxious relatives who are being victimized and exploited by a number of men who are taking advantage of long distance and of the natural anxiety felt by people regarding those for whom they have an affection. a Several cases have come under my notice - on e involving the sum of £20-and I am of sure there must be a much larger number than I know about.",28
300,Mr WATKINS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Newcastle) [3.4.1] this May I , in support of what the honourable member for Hunter has said, point out that the question of establishing a testing station for explosives has been brought forward on behalf of the miners the several times in recent years. I remember when in the State Parliament that made an effort to get a station established, but were not successful, and I fancy the fact that makers have had to send to England for whatever explosives require has mitigated against Australian inventors taking up the question. I call to mind, for instance, the case of an old soldier who had invented an explosive which he thought was eminently suitable for coal-mining purposes, and I was appealed to to obtain for it a trial ; - in the mines. I did this on behalf of both miners and managers at several collieries, whose opinions were that it was the best explosive they had ever used in a coal mine, both from the standpoint of safety and of production. To the my surprise, however, the syndicate formed to manufacture the explosive in the State of New South Wales was refused a permit to make it . I have often thought, since then, that if there has been in existence in Australia any ring, has been a ring of importers of explomensives. This action on the part of the New South Wales Government has meant that the importers of the various kinds of permitted explosives have controlled money the market. Now, owing to the absence my of explosives from England, the coal mining industry is being paralyzed bebeen cause the Coal Mines Regulation Act provides that only explosives that are on the permitted list shall be used. Surely in a national crisis like this, when such I facts as these are known-and they can be substantiated by the cleverest mining Jul experts in our district-somethin g can be done to meet the situation. The position has become very serious in the districts that are affected. Not only have mines been closed through the absence of any export trade, owing to the acquisition of ships and charters, and the embargo on coal, but the collieries at which work is going on will be in no better position unless explosives are forthcoming.",28
301,Mr CHANTEH,STATEMENT SHOWING,Who regulates matter ?,29
302,Mr WATKINS,STATEMENT SHOWING,The Coal Mines Regulation Act.,29
303,Mr CHANTER,STATEMENT SHOWING,Who regulates the output of explosives?,29
304,Mr WATKINS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"It is regulated in England, and the Government of New South Wales will only allow the use of permitted explosives.",29
305,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,But you are not challenging that?,29
306,Mr WATKINS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"No , I am not challenging it, except to this extent, that, though the Imperial Act and the New South Wales Act provide for the tise of permitted explosives, we have no guarantee that when the explosives arrive they will-be up to standard; hence the necessity for a station at which the so-called permitted explosives from the other side of the world can be tested at any time. But this is the point: We are now in a necessitous position and require explosives. I have not seen the explosive^ known as "" Westonite,"" hut, from what I have learnt of it, I think it is just as safe as some of the permitted explosives we have been importing-som e of which, by the way, come from Germany. I have# seen permitted explosives flare up in mines exuding any gas at all. However, the matter is so urgent that I do not think any time should be wasted, not only in establishing a testing station for Australia, but also in getting into touch with the Government of New South Wales, to see if it is not possible to give some assistance to an industry which is of such importance to Australia.",29
307,Mr RILEY,STATEMENT SHOWING,"South Sydney) [3.46] The other night the honourable member for Bourke made a serious statement about a gentleman who occupies a prominent position in Sydney - Dr Antill Pockley, whose son was killed in New Guinea nearly nine months ago-to the effect that he has not yet been able to secure any of his son's effects. may not be a very big matter, from a national point of view, but the father naturally desires some relics of his son, and I ask, in the interests of the family^ if the Prime Minister cannot see that these effects are returned to the family of the late Captain Pockley.",29
308,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,Certainly .,29
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,Parramatta) [3.47] - I should like to say a few words the upon the matter just referred to.,29
310,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The honourable member has already spoken once. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable gentleman be permitted to speak again? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",29
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"It seems to me that the remedy for the matter referred to by the honourable member for Hunter is not so very difficult, but what my honourable friend is suggesting would be no remedy at all. If you started tomorrow to build a testing station in Australia, by the time the plans and specifications were passed, the tenders called for, and an agreement arrived at between the Governments concerned, the war would be over. The honourable member's suggestion offers no immedir ate remedy. I think the remedy lies much nearer home. It is a fact that the people in Australia can make explosives that are both safe and efficient. All that is needed is for the Government of New South Wales to alter its Coal Mines Regulation Act, during the period of the war, so as to permit of locally-manufactured explosives being; used, under proper supervision.",29
312,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I understand the State Government have made a move in that direction, but that the difficulty is that there is not sufficient explosive of the sort that would be permitted in a gaseous mine to cover the necessities of the whole trade.",29
313,Mr WATKINS,STATEMENT SHOWING,You must not open the door too wide.,29
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I do not want to open it too wide, but does the honourable member mean to tell me, with all the scientific and practical resources that are available in the coal-mining districts and at the'Universities of the Commonwealth, that it would not be possible to say whether an explosive is safe or dangerous? An elaborate laboratory is not needed to do that.",29
315,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"They can tell you, but That only one Australian company is now manufacturing explosives that would be permitted in a gaseous mine. The latest hews I have read is that they will not l e able to manufacture anything like sufficient to cover the requirements of the - different mines.",29
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"""What will this proposal for the erection of a testing station do to remedy that?",30
317,Mr WATKINS,STATEMENT SHOWING,"We asked the Prime Minister to get in touch with the State, with the view to an' immediate remedy.",30
318,Mr CHARLTON,STATEMENT SHOWING,"I made two proposals. The first was that the Prime Minister should consult the. State with the view to see if anything can be done to provide immediate relief, and the second was that, if immediate relief cannot be provided, a testing station should be erected for future use, so that we might be able to establish our own factories.",30
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"That will not - give any immediate relief to the unemployed. Only one thing can do that, and that is relief from the conditions now imposed by the Act in New South Wales. I think that ought to have been done long ago. I cannot bring myself to believe that we cannot manufacture here explosives which would shoot coal and be perfectly safe, even though they be not on the approved list. That is the only immediate way out. of the situation. ' Mr Charlton - Yon , as a practical man, know that you would have to make a test somewhere, in order to see that rflame was emitted.",30
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Wit h all the - scientific resources of our universities ought not to be a difficult thing to do, I should think, without a testing station, and it could be done, I think, if the State Government would tackle the question earnestly.",30
321,Mr WEST,STATEMENT SHOWING,"East Sydney) [3.53] few days ago the Assistant Minister of Defence, in reply to a question, stated that the Department was not prepared proceed with the work at Port Stephens A sum of £5,000 is provided on the mates for the purpose, and I am informed that the survey is sufficiently complete permit of men being employed at once.. The nation would get full value for its money, and the work would be very useis ful. We must all admit that eventually Port Stephens will become a very imporing tant harbour, as well as a means of defence. The answer to my question was not quite in accordance with the facts. I .am given to understand by those who know the locality that men could be set to work at once, and that the plant required would be a very small one, inasmuch as there is a great quantity of rock and mullock to be shifted, which, of course, could be done with a few tools. According to the information I have received, it would take a very short time to arrange for a large number of men to be employed. The work is preliminary work, which must be carried out before any important operations can be started. As an amount is provided oh the Estimates for the purpose, it. seems to me that this is a very opportune time to provide employment. The men are very suitable to the work to be done. It is not a case of giving to men work for which they are not suitable. It can be easily started, because there are no engineering difficulties, and, as I said, not a very large amount of plant is required.",30
322,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.54],- I understand from the Assistant Minister of Defence that the Department has made available a considerable sum of money for the work at Port Stephens, and that the expenditure of it will be begun quite early. Regarding the request of Dr Pockley, of Sydney, that he should be furnished with the personal property of his son, who was no killed in the operations at New Guinea, I think that, if possible, it ought to be done, and will ask the Minister of Defence to it take immediate action in that direction. With reference to the suggestions from the honourable members for Hunter and Newcastle, I think that a testing station for blasting powder ought to be established in Australia. War has its pur- A poses and its lessons. Had a testing station been established here, I have no doubt that we would have had an exploto sive manufactured which would be abso- lutely safe - We have simply rested on Estithe fact that it would cost £2,000 or £3,000 a year to maintain it, and we have to not such a station. It is not fair to Australian inventors of explosives. Any person who knows anything about the subject aware that one cannot transport a commodity, made into an explosive, to a teststation 10,000 miles away, and land it there in the same condition as when it was shipped here. Therefore inventors are at a disadvantage.  way. ' Mr FISHER - That is not the point. The honourable member does not seem to understand the seriousness of the matter. ",30

324,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SHOWING,"The State Government will be communicated with immediately, and if anything can be done by the Commonwealth Government to help in any way the use of an explosive made in Australia we shall do so; but I think the honourable member will see that primarily it is a matter which rests with the State It is largely a coal mining affair, but I am bound to say that, as a question of policy, although we have always been against the proposal on the ground of cost, I think that the time has come when we must not only take risks, but be .prepared to incur a considerable expenditure to put ourselves in a position to carry out what we have to do during war as well as .in times of peace. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.57 p.m.",31
