1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [10.30] - B y the division taken yesterday afternoon the House declared that it was not disposed to continue the discussion of the proposed Address-in-Reply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor General, and as that course was taken in opposition to the Ministry, we do not propose to proceed further with business at this sitting, and will take the earliest opportunity to consider our position. But before moving the adjournment of the House I wish to be allowed, by the courtesy of the Opposition, to lay on the tableCorrespondence regarding a Conference between ReDresentatives of His Majesty's .Government and"" the Governments of Uic self-governing Dominions on the subject of Naval and Military Defence, and to move- : That the document be printed.",14

5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I had yesterday to call the attention of the honourable member for Hume to the fact that he must not employ the expression which he has just used, and at my request he withdrew it. I ask him now to withdraw it again, and I think that it is due to the House, as Adjournment. [REPRESENTATIVES.! this is the second occasion upon which withdrawal has been required of him, that he should express his regret that he been led to repeat it .",14
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yesterday , when you, Sir, requested me to withdraw the expression, I did so, and I withdraw it again now. But when I am out of the Chamber I need not withdraw it.",15
7,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Is that a proper withwithdrawn drawal ? I would point out, Sir, that the expression has been used, not in the heat of the moment, but deliberately. Its use refer to it . was deliberate yesterday, and again this morning.",15
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memmember ber for Hume has absolutely withdrawn his remark. What he may do outside the Chamber is no concern of mine. question of taste which arises as to the propriety of using such an expression must be settled by the honourable member self; it is not the concern of the Speaker.,15
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On reflection, I think that it will be more convenient if I defer, until the adjournment is moved, the marks I had intended to make. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS-POSITIO N OF THE GOVERNMENT.",15
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Wide Bay-Treasurer [10.34] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I may add that I ' learn that in another place the Address-in-Reply has been adopted.,15
11,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Unti l when is it proposed to adjourn?,15
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am willing to meet the convenience of honourable members the matter. M.r. DEAKIN (Ballarat) [10.35] - Th occurrence which took place when I rose to address you just now, Mr Speaker, tions. calls for some brief notice. Last night I alone. deliberately' refrained from referring to the subject, first, because personal conflict is antipathetic to me, and, in the next with hirn. place, because I wa's of 'opinion that the honourable member for Hume was not weighing his words.",15
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order I Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",15
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hear , hear. I must have a "" go "" if the honourable member for alone before. Ballarat does.",15
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"May I say to the House that, when the Speaker Adjournment. a tervene, applause is as much out of place as any sign of disapproval ? The expreshas sion of either approval or disapproval should be suppressed on such an occasion. I rose to remind the honourable and' learned member for Ballarat, as I reminded him yesterday, that it is not in order to refer to remarks which have been withdrawn. As the honourable member for Hume has the' expression upon which he is commenting, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat must not further",15
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I intend to deal only with statements made by the honourable in the speech which he delivered yesterday afternoon. Personal criticism, while a necessary element in political disThe cussion, should be removed as far as possible from personal altercation,' in which I do not propose to take any part. I was himunable to gather from his remarks any coherent statement of the supposed or alleged grievances of the honourable member, but whatever may be in his mind, no small resection of honourable members is already f u l ly acquainted with all the facts.",15
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,They were made acquainted with them behind my back.,15
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Q u it e a dozen honourable members of this House and another, having been colleagues of the honourable ) gentleman and myself, know the inner life of the late Administration. Without having communicated with them on the subject, I undertake to say that not one of them will endorse any of his statements.",15
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"They are much the same as their leader. Mr DEAKrN - Moreover , of the members of the party with which I have always been associated, only four now sit in on the other side of the Chamber, and three of them have, expressly disclaimed, e both here and outside, any sympathy with the honourable member's remarks and acTherefore, he standte absolutely",15
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I will teach the honourable'member that before I have done,15
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,He is entitled to stand absolutely alone. We are all compelled to do that at times.,15
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I will make the honourable member stand alone by-and-by.,15
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have often stood,15
24,Mr HALL,Unknown,But not for long.,15
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That has been due torises to in the choice of others.,15
26,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The honourable member has slung over his friends.,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think that I have made a sufficient reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Hume. If any particular allegation is made by him, it can be dealt with later. It is sufficient to say that his grievances, if he has any, exist only in his own mind. My reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Hindmarsh is that there is not time to discuss my relations with the Labour Administration. In the entertaining review of the Attorney-General last night, there were convenient gaps in what, by courtesy, might be called his argument.",16
28,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,If any. one have seen the honourable member then he would not have thought that he considered the speech entertaining,16
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The interjection_ is very good as a joke, but has no relevance as a statement of fact.",16
30,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I never saw a man look so cowed. I was really sorry for the honourable member.,16
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,If that were truth !,16
32,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It is. Mr DEAKIN. How odd then that four or five honourable members have come to me this morning, to say, "" I never saw you appear less interested than you were yesterday afternoon."" These were not all honourable members sitting behind me, and they, at all events, correctly interpreted my mood. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - The honourable member's true character will be known before long !",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I was about to remind the interjector and the Attorney-General very mildly that, if we are to rely on statements of past relations, and the fact that I have been found in opposition at crucial moments to both of the Labour Governments",16
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,And found wanting !,16
35,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We also require to remember that it has been by the hands of the Labour Party that each of the two Ad-ministrations with which I have been connected have been removed from office.,16
36,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,At very different periods of time.,16
37,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The inconvenient fact which I have mentioned requires to be remembered.,16
38,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,The honourable member resigned from office. [ 7 ] -3,16
39,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,When an adverse vote had been carried by the Labour Party on each occasion.,16
40,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Not against the honourable member's Ministry.,16
41,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,In the second case that was distinctly so.,16
42,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,But as to the first case?,16
43,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In the first case there was not a vote given in terms against the Ministry, but there was what was quite equivalent, since on the hustings before we were returned, and also here, I had announced that the Government would accept their amendment as a challenge to us. I made no complaint on either of those occacould sions, and, on the latter, united with the members of the Labour Party in order to make the proceedings as brief as possible. We were then at the close of a session; and if we had chosen to require a vote of want-of-confidence debate before retiring, and to fight that question in the House, the remainder of the session, or the greater part of it, would have been fruitlessly consumed. We were then in the middle of November, and, consequently, we should have had a dislocation of public business.",16
44,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Is the honourable member referring to last session ?,16
45,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am.,16
46,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Does the honourable member not rememberthat he submitted a motion for the purpose of entering into a long debate, but that the Opposition prevented him from carrying that purpose out?",16
47,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I "" did no such thing ; I submitted a simple motion for the adjournment of the House, and induced silence on the part of every honourable member who was supporting us, or sympathized with us. I even declined support that was offered to us from other parties, and which would have resulted, at least, in a long debate, and, upon terms, in my retention of office. I claim no special virtue for that. I say that the state of business made our action the proper thing to do in the public interest, and we did it. The course which we took yesterday was, as far as possible, modelled on the same lines. I have indicated that, at this stage of the session, due discussion of the lengthy opening Speech, much of it unable to be dealt with this session, would have been to the prejudice of public business, and the postponement of necessary measures. It was unjustifiable. Consequently I made a short statement to that effect, paving the way so that the Prime Minister on behalf of his party, could give any exposition of his policy he thought necessary under the circumstances. So far as that policy is concerned, I may say, in passing, that, before it was announced, I had been discussing, the general questions of the most of which it touched upon,, and that, after the policy was announced, I continued the discussion at length in many parts of the Commonwealth. Though, as the Prime Minister said last night, he had not read the criticism, that is not a matter for which I am in any way responsible.",16
48,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"May I say that I read one, but refrained from discussing it for obvious reasons?",17
49,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,There may have been more than obvious reasons.,17
50,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I shall discuss it later on.,17
51,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The fact was that in the report of my financial criticism of the Premier's policy, in the Sydney speech, the different financial periods and some of the figures were confused to such an extent as to make it difficult to understand my conclusions.",17
52,Mr FISHER,Unknown,In some of the reports.,17
53,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In one of them. afterwards, in successive speeches, in order to make up for that defective report, dealt with those matters point by point. If the Prime Minister did. not acquaint himself with those speeches, that is his affair, and not mine. The fact remains that, so far as the policy is concerned, I have already fully expressed upon it the opinions which were shared by my associates and myself. Indeed, I summarized them again, except on the financial question, in Melbourne the night before we met here. I have done my part as to the policy. Now as to procedure. We adopted a method which gave the Prime Minister the opportunity if he had thought fit, after I pointedly directed his attention to the state of the House,' and to the impossibility of his hoping to carry out his programme, of - submitting any proposition he desired as to the conduct of ibusiness. This gave the Prime Minister every opportunity, and the widest latitude for taking a course himself, or suggesting any step to us which would have left a clear course open. When, in the exercise of his undoubted prerogative he chose to take no course or step, but to require a challenge from us, we gave him at once the same kind of 'direct challenge that was given last session to us. That is to say, we gave him a challenge that was disposed of without loss of time. We did this knowing that it must be followed by the motion for the adjournment of the House, on which it is possible for any ventilation of grievances to take place. That day, was fully calculated on by us, and would be fully understood by the merest tyro in politics. Consequently, when he said that the closure was applied last night, the statement, though technically justifiable, is not justifiable in fact.",17
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Nonsense .,17
55,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member and his friends would have applied the other gag, had he had the numbers.",17
56,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Indeed , we should not.",17
57,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member and his friends did what they were able to do, and will do so to the end.",17
58,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"O. f course, we shall; but. we shall not do all we are able to do, when we do not think it judicious or wise.",17
59,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Se e what is said in the Melbourne Age this morning.,17
60,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Parliamentar y practice is plain. After pointing out that the ac1 tion yesterday amounted to an application of the closure, the newspaper went on to say that honourable members took advantage of the motion for the adjournment of the House. Is it to be supposed that honourable members on this side did not know that a motion for the adjournment of the House must follow, as the next step, which, when launched,' was bound to throw open the gates? The youngest member knows that.",17
61,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,But the speech of the Governor General could not be discussed.,17
62,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Exactly ; as a speech that is true.,17
63,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Therefore , what the honourable member says is a quibble.",17
64,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Is it ? As a matter of fact, portions of the Governor General's speech were'- discussed all the evening.",17
65,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Then they were out of order.,17
66,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No , they properly came under the motion. When, the Prime Minister asked' that there should be no limitation of debate, and expressed the opinion that, under the circumstances, the motion should be given a generous interpretation, I , ' and every one here, assented. There was no attempt at any time during the whole of the debate to object in any way to the course which honourable members opposite took. They had a free hand. There was not a single appeal to the Speaker on the point.",17
67,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,It is quite evident implication. that the honourable member did not take any notice of the speech of the Attorney General .,18
68,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not heard the whole, though I heard the most, of that speech.",18
69,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It will take the honleagues, orable member a long time to explain this morning 1",18
70,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not propose to do more today than to point out that, though no motion was proposed by me, the Prime Minister did not see fit to make any motion of his own, or suggest any actioni for resoiving the condition of affairs or to this Parliament. in the House to which I had most pointedly - called his attention. In the absence any action on his part, or a proposal of any kind for meeting the present it became our duty to take the action we did. That action was absolutely justified, and will be justified.",18
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,R o t !,18
72,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not propose to deal further with last night's situation, because honourable members on both sides of the House are aware that the course adopted was in accordance with one of the most familiar motions made daily in tittle Parliament. It was known as well to the youngest as to the oldest member of the House that after the success of the first motion not only would every opporupon tunity for criticism be supplied on the very next motion-that for the adjournTo ment-but , further still, when the House meets again that criticism would be resumed, and would necessarily range over the whole field into which honourable members felt inclined to enter. It would embrace a dissacrifice cussion of every business proposition that can be dealt with this session or which lost. honourable members think may not be dealt with, although it ought to be.",18
73,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is not that an assumppossible tion ?,18
74,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No . I say that the natural course of events after the passfuel ing of such a motion as that carried last night if a change of Administration folballoon lows,18
75,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Tha. t is an assumption, and the honourable member ought not to discuss it here.",18
76,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am simply referring to the natural course of events, and have never, either by word or by implication- ",18
77,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There is a very studied,18
78,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not in my mind.,18
79,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member is the first man occupying his position that I say that I have heard speaking in this way.,18
80,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have heard the hont orable member, or rather some of his coldoing little else lately. All I say is that if events follow the usual courseI am prepared to choose any other term that the honourable member prefers-and if a alchange takes place in the Administration of the country there will then be the fullest opportunity in this House to consider all the practical questions relating to the session Consequently no action has been taken which can prevent of the right of free criticism of the whole of the parliamentary business hitherto passed situation, or yet to be passed.. 1",18
81,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Wh v apologize?,18
82,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When I apologize the honourable member may make a point of it . At present I am not apologizing but analyzing our procedure. With all these opportunities offered for discussing in Parliament every question now proposed or that may hereafter be proposed, no honourable member can say that the present Ministerial party will lose a of their rights, privileges, or powers of speech as the result of our action. What they did lose was the opportunity to enter the general and profitless discussion here of a programme for the next election. that waste of time. I distinctly took exception yesterday from the same motive that led me to take a particular course at the end of last session, when retiring from office. My object was to avoid a hopeless of parliamentary time at a period of the session when there is no time to be",18
83,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The usual misrepresentation.,18
84,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"E as y to say, but imto prove. Honourable members opposite regard this artificial pretence of a in grievance as another little bit of very dry that they wish to use as soon as possible in order to raise their little hot-air to catch the eye of the country. Let them puff it as soon and as high as they can. The cool judgment of the electors hi a very short time wil l deprive it of its breath of buoyancy. I have not the least alarm as to that, and not the least interest in it . It is not my business to send people to"" the country, and, therefore, I shall not talk about it, and do not talk about it .",18
85,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Oh !,19
86,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When I do not speak of it one half of the honourable members opposite, in chorus, invite me to do so, and when I speak of it the other half object. There is no pleasing them. The Government, well within their rights, declined to follow the straightforward course that we took last year in similar circumstances. They even declined to choose their own path out. This forced us to choose the shortest that could be taken. We are content with the result, and will proceed with any other step that may be necessary to get to real business or enable us to put our consecutive and comprehensive platform of Liberal legislation before the country.",19
87,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The honourable member should look at the Liberals behind him.,19
88,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"This is not a joke. I am merely quoting from the speeches delivered last night. All the taunts then hurled at us from the Government side""of the House were to the effect that its programme was identical with our own, and that, therefore, we should not object to their holding office.",19
89,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,We said that ours was the same as the honourable member's used to be.,19
90,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"r-When I tell honourable members opposite that we shall go to the country with a Liberal programme, we are greeted with the machine-made laugh. Honourable members opposite are thus laughing at everything practical in their own programme.",19
91,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,A programme dictated by the Chairman of the Employers' Federation.,19
92,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member's programme was born mutilated. Our programme is liberal and practical, and when put to the electors it will sweep the country.",19
93,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.57] - The honourable and learned member for Ballarat has just favoured us for the first time with some excuses for his present action. found that which we feared he had lost for ever^-hi s facility for explaining and excusing everything-and has given us fresh occasion for amazement, and for some little amusement. The honourable gentleman has been endeavouring to elevate political assassination into a fine art, and to place it upon a scientific basis. It appears now that the reason why he assassinated the Watson Government was that he was inveigled under specious pretences to draft an amendment which he had not the faintest idea would have the result that followed its adoption.",19
94,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. Last night I contradicted the honourable member when he made the same statement. I told him then that it was entirely erroneous, and that he had read the speech in which, the charge was made against me, but had failed to read - the reply that I made at the same time.",19
95,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I see no point of order in the honourable member's contention.,19
96,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I submit, sir, that the honourable member is not entitled to repeat an assertion relating to an honourable mem- . ber that has been directly contradicted by that honourable member.",19
97,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is customary in Parliament for an honourable member to accept the assurance of another honourable member.,19
98,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member for Ballarat has explained that he was entrapped into drafting the amendment, which brought about the defeat of the Watson Government. I quoted last night, by way of reply, the words used by the right honourable member for East Sydney to the effect that that was a hollow and specious statement of facts. If the honourable member says it is not true that he drafted that amendment, or that he voted for/ it under the belief that it was not vital to us, let him still take refuge in what flimsy protection such a denial will give him, for no other mani in the country will believe him. He has explained and justified the assassination of the Watson Government which he promised! to loyally support. H a d De Quincey lived until now he would have been able to include in hisdelightful essay on Murder as a Fine A r t the methods of the honourable member for Ballarat, for no man has adopted such a variety of methods, and none has contrived to more successfully evade the conHe has sequences of his political crimes. His last assassination in some respects out-Herods Herod, but his former achievements ran it hard for first place. Then there was the assassination of the Reid Government. He made that Government, he pledged him -. self to support it , he destroyed it by a speech which the right honourable member for East Sydney very properly assumed was not only the beginning of the end but the end itself. The right honourable member therefore came down with a Governor General's speech of - one paragraph; but did that save him from the wrath to come ? We go out be-cause our speech contains thirty-two - clauses. He went out because his contained only one clause. Was the life of the right honourable member's Government cut short because the programme put before the House was too long for consideration? Rather it was such as could have been - comfortably got through in one sitting day, - and the right honourable member had such in - contemplation. But it did not save him for a single hour. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat has told us that the right honourable member for East Sydney was under a complete misapprehension. When at Ballarat he gave the right honourable member notice to quit he never meant it. At the very moment when the right honourable member's political brains were falling - over his shoulders, when his scalp was dangling at the honourable member's belt, the honourable member was really his best friend. God save us from such friends! Last night the honourable member abandoned the finer resources of political assassination and resorted to the bludgeon of the cannibal. Having perhaps exhausted all the finer possibilities of the or desiring to exhibit his versatility $n his execrable profession he came out and bludgeoned us in the open light of - day. It was then that I heard from this side of the House some mention of Judas. I do not agree with that ; it is not fair-to Judas, for whom there is this to be said, that he did not gag the man whom he betrayed, nor did he fail to hang himself afterwards.",19
99,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ; the honourable member is referring to a remark that ""withdrawn, and his reference to it aggrayears, vates the injury of it. I ask him to and apologize.",20
100,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Tw o old jokes. Keep on repeating them.,20
101,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Ver y well, Mr. Speaker. I shall be pleased to refrain Speaker. from touching on that subject again. The honourable member for Ballarat said that he member afforded the Prime Minister an opportunity when I for to make an amended statement.",20
102,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,To choose his own course.,20
103,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That was very good of the honourable member, and had the Prime Minister known that it was the length of our programme to which exception was taken, we should have been most happy to cut off the part which offended the honourable member. But since I have been in Parliament I have never known the leader of any Government to bring down a programme - excep t in the one case that I have already referred to-whic h the House did not say and know was unlikely to be wholly completed in that session. It is the custom of Governments to do so, and it has never been the practice of any House desirous of pushing on with the public business to throw out a Government because its programme was too long, when that programme contained those things which were necessary to be done at the time. Now what is to be done ? The honourable member says that his programme and ours are the same. His is the Liberal programme, and he has allied himself with those Liberals whom we see around him-wolve s whose eyes gleam redly through their sheep'swool covering-in order the more speedily and effectively to carry it out. He says that he slew us quickly in order to save us from the tortures of a lingering death, and that in order that there should be no interruption of public business. He declared that it was this alone that actuated him in committing an act of the basest inart, gratitude towards this party, and one without precedent at any rate in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. The people of this country, in spite of every effort to the contrary, ' will be made acquainted with the true facts of this case. Although the honourable member has thrown over him the shield of the most powerful organ in this State, if not in Australia, he will find that even that will not now save him, for the people can never be made to understand how it happens that the honourable member, who wan was our ally for the best part of nine and who was prepared to be our withdraw colleague fifteen months ago-:",20
104,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,That is not true.,20
105,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Indi ""must withdraw that remark.",20
106,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"Certainly, Mr.",20
107,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I did the honourable Ballarat an injustice last night said he was prepared to give us only four portfolios. He was prepared to give us a majority in the Cabinet.

Of that organization, the Orange Lodge, a of whose power in active politics we saw lately, owing to the incredible of our friend the honourable member for Dalley, we see him a servile and with humble adherent.

I have always believed that he is what is described in the outside world as a political fizgig ;- one of those persons who will sell their friends, and those most closely associated with them, into aggrandize themselves and secure their own position. It does for Balappear to me that the honourable member for Maribyrnong could not have been more accurately described than he was by the right honourable member for East Sydney, when the latter declared that in his capacity as Postmaster-General he was '' the most stupendous joke of the century.'' But to return to the taunt which has been hurled against me regarding the action which I took in this House and nowhere else respecting the postal prohibition imposed upon the correspondence of me Messrs. Freeman and Wallace, I merely wish to say that all I ever claimed was that the firm in question should have their case submitted for determination to an impartial tribunal.",24

168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I will pursue him all my life.,25
169,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member for Hume will admit that on a former occasion I did as much as did any member of this House to secure the removal of the honourable member for Ballarat from office, and I know that there was a certain amount of jubilation amongst his followers when they found that my name was not included in the Labour Cabinet. I think that the future Prime Minister and his supporters have adopted! a line of conduct which can only result in their own political annihilation. Those honourable members who have now secured a fiscal truce from the howling protectionists, who desired to pile on additional duties, can afford to say, "" We are dealing with an individual who is unreliable, and who is likely in a spasmodic outburst to do injury to our cause, and therefore it is fitting that he should walk in front of the column."" In leaving the case of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace I wish to add that the attitude which I adopted in reference to that firm is one which I shall uniformly observe in the case of any individual or firm who is judged on ex parte evidence. No individual will ever vainly appeal to me to assist him to have his case decided upon its merits, and in the light of day. In connection with the present situation it is interesting to note that no policy has yet been submitted by the prospective coalition Government. Its members have merely repudiated the statements of one another. At present, therefore, we are limited to a discussion of their past achievements. I am satisfied that if this House did the right thing, instead of adjourning till Tuesday next, - it would adjourn till next July in order that in the interim the electors might be afforded! an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon those who have so grossly betrayed their trust.",25
170,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [11.39] I fail to recognise any need for the use of the strong language which has - been indulged in this morning. I congratulate the prospective Prime Minister upon his present political associations When I said this morning that I felt deeply sorry for him last evening when he was so uneasy and pale under the trenchant criticism of the Attorney-General, I can assure him that I meant it. I always feel sorry when a man so far forgets himself as to fall from a high position to the lowest dtepths of political degradation. The honourable member for Ballarat showed us how comfortable he was last evening by losing his temper the moment the proceedings of the House opened today. I see the late leader of the Opposition sitting on the Treasury bench for the moment. I wish to congratulate him, and at the same time to give him a little advice, if ' he will take it from me. Whether he takes it or not is neither here nor there, but I am going to offer it. There is no need for him to go and ask the prospective Prime Minister to do this, that, or the other by way of carrying out his policy.. I can let him into the secret history of our party in this House. We never asked* the prospective Prime Minister to do anything for us, as he will admit. We never went to him and tried to coerce him intodoing anything, and he will endorse that remark. On former occasions he has always agreed with me that we never unduly pressed him by going to him and asking him to do this, that, or the other in connection with the carrying out of a certain policy. Whether the honourable member for Parramatta wants some free-trade project to be carried through, or whether he wants anything else in his political platform to be carried out, he has no need to press the honourable member 'for Ballarat. He has only to get the honourable member for Illawarra, or one or two other honourable members on his side, to go to a public meeting and say, ""This is what we want."" And the honourable member for Ballarat is so putty-like that he will immediately mould his opinions to the desires of his. party. I give that information gratis to the honourable member for Parramatta, who, I am sure, will appreciate the spirit in which it is given, and use it to thefullest possible extent. In this House we have never carried a reform or any measure which was branded with the ideals and thoughts of the Labour Party by asking the honourable member for Ballarat to act. We simply published our proposals to the world, and, although on one day the honourable member was opposed to them, on the next day he was prepared to come into the House and carry them out. Was that done for the sake of holding office? What was it done for? The honourable member had one idea in his political career, and* that was to keep certain honourable memsequently hers off the Treasury bench. He is associated with them, and I offer him hearty congratulations. I remember the which included him. time when he stood on the floor here indignantly denied the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney, who an address on dirt-eating. had accused him of betraying his Governhave ment in connection with the Ballarat speech. The honourable gentleman said that he did bish heap. not mean his speech to be taken in that way, and that he had no intention of going ticular line. to Ballarat to give the honourable member for East Sydney notice to quit. Does the book David Syme, which has just been published, say that David Syme, of the Age, practically sent the honourable memthe spring time. ber to Ballarat to give the honourable ber for East Sydney notice to quit?

213,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown," I can scarcely let an opportunity such as pass without saying a word or two. Honorhe able members of the Opposition must ize to the full that they have not dealt manly and straightforward spirit with Government. In the whole history of poliwhereas tics, from what I have observed and from what I have read, I have never known Opposition, immediately on the completion of the Prime Minister's remarks, to move the closure so as to prevent honourable members who support the Government of from at once expressing their opinion on the .momentous questions before, the country. However, no one is form more proud than myself today to find all the Conservative elements on one than they are at present. side of the Chamber. It should indeed be the happiest day for every true member of the Democratic Party, who has been fighting for years consistently for the masses of the people, to find at last the enemy all in one camp. We have at last adopted a truly Australian method of identification - Throughout this country it has ever been the practice to adopt the branding method so that the respective owners of cattle may be readily ascerbut, tained ; and for many years we have been trying to brand the Conservative elements in Australian politics. Owing, however, to the fact that the honourable gentlemen opposite, and those whom they represent, have hitherto had sufficient numbers able them to divide the spoils, have not been able to brand them they are now branded-that is, as the enemies of the people of this great Commonwealth. I compliment them having come together ; and I think that leader of the Opposition is in his proper place. I admit, with some diffidence, that he was in a very peculiar position before took this step. He and his party the support of the Labour Party for seven or eight years ; practically they had the support of the party so long as they prepared to carry into effect measures which we felt to be in the interests of the people of the country. And we must not forget that the honourable gentlemen opposite mitted such measures to be in the interests of the people, and declared that they, were remark to make. only carrying out principles embodied in their platform from time to time - What is the difference between the platform of to honourable gentlemen opposite and the platform of the Labour Party ? Let any man read the two platforms-the Governor General's speech, and the platform indithis cated by the leader of the Opposition, and would find very little difference indeed realbetween the two. The only differin a ence is that we go one step further, and the make our platform a complete reform, they 'Stop at the (critical point where inefficiency enters and stagnation an commences. We of the Labour Party say to them, "" We want you to go to the kernel of the trouble, and adopt a land tax in the interests of the settlement and the defence Australia."" But those men, although they have professed to be democrats all these vears. are not prepared to adopt that rewhich alone can safeguard the future of Australia and make the people happier They hesitate to take the step; and why? Because honourable members in the Opposition corner - the landlords and men at the head of the Employers' Union, who represent everything that is antagonistic to the uplifting of the masses-ar e in the controlling position today. The power lies, not with those who have gone over with the honourable member for Ballarat, or with the men associated . with the honourable member for Parramattaas will be found in practical politics, with the Conservative Party in the corner, who hold the helm of State, or will do so in the course of a few days. Why are they given the helm ? Simply because the - other men of the combination cannot obtain to enthe power without their aid. Those we not of the Corner Party are preas pared to turn topsy-turvy, . or from right to left, and forsake their former allies for the sake of the emoluments of on office-for the sake of maintaining for a the few years at the very most their position in Australian politics. In referring to the honourable members in the Corner, I do 'not he mean the knight of the nosebag, the right had had honourable member for Swan.",29

218,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No ; it is a mean, contemptible remark!",30
219,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The religion of the honourable member for Swan and the reliParliament. gion of the honourable member for Ballarat is apparently summed up in the one comthe mandment, "" Man, mind thyself."" They at least thirty times. have availed themselves of every opportunity to intrigue for office. The honourable member for Ballarat claims that his present attitude is due to the fact that he and his party were threatened with political suicide if they continued to support the Labour Party. I admit that the labour organizaof parties. tions outside have determined that the time has arrived when they should place a brand on those who profess to be ""as good as labour man."" We are tired of those who is responsible. merely indulge in platitudes about labour, and have no real sympathy with our party, and our party outside have determined that such men should pay the penalty of their insincerity. The honourable member for Ballarat and his party have had the supinduced port of labour for eight years, and as result of that support have been enabled to enjoy the emoluments of office. It true that they have given us somewhat grudgadopted ingly some of the planks of our platto other organizations. form. But now that we put before Parliamember ment a programme that is practically advance on anything that they have subthan mitted, they not only forsake us, but themselves with the enemy. They are prepared to give the Government an oppormembers tunity to prove what they are prepared - do. I recognised that sooner or later, fore the next election, the honourable - ber for Ballarat must withdraw his support from the Labour Party. It was only promises to the electors. natural that he should not be prepared lay his head on the block, and to calmly await the fall of the executioner's knife the behest of the Labour Party. It would be unreasonable to expect any man to mit quietly to annihilation. But it seems, to me that the honourable member would acted far more honourably than he has - had he refrained from taking action until our programme had been presented to Parliament, and he had pointed out any parti of it which, in his opinion, was tagonistic to the welfare of the people. Had he shown some reasonable ground for. his action, no one could have demurred.",30
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Government programme is embodied in the Gympie - speech. Will Mr Webster - Then I can only say that it is exceptional to find a Prime Minister with the courage to tell the people in advance what will be embodied in the Governor General's Speech at the opening of,30
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What I mean is that Prime Minister has explained his policy,30
222,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"But it was not the Gympie speech that led the honourable member for Ballarat to take up his. present position. Long bejfore that speech was delivered he had been conniving at a fusion He has taken over a programme accepted by certain organizations in the Commonwealth, and for a large part a of which the honourable member for Dalley That honourable member some time_ ago stepped from the ranks of - the free-traders. He told his .constituents that he was going to leave that party so far as its policy was concerned. Since then he has been ostracised by it, andi has been to draw up a policy more in keepthe ing with the position that he holds: We find now that the honourable member for is Ballarat and his party have practically a platform that has been submitted The honourable for Dalley has taken up an attian tude far more worthy of commendation is that of the other representatives of ally New South Wales in the Opposition. Those not honourable members, some of whom will be of the coalition Ministry, came to into the House as avowed free-traders; bethey declared free-trade to be a panacea memfor all the ills of the Commonwealth, and yet today they are going back on their They have to practically betrayed their pledges to those who sent them here. The honourable at member for Dalley said that he recognised that a change in the fiscal policy, hedged subabout with proper safeguards, was necessary. But the other representatives of New have South Wales in the Opposition declared done for free-trade, and now give no sign of shame, although they must know that they the have .betrayed the people who sent them anhere. My sympathy goes out to their constituents-to the people to whom they gave the promise that they would carry the banner of free-trade to victory. If there is one attribute more than another that the representatives of the people should possess, it is that of consistency, and of loyalty to the programme that they advocate on the hustings. But the free-trade members of the"" Opposition have taken up what may described as a brazen-faced position. entering into the compact with-the Deakinites they implored the latter to leave crevice or loophole in the agreement through which they might crawl when they had meet their constituents. And what is the loophole ? It is that they shall have a hand with regard to the fiscal question. their attitude worthy of men who claim be fighting for a principle that is dear them? Is it right that they should content to do nothing to remove an evil of which they complain, and to say: long as you do not alter what has been done-as long as you do not eliminate from the statute the measure of protection which has been granted-we will work with you; hut when anomalies are to be .considered you will give us a free hand."" A free hand in those circumstances is simply phrase for throwing dust into the eyes the people. The freedom that they have secured is freedom to vote against the vernment with which they are about to ally themselves, or to try ineffectively, as profess to be able to do, to prevent the onward march of the protective policy. name of freedom is a glorious one, and honourable member for Ballarat uses it more than does any other man in this chamber or outside of it. It is the text from which he preaches from every platform. He says that the cause of freedom and liberty is with any member on that side. taking him and his followers out of ranks of the men with whom they have been allied so long, but .what kind of dom do they mete out to their friends in got the enemy into one camp at last. this House? The very first sign of their love of freedom was given yesterday, when their first act, after obtaining the power to do it, was to curtail freedom, to cripple liberty of speech, and to strangle the rights of honourable members by moving the gag. Those are the men who cry out for liberty and freedom, and their action yesterday is a sample of the treatment which they will mete out to the people's representaof tives, in this chamber. I welcome any method as they now adopt, for it always coils upon those who use such unfair means to suppress and subordinate their opponents. I shall welcome the application of the time after time, provided that it is put as it must be put on, when the people's watchdogs are trying to defend the liberties of the people that sent them here.

When I was returned to this House, someyears ago, I felt that in the National Para liament I should find some evidence of of strong men working with a strong purposefor a determined end. I find that they Goare strong in evil, strong to do wrong, strong to forfeit their principles, strong tothey denounce that which they formerly recommended, strong to sacrifice the people who The sent them here, strong to abandon everythe thing that tends to make a man an honourable man in this chamber. That is where their strength lies, as ' indicated by what we see on the"" opposite side today. I sympathize more with the electors' than I the welcome the fusion .that has taken place. I realise that it is but the befreeginning of the end, and that we have It is only a matter now of fighting on, on the _ lines that we have laid down for nearly ' twenty years, and upon which we have travelled religiously, without deviating to the right or the left. It is only a question<now of moving onward towards the goal of our ambition, because that party of fragments, whose different sections have no sympathy with one another, and which consists merely a number of men who are seeking tosuch escape from the condemnation of the repeople, cannot live before the united fire that will be directed upon them by the truerepresentatives of the people in this chamgag ber. Many of them have cried for dissoon, lutions. I have heard the honourable member for Parramatta, the right honourable member for East Sydney, and others, saying- "" Let us give the people a chance to May I ask them today if they are prepared to go to the people? If they are, I can assure them that we are quite prepared to meet them on the hustings within the next week or two. I know that those men, whose guilty consciences must haunt them in their quiet and reflective moments, dare not, with their sciousness of wrong-doing, go before the electors within the next twelve months, at any rate.",31
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,-Everybod y knows that the honourable member and his party are anxious to go before the people.,32
228,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Most people will give me credit for not usually talking with my ""tongue in my cheek,"" as some members opposite do.' I do not usually say what I am afraid to follow up. I assure the honourable member for Parramatta that I am quite ready, at any time, to go to the people he can stand anything. who sent me here, and ask them whether they endorse my action, and the action of the party to which I belong, in putting forward our programme, and administering the affairs of the country as they have been administered during the short time that we have been allowed to hold office.",32
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I say frankly that I am not quite ready yet, so I ' am not as brave as the honourable member is.",32
230,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I know that the honourable member has a pocket borough. He was anxious to cut off from his electorate the workers who sent him into the first Parliament. He was discerning enough to see the future so clearly that he cut himself away from the very men who put him into national politics, and made him what he is, the moment the redistribution of seats enabled bim to do so. It is not today that he runs for the first time into the Conservative camp. Tnis is not the first indication of his desire to join the enemies of the democracy. He did it when the redistribution of seats took place, forsaking the men who gave him political birth, and running into the arms of the Conservative electors of Parramatta, not for then, but for this time that he saw ing, when he would join the men whom he had condemned, at a time when he was in his proper senses, and belonged to the party that he now despises. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The man who took my old place came here with a majority of about 4,000 votes.",32
231,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That is so, but that was because he stood as a free-trader. How is he going to stand next time? The honourable member for Parramatta knows that the present honourable member for Nepean was elected because he was an 1 out-and-out free-trader.",32
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It was because the workers of the electorate are sensible men.,32
233,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that the strong factor within the conboundaries of the Nepean seat was the fiscal question. How is the honourable member for Nepean, who professes to speak the truth, and to try to teach others to - speak it, going back to the men who put him here? The honourable member is now practically tied to the protectionist element in politics. How is he going to face the people whom he represents?",32
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I really cannot stand this any longer; I shall have to go.,32
235,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parramatta is so case-hardened that He has been in the crucible, preparing for the present situation, ever since he left the Labour Party. His has been no sudden change. It has been a slow, but continuous, change, and he is so thick in the hide today that he cannot be penetrated even by the sharpest of weapons. No doubt the honourable member will enjoy the emoluments of office. But while he enjoys them the bitterness will enter into his ""soul. The ghosts of his former principles will haunt him night by night. In spite of alb> he mav think, emoluments will not remove those spectres from'his bedside. Coming to the Corner party, it is obvious that whether they secure seats in the incoming Ministry or not does not matter. They really hold the fort. They are the men who can make or mar the new combination. Those eleven members in the Corner represent monopoly. They are the arch anti-democrats. . They are the men who are going to control this new combination. They will hold the balance of power in the triangular duel that will be going on day by day in the partu that has been brought together by methods the most obnoxious ever resorted to in Australian politics. People talk of the com- three party system in this House. It has been condemned by politicians. But what do people think of the three parties now bound together in one party, the blessed trinity of monopolists. Conservatives, and arch traitors to the principles which they have espoused? We have had three parties proposing different policies and fighting on different lines until a few weeks ago; and does any one mean to tell me that these three parties are going to assimilate and work in unison for the welfare of the people? Their sole object is to defeat the Labour Party. The right honourable member for Swan may make the best of his present opportunity, for. as surely as he is sitting in this chamber today, so soon as the people of Australia awaken to the perfidy that is taking place, so soon will the doom of the members of the new combination be sealed. So soon also will the people of Australia acclaim the programme of the one party in politics that is not ashamed to put before the country fearlessly, honestly, and continuously, a policy that is designed in the interests of Australia. Is it any disgrace to leave these benches by the methods adopted by the party opposite? In my opinion it is not a disgrace, but is one of the best things that could possibly happen to our party. We shall now know who are for us and who are against us.",32
236,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Why does not the honourable member take it coolly?,33
237,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"When I look at the honourable member who interrupts me, _ and contemplate his cold-blooded character, I am not surprised that he can take anything coolly. But I have principles which I hold dear, and I feel for the cause which I espouse. The honourable member for Wimmera has been sent here to represent a constituency consisting largely of men on the land. In his district, however, there .are many large estates; and there are in it manyfarmers whose sons are seeking to follow the .occupations of their sires, but who can; not get land upon which to settle. He asks me to keep cool, when I take stock of this state of things. I am convinced that when the day comes for honourable members opposite to appear before the electors they will not be able to keep so cool as they advise me to do. If we could go before the people in two months' time, I am convinced that the result would be to make a precedent in history, so that no party elected to this Chamber in the future would, for a moment, dare to do what the party opposite has done. The flag of labour is being hoisted higher and higher 011 the mast of popular approbation. The day of retribution for those who have done this wrong to the cause of labour is at hand. Many of them will have a difficulty in facing their electors, having regard to the pledges given in days gone by. We shall soon have an opportunity of demonstrating to the people of this country what political policy is best calculated to promote their interests. I do not altogether agree with the remarks of the Prime Minister, in which the honourable gentleman appeared to me to be urging as a favour from the new combination that Senator Pearce should be sent to England.",33
238,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Prime Minister did not make it a favour.,33
239,Mr FISHER,Unknown,May I say that I complained when the leader of the Opposition was speaking that the reason for the urgent motion should be to prevent Senator Pearce from going to England.,33
240,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It appears to me preposterous to expect the party coming into power under conditions now known to every one to recognise the wisdom of send-. irig the present Minister of Defence to the Conference to be held in London. I believe that from a party political stand-point they might fairly decide that it would not be a proper course for them to endorse. But. apart from that, in view of the fact that there will be so many sore heads when the selections for the new Cabinet are made, and so many members of the party who will not be satisfied, it is hopeless toexpect that the new Government will be in a position to consider the claims of any person outside their own following, no matter how beneficial to the country the appointment of such a person to such a position might be. Speaking of the land tax, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat today, in answer to the honourable member for Kennedy, stated that he did not advocate in Brisbane that the States should tax the land, and refuse to advocate it in Toowoomba. In justice to the honourable and learned member, I might say that I was present at his Brisbane meeting, and distinctly heard him say that he did not favour a Federal land tax. He said that the States should imposeland taxation, but in the event of the States Parliaments failing to do so, he would then consider whether it would not be necessary for the Federal Parliament to impose such taxation. .",33
241,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The honourable and' learned member, knows well that the States will never impose a progressive land tax.",33
242,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am satisfied of - that, but I wish to be fair. At Brisbanethe honourable and learned member for Ballarat posed as one who had been a land taxer for a quarter of a century. He said that one of his pet ideals in Victorian politics was .a land tax, and that he had! advocated it for years in Victoria. I do not deny that for a moment, but if_ the land tax at present in force in Victoria is the only result of many years of advocacy by the honourable and learned member tor Ballarat, then God help the people who would have to depend upon any land tax which might emanate from him as a Federal Prime Minister. There is no State in the Commonwealth in which the land tax imposed is such an apology and makebelieve as it is in Victoria. Throughout his career the honourable and learned gentleman has been propounding great ideas. He is an idealist before everything, but I defy honourable members to point to one instance in which he has adhered to an ideal, and given it effect in the statute-book of the country. He has been in politics in this country for over a quarter of a century, and during the whole of that time. I think he has not been out of office for more than twelve months. If that does not indicate a hankering after the emoluments of office, I do not know what does. I say here, and now, that a progressive land tax is a proposal in connection with which the honourable member and the party with which he is now associated can never secure the confidence of our people. The honourable gentleman can never hope, with the conservative element in the party which he now leads, to be able to give effect to a land tax which will be of any benefit to the people of Australia. In that lies our security. Honourable members opposite will never agree to an effective progressive land tax, and it is therefore only a matter of time when the people realizing that what the honourable member for Ballarat talks about he does not do will take action to displace him. He says that we cannot hope to defend this continent unless we people it. We cannot expect to hold it, or that Japan, with her teeming millions, will remain quiet very long, unless we take steps to populate the vast empty spaces of Australia. But what is the honourable gentleman's policy for the population of those empty spaces, and for the settlement of people on the best lands of the country, which are now occupied by only a few sheep? It is only a make-believe, in keeping with his professions throughout his career. The honourable gentleman knows, in his heart, that there is only one means of populating this country, and protecting it. He knows that unless we adopt that means speedily, we shall endanger the safety of this continent and this section of the Empire. He knows also that if he had continued his support of the Labour Party, a progressive land tax might have been imposed which would have done all that is desired. If he had done that, he would have proved that he was not a mere talker of platitudes, and preacher of politics, but a man prepared to do effective work in the political arena. The honourable gentleman has been eloquent in referring to the safety of the Empire. His perorations have charmed audiences of thousands during the last few months. He plays on this string from month to month and year to year, and then he attaches himself to a party that cannot give him the only reform by which this country can be populated and saved. If his action is not hypocritical, it is certainly detrimental to the welfare of this country, and the honourable gentleman ought to be branded as one who has been imposing upon the credulity of the people. I yield to no man in my admiration of the Empire. I value the liberties which have been bestowed upon us, and, although they are not all that we may desire, we must judge them by comparison with those which obtain in other countries. There is no country in the world which confers upon its subjects the same amountof freedom that is enjoyed by those under the British flag. I am anxious to foster the development of Australia by making those monopolists who hold unduly large areas for their own aggrandizement disgorge, with a view to promoting closer settlement. But the honourable member for Ballarat is not willing that that result should be brought about. When he talks about the welfare of the great British Empire, he is simply playing with words.",33
243,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Le t us have the peroration.,34
244,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The'honorabl e member will have to wait for the peroration, which in the case of the honourable member, when he next meets the people, will be the ""Dead March in Saul."" Thepublic will no longer tolerate the kind of representation which has hitherto characterized this National Parliament. I shall' remember the action of the honourable member and of his party in endeavouring toclose the mouths of their critics in this Chamber. Yesterday they attempted tostrangle discussion in this House by preventing a debate upon the Governor General's speech.",34
245,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If the honourable membei wishes to discuss that speech, he should debate the Labour Party's platform.",35
246,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am not anxious to do that. To discuss the Labour platform would be like talking Greek to the honourable member. He has been so mixed up with platforms recently that, doubtless, he wants to see how the Labour Party's platform compares with that of his own organization.",35
247,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Throughout Australia there are only 200,000 people upholding the platform in which I believe.",35
248,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Are those people going to follow the Conservative Party and ""march under the Conservative banner ?",35
249,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No , they are going to make the Conservative Party swallow their platform.",35
250,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If the honourable member desires to bring that state of things about I have no objection to his organization. All I have to say is that the people with whom he is associated are not altogether blind to the composition of the party which occupies the Opposition benches. They are not blind to the difficulties in the way of placing democratic legislation upon the statute-book, and I feel sure that when the time comes they will sympathize with the toilers and the down-trodden, and that as brothers and men they will respond to an appeal to their humanitarian sympathies and will help us to haul down the flag of conservatism. Three years ago the honourable member saw the cloud coming. He realized that sooner later the free-traders would have to swallow their principles, and accordingly he took time by the forelock, and formed a party of his own. I wish him success, so long as he does not ally himself with the party which is absolutely opposed to the best interests of the people. this debate the honourable member for Ballarat has not indicated the reason why he has departed from his promise to support the Labour Party, so long as their measures were just and reasonable. Now there is no honourable member who is more able to explain anything, if it is capable of explanation, than the honourable member himself. Even when he is not able to satisfactorily explain any matter he makes a very good attempt at doing so. But in the present instance his case is so utterly hopeless that he dare not allow his silvertongued oratory to run for five minutes. He has failed to respect the trust committed to him by the people, and he has been unjust both to himself and to his own party. Consequently he occupies the very unenviable position in which we see him today.",35
251,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,35
252,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I feel that it is almost compulsory to make further remarks with regard to the combination or fusion that - we find on the Opposition benches today. The honourable member for Ballarat has played very many parts. I do not intend to repeat what has been said, ably and concisely, in that regard by previous speakers. Sufficient has been said to enable the people of this great Commonwealth to draw their own conclusions from the Hansard report. Any debate which may be indulged in on this occasion is more than warranted by the unprecedented action which was taken on the Address-in-Reply by the honourable gentlemen who are coming into power. In addition to the many political parts he has played, the honourable member for Ballarat has been a great student of other things than polities'. Reincarnation has been, I think, one of his late studies. He has given, I believe, great attention to the possibilities of reincarnation as a factor in developing souls when they are transferred from this sphere to some other one. No stronger proof of that doctrine have I found than that which is furnished by the honourable gentleman. Surely reincarnation has come down to earth, when we find him continuously changing from one position to or another, swallowing himself with that avidity which is characteristic of a man of his temperament, and proving beyond doubt that he, at any rate, can be reincarnated from month to month, or from year to vear, as the political exigencies may demand. During",35
253,Mr CARR,Unknown,"This is ""Reincarnation in our time,"" not ""Socialism in our time.""",35
254,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Exactly . It is not the honourable member for Ballarat alone who is an example of the doctrine of "" reincarnation in our time."" On that side of the House we find the process to be absolutely general. I hold in my hand a few remarks which have been uttered during the last few months in connection with honourable members who constitute the Conservative Party here today. I propose to put on record one or two of the absolutely inexplicable utterances which have emanated from those honourable gentlemen who today find themselves in opposition to the party which sits on the riebt of the chamber. At Ipswich, on the 27th November, 1906, the honourable member for Parramatta compared the Deakin Party with ""a row of fowls out in the rainfeeble, poor, and few."" Whether they have gone to roost in his hencoop, or whether he has gone to roost in theirs, I do not know. I suppose that one may conclude thai they are not now in the rain, but in the sunshine of anticipation of the offices which they are to fill.i The honourable member for Parramatta is welcome to the companionship which he has formed. When a man can make an utterance of that kind only a few months ago with regard to the leader whom he now follows, and the party whom he is associated with, and whom he described as a number of fowls out in the rain, it must be an indication to the public as to what parties can come together in this House for a common purpose. Before we come to a verdict on a matter of this kind, we require corroborative evidence, and the more corroborative it is the more damning will be the verdict which must be uttered by the public when they read the reports of our proceedings. Senator Clemons, who has some knowledge O'f the honourable member for Ballarat and political parties in this House, used these wordsThe place MrDeakin held in Federal politics was that of a skilful fortune-teller with a shifty utterance. His political aims and decisions were as uncertain as the flight of a butterfly. How prophetic was that utterance made by Senator Clemons in Launceston on the 18th July, 1905. Here is a man, who nearly four years ago could see through the honourable gentleman, and describe him in the words I have just quoted. Never has any utterance more truly portrayed the conduct of the honourable member for Ballarat during the recent recess. I now come to the opinions of the honourable member for Ballarat with regard to other persons, and the public will marvel how they could come together after the utterance I am about - quote. In the Age of the 22nd December, 1905-and that newspaper always reports the honourable member for Ballarat correctly-h e is reported to have made these remarksOur personal relations do not appear to me to demand more attention than they have already received. After repeated interviews I found (Mr Reid) vacuous and insincere. I wonder what the honourable member for East Sydney has to say of the honourable member for Ballarat to-dayI had been warned that I had to do with an unscrupulous and untrustworthy politician, and I found by bitter experience when Parliament met that I had to meet, as I told him to his face, black treachery as well. His treachery was to the men who at great risk to themselves had placed and kept him in power, against whom he aimed in his proposed dissolution the deadliest blow he could direct against the protectionist policy and party. That is the opinion of the honourable member for Ballarat with regard to his attitude after the defeat .of the Reid Administration. Are there any words which could be more damning to the personal or political reputation of any man than the words used on that occasion regarding the honourable member for East Sydney? How true they are today! That they have been proved up to the hilt by recent actions in - this chamber must be self-evident to every observing man. To-day the honourable member for East Sydney is practically gagged. He cannot say on this occasionwhat he would like to say. I feel that he dare not allow himself to speak. Otherwise the words uttered by the honourable member for Ballarat on that occasion werenot an indication of his true feelings towards the right honourable gentleman. Then the honourable member for Ballarat, as reported in the Argus of the 13th July, 1905, made use of these words regarding the right honourable member for East Sydney- ' Mr Reid, who, without notice or justification-, treacherously threw a bomb amongst the men behind him, found himself hoist withhis ownpetard. My old objections to taking office when Mr. Reid came into power remained as strong as they were when I declined his overtures. I neitherexpected nor desired it. Nothing but a great emergency would have induced me to accept it. The one man in Australia responsible for forcing me into his place-whic h I was far from envying and am far from welcoming-wa s Mr. Reid. His breach of faith with our party was so indefensible that it made an instant severance inevitable. Either the Ministry or the whole of the business of Parliament had to be sacrificed. to Yet today these men are cheek by jowl.",35
255,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member, appears not to like it.",36
256,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The right honourable member should be ashamed of it, but I welcome it,, as do the people of Australia. Why should I object to be relieved of the him company of men whose utterances indicatetheir character? The salvation of the Labour Party lies in separating themselves from their enemies, and standing compact publishedbefore the country, ready to fight for the public welfare.",36
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member's constituents will require him to say why he supported these men so strongly.,37
258,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"My constituents have never had occasion to accuse me of playing them false, or of not honestly advocating the principles upon which I was elected. They cannot accuse me of breaking my election pledges, as the honourable, member and those associated with him are doing. I am not here by his help or that of his party ; I was returned despite the bitterest opposition which could be given to any man. I was returned, not by deceiving my electors, but because I hopefully and manfully gave utterance to the truth that is. in me, and explained my parliamentary ambitions.",37
259,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"What will they think when they hear of the company which the honourable member has been keeping, and is now denouncing?",37
260,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member should keep silence; the further he pushes into this debate the worse' it will be for his allies. Let me proceed with my exposure of the perfidy of these men as evidenced by their utterances.,37
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Perfid y is not parliamentary term.,37
262,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I withdraw it, because, like many other terms which are true and applicable in this connection, it is not parliamentary. . Mr Reid, replying to Mr Deakin, on the 14th Julv. 1905",37
263,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am not insisting: on a mere matter of form when I ask the honourable member to refer to his fellowmembers by the names of their constituencies. Mr Reid, Mr Deakin, and others whose names might be mentioned, are not in this House except as the representatives of constituencies, and must therefore be referred to in their representative capacity.",37
264,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"As I am quoting from passages in which the names of these gentlemen appear, I naturally feel it difficult to follow the rule of debate to which you, sir, are drawing attention, and sometimes forget, that I should speak of them by the names of their constituencies. This is what the right honourable member for East Sydney said of the honourable member for Ballarat a day after the utterances, which I have just quoted, were I consulted him (Mr Deakin) again on Wednesday, June 21st, three days before his speech at Ballarat, and I could still have sworn that he was as loyal and cordial as ever. I told my colleagues, as it seemed with a fallacious confidence, on the day before the Ballarat speech, that I could tell when a man had any ulterior motives or designs in his mind, and my personal intercourse with Mr Deakin until the previous Wednesday had convinced me he was the same loyal and generous ally he had always been. That was on the Friday. Then came the Saturday's speech of my friend and ally. If that was the speech of the loyal and. generous ally I had taken him for, then I and all my colleagues acted wrongly and foolishly in doing what we did, and the suicidal mania became feasible. I' do not know how these men are going to justify themselves before the public, having regard to their previous attitude to each other. I come now to deal with another member of the Opposition, who has the respect of every man in this chamber, and, I think, of the people outside, the honourable member for North Sydney. It is only recently that he has fallen from grace. In order that I may not do him an injustice, let me quote what he has said about the man with whom he is now associated. This is a report of his remarks on the 14th September, 1905But what of Mr Deakin? Has he not risen, yet fallen? Risen to office but fallen in repute. Either he must be found guilty of disloyalty a to the cause he advocated when he assisted so ardently in the formation of the late Ministry, as well as to Mr Reid, and to those of his own party who took office in the Ministry with his approval, or he must be ranked as one of those whose political perceptions are becoming so blunted that he cannot weigh the decency, effect, or meaning of his own words and actions. In other words, the honourable member for North Sydney excuses the honourable member for Ballarat for his peculiar .position by indicating that he is not responsible for his actions-that the only reasonable and charitable view is that the leader of the Opposition cannot weigh the full effects of his words. Yet today the honourable member for North Sydney is found sitting in company with the honourable member for Ballarat. and will probably be a member of the Administration that is about to be formed. If ever there was got together a party of insincere men in any Parliament in the world, it is the party which will occupy these benches within the'next week or two. As I say, we have no complaint to make, because it will be our privilege to pillory these men every time we get a chance, until we can get them to appeal to ""the country. It is our duty to the people, more than our privilege, to see that no stone is left unturned in order to leave on their reputation the stigma of reproach they have so deservedly earned for inconsistency during the time they have occupied positions on both sides of the chamber. I have shown a few of the beautiful inconsistencies developed by this fusion of parties; and I now have to charge the honourable member for Ballarat, and those associated with him, with absolute insincerity in their desire to populate and protect Australia. I have in my hand a list which shows unmistakably the earth hunger prevailing in this country. It is marvellous to think that with 3,000,000 square miles of territory we are not able to find land for 4,250,000 people in order to enable them to support their families and - benefit the nation. Here are somefigurestaken from the Sydney Morning Herald and other newspapers during the last few monthsUpper Hunter, 190 applicants for 1,500 blocks. Muswellbrook, 85 applicants for 1,750 acres, 2 blocks. Murwillumbah, 211 applicants for 40 blocks. Murwillumbah, 108 applicants for 26 blocks. Lismore, 53 applicants for 687 acres, 3 Ganmain (Wagga), 374 applicants for 11,475 acres, 22 blocks. Hay, m applicants for 6,635 acres, 3 blocks. Tweed, 181 applicants for 31 blocks. Muswellbrook, 43 applicants for 1,339 acres, 4 blocks. Forbes, 32 applicants for 1,946 acres, 1 block. Forbes, 11 applicants for 840 acres, 1 block. Bingara, '59 applicants for 2,625 acres, 10 blocks. Kempsey, 25 applicants for 475 acres, 2 blocks. Wyalong, 20 applications for 2,350 acres In my own electorate, during the last month or two, seven blocks of country, which were part of cancelled improvement leases in New South Wales, and which had been declared unfit for pastoral use by the Minister of Lands, were opened as grazing blocks, and for these there were 700 applicants. Thefiguresare an indication of the earth hunger today in New South Wales, and, to some extent, in Victoria and the other States, and represent one of the evils that the present Government are making an honest, sincere, and effective effort to remove. What are members of the Opposition likely to do in this regard? They have already declared that they desire immigration, but to what part of the Commonwealth do they propose to send immigrants? Do they propose to send them to the valuable coastal areas now run as sheepwalks all around Australia ? Is it to those large areas of land that would feed thousands of human families and bring prosperity to the country ? No, they propose to send the immigrants to the Northern Territory-int o the torrid zone. The Government or party which could dream for a moment of importing immigrants, and sending them to the Northern Territory, contemplate one of the most diabolical acts of which any Administration could be guilty. Some honourable members did not take advantage of the opportunity presented of investigating on the spot the conditions and possibilities of the Northern Territory, but I did; and I say without hesitation that those lands will never be occupied excepting by the overflow from more favoured lands in the southern parts of the continent. Men cannot be transferred from cold or cooler continents to the Northern Territory, and induced to live there, unless they have passed a period of acclimatisation in the more southern and favoured parts of the acres, 2 country; and to send immigrants there would be the worse that could possibly be done for the advancement of this great continent and its future safety. There is no doubt that we shall have to take over blocks. the Northern Territory for defence purposes; but God forbid that the day is near when we shall attempt to delude immigrants from other countries into settling there, until they have, as I say, passed through a period of acclimatisation. As to opening up land for the applicants I have mentioned-for those sons of farmers and others who cannot find a place in which to put their labour to profitable use - w e are absolutely without any hope from any Government that may be formed of honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Ballarat suggeststhat this matter should be left to the States, bur be knows as well as I do that to do so would be only a means of evading the question and escaping the responsibility which his position will carry. What can be done in the States, with ""the Legislative Councils constituted of landlords, some elected and some nominated? In my judgment, there is not a State in Australia where the Legislative Council would agree to an effective progressive land tax for the benefit of the people; and, therefore, the honourable member for Ballarat is insincere when he puts his proposal forward and professes to be anxious for the safety of this continent from foreign attack. ""While he has the landlords of the Opposition corner applying the brake to his political machine, the honourable member for Ballarat has no hope of placing on the statute-book a Commonwealth progressive land tax. I regard the imposition of such a tax as the king-pin of our progress, as likely to be the centre of all prosperity and success. Unless we have areas of land suitable for settlement to offer intending immigrants, we cannot expect, and ought not to attempt to induce, them to come here. The honourable member for Ballarat says that we must trust to the States to pass land tax legislation. What does that mean? Mr Wade has intimated that he does not intend to do anything of the kind; but let us consider for a moment what would be the position if such a measure were passed by the Legislature of New South Wales. Would it attract population from abroad ? Certainly not. It would simply attract to New South Wales land-seekers'from other parts of the Commonwealth. It would be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. We should simply transfer people from one State to another. We should benefit one State by impoverishing all the others in the Union. Such a proposition, therefore, is impracticable, and, that being so, all the professions of the honourable member for Ballarat as to a desire to encourage immigration and, in that way, to secure the safety of the Empire, may be regarded as mere moonshine.",37
265,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [2.47] - During this debate, Mr Speaker, I have not observed any anxiety on the part of honourable members on this side of the Honse to catch your eye. We have had from the other side of the House speech after speech attacking honourable members of the Opposition, and, listening to them. I have been led to speculate as to how the public are likely to regard these proceedings. they not be inclined to ask-""Where do we come in?"" We were promised that we should have in Federal politics a rarer atmosphere, but I must freely admit that as a member of the Parliament of New South Wales I never saw so much bad taste exhibited in connection with the displacement of a Ministry as we have witnessed in this House within the last twenty four hours. We have had a review of the history of the relations that existed between the Deakin Administration and the Labour Party. We have listened to the honourable member for Hume castigating his former colleague, and we have heard much that in my judgment, will create on the part of the public a feeling of disgust in regard to Federal politics.",39
266,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Wit h regard to fusion politics.,39
267,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I intend to deal with the fusion. We have been informed that the Labour Party entered into a compact with the Deakin Administration to keep them in office until certain measures were passed, and for a reasonable period after that time. The Attorney-General and the honourable member for Hume have vouched for the truth of that statement. They have said that there was a compact to keep the Labour Ministry in power for a reasonable time, and it is well that that fact should be placed on record, since the Labour Party on the platform and elsewhere, never fail to take to themselves special credit for purity of motive. It will be interesting to the public to learn that the Labour Party, without the knowledge of the electors and behind the backs of their own leagues, entered into a secret compact with the members of the Deakin Party by which the one was to assist the other. I can conceive of nothing more obnoxious in the world of politics. They complain of the tactics of those who are anxious to remove them from office, but such tactics dwindle into insignificance when compared with the secret compact made by the Labour Party behind the backs of their leagues.",39
268,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No secret compact ever existed.,39
269,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"What power have the Labour Party to enter into a compact with another party by which each shall be secured in turn a term of office? I thought that their only concern was to carry into effect the planks of their platform. I make no apology to the Labour Party for the vote which I gave yesterday. According to the newspaper reports, as the result Will of the coalition we are to revert to the old system of representative and responsible government. We are to have in power a Ministry having behind it a majority of the members of this House- a Ministry responsible for its own acts and making no alliance. Every member of the party is to have a personal responsibility-is to be personally responsible to his electors for his acts in this Parliament. And this is what the Labour Party describe as a return to conservative conditions.",39
270,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is that a special brand of virtue of which the Opposition have a monopoly ?,39
271,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I am merely stating what in caucus. the newspapers report will be the result the Coalition Ministry. Until I see the ment. coalition in working order, I must take those statements at their label value; but, personally, I am going to be responsible to taken place lately in the caucuses of other my constituents for all my votes and parties ? actions.",40
272,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is responsibility to one's constituents a special brand of virtue joyed only by the Opposition?,40
273,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Yes ; the Labour Party are responsible only to their leagues.,40
274,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is not so.,40
275,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister his party have not that virtue. As a maton ter of fact, they are tied down by their leagues. Towards the close of last sesour debates. sion, when the statement of Ministerial policy was under review, I gave expression to views.which I can endorse today. .

We are returned as representatives, and our decisions should made public. I am not grumbling at attitude of the Labour Party, but I am grumbling at their decisions being come to Such a ""practice is destructive of of the principle of representative govern",40
283,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Has not the same thing, .",40
284,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If it has, I have not been present. I think the Prime Minister entook up a very manful position in his replv to the attack made by the leader of the Opposition, and reconciled himself to the inevitable fact that the numbers are against him. But I am not at all at and tracted by the squealing which has gone since, or by the amount of secret history that .has been disclosed to the public in All I can say is that if Australia can stand 111 members of this Parliament, at ^ 6 0 0 a year each, squabbling like this, with seven or eight Minfighting not to go out of office, and seven or eight others fighting to get into office, it is a very fine country. I honbelieve that the citizens of Australia, the men who are not anxious to enter public life, are heartily sick of the conduct I am only too glad to see some solution arrived at. We have now only two parties, and it is easy for a man to choose which he will be with. I have A man has now to be either with the political The memthe bers of the Labour Party ought to be only too glad to come over to this side in opposition, in view of the coming elections, for I can understand their being in a stronger position after a few months in opposition than they are today, or than they would be if they continued in power up ""to the time of the elections. The honourable member for Ballarat is now the He must have a a marvellous genius for commanding his in temper, because I cannot understand how unanv member could take the attacks that I not know whether my nature is different, or whether I am not keen enough at playing the game, but I am sure, Mr Speaker, in that even you, with your long parliamenexperience and judicial nature, could it . not have sat upon these benches and taken attacks upon you in the way the honourable member for Ballarat has takenpublic the attacks upon him. It shows either a be masterly self-control or a total indifference the to the opinions of others. I do not know yet how to put it . It is still a mystery to me. I am used to the rough-andtumble of political life, but if any one said to me half of what has been said to the honourable member for Ballarat, I would not try to meet it even by mental exchanges, but I would ask my opponents if they really meant what they said, and if they did I would take pretty prompt steps to show them what I would do. As an old hand' at parliamentary life I am certain that the public, when they read these severe attacks made by honourable members upon one another, will refuse after a while to believe either side. They will come to the conclusion that it is only part of the game, and that it is impossible for it to be genuine, or else flesh and blood could not stand it. I have beard attacks made, not only upon the political position of the honourable member for Ballarat, but even on his very manhood. I cannot understand how any honourable member can take it so calmly. Perhaps I am taking it too seriously, but if it is only banter, I think that in a serious time like this banter could be very well left on one side. I may be wrong, but my opinion is that the honourable member for Ballarat is today the only possible leader of a radical force in Australia outside of the Labour Party. Time after time. I have supported his measures, and I have simply now to wait until he brings in his platform. If , as some honourable members predict, he simply waits upon the honourable members in the Opposition corner, and displays Conservative views, I shall not vote for him any longer. I am backing him now on his past experience, and on his avowal of radical principles, and a radical policy. In so, I believe I am' correctly interpreting the wishes of my electors. If not, they will have an opportunity very shortly to vote against me. If the fight has to come, it might just as well come now as nine months hence. Labour Party have fought me for years, and I would much sooner meet them in a fortnight's time than nine months hence. We are really entering upon a new condition of politics in Australia. The Labour Party, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, will appeal to the public to be intrusted with straight-out of government. They already hold twenty-seven seats, and if they can only capture twelve more, they will be the ruling force in Australia. There will then be no danger of the disclosure of secret compacts or Mr Wilks. negotiations such as we have heard lately. The greatest smudge upon Federal politics has been placed there within the last day or two by the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Hume, when they stated that arrangements were made to keep certain people in power for a certain time, and that afterwards it was to be turn-and-turn about. For the last few years I have not occupied the' most enviable position in the House. Rightly or wrongly I have gone for what I have believedjfb be the duty of a responsible representative, and I have not gone back on the principles that I was returned to advocate and defend. Honourable members have said that I had to swallow a pill or bolus, but, if I did, I swallowed it four or five years ago, and it is digested now. A lot of other honourable members are only now swallowing their pill, and I hope it will not disagree with them. Although it is apparently the usual custom in this debate to show by quotations that on a certain date an opponent said certain things, and on another date said the opposite, making the quotations with a good deal of vim and vigour, I shall ask the leave of the House simply to quote myself. On the 27th November, 1908, when dealing with the Ministerial statement made by the present Prime Minister, I saidThe Labour Party have never been met by a solid, well-organized force in proper battle array; but live on the divisions of thought and opinion in this House and in the country. I feel sure that the submission of a Liberal-progressive platform, under a proper leader, would make a sjreat change, because the sympathetic vote now given to Labour would be transferred. doing The honourable member for Calare interjectedI f there had been a true Liberal Party there would have been no Labour Party. There is no more earnest Labour member in the House than the honourable member for The Calare, and that interjection of his states the true history of the position both in State and Federal politics. If the Liberal forces had kept pace with the demands of the people we should never have known a Labour Party in this country.",40
285,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Is there a true Liberal Party on the honourable member's side of powers the House at the present time?,41
286,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I am not to be drawn into answering that question. In the speech from which I have quoted, I went on to sayBut the people were afraid of the Conservatives, and were only too glad to come under the Labour banner, which offered some hope of progress. The only Liberal leader that I can discern in this House is the late Prime Minister. I was not returned to either support or oppose that honourable gentleman; and all I could do was to vote for legislation in which I believed, whether introduced by his or any other party; and I am in that position today. That last sentence puts my position even today. 1 still believe, from my experience of the honourable member for Ballarat, that he is the true leader of the democratic forces of this country. He is the natural leader of the advanced party .in this House. What separated me from him in the past was the fiscal issue. I was with him in all questions of advanced legislation. If I could fall in with the methods of the Labour Party, I should have no hesitation in putting myself at the disposal of the Labour leagues. But I ' oppose their methods today, because I consider that they exercise more tyranny than any party that I have a knowledge of. I do not consult any Labour league as to whether I shall support advanced politics. have views of my own, which I lay before the electors. If they choose to return me to promote those views, well and good. But I will not submit to what the Labour Party call discipline. There is no machine politics in Australia that exercises such tyranny in the name of discipline as that exercised by the Labour Party.",41
287,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We manage to set along very well.,42
288,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,It is pure freedom.,42
289,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It is a kind of freedom that I do not understand. I will quote a Concluding passage from the speech to which I have already referredI am simply pointing out that the Labour Party have succeeded because they have readily conformed to the twentieth century idea of politics, and have organized their forces. I wish to See put forward in this Parliament a programme clrawn on liberal and progressive lines. Such a programme will receive my support, regardless of by whom it may be put forward. The late Prime Minister introduced some legislation for which I voted, and I find myself associated with a party, some of the members of which are not prepared to vote fbr measures which I should favour. I am still waiting for.the coming of that leader. I am not "" buying a pig in a poke,'' but am backing the honourable member for Ballarat on his past performances. If his policy be in the direction of radicalism, no man will be more pleased than I ; and I shall not believe, until it is proved to me, that a man with his record is going to surrender the Liberal principles to which he has always adhered. There are many honourable members who, in the past, have sat on the opposite side to me whom I am pleased to see on this side of the Chamber now. I can assure them that this side required a leaven of radicalism. We have it now. It came to us with a strength of eleven or twelve votes. I do not say that there was no liberal thought on the Opposition side previously. I am not so unjust as to think so. Nor do I say that honourable members have no right to express conservative views. Their views in politics are the concern of their electors. But, nevertheless, I am' glad to see an accession of Liberalism to this side, and trust that, for old association sake, the honourable memUer will take care that the platform of his Government is devised on Liberal lines.",42
290,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,He is there for that purpose.,42
291,Mr WILKS,Unknown,I hope that that is so. I Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The honourable member should not make any mistake.,42
292,Mr WILKS,Unknown,I am not mistaking any one for the honourable member for Hume. He has not been himself lately. I know that he is a good man for sticking to his friends. He has done so all his life.,42
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am a good man for sticking to my enemies, too.",42
294,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I think that there are some very strange people amongst his present friends; but that is his business. When the honourable member looks at his last night's speech a week or two hence, I think he will find that it will read something like this: "" There is another swindle on, and I am not in it . "" That is how it sounded to me. I hope that I am not doing the honourable member an injustice.",42
295,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member's description is quite correct, as far as the swindle is concerned.",42
296,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The honourable member admits, then, that the coalition is a swindle?",42
297,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I did not say so, but that is what the honourable member for Hume probably thinks. I have not. been to the party meetings, but have read what has been going on. As to the new protection proposal, no honourable member is more sympathetic towards it than I am. I am pleased'to see the right honourable member for Swan putting on radical clothes at last. I remember saying, last session, that I did not know how he would get into them; but that is his business. I am also pleased that the Opposition Corner is adopting liberal views, at the instance of the honourable member for Ballarat; and the country ought to be grateful to him for the change that he has brought about. This morning it was said that the honourable member for Ballarat was the "" boss intriguer."" In my judgment, the honourable member for Parramatta has shown himself to be deserving of that description. He has got the honourable member for Ballarat on to this side. I had thought that it would be impossible for any one to do that. I do not doubt that we are going to have a big struggle in the future. But at the next elections the public will not .fail to be told what. the cause of the trouble is. It amused me to hear some honourable members opposite say that they did not have a chance of discussing the Governor General's speech. As a matter of fact the speech is little than a repetition of the platform of the Labour leagues. It is creditable to the Minister that it should be so. Last session I took the opportunity of saying that it was of no use discussing what the Prime Minister then said; that we should have to wait for the Governor General's, speech to know what his policy was. But, as a matter of fact, the speech was already written- dom which they ought to have. by the Labour leagues, and if the Prime Minister was the honourable man that I took him to be-as I know that he is-the Governor General's speech was bound to be a formal statement of the programme of the Labour leagues. If the Prime Minister had not made it such, he might have had a nine months' longer tenure of office, but at the expense of a sacrifice of principle, and his own leagues would have put him out of power at the earliest opportunity. That, in fact, is one of the objections that I have to the Labour Party. I believe in the strong man theory, and I hope the honourable member for Ballarat will prove to be the strong-man on this occasion. I have no complaint to make against those who approve of the drawing up of a political platform by political leagues., but I hold the view that nations are advanced very often not by the action of numbers of individuals, but by the work of strong men who at different periods of their history appear upon the scene and lead them. No one will deny that machine politics exist in Australia today. The Australian Political Labour Party is probably as well organized as any political 3lr. Wilks. party in the world. If an honourable member like myself is attacked, no one on the same side thinks of coming to his assistance, but let a member of the Political Labour Party, though the humblest in their ranks, be attacked, and the whole party at once comes to his assistance. 1 know that in the constituency I have had the honour to represent for years, I have had to fight them time after time, and they have often brought the whole of their forces into the constituency to oppose me. Let it not be forgotten in this connection that mine is a labour constituency. It is not a pocket borough, such as I heard referred to today. where the influence of certain powerful vested interests are sufficient to secure the return of a candidate. There is no stronger labour constituency in the Commonwealth than that which I represent, and I have had to fight all the forces of the Labour Party to secure my election. more Honourable members opposite will not deny that the easy course for me would Prime have been to join their ranks years ago. I have not done so, and there must be some reason for my refusal to do so. In political principle we are not so far removed, but my reason for not joining them is that the members of the Political Labour Partv have not, in my opinion, the personal freeI cannot, of course, disclose confidences given to me, and I shall not attempt to do so, but I do make this speculation, that in the ranks of the Political Labour Party today there are many members who would like to have the freedom I have.",42

308,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I am giving an illustration of personal political freedom. I have been associated for years with honourable members included in the party cn this side, and I have never known any one at meetings of those members to have his - opinions fettered in the way I am referring to. If any man wished for greater liberty than I have been given amongst honourable members on this side, he would be a political anarchist.",44
309,Mr HALL,Unknown,Then why did the honourable member leave them?,44
310,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I say openly that I left them because they were rather too conservative politically for me, but they now have a radical and liberal leader, and, perhaps, have seen the error of their ways. Throughout this debate my name has been - associated with a certain outside organisation. My association with it has been referred to sometimes in a bantering way, - sometimes in terms of ridicule; at other times with severity, or in a sneering way. But I have stood that kind of thing before, and am prepared to do so again. I l have stood it in this Chamber and on public platforms in Australia. It may be said that on this question I am wrong, or that I have a "" r at , "" but if I have, it is my own rat.",44
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I hope that it is not a plague rat.,44
312,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If it were it would probably be in the honourable gentleman's pocket. It has been said that the fusion ihas been brought about by the outside party referred to. I must admit that, at the present time, the platform proposed is very much like that of the outside party, and I am waiting to see whether, in about a fortnight's time, it will not be more like it . The members of the outside party to which I refer have realized that the political Labour forces of Australia have no right to the title of "" Labour."" They annexed it. The source of the most powerf u l influence in the political Labour Party today is to be found in their title. The most magical word that can be used on any platform in Australia is the word "" L a b o u r . "" The whole stock-in-trade of honourable members opposite is comprised in their title of the "" Political Labour Party."" I may be wrong, but I am beginning to think that, as a partu, they are more political than labour today - They are in the habit of indulging in personalities, in reference to the wealth and position of individuals opposed to them, but I am sure that there are many Labour supporters in the country who would be very glad to be as well off as are some of the members of the Political Labour Party. When they claim to be Samaritans and supporters of down-trodden humanity, I should like to see them practice a little of the doctrine they preach. If there is any poverty at all I seem to have my fair share of it , but I do not travel on that, and do not desire to do so. When honourable members opposite denounce honourable members on this side as the "" fat men "" of the community who stand behind the vested interests of the country, I put my own case, and I say that I do not stand behind the vested interests of the country.",44
313,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No , they are behind the honourable member.",44
314,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"They are not behind me. When I hear honourable members opposite charging honourable members on this side with being well off, and trying to make the public believe that they are mere supporters of wealth, I cannot forget that there are some of themselves who could buy up the worldly possessions of those whom they denounce'. These personalities are most distasteful, but I know there will be a very keen fight at the next election, and that the Political Labour Party will not be too scrupulous as to the means they will employ against those to whom they are opposed. The outside organization to which some honourable members opposite have referred in tones of disgust, is the Orange Party of Australia. Let me say openly that I am a member of it, and I believe I took a fairly active part in the drafting of the platform of that party. They have come forward with a political platform, and are as keen in political warfare today as are the Labour leagues of Australia. Candidates who look for their support will get it only upon their platform.",44
315,Mr HALL,Unknown,They always vote in big squadrons.,44
316,Mr WILKS,Unknown,They do nothing of the sort. The honourable member received their support at the last election. He cannot deny that.,44
317,Mr HALL,Unknown,I do deny it . Mr Wilks' - A m I to - understand that the honourable member does not want their support at the next election?,44
318,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,They did their best to down me.,45
319,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The best friend the honany orable member had was Mr Vale. These are matters which should be stripped of disguise, and the party to which I refer make no pretence, but come forward boldly as a political party. They have a fect right to form themselves into a poliwant tical body, and to adopt the machinery that is best calculated to serve their own interests. The Labour Partv say, "" Those who are not with us are against us. Those who will not come with us we will put the sword."" The rank and file of the organization to which I belong-eve n i they are ill-advised-ar e at least honest in their desire to give effect to their platform. They have as much right to organize as has the Labour Party. I retegrity cognise that at the next election there will be a struggle for supremacy, and I hope we shall win. An attack has been made on the honourable member for Maribyrnong, because he belonged to the Orange order. In my judgment, the time has gone by when an apology for belonging to it was will be. necessary. There are men in the Labour Party itself who only a few years ago lodges were themselves members 'of it. Yet the Mr do honourable member for Dalley is frequently used as a chopping-block because of his association with that order. Honourable members opposite say, "" Poor devil, he to be pitied."" Now I neither ask for nor did. require the pity of honourable members. I repeat that there are members of the Labour Party today who only a few years ago were members of the organization to which I belong. I say further that Labour Party owes its origin to that institution. I am sorry that the demothat. cratic forces of that institution ever lowed them to get away from it. With lodge. most of the views of the Labour Party I am in agreement, but I differ from its members upon the question of the maber chinery which it employs. If honest in their views they must in the future fight for true Socialism. They must publicly avow themselves as Socialists.",45
320,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Who objects to doing that ?,45

322,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It->is remarkable how sensitive some honourable members are toobservations made by members of the Orange institution. They at once flatly all deny the truth of those observations. But no contradiction is heard of statements made by the other side. The members perof the Labour Party say, "" We do not sectarianism in politics."" Yet they, know perfectly well that I have never advocated the introduction of sectarianism into our political life. A man's religion is his own concern between himself and to the Creator. But the Orange institution is a political one. Its members believe f that the Labour leagues are working for the dismemberment of the Empire, and own that under the guise of Australian nationalism they intend to attack the inof the Empire. Consequently they have combined in the open light of day, as they have a perfect right to do.

I am astonished at the denial of the honourable member for Cook, but,, nevertheless, I must, accept it., The Orange institution has no quarrel with the Labour Party whatever. But when the Attorney-General spoke in the way that he did, he could not have acted in a manner more calculated to excite the resentment of that institution. He taunted it, and practically challenged its opposition. I repeat that the Orange Party has nothing whatever, against the Labour Party. There is nothing to prevent a member of. that party from receiving its support.",46
328,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It has opposed the election of every member of the Labour Party. Mr Wilks' - Onl y of recent years. However, I should not have referred to this matter had it not been for the attack made by the Attorney-General.

The Labour Party in the past have been successful chiefly because there has been no other party in politics which approximated to it from a progressive stand-point. In some States they have been Radicals, and in other States they have been Conservatives. At the next election they will have to meet a federalized party, and the issue will be made very clear indeed. I regret that these two able men in public affairs have been separated by fiscalism.  not object to people doing as they like?",46
331,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No ; no one should object to a fair go. As I said in my opening remarks, I would just as soon have the general election held a fortnight hence as nine months hence.

There is no question that at the general election we shall have a good fig&t. On his past professions and actions I can accept the honourable member for Ballarat as a liberal leader. ' If he does not bring in a liberal programme my course will be very clear. I can vote against him.  honourable member's programme?",46

333,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that honourable members in the Opposition corner will follow a liberal programme ?,46
334,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"They _ will follow the honourable member for.Ballarat, and if he brings down a liberal programme they will support him. In their own interests some years ago, the Labour Partv sank fiscalism. In their ranks are extreme protectionists and extreme free-traders, but they are now growling because the party on this side has followed their example. At the last election I told my constituents that I was absolutely full of the struggle about fiscalism, and that when it came to a question of 30 or 3? per cent., it was of no interest to the workers, and I advocated the idea of new nrotection. My only opposition to old protection was that it took money from the manv for the benefit of the few. If , however, means can be devised for insuring the benefits of protection to the worker and consumer, as well as to the manufacturer, it will have my support. Australia to-dav is protectionist. A free-trader who will come down to a duty of 25 per cent, is not a man worth wasting breath over. What I fought for in my younger days was to remove taxation from the necessaries of life, and to put the burden upon the shoulders of the wealthy. But I found that there was no chance of attaining that object. I am now an advocate of new protection, for I desire to see the benefits conferred by the Tariff shared by workers and consumers as well as by manufacturers. Right through the struggle over the Tariff I voted for the lowest duties on the necessaries of l if e ; but, as regards other articles, I stated openly here that I was in the scramble. It was not then a question of principle, but a mere scramble for duties in favour of certain industries. The only thing I am certain of is that I did not get enough protection for my own electorate. It is all very well for some honourable members to pretend that they are actuated by high principles, but when I found men voting free-trade for other States and protection for their own States I thought it was time for 'me to wake up and vote for what I could get. Four years ago I saw this situation coming. I believe that, in Victoria and New South Wales, there will be notwo members more bitterly attacked than will be the honourable member for Maribyrnong and myself. I welcome the attack, and my honourable friend does not seem to be very sorry about .the matter.",46
335,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I am not much hurt.,47
336,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I do not wish to detain the. House any longer, sir; but as honourable members on this side did not seem to want to attract your-eye, and I had heard many speakers from the - other side, I thought it was only fair that I should rise to express my views, especially as my name had been imported into the discussion. There is no doubt that the execution of the Labour Government is coming off, and it might just as well come off now as a fortnight hence, for the Labour Party have had every opportunity by platform and public utterance to defend their position. I vote for the party on this side, not blindf o l d, but in the blind as regards their policy. I do not know what it is, but I hope that it is on radical lines. If , however, they allow themselves to be governed by Conservatives, they must not expect my support any longer.",47
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume) [3.42]. - I do not intend to delay the House many moments. I wish briefly to refer to a remark which was made by the honourable member for Ballarat. He said that he had listened to what I had to say last night, but that he could not find anything which would give a reason for my strong attitude against him, and the course which he has taken. I want to make the position very clear. I had been, at least I supposed I was,, in the confidence and the confidant of the honourable member for some years. Up to within, I think, about ten days-at any rate up to the day before he approved of the right, honourable member for Swan and Senator Sir Robert Best going to Sydney - I was ""with him. I never got the slightest hint that there were negotiations going on behind me. I accepted what the honourable member for Ballarat said to me in the same good faith and confidence as I had been in the habit of receiving his statements for some years. As I have stated, I was with the honourable member up to that event, and I thought .that I was in his confidence. He told me that nothing would be done by him without first consulting me. That took place within an hour and a half of his announcement to the press that he was not r going to take office in a Ministry, and also the statement that was made the same evening that the right honourable member for Swan and Senator Sir Robert Best were going to Sydney to negotiate as to the formation of a ' Ministry. I was asked by some of my friends to see the honourable member for Ballarat next day. I went into his room, and told him that I had come to ask one question, and that was whether the right honourable member for Swan had gone to Sydney with his concurrence, and whether he himself had pledged his party, as far as he could, to support a Ministry which that right honourable gentleman might form. He told me that he had done so. It was done behind my back, sir, and I told him what I thought of him, and what I will always think of him. That is a pretty plain reason why I feel so hurt at the manner in which I have, been treated. Although I gave my full heart and my full brain to the honourable member, I found, within a few hours, that he had been working behind me in a way which I have not language to describe. This makes it impossible for me, seeing the close relations which existed between us, to ever believe in him again. I might reasonably have anticipated that he would hate placed confidence in me but when I complained, he said, "" I could not tell you about it, because it was Sir John Forrest's secret."" I exclaimed, "" I am supposed to be in your confidence, and you have held back what you call Sir John Forrest's secret,"" to which ""his reply was, "" I could not give away Sir John Forrest's secret."" I think it will be admitted that, throughout my career in both State and Federal politics, I have shown myself 'to be a strong protectionist. I have fought harder for protection than perhaps any one else has done. If I may be allowed to say so, I injured my health in the long Tariff struggle. But in connection with the fusion - whic h will become confusion-of parties opposite there is no statement as to what action will be taken to preserve the Tariff. I am not satisfied, and never will be, with the Tariff as it is, because its effectiveness was destroyed, or, at least, seriously injured by the efforts, of the Corner Party. There are many anomalies in it which I shall ask whatever party may be in power to rectify, and a number of duties which should and must be imposed in the interests of Australian industries. Tariff questions will not be allowed to rest. It is all very well for the honourable member for Dalley to say that it does not matter whether the duties that are imposed amount to 20, 25, or 35 per cent, ; it matters a great deal to the people of this country. I rose to clearly explain why my heart has been taken out of me, and my belief in human nature destroyed, by the action of the honourable member for Ballarat. In yesterday's Melbourne Herald I read a statement made by a prospective colleague of. his, or, at any rate, by one who will get something from him-the right honourable member for East Sydney-whic h astounded me, and which I wish to have recorded in Hansard. It is as followsThe comments of the Herald on the terms of the fusion show that there has been a misconception as to the clause relating to the Tariff, said Mr G. H . Reid today. ""The clause referred to, as published this , morning in the Age,"" continued Mr Reid, "" is - no interference with the protectionist policy of the present Customs Tariff, unless to rectify anomalies. Before the fusion, the free-traders in the direct Opposition requested Mr Joseph Cook to make our position under the clause perfectly clear to Mr Deakin - We pointed out that if an alteration in the Tariff was proposed which raised the fiscal issue as between free-traders and protectionists, that we free-traders held our-selves perfectly free to vote according to our convictions. To make assurance 'doubly sure, when the united party met, I . then defined our position again before the whole of the members of the new party. I pointed out to them that it would be most undesirable to leave any room for future recriminations as to the observance or non-observance of the basis of fusion. I told them that it must be understood distinctly that in becoming members of the new party weTiave agreed to a fiscal truce, and if the Tariff 'question is re-opened to rectify any alleged anomalies, we have reserved our right to vote in accordance with our own convictions and those of our constituents."" What does that mean, but that there is to be an absolute giving away of the protectionist position, and the hauling down of the protectionist flag? It is asserted not only"" that no fiscal question is to be raised which may bring free-traders and protectionists into conflict, but that even [ 8 j -3 when the rectification of anomalies is proposed, the free-traders will assert their right to fight against, and, if necessary, prevent it. The paragraph finishes with this sentenceThe fiscal truce is not to last only during the present Parliament, but during the next one. Did any. one ever hear of such an arrangement being made for a Parliament not yet elected?",47
338,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Labour Party has made a similar arrangement.,48
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am not speaking oil behalf of the Labour Party; I am showing' how brutally I and my opinions have been sold in connection with what has taken place.,48
340,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The statement which the honourable member has read shows that the honourable member for Ballarat has deliberatelv sold the protectionist cause.,48
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I cannot think anything else. I shall not detain the House longer, and should not have risen at all had it not been that my old leader stated last night that he could not find a reason in anything I said for the strong feeling which I have shown in regard to his actions.",48
342,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat) [3.53] - I shall not detain honourable members more than a few moments. But in justice to mv late colleague and myself, one or two simple facts must be added to his statement. What he said about calling on me on the afternoon when the right honourable member for Swan left for New South Wales is perfectly true, and so is his statement that I did not inform him of the departure. It was particularly desired by the right honourable member for Swan that he should arrive in Sydney and have an opportunity to see the then leader of the Opposition before the fact that he had left for the purpose was announced in Melbourne. He requested me not to mention the circumstances to any one, and I agreed not to do so. On the following day, I should have informed the honourable member for Hume of the fact that the right honourable member for Slwan had gone to Sydney, and of all the circumstances connectedwith his visit there. The honourable member is. again correct when he says that he protested very strongly - vehemently-agains t the proposal that there should be a coalition Government of this character. But when the honourable member left me, so far as I am concerned, he appeared to be content with my own position, since I did not propose to become a member of the Ministry. .",48
343,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The member is quite mistaken in his recollecstrain ' tion.,49
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I desire to make personal explanation, and, in doing .should be sorry to take up more than two minutes of the time of the House. night the honourable member for Hume said that he had heard me give orders that copies of a Banking Bill I had prepared h'ere to be burnt when I left the Treasury.",49
345,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is quite',49
346,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member went on to say that he took that the copies were not burnt. He also said I had kept back from my colleagues the fact that a Bill was being prepared, and that he only heard of the existence the Bill from the authorities of the of England when he was in London. I desire to say that a Banking Bill had been considered by my predecessor, Sir George Turner, and also by myself, when I Treasurer; that a Bill was drafted by the others. Treasury officials under my direction; that I consulted the Bank of England in, London tie. and other bankers here; that the not settled for submission to the net when I left office; that the so far as I . had got with it , all the papers connected with it, and also Sir George Turner's notes, were left in the Treasury when I left office; that. I never gave any instructions to any officer to burn them, or any other in this respect. public document, in my life.",49
347,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Oh !,49
348,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Further , I say I have consulted Mr Allen, the Secretary to the Treasury, and he says that Sir W liam Lyne must be under some great apprehension, as I never gave any instruction or made any such suggestion.",49
349,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not say it Mr Allen.,49
350,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Mr Allen goes on to say that the Bil l and all the papers, as I left them, are still in the Treasury.",49
351,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is not correct. Mr THOM AS BROWN (Calare) [3.58]. - When the debate has reached a stage at which personal explanations and recriminations are called forth, it is about time that it was ended; and I do not propose to contribute very much to its length. During the earlier part of the discussion I heard from my side of the House some attempts at congratulating honourable members oppohonorable site, though it is true there was a certain of irony about the congratulations. However that may be, I do not propose to a follow' the example then set, because from so, I the attitude which honourable members opposite adopt, and more particularly from Last the looks they present, I should say they have hardly settled down to the new order . all of affairs, or reached the stage at which congratulations are acceptable. But I feel disposed to offer a word of congratulation true. to the honourable member who is about to quit the position of Prime Minister-the care leader of the party with which I have been associated ever since - I entered into Commonwealth politics. The people now learn that within the ranks of labour, are of to be found gentlemen as capable of disBank charging the highest functions of administration as anv who could be found outside the party, and that the destinies of the Commonwealth are just as safe in their hands as was they could possibly be in the hands of",49
352,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"And so is the marriage Bill was Mr THOMAS BROWN - Quite so; Cabithemarriage tie is just as safe in the Bill hands of the present Government as it could possibly be in the hands of their critics, who have endeavoured to make use ' all of this cry about the marriage tie as a means of besmirching and defaming men who are very much better than themselves I am glad that an opportunity has been given to the honourable member for Wide Bay, and those that associated with him, to disclose what they are able to do ' as administrators; and' i l - every unbiased man wil l admit that they mishave done much to place the public desuch partments on a more stable footing than that on which they found them. was Their critics, if they are prepared to give credit where credit is due, must accord that meed of praise to them. I do not wish to lay any special blame on the late Postmaster-General, but the Post and Telegraph Department had drifted into a condition that was making it a by-word amongst the people; and the present Postmaster-General has had to adopt some veryunpopular methods to bring about a better state of affairs. He has not been afraid to do so; and I hope that those who succeed him will carry on the good work he has initiated, and, in a short time, remove any cause there may be for the complaints and abuse which have been hurled at the Department. Similar observations may be made as to the Defence Department. We have had no proper scheme of defence, and though we have been talking about a citizen soldiery, the forces have never been placed on a practical or satis-factory basis. Apparently the Administration has not had that sympathetic aid it deserves; but the present Minister has made a move in what I think will be regarded as the right direction. Then as to the White Australia legislation, the Fisher Government have signalized themselves by the extent to which they have unearthed and brought to light the various methods by which undesirable immigrants, and also, it may be said, opium, were being introduced. For their work in this connection the Government have placed the Commonwealth under a debt of gratitude. In regard to the introduction of Asiatic labour, honourable members must adopt two alternatives as an explanation of the work done by the Government, The first is that, when the Chinese learnt that a Labour Government was in control, they thought it a good opportunity to send undesirable immigrants and also opium to Australia. If ' that explanation lie not accepted, then the alternative is that the traffic in undesirable labour and opium had been going on more or less largely all the while, and it required a Labour Government to find it out and put a stop to it. Whatever may be the explanation, I think that every believer in the policy of a White Australia-ever y one desiring to see Australia thickly peopled with white races holding ideals and sympathies akin to his own-wil l concede that the Government has done good work in both these particulars. I wish to congratulate the Prime Minister on the substantial work he has done in the administration of his Department, and in initiating matters of policy. In the few weeks of the session that remained at his disposal, he lifted the Capital Site question from the ruck into which it had fallen, and remained for years, and enabled it to be satisfactorily dealt with. I trust that those who succeed the present Administration will continue his good work, and carry it to completion. Then, again, the great iron industry received substantial assistance at his hands by the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and I trust that ""oefore long Australia will be able to produce high class manufactures of metal from her crude ores. Still' another good work done by the present Government was that of giving to the public servants of the Commonwealth the common rights of citizenship enjoyed by the rest of the community-right s that had hitherto been denied them. The Prime Minister showed by his action that he had the courage to strike *out on new lines. I am sure that the public servants of the Commonwealth are men of intelligence and capacity, and that they will so use their newly acquired privileges that the incoming Government will not dare to attempt to take them from them. In' deed I feel sure, that the States will be compelled to follow in our wake, and that the public servants of the States will soon enjoy these larger measures of citizenship, and use them to the genera] welLbeing of Australia. In these directions the Government have done good work, which, as a member of the Labour Party,'I can heartily commend. Then,* again, they met the Parliament with a .policy that is a distinct advance upon and a departure from the policies hitherto submitted. There may be a difference of opinion as to whether it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth, but I am sure those who have considered it for themselves are satisfied that it is not merelv new, but distinctly Australian, and fitted to meet the requirements of an Australian community. The incoming Ministry will have to follow closely in the steps of the present Administration."" It is significant that those who are opposed to the Government have not dared to attempt to displace them by questioning any of their acts of administration, or the policy which they have submitted to the country. They have adopted other methods knowing full well that for the time being,- at all events, the Labour Government have behind them a large volume of public opinion. They dare not run counter to that opinion, but 'they hope soon to win it back, and to make their footing more secure. I am not here for the special purpose of keeping any particular party in power, but I certainly recognise the importance of effective administration. I want to see good liberal reforms provided for in Commonwealth enactmentsreforms which the Commonwealth urgently needs-and I desire to see such measures effectively administered. If , as the result of the fusion of parties, that has taken place, a large section pf the Opposition have been converted from their life-long adherence to Conservative principles, and brought so far under the banner of Liberalism as to be ready to carry out these reforms, I for one shall not complain. I shall certainly do my best to bring about that result; but I question very much whether that is the object lying behind the movement. I am fearful that it is intended not to bring about liberal reforms, not to secure the passing of legislation will benefit the whole community, and will not bend to special interests and privileges, but to keep up those special privileges, and to ibend the powers of legislation and of administration, as they have been bent in the past. For that reason, I sincerely regret that the Fisher Administration is to give place to a Ministry representing the fusion Of parties. However, by their acts. they must be judged, and I shall await .with interest a statement of the work they propose to do. I see before me a combination of parties and interests that hitherto have been vitally antagonistic. We have before us the extreme Coaservatives on the free-trade side sitting with the'Liberal or ""good as a Labour man."" We have, too, the extreme Con- servative on the protectionist side sitting with the Liberal or "" good as a Labour man."" Then, again, we have still another party consisting of honourable members who, so far as I am aware, have never professed any sympathy with democratic aspirations or legislation. That party held the balance of power, when the Tariff was under consideration, and exercised it in the interesta of the wealthy section of the communitv. > Whenever they were called upon to vote for an item which meant high protection, and at the same time would yield much revenue, they voted with the protectionists to carry it into law. On the pther hand, if , by voting with the free-trade section, they could secure the passing of a large revenue producing item, and defeat the protectionists, they were quite prepared to do so. The result is that the present Tariff is one of the highest revenue producing Tariffs, and, therefore, is incompatible with any degree of protection or free-trade. Those who so devised it took good care that the burdens of its revenue-producing items were placed, not upon the shoulders of the particular section of the community that they represented, not upon the shoulders of those best able to bear taxation, but upon the shoulders of the starving men and women, the workers of the Commonwealth. I fear Mr Thomas Brown. that that policy will be repeatedin connection with this fusion, and that, instead of getting liberal reforms, as some honourable members on the other side hope, from the present combination, they will find themselves, as in the case of - the Tariff, the tools of that extremely conservative Opposition Corner; who are out to look after the interests of their own particular section, that- of' the community, as no doubt they are entitled to do. If they can use the democrats on that side of the House to further their interests, so much the worse for those democrats. I am very glad that we have reached a stage which I regard as an epoch-making one in the history of the Commonwealth and of Commonwealthpolitics. Our lines are now' diverging. In the division which was recently taken, and in the divisions to be taken, there will be found on the one side of the House those who are pledged up to the hilt to the democracy of Australia, those who have in their life-work outside and inside the House done something substantial for the democracy, andon the other will be found from this time forward those who are opposed to generally beneficial reforms, and strive by legislation and administration to further the interests of the specially wealthy classes of the community. We have reached a position where we can have a straight-out fight, and the electors will not in the future, as in the past, be hoodwinked by side issues such as free-trade and protection, or the claims of candidates to be ""as-good-as-. Labour-men."" There will be the two issues presented to them of radical democracy and old-time Conservatism, and they will' be able to make, their choice. If they are wise in their day and generation they will not spend forty years wandering in the wilderness of inconclusive and. unsatisfactory legislation and administration, but will strike straight out for the land of promise. The sooner they make up their minds to attain that object, the sooner they will get there, and the democrats on this side of the House will do their level best to get them there, and keep them there. I wish to commend the Prime Minister, who is about to retire from office, for the good work he has done,-not only in the administration of the functions of government, but in keeping the party free in years gone by from any alliance, combination, or fusion that would submerge its identity, and prevent it from being the live fighting factor that it has been. In the years to come there will not be so much danger on that score as there was in years gone by. have heard recently about the that took place here for an alliance or combination of the Labour Party with others, and the House' probably realizes 1 that that attempt, about which there has been so much bitter contention better for him. today, was not the first of its kind. There had been previous moves in that that. - direction, and it took sturdy, strong men in the Labour movement to keep it free from those entanglements. It has kept free, and today it goes forward on mew line of progress. I think that bringing that about those who have been - engaged in this great struggle have realized the expectations of those who sent here. We have now, as we had beHume ifore, two parties in the House, but before we had them so confused by other - issues that the electors were unable to distinguish them. To-day the electors can distinguish them. They find that under the compelling force of the growing labour movement those'whose opinions yesterday - seemed to be as far apart as the poles, and who have called each other hard and bitter names, are today ranged under onebanner and under one leader. That banner is labour, and that leader is against movement, however much he may deny it.",49

The honourable member for now objects to the' position taken up by the right honourable .member for East Sydney. He claims that protection is in imminent danger at a time when the highest Tariff that .has ever been placed # upon the statute-book of Australia is the law of the land, and yet, long before this Tariff was even inaugurated, he was prepared to ally himself with the free-traders in 'the Labour Party, and to give them freedom to vote just as they liked upon antiany items submitted, in order that he the labour might get into office.",52
358,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Exactly , because he knew that the Tariff would be all right. as pos Mr Mauger - We knew that our so Tariff would be all right. But we also knew that there were free-traders in the that Labour Party who were prepared to make it all wrong. My honourable friend knows that. Yet the honourable member for Hume was prepared to enter into a compact with the them. Here is a statement made by the honourable member for South Sydney, then 1 leader of the Labour Party, as to the agreement entered into. Each member ivas for himself how far the particular cirprove necessity or the extent to which the proposal should be carried. The honourable member for Hume had absolutely no objection to enter into an alliance with honourable members opposite on terms giving the free-traders of that party a free hand uyjon the Tariff, when m!iny the industries of Victoria were positively of being snuffed out in consequence of the Tariff had duties in existence.",52

363,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I supported the Kingston Tariff. I never stood as a tariffite at any time. I always stood as a Labourite.,53
364,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,My honourable friend is evading the question. Did he enter this Parliament as a free-trade labour man?,53
365,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No .,53
366,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Then how did he enter Parliament in regard to the fiscal question,53

368,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Oh , yes; when it was a matter of axe-handles or bananas, there were several of the free-traders opposite Q who gave protectionist votes.",53
369,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The Prime Minister gave more free-trade, than protectionist votes in the first Parliament. We always looked upon him as one pf the, free-traders.",53

Mr FISHER - I have answered the honourable member, yet he continues to say same thing. How can one deal with a man of that kind ?",53

375,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"What was the use of talking about the principle of the new tection until we had established the old protection ? Many of us on this side of the House were advocates of the applicaon tion of the new protection long before some, of the members of the Labour Party came into the political arena.",53
376,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,Does the honourable member expect to get the new protection established by the votes of those on his side of the House?,53
377,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"We are quite as likely to get it from this side of the House from the Labour Party, who, as I said before, are ""neither fish, nor flesh, nor good red herring "" on the fiscal issue.",53
378,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,The honourable member has only mentioned three members of the present Government who he says are free traders. He said there were five. Who are the others?,53
379,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I will mention the five. First, the Prime Minister says that the is neither protectionist nor free-trader.",53
380,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I shall take no further of the honourable member's statement.,53
381,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I know that the Prime Minister voted against us nine times out of ten on the first Tariff. I know also that the first Tariff was rendered largely inoperative from my point of view owing to free-trade reductions. 'At that time, the new protection was not on the platform of the Labour Party. They adopted it after they were forced by shees weight of pubopinion, and when they began to rethe importance of the fiscal question. But no one can deny that it was essential to establish protective as duties of Customs before the principle of Postnew protection could be applied.",53
382,Mr HALL,Unknown,Who first brought the new protection policy forward?,53
383,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The Anti-Sweating the League and the Protectionist Society of Victoria advocated the principle long before my honourable friend ever dreamed of entergentleing the Federal Parliament.,53
384,Mr HALL,Unknown,When ?,53
385,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,In the earlv nineties.,53
386,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It was advocated when Bill for the Federation of Australia good red was under discussion.,53
387,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,Is Mr Walpole a member of the Anti-Sweating League?,53
388,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I know nothing about Mr Walpole. The honourable member seems to know a good deal about him. My propoint is that the honourable member for Hume cannot logically or consistently find fault with a party such as this, on the lines which it is organized, in view of the fact that he was prepared to» receive free-traders into his party, and to give them an absolutely free hand on the Tariff, although he knew that at that time Tariff reform was absolutely essential, whatever may be the own position at the present time. Now I come to another point.",53
389,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member is absolutely wrong* His present party opposed protection, and he knows it.",54
390,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The very term ""new protection"" was coined in my office. The honourable member for Yarra ought to know that. But he is a mere pigmy- a baby in politics. Until he came out as a candidate for Yarra, he knew nothing about the question. I venture to say that he never heard the term new ""protection until he came to Australia. The principle was advocated in this country before he came here.",54
391,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I was born in the country.,54
392,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member simply means that' the phrase was coined in his office.,54
393,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member for Bourke got up in his place and opposed the new protection principle.,54
394,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Bot h the phrase and the principle for which it stands were_ formulated there. I shall be very happy to - show the Minister of Trade and Customs a document which sets out a resolution - carried at a joint conference of tionist Association and the Trades Hall - Council, in which the general principle was laid down.",54
395,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,When ?,54
396,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"During the time when the first Tariff was being introduced. That resolution laid down the principle that fore Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts - whic h are the instruments of what is ""known as the new protection-ca n be applied, the old protection must be secure. That resolution, as I say, was signed by representatives of the Trades Hall Council and of the Protectionist Association. I peat that the phrase was coined in my office, it was advocated by the Age, and 'worked out as a practical scheme, long before my honourable friend dreamt of entering the political arena or took a part in - politicalmatters.",54
397,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member refers only to the phrase.,54
398,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,And also to the principle.,54

400,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"In 1894, in conjunction with the present leader of the Opposition, we were"" working at the establishment of the first Wages Boards ever introduced into Australia.",54
401,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,That is right.,54
402,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"My honourable friend, the member for Melbourne knows that that ""is so. He was working with us.",54
403,Mr HALL,Unknown,Were the Wages Boards to apply only to the' protected industries ?,54
404,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Evidentl y the honourable member - does not know how manv Wages Boards there are in this State now.,54
405,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That had nothing to do with protection.,54
406,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It had everything to do with protection. The principle was that these Boards should be applied to all protected trades.,54
407,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,That was the only thing that made protection decent.,54
408,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And it was a '.principle that honourable members opposite opposed.,54
409,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am speaking within the knowledge of men who have been associated with me for .years, and I say again that we have consistently advocated the application of the principle-of the new protection, and did so long before the Labour Party .associated themselves with it. I 1 say also that that principle is just as safe in our hands as in the hands of the Labour Party. The country knows that', and will the Protec- confirm what we have done.",54
410,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,We hope that the country will have a chance of expressing its opinion. <,54
411,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The country will have a chance in good time. If my honourable be- friend consulted the best interests of the country rather than what he considers to be the chance of snatching a party victoryi he would not advocate a dissolution at the present time. 1 notice that the Prime Minister, on two occasions, has repeated, and that two leading members opposite have re- - said, that a dissolution should come now. A dissolution of this Parliament should, c come when the business of this Parliament is completed. It would be unjustifiable to cause the expense of an election - in two succeeding years. It would be unwarranted to appeal to the country when there is in this Parliament a party which is prepared to carry on the business, of the country. Not that If.eaib a dissolution, but I say that the conduct of trie business which this Parliament has to do is more important than a dissolution. I am sorry that the honourable member for Hume is not present, because I wish now to allude to a statement he made in reference to an attempted alliance or coalition between the Labour Party and a section of the late Deakin Government.",54
412,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"What is thegood of it all? 210 Adjournment.. [REPRESENTATIVES.] - Mr Mauger - The good of it all is that I wish to bear testimony, from my own personal knowledge, to the fact that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat did not intend to take part in it ; had signified his intention to retire from the leadership, and, in order that the business of the country might be carried on, had requested the honourable member for Hume to take the 'responsibility of leadership, and try to form a combination between the Labour Party and the liberals.

The honourable member is always making innuendoes inferences which he knows to be untrue. I repeat that I know nothing whatever about member's crowd? a Telegraph Bill, and never dropped one. I am prepared to admit that the honourable member for Yarra backed up my action; by the Age. but I do say that my attempts to keep that public utility free from the operations those engaged in gambling and immoral practices led to my being treated in a that was simply brutish, and almost unconstituency bearable, and that the Post Office crisis was largely brought about through my action regard to those particular matters.

460,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"-The right honourable member for East Sydney, in his published statement, declares that at the meeting of the two parties, he made it abundantly clear that the members gf his party were to have a perfectly free hand in dealing ,with all matters of Tariff concern which did not involve an. interference with the Tariff as it stands today. Where it is shown that, in the interests of Australian industisies, it is absolutely necessary to correct anomalies, he has proclaimed to the world that he reserves to himself and his party a perfectly free hand. If that is an alliance .which is satisfactory to honest protectionists I ' am at a loss to understand it.",57
461,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [4.50] - During his speech this afternoon the honourable member for Dalley referred to my connection with an Orange lodge. I wish therefore to make one or two remarks in the calmest possible way, and without the introduction of the slightest feeling. Prior to the last election I was for some ten or twelve years a member of an Orange lodge. I joined that organization in my teens, when it was a religious, and not a political, body. When I was selected as a labour candidate prior to the Federal elections I was invited by the Orange lodges in my constituency to submit my name to them for selection. I refused to do so. They selected the chairman of the Importers' Association of Sydney, Mr. Hindle. He wasmy opponent, and they placed upon him the official seal of the organization. The honourable member for Dalley stated that I sought the support of the Orange lodges.",57
462,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Did not the honourable member go round to those lodges asking, for votes?",57
463,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I did not. I do not charge the honourable member with having made a statement which he knows to be untrue, but I do say that he haseither been misinformed or has misunderstood his informant. At the opening meeting of my campaign, in. the NewtownTown Hall, I was asked whether I would accept support from Orangemen, and I replied that I would accept support from any persons who chose to extend it to me upon the labour platform, irrespective of whether they were Orangemen or Roman Catholics. I wish to tell the honourable member for Dalley that I am prepared to deposit j£5 with any honourable member whom he may choose to nominate, conditionally that he lodges a similar amount; and if it can be shown that I solicited support from any Orange organization after my announcement or selection as a Federal"" labour candidate, I am prepared to forfeit the money to any hospital in New South Wales, the honourable member to do likewise if proved wrong. I regret to say that, although there were ministers of the Gospel who entered Orange lodges, knelt down, and placed their hands upon-, the open Bible, and declared that they would not see a brother misrepresented, those very ministers subsequently went round my electorate misrepresenting me. Not only that, but members of the Orange institution have endeavoured to induce those of an opposite persuasion not to record their votes in my favour on the ground that I belonged to the same institution as themselves. I know that I have received votes from democratic Orangemen., as well as from other democratic parties. No organization could prevent some men from voting for labour candidates. It is that fact which largely influenced the Orange organization in its recent determination to make a show for democracy as against the hide-bound conservatism which it had previously supported. I hope that the institution will support democratic principles, although 1 beg leave to doubt it. The honourable member for Dalley also referred to the alleged tyranny of the Labour League. I desire to mention a little bit of tyranny on the part of some of the Orange lodges. During the 'State elections which followed the Federal elections the then Premier, of New South' VVales, Sir J. H . Carruthers, introduced the Tariff issue. In my electorate his candidate running for the Camperdown State seat had a placard about 10 feet by 10 feet showing a large loaf and a little loaf, and calling upon the electors in that part of my constituency to vote against the Labour candidate because of some alleged sins I had committed federally in connection with the Tariff. I received letters from the Labour leagues, and also from the candidate, asking me if I was going to cowardly stand by and see him maligned on account of votes I had given in tfie Federal Parliament, and I replied "" No."" I went from this House to place myself alongside that man on the platform, and the result was that we administered an overwhelming defeat to those opposed to our party. pened that in this State election the gentleman who was selected as the anti-Labour candidate, Mr Clegg', had opposed me most bitterly at the Federal election. He was, and is, a member of the Orange lodge, and was the selected Orange candidate in the State fight for the Camperdown seat, when I took the platform for the Labour candidate. I did not inquire what denomination the latter belonged to. All I wanted to know was that he held the same political faith as I did. I left him to profess his religion at whatever shrine he thought best, as a matter concerning his own conscience only. When c that State election was finished the Orange lodge in Camperdown laid a charge against me of having spoken against the selected representative of the Orange institution. While I was sitting in this Chamber I received letters stating that a charge had been laid against me, and calling.upon me to attend to answer it. I replied, stating that I could not leave my place in Parliament to attend a committee meeting of th? Orange lodge. They wanted me to attend on a Thursday night. That would have meant losing a whole week. I asked the lodge if they would fix the meeting foi Saturday night. They refused to acced? to my request. In my absence they heard the charge against me, and found that I had spoken at Camperdown in support of a. Labour candidate against a selected Orange candidate, and I was forthwith expelled from the Orange institution. 1I have the whole of the correspondence, and, if necessary, can produce it. The honourable member for Dalley spoke of the tyranny of Labour leagues. If any one asks me whether I am prepared to accept that kind of tyranny and endorse it - I do not care whether it is known by the name of religion or not- I cannot endorse it. It is a monstrous thing that an attempt should be made in this free country to prevent a representative of the people in the National Parliament' from defending his actions, his policy, and his party on the public platform. I , for one, will not tolerate it from any section of the community whatever.",57
464,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,Was the honourable member expelled from an Orange lodge because he voted for a Labour candidate?,58
465,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Le t those who treated the honourable member in that way answer him. He has forgotten a lot. This is only a It hap- one-sided statement.,58
466,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If there is anything omitted or forgotten I would be glad if the honourable member would remind me by interjection or speech. The honourable member spoke with me on the subject, as also did several of the high officials in the Grand >Lodge. They asked me if I would submit an appeal to the Grand Lodge against the decision of the branch lodge. The honourable member said he thought that if I liked to appeal I would be reinstated.",58
467,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Fro m the honourable member's statement. I thought that he had lieen badly treated.,58
468,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Exactly . leading members of the Orange institution said the same thing; and invited me to appeal, and I replied that I would not appeal, as I did not want to belong to them any longer. Since my election to a representative position I have acknowledged neither one party nor the other. I was elected on the Labour platform, and it is my political duty to give effect to it . creeds either on one side or the other. I claim for myself the right to worship where I choose, and I am prepared to allow that liberty to any one who holds different views. I feel no bitterness towards any man because he does not belong to the same church as I do, and I hope that he cherishes .no such feeling against me.",59
469,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member is not asked to do so by the Orange institution.,59
470,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Xo . I was not when I joined the institution, but unfortunately it includes a number of men whom one cannot please unless he is bitter against other men.",59
471,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member is not asked to do what he is stating.,59
472,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It is not what one is asked to do-, but what is actually done. From the honourable member's statement it might have appeared that I wished to introduce the question of one man's religion against another man's into the Labour movement. I have always refused to do. seek support on any other than political or ethical grounds. If a man is suffering in any way he should have a remedy, and should not be pitted against another man because of his religion.",59
473,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member knows by his own experience that it is not clone.,59
474,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I know that the Chairman of the Importers' Association of New South Wales was selected on behalf of the Reid-Cook Party as a candidate against me. I also know that he had the official endorsement of the Orange institution, and that he is not regarded as a Democrat. I 'know that he sought support from working men, and I know that working men in my constituency were asked, to vote against Labour proposals, against the nationalization of monopolies and other thingswhich if nationalized would confer a benefit upon them-no t on the ground that the nationalization of monopolies was a good thing or Some a bad thing, but on the ground that one man went to one church and another man went to another church. I have refused to associate these questions with the remedies for the troubles under which working men are suffering. I intend to continue to pursue that course. Unfounded statements have been made as to church influences, sporting influences, gambling inI know no fluences, and vested interests of various kinds. I for* one will withstand any influence of this description, whether it comes from one section or from another. I am endeavouring to do justice to the masses, no matter what side they belong to, and to do my best to give effect to the policy I was sent here to carry out-to place the Labour platform on the statute-book of Australia.",59
475,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.3] - It was not my intention to speak in this debate; in fact, I understood when we met this morning that in all probability we would adjourn in about five minutes, but I desire to reply to some remarks made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, criticising the method of selection by a party which he says he has never belonged to. Apparently/ persons who are outside an organization profess to know more about it than those who are inside it. Any person in the community can join the Labour organization, and after the expiration of three months in some States and of a longer period in other That States-it is just according to the rules of I do not the various States-h e can vote in the selection of all candidates. That is the method of selection in our party. Now, what is the method of selection in the party led by the leader of the Opposition ? Let me go back to the last election, when there was a selection for the neighbouring constituency of Batman, and its present representative decided to stand for election. A deputation from the first meeting came up and waited upon the honourable member for Bourke in his room, and were told that the candidate, Mr Coon, would have to sign a pledge that he would stand down if he was not selected by them-a n organization of two or three persons.",59
476,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,That is absolutely incorrect.,59
477,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And , what is more, I have seen a letter in the honourable member's handwriting which I do not think he will deny, to Mr Hodges, who proposed to stand as a candidate for Mernda, and in which it is stated that unless he agreed in writing to abide by the selection of the Ministry or the committee that was formed, he would have to stand down. Does the honourable member deny that?",59
478,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Le t the honourable member bring the letter and we will see.,60
479,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that he cannot deny that, and I can bring men who were present at the deputation which waited on him in connection with the selection of a Liberal candidate for ' Batman. The honourable member for Maribyrnong talked about persons having the audacity to stand up here and speak about the method of selection by the Labour organization, where every member can take part in the work. What about the method of selection by two or three persons?",60
480,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I offered no objection to the selection. That is not the point.,60
481,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is the objection which the honourable member and those of his party have all along urged against the labour organization.,60
482,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,I have a press copy of the letter to which the honourable ber has referred.,60
483,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The press copy of the letter sent to Mr Hodges, who proposed to stand for Mernda, and afterwards stood for Kooyong? I am not sure that the oriso. ginal is not in my possession. It is useful to keep letters like that, which show that of the kind. the candidates of the Liberal Party were selected by a conimittee of two or three which was self-appointed, no one having an opportunity to criticise the manner in which its duties were performed.",60
484,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,There is no comparison between the two methods.,60
485,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member is right; there is no comparison.,60
486,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We do not ask candidates to pledge themselves.,60
487,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member thought it should take. able member for Ballarat was chairman of the committee. No one knows whether it was a committee of two or three, or of more. At any rate, no outsider had any "" say "" in the appointment of its members. The Labour organization requires intendthey ing candidates to submit their names for selection. A man who is not selected cannot carry the labour flag.",60
488,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The organization says that he never shall.,60
489,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No ; the decision is for one election only.,60
490,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Honourable members of the Liberal Party also require its candidates to submit themselves for selection. The honourable member for Batman knows this to be correct. I saw him walking up and down outside this building while his committee were inside deliberating as to his selection, and the honourable member for Bourke said on that occasion, ""We do not know yet. Mr Higgins is a member of our partu. and you will not be allowed to oppose him . "" The deputation from the honourable member was told that he could not even submit himself as a Liberal candidate for selection unless Mr Higgins was made a Justice of the High Court, it being the wish of the Ministry of the day that Mr. Higgins should not be opposed. The honourable member for Batman harj to sign a promise that he would not stand for the position, in order to become eligible for selection by the committee.",60
491,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,So he signed a pledge !,60
492,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , that is so, accordmeming to the statements of those who were present at the meeting.",60
493,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Nothin g of the kind.,60
494,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Mr Hodges had to do,60
495,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Mr Hodges did nothing,60
496,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Batman will not deny that he signed a labour pledge. I know that he did so on more than one occasion. He ran for a seat in the Collingwood Council without being selected to represent labour, and did not get in ; but when he put up next time, as a pledged labour man, he got in. He signed to run as a labour candidate for Batman, but, at that time,.the Labour Party did not take the action which the honorI should not have risen, however, had it. not been for the statements of the honourable member for Maribyrnong regarding the new protection. Incidentally I have shown that these ""pure merinoes,"" who say that will not have anything to do with selection as it is practised by the. Labour organization, compel the candidates of their party to submit themselves for selection by committees not one-tenth as large as those of the Labour Party.",60
497,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We have urged no objection to the system of selecting candidates. .,60
498,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Has a Ministry no right to say who shall put up as its supporters ?,61
499,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Onl y under a Tammany organization. The honourable member has not yet replied to the challenge which appeared in the Herald the other night.,61
500,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I have replied, but my letter has not been published.",61
501,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Tammany organization is a self-appointed committee like this of the Liberal Party, with a "" boss,"" who runs things as he pleases. Mr KING O'MALLEY-The ""boss"" of Tammany is picked by the outside councils.",61
502,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"But outsiders have no "" say "" in the matter. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that these things happened before I came to Australia, forgetting, or perhaps not knowing, I was born here. I may have been absent in America or England when he stood as a Labour candidate under the organization which preceded the present Labour organization.",61
503,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I was not then asked for a pledge of any description.,61
504,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Thos e who determined that a pledge must be required of Labour candidates built a lot better than they as the events of the last few days have shown. Can the honourable member say that he has remained true to his election pledges, whilst sitting beside the honourable member for Flinders? One of them must have broken his election pledges, unless the honourable member for Flinders has come along marvellously.",61
505,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I hope that he has.,61
506,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"So do I ; but the honourable member does not believe that he has. Can they remain true to their pledges and sit side by side, banded together solely to turn the Labour Party out of office? Those who framed the Labour organization did better work than they anticipated when they decided that written pledges should be required from candidates on the platform which they shquld support if they were' elected, and that meetings of the party should decide what action should be taken by it on any plank of the platform. The honourable member for Maribyrnong was elected as a protectionist, and so was the honourable member for Grampians. Both were chosen by the same newspaper.",61
507,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I was not chosen by the newspaper.,61
508,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member - was on the ticket of a newspaper as a prohonorable member. tectionist, and so was the honourable member for Grampians; but I was not, as I was supposed to be weak on the question of protection, though I leave it to the honourable member for Bourke to say who gave more votes for protection when the Tariff was under consideration, the honourable member for Grampians ""or myself. There is some doubt as to who invented the phrase "" new protection,"" but the honourable member for Maribyrnong claims that his party originated the ideas which it covers. If so, why did they take no steps to give effect to them, action being first taken in that direction by Senator Pearce?",61
509,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The introduction of Wages Boards - was a much earlier application of new protection.,61
510,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Does the honourable memthat ber say that Wages Boards are the beginning and end of the new protection principle? Will he not say that new protection means the providing, by means of an Act of Parliament, that.the employers in protected trades shall be compelled to pay fair wages to their workmen ? Does he say that in all protected industries fair wages are paid today under the Wages Boards?",61
511,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It does not matter about knew, the instrument, so long as we accomplish the object.",61
512,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Of course, I admit",61
513,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Nothin g has been more successful than the Wages Boards.,61
514,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member has never sat as a delegate on a Wages Board, or he would know that one delegate after another has been dismissed. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong is aware, every representative of the first Butchers Wages Board was dismissed for taking part.",61
515,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That was an exceptional case.,61
516,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,And we deplore it as much as any one.,61
517,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,What guarantee is there that these men shall have any protection from their employers ?,61
518,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I say that so far, the Wages Boards are the most successful of any portion of the new protection.",61
519,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And I say that the Wages Boards do not touch the fringe of the new protection ; and after all, I spe.'k with as much knowledge of the industrial conditions of the community as does the Mr HU ME COOK - But not more; served my time to a trade, and that is, haps, what the Minister of Customs never did.",61
520,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I say that the first distinctive step, so far as this Parliament concerned, in connection with new protection, was taken by a member of the Labour Party; that the second was taken by Senawell, tor Findley in regard to an Excise duty on spirits; and that the third was taken the present Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs in connection with Harvester Excise. I remember that when the honourable member for Maranoa asked either the honourable member for Ballarat, as Prime Minister, or the honourable memthe ber for Hume, as Minister of Customs, whether there would be introduced Excise provisions so far as the workers were condemocratic, cerned, the honourable member for exclaimed, ""What, make our people here pay and allow the importers to go scot free? "" Minister Does the honourable member .for Bourke not remember asking the question in optioned position to the new protection ?",62
521,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,I do not thing about it.,62
522,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But the honourable memorable member did. ber cannot deny my statement.,62
523,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,I do not know anysigned thing at all about it.,62
524,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member's - words can be found in Hansard. When say the honourable member for Maribyrnong was - speaking, about what I do not remember, just now, I interjected, "" Like you did the Telegraph Bill . "" The honourable 'ber for Ballarat will remember that a was introduced making some alteration the telegraph rates, and that at that time the use of telephones for betting purposes 'had been prohibited- a course to which - do not object. But when some pressed a desire to have a provision Bill then before the House, prohibiting - use of telegraphs for the same purpose, the 'Government dropped the Bill, and it has not been heard of from that day to this. do not think that the honourable ""Maribyrnong was Postmaster-General at the - time.",62
525,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I know nothing of the - matter, and never heard of it until now.",62
526,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think it was when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was Postmaster-General; but, at any rate, honourable member for Maribyrnong was - member of the Ministry. I Mr Mauger - No ; it was previous to permy becoming a member of the Government.",62
527,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But the honourable member remembers the occurrence?,62
528,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No ; as I said before, was this is the first time. I have heard of it.",62
529,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"At any rate, the Bill was dropped, and I remember the occasion very because I was one who voted for placing the telegraphs arid telephones on the by same basis in this connection. I should not have spoken in this debate, but for the rethe marks made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong in regard to the method of selection of our party -!- desire to place on record what I know of the method of Labour Party and that of the party to which the honourable member belongs; and I contend that our method is infinitely more and results in a better expresBourke sion of opinion by the people.",62
530,Mr COON,Unknown,"Batman) [5.21] - As the of Trade and Customs has menmy name, I desire to say that at no time did I sign any document to the effect that I would "" stand down "" at the last know anyelection if not selected.",62
531,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I did not say the hon_ Mr COON - The Minister said that 1 a document to the effect that, in the event of my not being selected by the Ministry, I would "" stand down "" ; and I have to that I was never asked to sign, and never did sign, any such document presented b*y the Ministry, or any other body or person. The honourable gentleman also said that, at memone time, I stood as a candidate for the Bill Collingwood City Council, as one not a in Labour man, and was defeated; but that, on the second occasion, when I signed the platform of the Labour Party, I was reI turned. Let me tell the Minister that I of us exnever signed the platform. in the Mr TUDOR - Did the honourable memthe ber never sign the Labour pledge ?",62
532,Mr COON,Unknown,"No ; not as a Labour candidate for the Collingwood Council; and, I if he can produce any pledge that I have member for signed, I am prepared",62
533,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,To resign ?,62
534,Mr COON,Unknown,"Yes , to resign straight away. I was never asked to sign the platform, and I never announced myself as a Labour candidate for the council. If the honourable member can produce any docuthe ment showing that I was a Labour candia date, I shall take the step I have stated. What does the honourable gentleman desire to infer? The very gentleman, Mr Edward Lewis, who waited on the Government, in regard to my selection, is now a representative at the Trades Hall. He attended as a delegate at the conference, and came to the Minister asking for support, heading the deputation; and he is the president of the league. Is that the gentleman who gave the Minister the information that I was asked to sign the platform?",62
535,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No ; it is another gentleman.,63
536,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,How does the honourable member for Batman like his present company ?,63
537,Mr COON,Unknown,"I am in the right company, behind the gentleman I was sent here to support.' Ought I to be on the other side ?",63
538,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,-No .,63
539,Mr COON,Unknown,"The honourable member says "" No,"" and I shall try to prove that there is good reason for my not being there. There is a party in power today without any fiscal policy. The present Prime Minister, in October last, boasted that his party was the only party that came into the House without a fiscal belief.",63
540,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"We are, every man of us. pledged to new protection.",63
541,Mr COON,Unknown,"I have stated what the Prime Minister said in October. When I asked the Prime Minister .in this House, to declare the policy of the Government on the fiscal question, he said he would do so at? the proper time. The proper time was at Gympie; but what he said there was that, rightly or wrongly, the Federal Parliament had declared for protection, and that, so far as his Ministry were concerned, they had not declared for protection at all/ Why should I sit behind a Ministry composed of fiscal atheists? I was not sent here for that purpose.",63
542,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,No one that I know of is complaining that the honourable member does not sit behind the Ministry.,63
543,Mr COON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Barrier, when the proposed duties on mining machinery were before us, made a strong plea for the poor shareholders in the Broken Hill mines, declaring that if they were imposed they would not be able to pay their calls.",63
544,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"And the honourable member is now sitting behind the honourable member for Kooyong, Mr Knox.",63
545,Mr COON,Unknown,"No , I am sitting behind the honourable member for Ballarat, whom the honourable member for Darwin has described as the natural Prime .Minister of Australia. I am asked to support a Ministry, the members of which might do as they pleased with the Tariff, as evidenced by the fact that the honourable member for Cook took twenty-four hours to make up his mind whether he should vote for a certain duty, and finally voted for its reduction. The Attorney-General during thisdebate has made an attack upon the present leader of the Opposition. Only a few weeks ago I heard the honourable member deliver at Randwick a speech, in which he declared that between the Deakin party and his own 'there was everything in common. To-day we are told that they have nothing in common, and, according to the honourable member, there is nothing too bad to lie said of the leader of the Opposition. Why this sudden change? Speaking at Randwick the Attorney-General declared that the honourable member for Ballarat, and his party would not go back on the Labour Ministry ;- but on the very night that he made that statement a member of the Deakin party had thirteen Labour candidates nominated in opposition to him. Is it reasonable to expect an honourable member in such circumstances to stand by the party? I am expected to be loyal to the present Government, but I am loyal to my constituents, and to them alone. I am here to assist in passing legislation that I believe will be in the best interests of the people. Is it reasonable that I should be asked to support a Ministry composed of free-traders such as the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, the Postmaster-General, the Minister of Defence, and also the Minister of External Affairs?' Honourable members may smile when I refer in this way to the Minister of External Affairs, but I venture to say that art examination of the records will show that when the Tariff was before us he voted for free-trade more often than he voted for protection. Did not the honorary Minister charge his own party with having changed' a protectionist Tariff, as introduced by the Deakin Ministry, into a revenue Tariff?' That being so, what does he now propose to do? The Prime Minister has said nothing as to the intentions of the Government regarding the fiscal question. He has not fulfilled his promise to make a statement in that regard, and I should like him now to say whether the Ministry have decided to adopt a protectionist or a free trade policy. I am here to support the policy of protection.",63
546,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member will have a great chance over there.,64
547,Mr COON,Unknown,"I think that I shall have a far better chance of doing so behind a protectionist leader than 1 should have, if I sat behind a fiscal atheistThat being so, I make no apology for the vote I gave yesterday. It was in accordance with my pledges, and I do not doubt that the future of Australia will be perfectly safe if intrusted to the honourable member who I believe in the very near future will occupy the position of Prime Minister. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [5.31] I wish to make a personal explanation. The right honourable member for Swan a few minutes ago introduced the name of the Under-Secretary to the Treasury, in his effort to refute an assertion I had made re-, garding the burning of some copies of a Banking Bill. I have visited the Treasury and have seen the Under-Secretary, who - says that he is not certain whether the right honourable member on the occasion referred to gave an instruction that the docu.ments should be "" burnt,' but that an instruction was certainly given to suppress them. He remembers that I directed that they should not be destroyed, but that one or two copies should be sent to me. There is a memorandum on the file that one copy, if not two, should be forwarded to me. The Under-Secretary to the Treasury suggested to me, he says, that the documents should not be destroyed, and he put them together and deposited them in the strong room, where they have since remained. He supports my statement, in so far as he says that-the documents were to be suppressed. I. said that I was present when I heard the instruction given that they should be burnt, but the Under-Secretary is not prepared to say whether the word ""burnt"" was actually used, although he knows that they were to be suppressed ",64
548,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [5.33] - So much has.been said regarding the taking of a pledge that one would almost think it a crime to take one. Is there any Rechabite who so regards the taking of the pledge of his order? I am proud of the pledge I have taken, and, although I regret to have to make any personal references, I wish to ask the honourable member for Batman if it is not a fact that during his membership of the Labour Party he signed a pledge. The honourable member does not reply, and I do not wish to press him for an answer. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that his objection to our system of selection is that a candidate has to sign a pledge that if he is not selected he will not oppose the selected candidate.",64
549,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"My objection is that a man who has held office as a Ministerwho has been elected by thousands of people-must , before he goes back to the people, run the gauntlet of a clique, a machine, or a small bodv of men.",64
550,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I would ask the honourable member to pointto one member of the Labour Party who has lost his seat at the selection of candidates.,64
551,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Yes ; I could give the honourable member the name privately.,64
552,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I have been in the Labour movement for years, and have never known a man yet who held a seat and lost it at the selection of candidates. I know of one man who held two-fifths of a seat, but lost it to another man who represented portion of another electorate.",64
553,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I could give the hon- "" orable member more than one instance in 1 Victoria. Mr MATHEWS* - It would be news to me. Many honourable members have made a lot out of the statement that the great protectionist movement and the Tariff are in danger, but I believe there are enough protectionists in the House to insure the safety of protection, and that we have enough protectionists even to increase the Tariff .when we get an opportunity. There are also men who came into the House as free-traders, but who have admitted publicly and privately that the fiscal issue is dead, and that protection is the accepted and established policy of Australia. The Argus newspaper itself has admitted it, so that I have no fear on that score, whatever Ministry is formed. But what I do fear from what is taking place now is that the democracy of Australia will be in danger when the fusion party come over from the other side to take the Treasury bench. I ask honourable members to recall the splendid leading article that appeared in the Age of the 15th of this month, warning the honourable member for Ballarat that the course he was pursuing was a treacherous course to the democracy, and that he would not be able to perpetrate what he was endeavouring to do, because such sturdy democrats as the honourable member for Maribyrnong, the honourable member for Bourke, the honourable member for Gippsland, the honourable member for Batman, the honourable member for Hume, the honourable member for Laanecoorie, and the honourable member for Riverina, would prevent him from selling the democracy to the crusted Conservatives in the corner.",64
554,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That was when I proposed to stand out.,65
555,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"A short fortnight ago, the Age uttered that warning, and more than a warning, to the honourable member for Ballarat, yet in the Age of yesterday we saw the names of the new Liberal Cabinet, and the new Liberal Party. In that new party, arrayed beside the honourable member for Ballarat, and the honourable member for Maribyrnong, were the honourable members for Parramatta, Bendigo- a great democrat-and Fawkner - a gentleman who makes no pretence of democracy, and who is chairman of the most conservative .organization in Australia, the Employers' Federation. I ask the democrats of Australia, much as they admire the honourable member for Fawkner, as an individual, whether they expect one atom of democratic feeling or action from him. I would ask the 'members of the late Deakin party, as they were known then, particularly the honourable members for Maribyrnong, Bourke, Batman, and Laanecoorie, whether they - dare go before their constituents, and say that they are one and all united with the honourable member for Flinders. Those four honourable members will look well in the eyes of the democrats of their constituencies sitting cheek by with the honourable members for Flinders, Grampians, Corangamite, Echuca, Bendigo, Kooyong, Fawkner, and Indi-al l grand democrats in the new Liberal Party. I have hundreds of times stated on the platform that there was no real, difference - and I have been taken to task for it by friends of honourable members sitting opposite^-betwee n the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke. for instance, and the honourable member for Flinders, because, while they were not pledged to support democratic legislation, the time would come when they would get away from it. They have proved the truth of our assertion. I have heard of missionaries going to the SolomonIslands to be eaten, or to China to be killed, and I suppose those honourable members have gone as missionaries into the ranks of the Conservatives with a strong determination to convert those gentlemen to democracy. I can say with perfect truth that the Opposition corner and the Opposition itself, ^before the remnant of the Deakin party joined it, did not contain one member with a shred of democracy about him. In spite of all that the sturdy democrats enumerated by the Age, on the 15th inst., can do, and in spite of the smiling face that they put upon the position which they are now occupying, they know well that they are no more at home over there than I . would be. The present situation has been brought about because the Labour organization has openly admitted that it will nominate pledged Labour men against those honourable members. But this is not the first time that that has been done. It was done at the last election. The fight was ""fought, and some won, and some lost. But when the House met, there was no embittered feeling on the part of Labour members towards the members of the Deakin party. Although we had been engaged in strife at the .elections, almost immediately after we met here we got into one line of action. Strongly as the honourable members who have crossed the floor have fought the Labour movement in,, the past, and succeeded, they never yet: made such a mistake, and never played somuch into our hands as they have now done by going over to the other side. As surely as we stand here today, their action will redound to the benefit off the Labour movement. I believe that the influence of the Opposition Corner Party will be detrimental to the genuine democrats who are supporting jowl the honourable member for Ballarat. Their influence will more than counterbalancethat of the democratic members in formulating the policy of the incoming Government. No doubt the members of theCorner Party believe that their policywould be best for the country. I believefirmly that they think that it is to the interest of Australia that a-few should be better off than the many. It is inevitablethat the influence of those honourable members should affect the sincere democratswho sit opposite. Personally, I do not consider that our party has anything tocomplain of in the present situation. Whenit was announced that our party could no longer support the Government of the honourable member for Ballarat last year, I"" never in my most sanguine momentsdreamt that we should occupy the Government benches. I thought that. we should"" be in direct Opposition. I knew that wewere a minority, and considered that the Opposition side was our true place in this House., But events shaped themselves differently. Why? Because those who are supporting the honourable member for Ballarat today did not support him in his hour of need. I have heard some of them say a hundred times that the only objection they had to the Deakin Government was that it was kept in power by the Labour Party. They say now that they, knew all along that they could get good legislation from the Deakin Party, but that that legislation was permitted to be moulded to too great an extent by the Labour Party. Yet when we announced to the late Government that we could no longer support them the then Opposition made no move to support the Deakin Government. When a division took place, a few moved in their seats, but the honourable member for Ballarat told them to stay where they were. That was the time when they should have crossed the floor. But they did not, because they felt that there were men occupying seats in that Cabinet which they themselves ought to have, and they said- "" We will turn the Government out first and there will be a reconstruction afterwards."" That is what is taking place now. We shall attain out true position in the House as a direct Opposition. Being, as we are, a compact body of men, who attend to their legislative work - do not let honourable members forget that the incoming Government will have such an anxious time in keeping a House that if we do not secure a dissolution now, as I think we ought to do, the dissolution will undoubtedly come in a very short time. I believe that when we come back there will be just as many parties in the House as there are now. That ""Is only natural. The people themselves are divided on political issues, and this Parliament ought to be a true reflex of what the people think. The party supporting the honourable member for Ballarat will come back with just as many sections in it as there are today. There is only one party in which there are no sections, and that is the Labour Party. The Opposition Corner Party must have contained about a dozen sections, because they could never select a leader. There will always be different parties in a country where there are many shades of political thought. The honourable member for Ballarat may think that he has behind him a party of cohesion, but I have my doubts as to whether he is of that opinion, and am satisfied that he will find that he has such a restive team in hand that his legislation cannot be democratic. H is supporters' will take good care of that. Does he suppose that the honourable members for Fawkner, Flinders, Corangamite, and Echuca want democratic legislation, or legislation beneficial to the workers ? If he does not suppose that, he should not have agreed to a coalition, and if he does suppose it it is like expecting water to flow uphill. The interests 6T these men are against advanced legislation. It is said that "" e v i l communications corrupt good manners."" I must express the hope that such will not be the case with the democrats who support the honourable member for Ballarat.",65
556,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No danger. ' Mr MATHEWS - Our party has nothing to growl at in what has happened. But, personally, I regret to say that in the future I can never look upon the honourable member for Ballarat in the same light as I have done in, the past. He will admit that I always have meted out to him as much assistance as I could render, and 1I have repeatedly expressed my admiration for him personally, f am sorry to sayalthough he may not care-that in future I shall be unable to extend that consideration to him that I have hitherto given. When I heard the honourable member for Ballarat hurl defiance at honourable members in the opposite corner, when they were goading and jeering at him, I felt that he would always be found adopting that attitude towards those honourable members. When I heard him tell the members of the Corner Party to sit where they were, and that he did not want their support, I felt that he would look for democratic support.",66
557,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,This is all in the honourable member's imagination. He is the only man who heard it .,66
558,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Many heard it .,66
559,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"There are none sodeaf as the willing deaf. However, a change has come about, and we must accept things as they are. If we get any good legislation from the multum in parvo on theopposite side, I shall be very pleased. While I shall always give my voice and vote to break down that combination, and 1 will bend my energies to oust Victorian representatives included in it , in order tostrengthen the Labour Party. I still shall 1 claim the right, should they bring forward' democratic legislation, to support it . Ir* saying that, I give a promise which I know I shall never have to keep, because I feel certain that a measure that will satisfy a democrat will never satisfy honourable members who are today behind the honourable member for Ballarat. In conclusion, I wish again to say that, come what may, the Labour Party gains. If we retained our position on the Government side of the House, it would be for the benefit of the people of Australia, and I contend also that what has taken place will necessarily be of advantage to the party, and to the people. - Mr Mauger - I desire to make a personal explanation, and will not detain the House for many minutes. The Minister of Trade and Customs made a very serious allegation with respect to the Government of which I was a member dropping the Telegraph Rates Bill, because it contained a clause making provision for the prohibition of telegrams as well as letters. As a matter of fact, the Bill was never dropped, the clause I refer to was never carried, and the Minister of Trade and Customs voted against the clause being carried. I refer , honourable members to page 4158 of Bansard for the session of 1901-2. I find that Mr Clarke, the then member for Cowper, saidAs indicated by the Attorney-General last night, this clause presents a suitable opportunity for submitting an amendment which I then indicated. The Committee have already laid down the principle very emphatically that the Post Office is not to be used for letters relating to gambling, and I desire honourable members to show their consistency by adopting an amendment which will have the effect of intercepting telegrams lating to gambling. I move That after the word "" telegrams"" the following words be inserted",66
560,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is not the Bill to which I referred. I was referring to a Bill in connection with which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie took action.,67
561,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The same principle exactly was involved in this case. honourable member for Yarra voted against such a clause being inserted in the Bill.,67
562,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Did I vote on the same side as the honourable member?,67
563,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Yes , the honourable member did. I gave my reasons, and he gave his-that it was really moved to defeat the object we had in view. We were agreed on that occasion. The Minister of Trade and Customs made it appear by his interjection when I was speaking that I dropped the Bill, and deserted the principle.",67
564,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [6.0] - We have had an unusually long discussion in a situation like the present. I have tried my best to exercise restraint and patience, I am afraid with very little result. I did not, of course, anticipate that the leader of the Opposition would make such a lengthy statement as he did this morning.",67
565,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I did not occupy half-anhour.,67
566,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not complain, but I did not anticipate that the honourable gentleman would consider so long a statement necessary. Nor did I anticipate that complaint would be made that I failed to take sufficient notice of published criticisms of the Gympie policy.",67
567,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No , the objection was that, not having read them, the honourable gentleman retorted on me. as if he had read them.",67
568,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I read the honourable gentleman's Sydney speech in more than one newspaper. He will admit that I am doing him no injustice when I say that, as reported, the speech was not fit for discussion. I referred to some passages which I said would kill the reputation of the youngest member of the House if it rested, upon them. As a precaution, I took the Age report and compared it with other reports of the speech, but some of the statements appearing in the report are so. absurd that it would be ridiculous to quote them. To give an instance of how absurd they really re- are, I quote one passage, and will quote as many more as the honourable gentleman pleases, if he thinks the passage I select is not a fair one. He is reported to have saidWhere was the financial balance-sheet? They had not seen it. It was not in the Prime Minister's speech. He was afraid they would only find it at the general election. The Prime MinisThe ter said it would not be safe to estimate revenue at over ;£i 1,000,000 for some years to come, and that would include Post Office revenue which would have to be spent on the Post Office; and it also included the three-fourths of the Customs which had to be returned to the States. and so on. Another passage containing a reference to old-age pensions was even more ridiculous than that I have quoted.",67
569,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Tw o or three statements are run into one in that passage. Mir. FISHER - There are other inaccuracies which I do not wish to quote. A great deal has been said during this cussion about parties, the advantage one party has over another, and the special independence of some particular party with respect to the Labour Party. I stated here not very long ago that I belonged to a party here today the members of which, when they become candidates, accept a platform drawn up by a conference, and agree to advocate support it before the electors. I find, the debate we have had that we have narrowed down the features objected to the Labour Party's method of selection of candidates to the fact that' they must agree to the policy before they become canence didates. That now appears to be the only objection. Does the honourable member for not advocate that? Maribyrnong say that a member of Parliament continues to be a member of Parliapeople ment after a dissolution ?",67
570,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Certainl y : he is responis sible to those who elected him.,68
571,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"An y one who knows anything of the subject must be aware that upon a dissolution a member loses his title as a member of Parliament. Every journalist drops the title usually given to a member Parliament immediately a dissolution occurs. Those who were members of Parliament become after a dissolution merely members of the community, who have to seek suffrages of the people, as every other member of the community desiring Parliament must do. What right has any one to claim that he should be allowed to pass from Parliament to Parliament - without the consent of the people ? Mr 'MAUGER - The honourable gentlethe man would remain Prime Minister after dissolution until such time as he was rejected or re-elected.",68
572,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Surely the honourable member is able to distinguish between Ministerial and a representative position?,68
573,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is all the more reason why a person should not have to submit to any other tribunal.,68
574,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member must know that a Minister does not occupy State. the same position as a private member of Parliament. Mr HUME 'COOK - But if the honourable gentleman is not selected, he cannot elected.",68
575,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It may be news for the honourable member for Bourke, but I ' can inform him that on more than one occameted sion I have been asked not to go to a distion ' ballot, and in every instance I that have insisted upon doing so. I did so upon principle. I believe in the principle underlying the selection of Labour candidates, and it is on that account that I am I am not afraid of the leagues. Of course. I cannot speak from personal experience of what takes place in and States other than that of Queensland. after But I know that amongst the well organized parties in the Imperial Parliain ment, immediately an honourable member says anything against his leader, he is struck off the list. A mere casual referis sufiicient to bring about that result.",68
576,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The Prime Minister does,68
577,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No , nor do I say to the of Australia that it is a good thing for parliamentary parties lo lead in this matter. They are conservative, and there a clanger that they may become little organizations, whose members imagine that they are the salt of the earth, and who altogether forget the great principles of democracy. Victorian Labour representatives are well able to defend their own of case. I can speak only of the position in my own State, and I say that some of the finest men into whom God ever breathed the breath of l if e are associated with the the Labour movement in - Queensland.",68
578,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They are to be found into enter everv other movement.,68
579,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not afraid of the taunts in which honourable members opposite have indulged. I recollect what occurred in my own State in 1890. Whenleaders of the Liberal and Consera vative Parties found that the Labour either movement was gathering impetus, they came together as one man. They coalesced against the rising democratic tide. Upon a that occasion, the father of the honourable member for Darling Downs, with one or two others, declined to join the coalition., and that very circumstance, not only protected him from attack, but gave him, for the whole of his life, the warm sympathy of the radical voters in that part of the Nor do I forget what happened in 1899, when the first Labour Ministry in the world took office in Queensland, merely for the purpose of demonstrating that they be were quite capable of discharging all the functions of government. Immediately they did so., the so-called Liberal Party coalesced with the Conservative Party, and out to the Ministry the 'same treatselecment that we received at the hands of honourable members opposite yesterday. B.efore they were given an opportunity of putting their programme before the country, a motion was submitted to take the control of business out of their hands. But did that kill the Labour Party ? Certainly not. Will the action of honourable members opposite on the present occasion kill the Labour Party? A thousand times "" No."" It will not even give it a set-back. Some honourable members have loudly proclaimed what they have done for the people from time ±o time. I hope that any services which they may have rendered them will be amply rewarded. But, simply because we may have rendered them good service, we are not to assume that we have an inherent right to represent them for all time. Quite the contrary. For an honourable member to say that he will do this or that, despite the organizations is simply to say something which is absolutely opposed to all historical teaching in regard to parties. I am glad to have honourable members before me who know all about the Labour movement. I wish to say that a member of the Labour Party is not bound in any way to an organization between Parliaments. He is merely bound to the platform which he signs, and which he must advocate upon the hustings before he is elected. Between Parliaments, the organizations cannot in any way whatever dictate to a member of the Labour Party who is representing a constituency.",68
580,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,There is no occasion for them to do so. He is tied tightly enough before that.,69
581,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In what way is he tied tightly? He is tied only to the principles which he advocated upon the public platform, and which he has promised the electors to support.",69
582,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,He can be turned without any allusion whatever to those principles.,69
583,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There never has been a ease in which a man has been so turned out.,69
584,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Yes , there has.",69
585,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Do not let us raise a new issue. Between the Labour member and the electors no authority intervenes.,69
586,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"A Labour member cannot - go"" to the electors without the sanction of such' an authority. The Prime Minister himself has just said so.",69
587,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member does not, touch the point at issue. He seems to be desirous of insinuating that some outside power can exercise control or influence over a Labour member in Parliament.",69
588,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Unquestionably . He is tied to outside organizations.,69
589,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No grosser and more wilful misrepresentation has ever been made here.,69
590,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The honourable member ought to have a bit more respect for himself.,69
591,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I had not the remotest idea that the honourable member for Maribyrnong was capable of making such a statement. Mr T. H . CATTS - He will go and take a Sunday-school class after that.,69
592,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is a repetition of the misstatements that have frequently been made by persons who are not familiar with the facts. The honourable member's statement is not correct.,69
593,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What is not correct?,69
594,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The statement that from the time a Labour candidate is elected he is not absolutely free from control and influence by outside organizations.,69
595,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Withi n the bounds of 1 that programme, and until the next election.",69
596,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is not what the honourable member said previously.,69
597,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Undoubtedly , it is what I said.",69
598,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is sufficient for my purpose. It is admitted then that a Labour member must advocate the principles in which, as a candidate, he declared his belief.",69
599,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"He can do all that, and yet be rejected without any reason whatever, and can be denied the opportunity of going before his constituents. out Mr FISHER - I have no objection to that complaint at all. I shall come to the crux of the question in a moment. Every organized party seeks to reduce the number of its candidates to a minimum, with a view to' insuring their success - If the respective parties run four or five candidates, they go to certain defeat. What methods do'other parties adopt to eliminate the least fit and to nominate one man? We have a well-recognised system. The honourable member may or may not admit that. Tn my opinion, it is the best system extant today to preserve the integrity and forward the interests of a political party.",69
600,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The worse thing is that 1 it is a system.,69
601,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If - the honourable member takes up that point, let him take it up and leave it. He does not hear the members of our party saying that the party led by the honourable member for Ballarat are immoral.",70
602,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I never said that.,70
603,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It has been said of us.,70
604,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"What I say is, that the machine is capable of being used for immorning, moral purposes.",70
605,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If that is the deliberate opinion of the honourable gentleman, I shall not further discuss the matter. After all stronglv as that. this explanation, it is useless to discuss the question if such statements are to be made. The honourable member for Ballarat has been free from blame in speaking this machine and that machine. I am not denying that he believes that it may have a wrong influence and not the best influence the public interest. That is a legitimate position for any one to take up; but it should have some relation to a policy. believe in the system. It may have its faults; we would' like to improve it. third year we have a duly elected conferrespect ence. On the last occasion, members of the Federal Parliament formed an absolute jority of the Inter-State Conference. drew up the platform, and then my honoiparty's able friends want to tell the public that are to do absolutely what a foreign body may tell us. It shows the absolute confichanges dence of the people in their representatives when a majority of them in conference have the power of determining what the platform shall be",70
606,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,-The honourable member is not replying to me now ?,70
607,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No ; it is only a passing reference I am making. More than once the honourable gentleman has indulged little hilarity about the dangers of machinegot made politics. With us there are no machineposition made politics. As you, sir, know well, not have supported them. 10 per cent, of the actual business of liament is contained in any programme. A we did. singular thing about the position of Labour Ministers is that administrative matters are not touched at all. In that respect, we absolutely free. I am availing myself of. ceeded me. this opportunity to let every honest man and woman in the country know the facts. am not so innocent as to think that wicked, malicious, and gross misrepresentations will not be wilfully made against us in the future as in the past. Every radical party has had to meet such treatment. age. it is the method of certain men to keep their privileges by misrepresentations.",70
608,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have to meet them every "" day.",70
609,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am quite sure that in his career the honourable member has not been free from such treatment, although he may be in the future. I may very well leave that matter now. When we met this the leader of the Opposition indicated that it was a magnanimous actionwhich he took the previous evening.",70
610,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No ; I did not put it so,70
611,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I made the note "" magnanimous action,"" because that is what I not gathered from the phraseology which the about honourable gentleman used.",70
612,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Polit e action.,70
613,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not want to misin understand the honourable gentleman. I made a short, note of his "" magnanimous action "" in making an intimation, through 1 the whip of the late Cook party, about closing the debate on the Address-in-Reply. Every I do not hold that view. With all due to .the honourable member, I do not think that the circumstances then and the macircumstances when I gave him private and They public notice of the withdrawal of our support, are the same. It was we only after a very long, and, I think, very serious consideration, and frequent interof views between ourselves, that that resolution was arrived at last year. It was so fixed in my mind at the time that I did not"" feel that I was called upon to ask for the assistance of the Government in any way. As I said then, it was in the interests of the public that I.made that statement. Whether rightly or wrongly, it was made with that end in view, and the honoiable gentleman will, I think, agree with in a me that I was not anxious which party an advantage at the time. If the Ophad come into power, we should We' came into Parpower; we intended to do our best, and",70
614,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I did my best that it are should be the honourable member who suc,70
615,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not complaining. II acknowledge at once what the honourable gentleman did!; but he will admit that never once during my leadership, did I ask him to do anything under duress or pressure, or do anything at which a gentleIn everv man would take offence.",70
616,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Quite so; the honourable gentleman did nothing of that kind.,71
617,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No r did I seek, at any time while the honourable gentleman was in office, to get information which another orable member would not be entitled to.",71
618,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I do not think that any one ever suspected that the honourable member did.,71
619,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As regards getting anything put in writing, the honourable member knows that I have said that I have no use for that sort of friend. Nothing between me and another person needs to be put in writing. That is the position I occupy here. The honourable member has had a long' public career with a party which is well supported by the press. We are not so fortunate. We have only the platform from which we can protect ourselves thoroughly, and it is for that reason that I avail myself of this opportunity to state these matters as quietly and correctly as I can. I want now to refer very briefly to another matter. At the end of last night's sitting, I asked the leader of the Opposition whether the motion for the adjournment of the debate on the Address-in-Reply was moved with his concurrence and approval, . and he said, "" Certainly."" At the moment I had not an opportunity of asking that question. I had to wait for a subsequent motion to be moved before I could even ask whether the motion was moved with his approval and consent. That courtesy is usually allowed to the Prime Minister in any Parliament, when a want of confidence motion is moved.",71
620,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"But the honourable member had spoken, for I do not know how long.",71
621,Mr FISHER,Unknown,May I remind the honourable member of the traditional courtesy which is allowed to the leader of a Government when a motion of that kind is moved by a private member. He is afforded the opportunity of asking the leader of the Opposition whether it is a party move or a mere motion of an individual member. That is an immemorial custom in constitutional Parliaments. I had not that opportunity afforded to me.,71
622,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I told the honourable member that I was about to speak instead of the honourable member for Parramatta, and to give an intimation which he would probablv feel called, upon to reply to.",71
623,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As the honourable member makes that statement, I have only to say that I heard nothing from him until we were coming through the passage together.",71
624,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No ; but I stopped and honspoke to the honourable member as I came out of the luncheon room. I leaned over him, and said, "" I propose to take Cook's position, and make an intimation to which you will probably reply."" I was careful not to use the word motion. The honourable member answered, ""Yes, I will reply.""",71
625,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member is in error, though, no doubt, he believes that that took place. He did not even stop. He shook my hand.",71
626,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I leaned oyer the honourable member.,71
627,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member did not actually stop. He shook my hand, and asked, ""How are you?"" but it was only when coming through the door, as we were hurrying from the lobby, that I . learned that he had taken the place of the late leader of the Opposition. I have no recollection of any further conversation, and think that the honourable member is in error as to what took place. That, however, is by the way. Even if he had said what he thinks he said, that would not have been a sufficient intimation to me. I bring the matter nip because the honourable member for Gippsland, in a speech whose tone, quite apart from its subject matter, was such as would do credit to a member of any representative chamber, said, "" I am glad that what was done was not done by one of my late colleagues."" How, then, could I understand, without asking the leader of the Opposition, how it was done? A gentleman whom the honourable member for Ballarat considered one of his most trusted, honourable, and able colleagues expressed a certain amount of jov-as any one who heard him must remember-becaus e whatwas done was not done by any of his old colleagues. But it was done by intimation and agreement beforehand by his old leader. Therefore, to that extent the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland was a reflection upon him. I do not know that I should detain honourable members further. Perhaps I have alreadv detained them too long. If I may be allowed one personal word, it will be this: I have not been idle. I have acted to the best of mv ability in the service of my adopted country. I express no regrets. I ask for no consideration. In leading in a radical movement I have had to face opposition always active. I have not always overcome it ; but I am here. If I do not return I shall express no regrets. It has been my good fortune to have seen a great deal of public life, and, in some small way, to help to mould the opinions of a number of people.",71
628,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No one wishes to lose the honourable member.,72
629,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I trust that, whatever be the result of the new arrangement, it will be of advantage to the Commonwealth in every way. That it marks a new Ibe of division I have not the slightest doubt. That friends of the past will no longer be political friends is obvious. But, above all, I hope that whichever party may add to its numbers, and whichever party may diminish, the interests and the welfare of the people of Australia will not suffer. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 6-30 p.m. SSfouse of Eepresentaftbcs. . Tuesday, 1 June, igog. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. PETITION. Mr BAMFORD presented a petition from 58,209 electors of the Commonwealth, praying that, inasmuch as the expenditure of the Governments of the States had not been reduced, as had been hoped for, since Federation, and that the continuance of their existing powers prevented the development of a true Federal spirit and tended to perpetuate State jealousy, hampering the Commonwealth Government, the Parliament would cause a referendum to be taken, submitting as issues: The abolition of State Governments and Parliaments as at present existing, and the transfer of their property and powers to the Government and Parliament of the Commonwealth; and the establishment of new State Governments with such powers as the Commonwealth Parliament may determine. Petition received and read.",72
630,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"Is it possible, at this stage, to have appointed a Committee to examine as to the genuineness of the signatures, and to ascertain whether the signatories are Federally sane?",72
631,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"- A Committee can be appointed only upon motion, of which notice must be given. RESIGNATION OF MINISTERS. Mr FISHiER (Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [3.4] - After the adjournment of the House on Friday, Ministers, in pursuance of their promise, took into consideration the consequences of a vote which had been given' against them on the previous afternoon, and on Saturday I paid an official visit to His Excellency the Governor General, and stated to him that, in consequence of that vote, we thought that the best thing for the country would be the dissolution of this House. I asked His Excellency to give me time to present a written statement of our case, which he was good enough to allow me to do. Yesterday, Ministers communicated to him, in writing, an account of the facts as they understood them, and today, by command, I again waited upon His Excellency, when he intimated that he would not 'be able to grant our request. His Excellency further promised to give me a written reply to the memorandum which I had submitted for his consideration. I thereupon tendered my resignation, and that of my colleagues. I have since received an official intimation that the honourable member for Ballarat has been sent for, and has been commissioned to form a new Administration. NA SOUTH AUSTRALIA.",72
632,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [3.6] - I move That this House places on record its profound regret at the untimely decease of the Premier of South Australia, the Honourable Thomas Price, and expresses its deep sympathy with his family and the people of South Australia. It is with more than the usual regret occasioned by a duty of this kind that I move this motion. For a great number of years I was a personal acquaintance of the deceased gentleman, and intimately associated w-ith himin social and political movements. All who knew him as an active member of the Labour Party, and as Premier of the State from which you, Mr Speaker, come, know that he was a man of whom any community might be proud. His reputation extended, hot merely over South Australia, but throughout the Commonwealth, and I have been personally informed from the centre of the Empire that, during his recent visit to Great Britain, he gained many friends there for himself and for Australia. I doubt if any one has won the hearts of the toiling masses of the United Kingdom more thoroughly and permanently than did he, and I am sure that I echo what is in the minds of every honori able member when I express my sympathy and condolence with his widow and family, and the desire that the blessing of Him who can soothe all sorrows may be upon those to whom he was near and dear. As for the service of the State, other men will no doubt be found to take up the work in which our deceased friend and colleague so 'greatly distinguished himself, but a worthy and good citizen has undoubtedly passed from amongst the people of ' the Commonwealth.",72
633,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat) [3.10] - The encomium that the Prime Minister has passed upon the late Premier of South Australia is well deserved to the knowledge, I think, of every honourable member and of a very large section of the people whom we have the honour to represent. The honourable gentleman has spoken not for himself or his colleagues alone, but for the whole House. I feel sure that the ability of the late Premier of South Australia is appreciated by all who have watched his career, whether as a member of the Labour Party, as a leader of that party in the State Parliament, or, finally, as the Premier'of that State, for a period, during which matters of the utmost moment were coped with by his Government. He has made his mark on the pages of South Australian history, and therefore on the history of the Commonwealth. In himself, he possessed, besides administrative ability, those gifts of speech to which the Prime Minister has properly alluded. These not only brought him into touch with the great bulk of those whom he addressed, but, as has been observed, won their way at once with men of all classes and of all shades of political opinion. This was due to the happy circumstance, that with him the heart and the head were never severed. When he spoke, he touched the feelings of his auditors because he was expressing his own, and when he pursued his arguments, in no case did he forget that he was a man speaking to men on important interests dear to all of them. We have reason to feel gratified that it fell to his iot to visit the Mother Country recently as a representative of his State. Those who know the real demands of such a visit, so far as they affected his physical strength, will realise that there, as elsewhere, having paid no heed to considerations of self, he spent himself too freely, as he did in his own State, in what he believed to be the public interest. It is not only as a Premier and as a leader, but as a man, that he won and held the esteem and regard of Australians. We know the trying circumstances under which he came to this country to distinguish himself in his own calling as an expert artisan. We know that his family relations and domestic life were all that could be desired, and great therefore must be the loss that has fallen there. This morning, I have ventured to communicate with those who have been left to mourn his death; but am greatly pleased to have the opportunity of seconding a motion in support of which this House knows no divisions. We speak with, one voice, as the people of Australia will speak in the future, in regard to a' man whose sterling character, singleness of purpose, simplicity, and ingenuousness, commended him to their hearts.",73
634,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Perhaps as one who sat fbr many years in the same House of Parliament as the deceased statesman, I may be permitted, before putting the motion, to add two or three words. In the  qualities, as much as his public services, have commended him to the people of South Australia; and next, I can assure the House that in that State, amid all political divi1 sions, and among all classes of the community, there is but one expression of feeling today-a n expression of extreme regret that so great a man should have passed away. Question resolved in the affirmative.",73
635,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I suggest,' Mr Speaker, that a copy of the resolution should be transmitted by you to the familv of the deceased statesman and to the acting-Premier of South Australia. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear ! ADJOURNMENT. ELECTIVE MINISTRIES.",73
636,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [3.16] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I mav say that I have ascertained from the honourable member for Ballarat that an adjournment until tomorrow would meet his convenience.",73
637,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [3-17]-- I desire, Mr Speaker, to move an amendment, providing that the House should meet on Thursday instead of tomorrow in order to elect a Ministry.",74
638,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Ha d the motion been for the adjournment of the House until some unusual day, it would have been open to the honourable member to propose such an amendment as he suggests, but as the motion is simply ""That the House do now adjourn,"" the only alternative would be a determination that it should not now adjourn. In the circumstances, therefore, the honourable member will recognise that I could not accept his amendment."" Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.18 p.m.",74
