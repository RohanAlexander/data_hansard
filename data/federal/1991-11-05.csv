1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Unemployment Dr HEWSONI direct my question to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Prime Minister admitted that Mr Keating's run for the leadership was 'off-putting to some extent'. I ask: is it not a fact that he has been totally cupied with the Keating threat, and that the only thing he has done for the unemployed in the last 18 months is to add to their number?",12
2,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer to the first part of the question is obviously no.,12
3,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,12
4,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If those opposite do not understand the English language, that is their trouble. They say that I have been preoccupied. Mr Speaker, as you and any discerning member of this Parliament would observe, I have been engaged within the Cabinet, outside the Cabinet, within this country and overseas on a range of activities calculated to pursue the best interests of this country. On the question of what I have done for employment in this country, I would contrast my record with that of the Leader of the Opposition any day. It is the case that we have averaged an employment creation rate in this country of 177,000 per year in our period of office, which is almost exactly three times the rate of employment creation under the Opposition parties when they were in government, advised by the now Leader of the Opposition. Raw Material Processing",12
5,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can he advise the House what action is being taken to get further raw material processing under way in Australia? How important a contribution does raw material processing make to Australia's export potential?,12
6,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can indicate that today the Government has announced some important new initiatives to ensure that value adding and resource development projects will increase in this country. What we have announced is that a new process has been developed whereby we have built upon initiatives announced in the March economic statement. That statement established two mechanisms: the subcommittee of Cabinet to look at sectoral initiatives, and the major projects group of Cabinet. What we have developed is a proactive approach to industry development which is preoc- based on sound business opportunitiesinvestment opportunities that come to the Government but are not proceeding because either the necessary facilitation does not exist or there are impediments that the Government is capable of addressing. It links that industry initiative, the sound investment proposal, into government, and sets a time scale against which the appropriate industry Ministerdepending on the nature of the proposalneeds to report back to the structural adjustment committee of Cabinet within 45 days. The Government today announced two examples based upon this process: one which will ensure the ability of this country to retain and develop the technology associated with the building of a magnesium metal industry in this country, and the other for the advancement of a mineral sands deposit. There will be more to come. The approach involves an addressing of sensibly identified impediments and, where necessary, facilitation has to be undertaken by the Government either in accessing existing programs or in making the necessary linkages which for the time being are not occurring. As an adjunct to this, during the discussion last night it was also recognised that there was a need for the Government to come forward with a more effective means of streamlining the approval mechanisms for these projects. My colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and I will be putting forward such a proposal in the not too distant future. In conclusion, this Government is committed to the expansion of productive activity in this country, particularly based on our resource industries, be they agriculture, forestry or mining. It is commitment to the expansion of those activities that lead to net export growth because new job opportunities will flow from that. This initiative announced today is an important element in ensuring that that program will be implemented. Commonwealth-State Financial Reform",12
7,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer him to his comments about the process of reform for Commonwealth-State relations when he said: We must not allow the overall thrust to be lost in a mire of bickering and intransigence. Is this not an accurate description of what has happened to the Commonwealth-State financial reform since the ex-Treasurer gave his speech to the National Press Club?,13
8,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Delivery of Health Services to Rural Communities,13
9,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Can the Minister inform the House what the Government is doing to improve the delivery of health services to mral and remote communities?",13
10,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One ought, firstly, to acknowledge that there are quite serious difficulties-and sometimes increasing difficultiesin providing s-rvices to rural communities, especially remote communities. That is reflected in a number of ways. It is reflected particularly in the absence of professionals, particularly doctors, in the more remote communities. But even in less remote rural communities often the full range of services is not provided. Indeed, where services are provided they are often make-do services rather than being entirely appropriate for the purpose. For example, in many of the hospitals in rural areas quite a high proportion of the patients are there not because they are particularly ill but because their admittance is seen to be an appropriate response to peoples' need for care, although that care might be more effectively provided in a nursing home or hostel, or even more effectively provided in the home. The honourable member for Page asked what the Government was doing about the delivery of health services to rural communities. In 1989 the Government announced a package of over $6m to provide for multipurpose centres in rural areas; that is, the Government thought that through these centres it would be able to make a contribution so that even bush hospitals might better be replaced with facilities that included components of other programs. Through the process involving Commonwealth-State relations and particularly meetings of Health and Aged Care Ministers it was agreed in April of this year that a multipurpose funding task force should be established to look at the issue of providin- better services in rural areas. That task force, which is soon to release a report, suggests that it would be possible to develop quite different and more flexible funding arrangements to provide better ser. vices for rural areas. It particularly puts forward the suggestion of pooling so that the funds the Commonwealth might contribute, whether in the form of Medicare, pharmaceutical funds, nursing homes or hostels, or what the State might spend on hospitals and community nursing, might be pooled. Out of those pooled funds it might be possible to develop more appropriate service models in rural areas. By this approach we would be able to use the funds more effectively and achieve much greater efficiency in a situation in which it is quite often difficult to provide the service efficiently, and we would be able to provide a service that gives much greater user satisfaction. The honourable member for Page asked a very serious question, which the Commonwealth has been concerned about. We are piloting more multipurpose centres. I have written to State Ministers indicating our willingness to do that. Through the Premiers Conference process the concept of pooling might enable us to achieve more radical reform that, incidentally, could only be achieved on the basis of Medicare. Medicare provides a universal basis to enable funding transfers and to enable aÂ· construction of diff-rent models that are more appropriate and would be more appropriate in rural situations. The honourable member's question is an important one that the Government has been pursuing and will pursue in the future. Premiers Conference",13
11,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does the Prime Minister agree with the Premier of Western Australia that the goals of the Premiers Conference have 'been railroaded in the Caucus yesterday'?,14
12,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Export Performance,14
13,Dr CHARLESWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to a claim made by the Leader of the Opposition in a speech on 31 October that Australia today is 15 per cent less competitive than it was in 1982-83? Is this claim accurate? What is the level of Australia's export performance? Is that performance improving?,14
14,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen the Opposition Leader's speech. It reads: On the Treasury's own index of competitiveness, today we are 15 per cent less competitive than we were in 1982-83 when the Hawke Government came to office. The first reason, a failure on economic grounds. He goes on to blame the accord and a supposed veto power exercised by the officials of the ACTU on major reforms. This is frightening stuff. I checked the Treasury's indexes of competitiveness to see how our economic policy has performed on competitiveness. These are the indices of unit labour costs and prices adjusted for exchange rate changes. On a CPI basis they declined by 13.8 per cent between 1982-83 and 1990-91, on a unit labour cost basis by 17.3 per cent and on a GOP deflator basis by 15.6 per cent. Here it is. Mr Snowdon-He just got the plus and minus wrong.",14
15,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right. If the Leader of the Opposition had examined the notes describing the data he would have found that a rise implies a deterioration and a fall, an improvement in competitiveness. Let me explain the problem for the Professor. In other words, the competitive situation is the opposite of what the Leader of the Opposition has asserted. Competitiveness has improved by 13.8 per cent, 15.6 per cent or 17.3 per cent over the period, depending on the measure used. It has not deteriorated. The conclusion we can draw from that is not failure but success. Mr Sharp-If this is success, heaven help us.",14
16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore!,14
17,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the degree that the Leader of the Opposition attributes these figures to be a consequence of the accord and the ACTU's influence on reform, he is wrong about the direction of that, too. The Professor could not read a Treasury table. He got it wrong. Media Concentration",14
18,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Prime Minister explain the Government's current policy on media concentration? Does the Government's policy reflect the view recently stated by Mr ' Kerry Packer, that the public does not give a damn who owns the Fairfax newspapers? Or does the Government's policy reflect the petition to the Prime Minister from a majority of the members of this House and the Senate expressing concern at further concentration of media ownership?",14
19,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me say that neither Mr Packer nor anyone else outside the Government speaks for the Government on the question of its policy in this area. Mr Connolly-What about Mr Barron?,14
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bradfield will cease interjecting.,14
21,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, this Whole question of the media concentration and the ownership of Fairfax is centred very much on the Tourang bid. Let me make some observations, as I think the honourable gentleman would want me to, on that particular central aspect of the issue of media concentration. First of all, any discussion of increased, concentration of media control as a result of the Tourang bid for Fairfax being successful is, of course, at this stage entirely premature. There is nothing before the Government at this stage. As I think the honourable gentleman will know, the receivers are still to make their recommendation to the consortium of banks on which of the bids best meets the interests of the banks. Of course, it is the case that, should that bid nominated by the receivers include foreign equity. it would be subject to consideration by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which would then make a recommendation based on an assessment of the national interest to the Treasurer, who would then make the final decision on whether or not to allow that purchase to proceed. So that is the state of play. The Treasurer has already indicated that he would consult with his colleagues before making his decision. I know that this would also be of interest to the honourable gentleman: on the question of control, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is currently investigating the circumstances of the Tourang bid to establish whether there is any possibility of an extension of control. Ifand I underline 'if'-the Tourang bid were successful, and if it were to establish control over the operations of the Fairfax group by  be in breach of the Broadcasting Act and would be obliged to divest. That is the situation we are confronted with; those are the elements that are taking place. At this stage, obviously we are in a hypothetical situation. For instance, if the Melbourne bid-the AIN bid-were to be successful and recommended by the receiver, there is no question, as I understand it, of foreign ownership being involved. The matter arises, as I say, if there were to be that recommendation. Those are the processes that are to be followed. The Foreign Investment Review Board looks at the test in terms of national interest and makes a recommendation to the Treasurer. He would be consulting with us and we would be making a judgment in terms of what we believe was in the national interest. I would say that, in making a judgment about that, I would not regard as unimportant the petition that was put before us. Magnesium Metal Extraction",14
22,Mr COURTICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Can the Minister advise the House what action is being taken to develop Australia's magnesium industry and how important that industry is to Australia's exports?,15
23,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The decision announced earlier today follows endorsement by Cabinet of a joint submission from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Resources and me and an expression of support from the Queensland Government. The decision was taken in the context of exciting prospects for magnesium metal. I quote briefly from the statement: Magnesium is the lightest of all structural metals. World demand is expected to increase significantly over the next decade because of the metal's light weight, high strength and recyclability. The international demand for magnesium metal will be enhanced by the increasingly stringent emission regulations for motor vehicles in the United States and Japan. These will require the development of lighter motor vehicles with much greater use of light materials such as magnesium metal. The. decision addressed an impediment in the form of an R&D gap of some $25m. The decision will allow a pilot plant to be constructed at Giadstone, costing $55m, paid for through a private sector contribution of $30m, with $5m from the Queensland Government and $20m from the Commonwealth in the form of a loan through CSIRO repayable through royalties. It will allow work to proceed at Gladstone on the extraction of magnesium metal from ore obtained from the Krinwarara deposit, which I understand is the world's largest' high purity deposit of magnesite. It will provide the opportunity for the development of an Australian extraction technology and will further allow the partners to proceed with the construction of a commercial plant in 1995. I point out to the House some of the very exciting value adding prospects that exist in this industry. If one were simply to dig up the ore 'and export it, one would receive $60 per tonne. But extraction of the metal yields a product worth $4,000 a tonne. That is before one considers the possibilities which exist in the development of alloys and in the manufacture of automotive parts. The Government, through its decision, is laying the foundations for an exciting new Australian industry based on the commercialisation of Australian research and development. It follows a long history of involvement by CSIRO-and a long history of involvement and enthusiastic support from the honourable member for Hinkler and his colleague the honourable member for Capricornia. Commonwealth-State Financial Relations",15
24,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that in July 1990 at the National Press Club he said on the issue of financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States: ... there was a very very positive approach from the States. In other words, they accept the sincerity of what we're about. Now that the Government has ruled out giving the States income taxing powers, a guaranteed share of Federal revenue and excise revenue, what has happened in the last two weeks to persuade the Commonwealth to scuttle these proposals and why did the Government, in apparent sincerity, put them on the table in the first place if it always intended to oppose them?",16
25,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The situation is very clear. Mr MCGauran-Yes, Paul rolled you; that's how clear it is.",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I,16
27,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable gentleman had followed all of the processes, he would not have asked the question in the form he has. Back in 1990, we approached the Premiers about getting a closer and more effective working relationship, particularly as we were moving to the edge, as it were, of what we were able to do in our own constitutional bailiwick about micro-economic reform and we were going to have to deal with the States in areas such as road, rail and electricity. As we moved to talk to the States about those issues, they wanted to have on the agenda the issue of financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and that was perfectly proper. What we set going at the October meeting last year in Brisbane was a series of studies to examine the range of options that could be available for consideration by the Commonwealth and the States at future meetings. A great deal of work has been done by the officials from the Commonwealth Treasury and from the treasuries of the States and the Territories, and we very much appreciate that. When this issue was discussed in Brisbane there were certain indications given by myself and the then Treasurer as to the parameters of concern, that we were not going to be doing anything which would prejudice the discharge of the responsibility that the Commonwealth properly has in conducting the macroeconomic policy of this country. That is on the record. In the context of certain considerations having been put up in recent weeks about what we might or might not do, I made it clear in my discussions with my Caucus colleagues yesterday that, so far as the granting of income taxing powers to the States is concerned, I would not regard that as being on. Obviously they may want to talk about it, but as far as I am concerned not only is it not on but also, as far as I know, it is not something that recommends itself to the States. I certainly have not received any indication from the States at all that they would want to have State income taxing powers. May I say, parenthetically, that they would be out of their collective cotton-picking minds if they chose to have it, I would have thought. Nevertheless, I have made the situation clear and I do not think there will be any issue raised between us because I do not think they will be asking for those powers. Mr Downer-What about the share of revenue?",16
28,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable gentleman waits his tum I will remember his questions because, like him, they are not very complicated; they are pretty simple. Mr Downer-Not as transparently dishonest as you. Mr Snow-Withdraw! Mr Hand-Withdraw!",16
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory! Mr Downer-You can dish it out but you can't take it back.,17
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,17
31,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In regard to the suggestion that the States might have a share of the Commonwealth imposed taxation revenue, I have made it quite clear-and indeed it is also made clear in the voluminous report from the officials-that it has to be understood in regard to the concept of the States taking a given share that it runs counter to what is the theoretical underpinning of their concern about vertical fiscal imbalance. The concept of the concern about vertical fiscal imbalance is, simply put, that there is this gap between the responsibility that the government has, the State government in this case, for the raising of its revenue vis-a-vis the responsibility that it has for spending. So the concept of reducing the vertical fiscal imbalance involves trying to get a closer equation between the responsibility that a particular level of government has for raising revenue and the proportion that it has to spend. Of course, by definition it follows in those circumstances that, if the State government were to be given a particular share of our revenue which it had no hand in the raising of, or in the determination of the raising of it, this would run counter to that basic principle. This is what I said yesterday, and this is what I believe to be the case. On that basis, prima facie, we would not favour that approach. All I can say is that I have before me no proposal at this stage from the States. If the States want to put a proposal which may in part have this concept of sharing, we would look at that because we have had these options on the table for consideration. The States' people have been involved; it is partly their document which is before us as well as that of the Commonwealth. What I did with my colleagues yesterday, and what I did with the States through the publication of my view, was make it clear that there is that significant theoretical problem as well as a practical problem in some respects regarding the concept of sharing. Mr Downer-What about excise revenue?",17
32,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This 100-page document, which has been prepared by the officials, deals with that in some detail. Without going to all the confidentiality of that report, let me say to the honourable member that these issues are pointed out in that report. I am quite happy to share it with the honourable member; he shows an interest in it. First of all, if he wants to put it on the basis of looking at possible advantages--and this is a theoretical exposition by the officials who examined it-I think the honourable member would recognise as being the fact in Australia today that this confusion exists by virtue of the fact that the Commonwealth, through section 90 of the Constitution, as of course the honourable member would know, because he has it at his fingertips, has exclusive powers over excise. As the honourable member also knows, from his legal knowledge, in regard to excise we have this grey area where we have sort of franchise fees of the States which are quasiexcise in their nature. I point out to the honourable gentleman that the report says that there are some difficulties and confusion existing between the Commonwealth's excise powers and these quasi-excise powers that are exercised by the States in terms of franchise fees. It points out that there could conceptually be some advantages in having one area responsible for the imposition of these fees. On the other hand, the report points out-and it follows from what I have said already-that there is considerable legal complexity about the possibility of any change of powers from the Commonwealth to the States in this area. Mr Reith-You have confused yourself.",17
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,17
34,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The representatives of the Commonwealth and the States, who have had infinitely more to do with this than the honourable member will ever understand, do not believe that the exercise or the time taken has been wasted. If he later has the opportunity, of which I hope he will avail himself, of reading the report, he will see that it has been far from a wasted exercise. It is a very useful document. I believe it can still form the basis of a useful and constructive dialogue and discussion between the Commonwealth and the States. Waterfront Reform",17
35,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Minister for Transport and Communications seen reports claiming that no structural reform has taken place on the Australian waterfront? Are these claims accurate? What progress has been made on waterfront reform? Mr BEAZLEYI have seen a couple of these reports, largely emanating from the honourable member for Gilmore, in which he manages, in the face of all the evidence, to make the usual Opposition assertion that there has been no progress in that area. What underlies that is dismay that the objectives put in place by this Government some time ago in pursuing waterfront reform have been achieved and the results, in terms of productivity, have been improvements in excess of what we anticipated. I might go to some of that detail. Unlike the honourable member for Gilmore, at least there are some people, particularly in the media, who have chosen to analyse these facts and have found their conclusions to be the same as the Government's and not his. The fact is that in major ports around Australia the old industry wide pooled labour system has been replaced by company based employment, and the supporting structures are being dismantled. More than 2,250 older, less skilled employees have accepted early retirement from the industry, in addition to 760 employees who have left the industry by natural attrition. This represents a 30 per cent cut in the work force. There has been extensive award restructuring, consolidating some 20 awards and agreements into a single stevedoring industry award. A multitude of labour categories and pay rates under the old awards have been replaced by a seven-level skills based classification system. Union coverage is undergoing a majorationalisation with the aim of a single union representing waterfront and seagoing employees. Already seven unions covering the stevedoring work force have been reduced to three. Employers are reporting productivity improvements of up to 80 per cent and are aiming for consistent performance levels with overseas ports. For example, Conaust advises of productivity gains of up to 80 per cent at its Sydney CTAL container terminal, and truck turnaround time is commonly just 15 minutes, which is 100 per cent better than the target in its enterprise agreement of 30 minutes. Strang Patrick stevedoring also reports an 80 per cent lift in productivity at its Melbourne operation from handling an average of 12 to 13 containers per crane hour to an average of 22, which is better than comparable performances in major European ports. Indeed, Peter Roberts in an article a couple of days ago in the Australian Financial Review pointed out these statistics. The following crane hour figures compare the rate of lifting containers from medium sized cellular container vessels at comparable ports: Port Melbourne, 22; Felixstowe, 19.7; Hamburg, 27.4; Bremerhaven, 21.0; Zeebrugge, 19.5; Le Havre, 19.3. What we clearly see from that is that, on the waterfront, we are now not just up to but exceeding performances in most of those European ports. Mr Sharp interjecting",18
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore will cease interjecting.,18
37,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those ports have very substantial advantages over this country in the volumes that they have to move, their ready access to other systems of transport and the competitive position that they are in. In respect of those negotiations, because of the distribution of authority in this portfolio, my involvement has been only sporadic. But the Prime Minister has been actively engaged in the negotiations, as has Senator Collins. The changes that they have achieved in their continued dialogue with the union movement and the employers concerned have produced the biggest turnaround ever in productivity on the Australian waterfront. As a result of that, they have achieved international best practice on the Australian waterfront.",18
38,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, rubbish. That is rubbish. Mr Sharp-You are kidding yourself.",18
39,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What do we have from those opposite? What is the Opposition's strategy on the waterfront? What is its solution? It is to put in the troops. That is the Opposition's solution. 'We do not conduct negotiations; we think with our blood', say our opponents on the other side of the House. If I can paraphrase Goebbels, as far as the Opposition spokesmen on this matter are concerned, it is: 'When I hear the word ""waterfront"", I reach for my gun'. That is the view of the Opposition. I think it was Himmler, not Goebbels. He said, 'When 1 hear the word ""culture"", I reach for my gun'. Of course, through that process the Opposition would create nothing but industrial chaos.",19
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",19
41,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sit down, Kim.",19
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, some months ago, on a point of order from the Government side, you obliged me to withdraw an analogy referring to Goebbels in relation to the honourable member for Blaxland and other members of the Government. Am I to asswne that that ruling no longer obtains? ",19
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think that the honourable member for Bennelong is drawing a bit of a long bow.,19
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not; it is a double standard.",19
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left will calm down for a moment. The honourable Minister might use less inflammatory language.,19
47,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think the honourable member remotely resembles Goebbels, and I withdraw it in so far as it gives him offence, but he does have some philosophical problems when it comes to dealing with the waterfront.",19
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you withdraw.",19
49,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition interjected 'Nonsense' when I said that we were achieving levels of internationally best practice. That was his point of view. He can rock on down to Melbourne or Sydney and have an argument with Richard Setchell. He can do something useful for a change. He can actually go and talk to someone in industry somewhere. Mr Sharp interjectingMll SPEAKER-Orderl If the honourable member for Gilmore continues to interject, I will name him.",19
50,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He should do that, instead of tapping away at his computer and heckling the Prime Minister persistently across the table as he does. He might include in his discussions a bit of a chat with Richard Setche]l of Conaust. When asked precisely that question, Richard Setchell had this to say: I believe that we will produce an internationally competitive waterfront by the end of this year ... Increases in productivity we expect will be in the region of 60-100% ... But by the end of this year I think we will have put to bed a lot of the sceptics criticism about not being an internationally competitive waterfront. Honourable members should not argue with me; they should just rock on down to Me]bourne or Sydney and have an argument with Richard Setchell about that. They should do some useful consulting around Australian industry instead of trying to stick on all these services a consumption tax of 8, 10, 15, 22 per cent-whatever it is. Commonwealth-State Financial Relations",19
51,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister has, in his last answer, systematically ruled out all the major financial options for reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations, does he agree with the Premier of Western Australia that he needs to reassert his position and that the gains to be had from the Special Premiers Conference cannot be sacrificed in the interests of temporary politics?",19
52,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the shadow Treasurer, who I know has difficulties in the area of economics and finance, began to understand what has happened in this area, he would discover that the premise of his question does not exist. Not everything has been ruled out. As I have said, I will be interested to hear what specific proposals the Premiers want to put to us. It seemed to me appropriate in regard to certain egregious propositions that had been talked about, and given the prominence which they did not intrinsically deserve, that my position should be made clear. It is still entirely open for the Premiers to put their proposals to us and we will consider them. From the very beginning, as I said I think in the first answer I gave today, we put, if you like, parameters of caution upon what should be contemplated. I would be surprised if those opposite would not share those parameters of concern and caution with us because, obviously in this modem day world, the national government of this country has got to be able to be sure that it can have available to it, as far as possible within the constitutional framework within which we operate, the capacity to discharge its responsibilities for the conduct of macro-economic policy. That was put on the table in October of 1990; it remains relevant. However, as I make clear, I am hoping that the Premiers will have some specific proposals to put to us. If they do, what I have made clear will happen is that the Treasurer and I will discuss those matters with the Premiers and the Chief Ministers at the Special Premiers Conference in Perth at the end of this month and, if there is a specific proposal that they want us to bring back and consider, then that will come back and it will be considered through the processes of my Party and my Government.",19
53,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What is the Government's response to the conclusion of an agreement for a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia?,20
54,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question. It covers a very important subject.,20
55,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What was the question? We could not hear it.,20
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,20
57,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: we could not hear the question. Obviously the Prime Minister understands what it is.",20
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question was not to the honourable member for O'Connor, so he has no need to hear it.",20
59,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question concerned Cambodia and the Government's response to the conclusion of the comprehensive agreement in regard to that country. As I was about to say, firstly, I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question. It is the case, Mr Speaker, as you well knowI know of your concern in this issue-that for more than a decade the tragedy of Cambodia has been one of the world's most disturbing humanitarian issues. In addition to that, it has been one of OUf region's most urgent strategic problems. It has had that fundamental dual importance for this nation. For that reason, this Government, through both the former Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, and the present Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, as I think all honourable members know, has given a very high priority to helping the search for a solution to the Cambodian problem. The broader context-if I may put it that way-for the achievement of a settlement of the Cambodian problem has, of course, arisen through the great changes in the relations between the superpowers. That has provided the context. Those changes have required the various backers of the Cambodian factions to reassess their intercst<; in the situation in Cambodia. Within that context, which has existed for Cambodia some years, the key obstacle to a settlement had been the inability of the factions involved directly and of their backers to agree on who would run the country while the elections took place. That had been a core problem in trying to resolve the issue. Honourable members will be aware that late in 1989 Senator Evans took up a broad idea which had been put forward in the first instance by Congressman Stephen Solarz of the United States. He put forward the broad concept that the United Nations should, in effect, rule Cambodia during a transition period to allow elections to be held in which Cambodians could make their own democratic choice about the government which would be in charge of their country. The Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, took that simple idea and turned it into a comprehensive, detailed and practical plan which envisaged a bigger role for the United Nations than any it has ever taken before in any comparable or vaguely comparable situation. To put it mildly, the Evans transformation of the Solarz idea was to create an exceptionally bold plan. Having taken the Solarz broad concept and translated it into this detailed, comprehensive and bold plan, Senator Evans then went about the job of selling the plan. He did that to the Cambodian factions and their backersobviously that had to be done; he did it to our regional neighbours; and, ultimately most importantly, he sold it to the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Since then-as you know, Mr Speaker, and as I think the honourable member for Reid appreciates-Senator Evans, with his Department, has been absolutely tireless in promoting a settlement based on his plan. He has done that through various vicissitudes. In doing so, he has cooperated closely with his friend and colleague the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Alatas, and that has been important not only intrinsically in regard to the settlement of that issue but, as I think the honourable member for Reid will appreciate, also in creating a sensible and productive relationship between us which will be relevant to the bilateral relationship between our two countries. I acknowledge the significance of the cooperation that Senator Evans has received from Mr Alatas. In Paris, the week before last-as we all know and I hope we all appreciate and applaud-these efforts of Senator Evans with others were rewarded by the signature of an agreement for a comprehensive settlement which was based directly on Senator Evans's plan. The acknowledgment of Australia's role through our Foreign Minister could not have been more directly made than it was in the circumstances in two particular sources. Without intending any disrespect, because I intend none, to our French colleagues, I think it is the case that the French are not generally known for the way in which they throw bouquets around the world in regard to other people. But on this occasion the French Foreign Minister, Mr Dumas, was particularly generous in his observations. I quote what the French Foreign Minister had to say about Australia: . . . no one will forget that the agreement which we are going to sign shortly owes much to the initiative which shemeaning Australiawas able to bring to bear at the moment when hope was weakening. It is thanks to this veritable second wind that the five members of the Security Council and the Secretary General of the United Nations were able to return to the task from a new starting point. .. As I say, it was an extraordinarily generous and direct acknowledgment by the French Foreign Minister of the fundamentally important role played by Australia. As you will recall, Mr Speaker, one of the key Cambodian leaders, Hun Sen, who has just been in Australia, said of the settlement signed in Paris, in a very simple, direct and compelling sentence, 'Let me tell you the real father is Gareth Evans' - the real father of the settlement. Here we have an unqualified and richly deserved compliment. On behalf of the Government and also, I would hope, on behalf of the Parliament as a whole, I congratulate Senator Evans on a remarkable achievement. We are enormously proud of what he has done. His nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is simply a fitting recognition of that achievement.",20

61,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We do not need any cheap interjections on this. I would have thought those opposite regarded it as too important. Our pride in Senator Evans's success is equalled-I know I certainly speak for all members of the Government-by our delight that the people of Cambodia will now have an opportunity to rebuild their nation and their lives after so many terrible years. The Cambodian factions' willingness to overcome years of bitterness and distrust to conclude this settlement is to be commended. It is a good omen for the future of Cambodia. But we must not assume-as we do not-that the settlement process will all be smooth sailing. I go finally to the question of Australia's further role. We have only just begun that role. A team of some 40 ADF communicators is now on standby to go to Cambodia as part of the United Nations advance mission which will provide communications and good offices between the factions until the full United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC, is established next year. Its mission, as we should all acknowledge in this place, will be difficult but it will be rewarding and we wish its members well. Australia has offered to provide some 500 personnel for UNTAC itself, including the commander of the main peacekeeping force, as well as electoral assistance. We are committed to helping with reconstruction and repatriation efforts. I conclude by saying that I will be advising the Parliament further about our participation in the United Nations operation in Cambodia when more details are available. Economy",21
62,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Can he confinn whether in his circulated statement in Bangkok he stated that Australia is in the worse recession since the Great Depression or, to quote him exactly 'our most severe recession for 60 years'? Does he stand by his statement or, given his recent change in rhetoric, has there been a sudden and monumental recovery which has been totally unnoticed by the one million people unemployed? Alternatively, was he intimidated by his first meeting of the IMF and World Bank in an international setting?",22
63,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will give the factual background to this matter. I decided not to make a verbal presentation to the plenum of the World Bank-IMF conference because Australia, and thereby I, as one of the governors of the bank and the IMF, had spent two full days in the interim committee and the development committee. I thought it appropriate to give participants from other countries who had not had an opportunity to speak the opportunity to do so. A 23/4 - page statement had been finalised the night before and it was tabled. It contained the phrase 'most severe recession in 60 years' as an aside, explaining why Australia had not been able to do more on foreign aid. Since then I have checked the history of recession indicators to see whether the phrase 'most severe recession in 60 years' is true. Unfortunately for the Opposition, I was wrong.",22
64,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,22
65,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say 'unfortunately' because it suits the Opposition's purposes. On the five most relevant measures, the 1960-61 recession and the 1982-83 recession were worse than the one in 1990-91. Mr Reith-Is that it? Are you serious?",22
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,22
67,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The real issue is that most Australians are not interested in any academic or statistical comparison of past recessions. What they want to know is what the future holds. The only issue of real importance now is the quality and timing of recovery. The economic fundamentals will govern the quality of recovery and we are far better placed than we were in 1982-83. Australia is now well positioned for a sustained recovery in investment and employment activities. We have embarked on an era where Australia will be a highly competitive, low inflation country and we have an opportunity to deliver sustained growth in employment and community living standards. That is due only to the policies pursued by this Government in its eight years in office. The program of industry reform initiated by this Government, including tariff reform and financial deregulation, is fundamental to Australia's economic prospects.",22
68,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,22
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,22
70,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us not forget that it was while the Opposition was in power that Australia became internationally uncompetitive, hiding behind tariff barriers and other forms of protection, thinking the world owed it a living. Let us remember that the Hawke Government has delivered the lowest inflation rate for 20 years. The accord between this Government and the ACTU has resulted in gross profit share reaching record levels. Even in the midst of recession the profit share remains close to the historical highs recorded under this Government and is well above the levels recorded in any year under the previous Government. The capital stock has been expanded, reflecting the strong growth in business investment prior to the recession. That growth reflects the private sector's confidence that this Government has what it takes to make Australia internationally competitive. Dr Hewson interjecting",22
71,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition cannot even read a Treasury table. Australia's competitiveness remains favourable by historical standards and is 14 to 17 per cent better than in 1982-83. Real unit labour costs are 10 per cent lower than when we came into office and are at levels that have delivered strong growth in the past. Because of wage restraint and productivity growth, real unit labour costs are forecast to fall further this year.",23

74,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let there be no mistake: I am not simply saying that we will have a quality recovery when it arrives, because we are already witnessing signs that recovery is under way. Retail trade has grown strongly in the past few months and activity has increased noticeably in the private housing market, with finance approvals, building approvals and commencements all recording growth. Mr Tim Fischer-Sadly, you are wrong.",23
75,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member would like it to be wrong, but this is the truth. Surveys of business expectations, particularly the National Australia Bank, CAIWestpac and the State Bank-ACM surveys, indicate improved expectations of growth in output, profitability and capital expenditure over the next few years. If the honourable member wants to check the figures himself he will see that what I said about 1960-61 and 1982-83 was perfectly right. Housing",23
76,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Can the Minister inform the House what steps are being taken to make sure that housing in Australia fits the needs of people such as sole parents, the aged and low income families?",23
77,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a question that is of some importance for the honourable member's electorate, because it has quite a large number of units of public housing and a population that depends on government housing policies. I notice that the Opposition made one of its rare interventions in relation to public housing on 3 November, when the shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Forrest, made the point that in public housing what needed to occur was that capital did not need to be Mr MCGauran-You have done it again, Brian. The press gallery is clearing off. Dr Bob Woods-They are going. Look at them.",23
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left will cease interjecting. I warn the honourable member for Lowe.,23
79,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow spokesperson, while regretting the waiting lists-with crocodile tears-went on to say that there ought to be no further capital investment in public housing and that there ought to be a reduction. But given the reduction of capital expenditure in public housing, those funds ought to be transferred into areas of rent assistance. Essentially, the opportunity exists for a party, particularly when in opposition, to construct an alternative policy. The Opposition has the opportunity to develop comprehensive policies in any area, and no area is more important in terms of social policy than the whole area of housing, public housing in particular. In contrast to the Opposition, the Government is seeking to develop an approach to housing which takes seriously",23

81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is far too much noise on my left. People in the gallery have decided they want to go early. If members on my left continue to interject, they might\ get to see the pre-race round-up as well.",23
82,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was contrasting the approach of the Opposition, which once again in this area of policy relies essentially on privatisation, without detail, on the reduction of the public sector, on selling off housing stock and on substituting rent assistance for a public housing program as representing some kind of policy. Against that, through the national housing strategy the Government is seeking to develop a comprehensive policy that goes not only to the question of public housing and rental assistance but also to dealing with those constraints that exist within the Australian community and exist for middle income Australians, especially new home owners, when it comes to finding affordable housing. One of the reasons we get stupid interjections from the Opposition is that housing is a complex issue. What we have never had from the Opposition is a complex and comprehensive policy on housing that goes not to one strand or to one degree of simplicity but to housing in all of its complexity and not only to its financial aspects but also to the housing industry and its structure, to the availability of land and to reports such as that of the Indicative Planning Council which suggests that, as the housing recovery that it predicts occurs this year and next year, there will be considerable constraints at the level of land, which is essentially the responsibility of the States, not the Commonwealth. So through the process of the development of the housing strategy, through the consultation occurring between the Commonwealth and the States, we will be able to deal not with simplicities but with all the complexities that are important in developing an efficient and equitable supply of housing. That does not mean selling off the public housing stock; it means linking public housing policies, for example, to improved rental assistance so that rent has its role. That issue cannot be addressed if there is not an addressing of the issue of the supply of housing. Notably, in Australia housing markets have failed to address the need for rental accommodation or to deal with the problems that people have with the transfer cost of moving from units and smaller units of housing into family housing. So there is a range of issues and they are being addressed through the national housing strategy. They certainly go a long way further than simply public housing; they go to the whole balance of housing policies and they fit into the Government's concern about cities.",24
83,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Broadcast of Parliamentary Proceedings",24
84,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, in welcoming you back to this place, could I put a question to you on a matter that is within your responsibility? In the weekend media it was reported, with respect to the broadcast of a committee's proceedings yesterday, that an exclusive right was held by the ABC with respect to the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings and those of parliamentary committees. Would you explain to the House the nature of that exclusiveness? Is there any consideration payable by the ABC? Is there any denial of access to other broadcasting channels or media? Is the price ultimately only related to the extent to which the ABC now no longer provides on one of its AM channels the opportunity for listeners throughout Australia to hear parliamentary broadcasts?",24
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the right honourable member for New England, my understanding of the guidelines laid down for the televising of Parliament and committees is that the feed from Channel 1, or whichever channel the committee hearing is on, is made free to air to any television channel that may wish to take it. Provided that they are willing to run it, they can run it. Any televising organisation or radio organisation can take excerpts of the proceedings. Provided there is an element of balance in that, they can be used in other re-broadcasts at a later date. There is, to my knowledge, no exclusive right that the ABC has, though I must say, in support of the ABC, that it is the only media organisation that has taken Question Time in both Houses and run it live. Also, it is the only organisation, to my knowledge, that has requested the right to tape the proceedings of parliamentary committees. But if any other channel wants to run them, it is free to do so. Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Forum",24
86,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As you, Mr Speaker, are responsible for the international relations of the Parliament, could you advise the House on the status of your invitation to parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region to attend the inaugural conference of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Forum in Canberra, which was initiated at the Steering Committee meeting last August in Singapore? Do you propose to establish a joint parliamentary working group of interested members to help prepare Australia's contribution to the conference and, in the event that it takes place, the subsequent establishment of a new regional parliamentary body? Could that committee be on the basis of the existing structures we have for both the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union?",25
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have told the honourable member for Bradfield privately, I do not think the President and I have any need for any group to help us do our job. As to the question of where we are up to with the inaugural meeting of that forum, that is still in the melting-pot, and we are still awaiting information from our colleagues in the region.

91,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",26
92,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,26
93,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,26
94,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,26
95,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In an article in the Sunday Age on 20 October 1991 entitled 'Let Europe stay in Europe', the journalist Terry Lane launched into an attack on me in relation to both multiculturalism and the crisis in Croatia. I do not wish to take up the time of the House in a comprehensive rebuttal of all the misrepresentations made against me by Mr Lane in this venomous attack. Nevertheless, there are three gross misrepresentations which need to be directly rebutted. Firstly, Mr Lane attributes to me the view that multiculturalism is 'the happy co-existence of mutually hostile enclaves'. That definition has been rejected by the Government and by the Opposition and in all my writings and speeches on this matter. Secondly, Mr Lane attacks me as Chairman of the Parliamentarians for Croatia and Slovenia and, indeed, he attacks the right of parliamentarians to have such a group. Mr Lane then accuses me of inconsistency, claiming that I support multiculturalism in Australia but only monoculturalism in Croatia. He attributes to me this view: Report If the Croats want to set up an homogeneous state, presumably with one language, one set of laws and the preferred music and food of the Croatians, then we should encourage them to do so. Mr Speaker, as you are aware, I recently travelled to Zagreb during the war period in order to have discussion with and gain assurances from President Tudjman on precisely this issue. Not only does the new Croatian constitution guarantee the rights and culture for all minorities, including the Serbians Jiving in Croatia, but President Tudjman is prepared to have those rights monitored through the United Nations and other international authorities.",26
96,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think the honourable member is going past where he was misrepresented.,26
97,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am pointing out the way in which I have been misrepresented and giving the rebuttal to the misrepresentation.,26
98,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member might get to matters that deal with him, not that deal with a third party.",26
99,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This is a matter that deals with me. It has been asserted that I hold a certain view about Croatia and Croatians, and I have pointed out in this explanation that not only did I philosophically gain assurances to the contrary but also I actually went to Zagreb to gain assurances to the contrary in relation to this matter.",26
100,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The honourable member can tell us where he was misrepresented, but the views of a third party are not all that germane to this. So the honourable member might get on to where he can tell us about his position.",26
101,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I make that second point. There were a number of misrepresentations, but the final one on which I will take up the attention of the House is where Mr Lane attacks me saying that, in supporting the right of Croatians, Slovenians, Bosnians, Serbians and others to peacefully rally and support their former homelands, I am undermining a harmonious society. He says to these peoples: ... if your heart is over there why don't you take the rest of your organs to join it. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. With great respect, if a member of the Opposition were pursuing a personal explanation in this manner, you would have sat him down well before now. The honourable member is debating the issue.",27
102,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Hume will not reflect on the Chair like that-and that is a reflection on the Chair. The honourable member for Calwell will get to where he was misrepresented. The matters of substance that he wants to raise are probably more properly raised on the adjournment or in some other forum in the House.,27
103,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, these three and other misrepresentations were directed towards me-and anyone is welcome to read the article in relation to that-as Chairman of the Parliamentarians for Croatia and Slovenia group. I have referred to that third representation.",27
104,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Would the honourable member quickly get to where he was misrepresented.,27
105,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have referred to that third misrepresentation. I now wish toMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is clearly outside the bounds of a personal explanation. The article on the face of it, as read by the honourable member, was simply a commentary on his argument. It was in no way whatsoever a misrepresentation. You should rule so accordingly.",27
106,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am going to hear from the honourable member for Calwell how he was misrepresented. If he cannot tell the House that, he should resume his seat. We are starting to become impatient about this.",27
107,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am really trying to save the time of the House. If honourable members opposite would cease interjecting, I will finish.",27
108,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member for Calwell will not canvass points of order. He should state how he was misrepresented. The honourable member for Kooyong is on next-and I do not want to have half an hour with him!,27
109,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,This claim by Mr Lane is outrageous. It is a denial not onlyMr Downer-He is debating the issue. You should sit him down.,27
110,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! Dr THEOPHANOUSIt is a denial of democratic rightsMr Downer interjecting,27
111,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will not continue to interject. I am having difficulty hearing the honourable member for Calwell. I think the honourable member for Calwell may have gone as far as he can in telling us about where he was misrepresented.,27
112,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I seek leave to make a statement.",27
113,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to be misrepresented? ,27
114,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member may proceed.  the Adelaide Advertiser of 23 October, and subsequently repeated in some other publications, particularly the Sunday Telegraph of 27 October in an article by a Mr Brad Crouch, contained a number of reports of a meeting of the Joint Select Committee on Family Law where in certain statements of mine regarding dome-tic violence, I have been variously refelled to without regard to the fact that in canvassing the issue, as the transcript shows, I described those factors behind the issue as 'appalling' and said I was 'appalled to hear how frequently it is done'. Quite obviously, with none of the reports quoting me in that regard, without reference to such descriptions the context is significantly misleading. Mr Downer-Now that is how it is done, you see.",27
115,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member for Kooyong has constraints upon him which have caused him to be more succinct today than he usually is. However, I am sure that he will stay for the next 20 minutes to hear the Leader of the National Party of Australia deliver his dissertation. NA Federal-State Financial Relations",28
116,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to provide leadership and direction to the nation in the area of FederalState financial relations and its impact on employof ment and development during the worse recession since the Great Depression. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",28
117,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to the challenge before me in raising this matter of public importance because it does relate to the future of this country and to the crisis in the economy. It might well be Rasheek in the Melbourne Cup, but it is chaos in the Caucus. No matter who wins the Cup, there is a massive crisis in the country. I must say that never in the history of the Federation of Australia has so much damage been done to so many Australians by so few-namely, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the current Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), and this Government. The last shred of leadership of this Prime Minister evaporated yesterday when he could not even withstand the further shot from ex-Treasurer Keating. He folded up his tent, collapsed the new federalism program and in fact tore up large chunks of new federalism under the pressure of the Caucus. He vacated his responsibilities as Prime Minister of Australia, as leader of the Australian Labor Party, in this worse recession in 60 years. Let me say by way of background that the Prime Minister launched this huge initiative right back on 19 July 1990 in a famous National Press Club speech when he made it a major commitment of this term of his Government. He made it a priority to embrace not only the Federal Government but all State governments and, by degrees, local government. He laid down the challenge for Australia to genuinely bring forward microeconomic reform, to genuinely bring forward new federalism in respect of financial arrangements between the States and the Federal Government, in respect of taxation arrangements between the States and the Federal Government and, indeed, in respect of a range other matters. In fact I helped the Prime Minister write one paragraph of this important speech which he took from a House of Representatives Committee report. By way of an example, he said: A cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and Perth may be subject to three nODintegra,ted rail - ystems, four changes of l?co-otlves, - ve different safe working systems, SIX .dlffe-ent SIZes of loadin- gauge, 10 different engmeenng standards of bastc standard gauge rail track, and 12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew changes, refuelling and inspections. That is how wide the speech was on new federalism. This was the great launch in July 1990, some 16 months ago-but what now? What happened yesterday? Yesterday following on from the speech at the National Press Club by ex-Treasurer Keating, the honourable member for Blaxland, the Prime Minister folded up. He collapsed large chunks of the new federalism program at the behest of one backbencher-the honourable member for Blaxland, who has no shame; who created an unemployment figure of one million. Mr Reith- Mr Recession.",28
118,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition correctly points out, he delivered us a designer recession. It was a recession we had to have. The Government might not accept our quotes on that, so let us turn to what Professor Helen Hughes of the Australian National University said: Instead we have inflicted a totally unnecessary and unwarranted recession on ourselves. She continued: Australia was gripped by trade problems whose principal cause was the inaptness of macroeconomic policies while Paul Keating's policies as Treasurer undermined the economy and led to the present recession. We crippled our exporters by high inflation, high interest rates and greatly overvalued exchange rates. The principal cause of all three were hopeless fiscal policies, hopeless monetary and financial policies and hopeless income policies. Professor Hughes went on-I invite honourable members to listen to this very carefullyto be very critical of the tax system in Australia, labelling it as a 'byzantine, inefficient and archaic tax system that invites avoidance and evasion'. Amen! I will say more on that in a moment. She said that Australia needed to reform its tax laws if it is to be internationally competitive. It was a recession from ex-Treasurer Keating we supposedly had to have; but, frankly, it was a recession we did not have to have. He gave it to us as a consequence of his interest rate policies. Ex-Treasurer Keating has no shame; he is a disgrace. He should depart this Parliament-the sooner the better-and then we might well have a recovery. The other sad footnote to that National Press Club speech of ex-Treasurer Keating's was that he chose to move from the normal Wednesday to a Tuesday. The ex-Treasurer gave that speech to the National Press Club on Tuesday, 22 October. What happened on Wednesday? He could not dare speak on the Wednesday because there was a national strike in New South Wales. It gets worse. Guess what the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) had the hide to do on the day of that national strike? He closed his electorate office and put up a notice saying, 'This electorate office is closed'. Constituents were denied access to this electorate office because of the industrial dispute in New South Wales on that day. The man does not deserve to be a Federal member. This is a Federal electorate office, and we should let him answer for his action. This matter of public importance focuses on the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was described by one of his own as Old JeUyback. If ever there were an example of the Old Jellyback tendencies, it is in relation to Federal-State relations. Prime Minister Hawke, as he always does, folds under pressure, like a deckchair on the sinking Titanic. In the specific area of Federal-State financial relations I remind honourable members of the joint statement arising for the November Premiers Conference: The crucial and inter-related issues of reform, of Commonwealth/State financial arrangements, including reviewing the distribution of taxation powers to reduce vertical fiscal imbalance. This was the matter listed right up until yesterday. Today, in the force of Question Time and the questions raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), this is a matter which has now been taken off the agenda and which the Prime Minister has walked away from addressing when we need to have change and when we need to have radical reform in this country if we are give jobs back to the jobless and if we are to provide a turnaround and make our economy truly internationally competitive. The preliminary conclusions from the Special Premiers Conference in July, very interestingly, included the following: A very large reduction in the existing degree of vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the States could be made before the existing arrangements for horizontal fiscal equalisation would be called into question. But that is when Keating intervened. Keating came forward and decided to torpedo the Perth Premiers Conference and all it entailed-all that was designed to be discussed and positively considered. He did so to the point that it was taken out at the Caucus yesterday. But Keating was not on his own, and this is where we come to the leadership of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister no longer has the courage to call into line people such as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) who said today, 'It is perfectly okay', and, by implication, 'r want to encourage the attacks of the honourable member for Blaxland on the Prime Minister'. How can the Prime Minister sit in that Cabinet, with the convention of the Westminster system on Cabinet solidarity, and have Dawkins encouraging Keating to launch attack upon attack upon him? r realise that this might upset the Deputy Prime Minister, so r will refer to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in the Senate. Mr Howe Mr Deputy Speaker, r do not want to interrupt the honourable member but I think that he should be directed to refer to members of this Parliament by their proper title.",29
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Minister is correct.,30
120,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I point out that the Minister for Social Security encouraged the honourable member for Blaxland in this path. He added to the burden of the situation when he said: We have to be very careful in handing over Commonwealth powers, especially in the area of welfare. If the Deputy Prime Minister wants to get so excited about this matter, there is also a quote by him. I know honourable members may want to get excited about other matters, but I want to quote what the Deputy Prime Minister said. The Deputy Prime Minister should listen to this, because this is what he said: I think it is entirely right that the Commonwealth should retain the whip hand in these (taxation) matters, because we do have to manage macroeconomic policy. What happened? Jellyback folded, Caucus is in chaos and, while the Cabinet and the Caucus fiddle, the country burns-there are a million people unemployed and the economy, sadly, is not in recovery. Much as I would dearly want to stand up in this House and say that there is a dramatic economic upswing, increased confidence and new jobs, the reality of the situation is totally the opposite. That situation is reflected in a case that has recently come to my attention. A couple bought a dairy farm in 1980 after 10 years of living in Melbourne. They worked hard to build up the property and within four years they had drawn up plans to extend the house to fit their four children. But then came the price slump and the drought and the wife took up employment at the local hospital. The final blow, however, was the news that the wife's job at the hospital would cease in December. Now they cannot afford trips into town and they fear family iJlness. That situation and that individual suffering, multiplied right across the country, is manifest everywhere. It has led to the circumstance where the husband is unable to sleep at night, although he is always tired, there is brittleness in the way family members relate and increased asthma attacks are a daily event. In other words, there is a huge amount of economic misery out there. There is confusion over the direction and leadership of this Government, and the leadership of this Prime Minister as he prepares to go to Perth for the next Premiers Conference. I say further that there is an absolute need to clarify the Federal, State and local government of this country. There is a strong case for establishing a national electricity grid, and there should be consideration of a Bass link, which would involve a 300 megawatt undersea cable between Gippsland and Tasmania at a cost of some $400m. Equally, what we have successfully exposed today is the fact that the Prime Minister has walked away from his responsibilities as Prime Minister of this country and has failed the test of providing leadership for this country at a time when we need to maximise employment, proper development, economic performance and international competitiveness so that we can together build a better Australia.",30
121,Mr HOWE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Batman-Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services)(3.30 p.m.)-We have just heard a speech, supposedly about Commonwealth-State relations, which essentially delivered an attack on Government back bench members. It was delivered by someone who really has the stature of a backbencher as far as the Opposition is concerned. The fact of the matter is that Federal-State relations is too serious an issue to be dealt with in such a trivial way. We have just listened to 15 minutes of absolute emptiness. No attempt has been made by the Opposition to go to any point of substance whatsoever on Commonwealth-State relations. There was not one point of substance in 15 minutes. The reason why we will continue to be the Government in this country for a velY long time is that we are about substance and getting reforms into this country that will enable the country to operate more effectively, more efficiently and more fairly. That is essentially what governments need to be about. To do that, they need political courage. This Government has won respect because, again and again, it has demonstrated its capacity to take on very hard issues and to pursue those issues to the point where it achieves very significant reform. We can also say that in the area of taxation. One does not need to have much of a sense of history on taxation policy to be able to make very clear comparisons. When Opposition members were in government, tax avoidance was the order of the day, the tax system was simply not reformed in any sensible or fundamental way and, effectively, paying one's taxes became an optional extra in this country. Against that, this Government has been prepared to pursue widespread discussion in the community leading up to a tax summit, to canvass a number of options, to make a choice with respect to those options and then to carry through a very significant process of reform. That is the difference. The difference is that this Government has had the courage to carry through reform, whereas the Opposition, when in government, caved into every interest group. The Government is prepared to address taxation reform in so far as it is of interest to the States. That is why there has been a process to allow discussion to occur between Commonwealth and State officials about a range of taxation options. Today, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicated that there was not a great deal of enthusiasm about the transfer of income tax powers to the States, either in Caucus or in the States. I would not have thought that was terribly significant news. The fact of the matter is that the former leader of the conservatives, Malcolm Fraser, was very enthusiastic about encouraging the States to pick up income tax. He legislated to make that possible. For a number of years the States had before them the choice of introducing income taxes. They chose not to do that, just as a number of States are already indicating that, frankly, they are not interested in getting income tax powers. That is a route they are not prepared to go on. Yesterday, the Prime Minister indicated that there was no enthusiasm-in Canberra and a number of the State capitals-for an option that involved the transfer of income tax powers. Apart from that, the process is continuing. An options paper has been circulated. Frankly, those options papers have been studied in the way that they have sought to canvass all of the options. No options have been excluded. They have put all of the options on the table and they have investigated the strengths and the weaknesses of those various options. As far as the Prime Minister is concerned, I have to say that he has had the opportunity to see that work that has been done. Of course, under questioning in the Caucus, he has been prepared to make available what the drift of his thinking is. As I have said, there is nothing particularly newsworthy about that. However, the report will receive further consideration. That final report will be considered after the Government has completed its consideration by the Premiers Conference in November. As I have said, it indicates the full range of options that are available. Those options and their implications can be considered, if you like, in terms of vertical fiscal imbalance as well as horizontal fiscal imbalance. I take five minutes of this speech to talk about what has been achieved through the Premiers Conference process. It would be quite wrong to think that not much has been achieved and that not a great deal of energy has arisen out of this Premiers Conference process, particularly related to, for example, the whole area of micro-economic reform. One of the striking things about the Opposition in this Parliament is its willingness to pick on a slogan or perhaps a phrase and to keep repeating it-day in, day out. I think that members of the Opposition have got used to that kind of sloganeering. It is something that they did when they were in opposition before. They keep repeating and yapping away about micro-economic reform and putting a negative in front of it. They keep saying, 'That is not something that the Government has not done anything about'. Let us forget about the whole question of mutual recognition of standards, what is involved in that and what, effectively, that means in terms of efficiency to have uniform national standards. Let us forget about the agreement on mutual recognition of regulations which would apply where national uniformity is not essential. Let us forget about the mobility in terms of occupations. Let us not talk about roads and what has been achieved in terms of the National Road Transport Commission, which is already now in operation and the three commissioners of which are in the process of being appointed. Officials are being asked to report to the November conference on the feasibility and desirability of extending registration and regulating a charging system to cover light vehicles. The transport efficiency objectives of the Government have been advanced in that particular area. We could talk about the National Rail Corporation where a shareholders' agreement was signed at the July Special Premiers Conference. The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia have pledged to provide the initial equity funds for the Corporation estimated to be in excess of $400m over the next five years. Mr Tim Fischer-That is a good thing, but have you thought about",30
122,Mr HOWE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say to the Leader of the National Party that it is a good thing. His Party has been in government for most of the last 40 years, but it was this Government that had to produce the nationalMr Tim Fischer-And we standardised the rail.",32
123,Mr HOWE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the National Party wants to interject. I go to the question of electricity. There has never been a period of greater expansion of electricity generation in this country than the period of the late 1970s, when Malcolm Fraser was in power. We went for a massive expansion of electricity supply. In fact, we got ourselves into a situation of massive debt-which, for a number of States, is a very large part of State debt-on the assumption that somehow there would be an explosion of interest, in particular in aluminium and power intensive industries. The result of that has been a disaster. It has been a disaster in terms of debt and it has not led to great efficiencies in terms of Australian industry-quite the opposite. It has, in fact, resulted in industry often being loaded with higher taxes than it would otherwise have to pay. So the creation of a national electricity grid is no easy or simple reform; it is a massive reform. It involves seeking to deal with the problem of oversupply of electricity which in fact flowed from the period when those opposite were in government, when Malcolm Fraser broke the rules and threw out the rule book in terms of the Loan Council and Premiers Conferences and allowed State borrowings to get to a ridiculous point. Let me talk about government trading enterprise reform and related matters. Improving government enterprises is also an important part of the micro-economic agenda. We heard the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) today talking about the significance of waterfront reform around Australia and its importance to microeconomic reform in Australia. The microeconomic reform agenda effectively cannot be carried through without Federal-State cooperation. The Prime Minister has already achieved a great deal with the Premiers. He has an unfinished agenda and will go a long way further in that direction. I go to the third area of the unfinished agenda which goes to another aspect of Federal-State relations, that is, the whole question of tied grants and the reviews that have been carried out, the so-called functional reviews of a whole range of areas of social policy. That is very important in terms of economic efficiency and it is important in terms of the Federal-State relations agenda because, when we fund the States, as we do, by very large amounts of money-in the case of health it is billions of dollars for hospitals-and then see the States making decisions that are not about health but about shifting the costs from the States to the Commonwealth, we realise that that is an issue of micro-economic reform that needs to be addressed. As we put $1 billion every year under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement, we have the right to look at where that fits in in relation to other objectives that the Government might have and how we can ensure that those objectives are maximised in terms of a comprehensive State housing policy. When we think about people, as we were earlier today in a response to a question from the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) about what occurs in rural areas, we see that the blocks that exist between the Commonwealth and the States in respect of different functional responsibilities mean that we get not only a duplication but also a failure to deliver in rural areas the kinds of services that people have a right to expect. We need greater flexibility, but we will not get it without sitting down with the States and working through different ways to approach the problem. From the point of view of the Commonwealth, we are flexible in relation to tied grants. We understand that the States are looking for greater flexibility, and that of course can help us address questions of vertical fiscal imbalance just as much as revenue and taxation issues can do. But in doing that we have got to be absolutely sure we are focusing on the kinds of outcomes that the Australian people would expect from government. How stupid it would be to transfer responsibilities from one level of government to another, only to find that the quality of services deteriorates and people's expectations simply cannot be met in a certain area. These areas are sophisticated and demand sophisticated treatment. That is why we have had meetings of the various Ministers with functional responsibility. Whether it is in housing, health, education, child-care or whatever, we have been able to sit down with the Ministers to try to work out an approach that will lead to greater efficiency, will improve equity and, above all, will get for us quality outcomes that Australian people have a right to expect from their government. This has been a very exciting exercise with three levels of government sitting together, working through their respective approaches, looking at where cooperation can be enhanced and, above all, looking to the national interests. That is what we are entitled to do. That is why it is a serious business, and why this Parliament did not deserve the kind of trivial rubbish that was dealt out by a backbencher trumped up as a leader of the National Party. There is no reason why our intelligence should be insulted when a serious issue such as Federal-State relations is before the Parliament. Just imagine how much reform would be delivered by those opposite in the area of Federal-State relations. What right have they got to raise this issue and then deliver not a sentence of substance from Fischer in the 15 minutes that Parliament has allowed him?",32
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member should refer to another member by his proper title.,33
125,Mr HOWE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I acknowledge your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) simply wasted our time and diverted us from the real issue of the Cup-and, frankly, Dr Grace will have taken it out by about now. (Time expired) '. MR CONNOLLY (Bradfield) (3.45 p.m.)-It is a matter of great regret that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who started making at least a valiant attempt to defend his Government's policy on new federalism, should so soon depreciate his address into one of vituperation towards my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). The sad facts are quite clearly on the record. In every respect, the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) discovered new federalism as if he had received a message from God on the road to Damascus. ! The history of the Government's involvement in new federalism is on the record. It has been a matter for great criticism by none other than the Premier of South Australia, the then President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Bannon. It goes back of course to the inheritance of the previous government when Mr Fraser, then the Prime Minister, summed up his Government's attitude on the appropriate relationship between the States as reflecting 'cooperation, not conflict; partnership and not domination'. The amazing thing is that between 1983, when the Government came to power, and 1990 we heard very little indeed from the Prime Minister or other Ministers about this critical issue which the Opposition has chosen to put before the House today as a matter of fundamental public importance. We are complaining on behalf of the Australian people because of the Government's failure to provide leadership and direction to the nation in this critical area of Federal-State financial relations. We have also made the clear point that its impact on employment and development during the worse recession since the Great Depression is clearly unacceptable. The essence of our case is this: over nine years in power, the Prime Minister and his Government saw the light in 1990. Here we are now in 1991, heading towards the third Premiers Conference to consider a host of vital issues which are going to affect future generations of Australians and certainly have a major role to play in the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector reform across this nation. The point needs to be made that in May 1988 at the Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth, on its own initiative, announced it would devolve certain programs to the States from 1 July 1988. The list is hardly profound, nevertheless it should be on the record. It reads as follows: family support; emergency relief; vaccination program; miscellaneous pharmaceutical benefits; royal far west children's health scheme; and royal Queensland bush children's scheme. Most of those programs affect the lives of individual Australians, particularly our children. Most of those programs, forced on the States, resulted in very serious financial difficulties for low income families who should have been the beneficiaries of those programs. The point I am making is this: as early as 1986, Premier Bannon of South Australia, in a major address, the Sir Robert Garran Memorial Oration, in the same year, said: Prior to this year's Premiers' conferencethat is, June 1986I raised with the Prime Minister the issue of the administration of Commonwealth and State programmes. My Government recognised that the difficult economic situation facing the whole of the nation would inevitably mean that all Governments would have to accept a degree of restraint in their expenditures. He went on to say: However, it was my view that, as far as possible, we had to ensure restraint was not translated into cuts in direct services-we needed innovation-and a better way of doing things. Yet, as I said, at the Premiers Conference in 1988, two years later, the attitude adopted by the Commonwealth in the area of programs achieved precisely what Premier Bannon hoped it would not. He went on to say: The Prime Minister responded positively to this suggestion and made reference to it during his Address to the Nation immediately prior to the Premiers' Conference. This is the important part: At the Conference itself I fonnally put the proposal and it was agreed that the Commonwealth should urgently take up with the States the rationalisation of administration in areas of shared responsibility. He then said: Since that timedo not forget this is in 1986the issue has been the subject of discussions at 'officer level'. This is an interesting euphemism which means that the subject is considered important, but not urgent-significant but of no real priority. There it is, Mr Deputy Speaker: damned from the mouth of the Federal President and probably the most successful Labor State Premier in Australia. He said 'significant but of no real priority'. It is a sad fact that the evidence for his statement has been absolutely proven in what has taken place since then. In a speech to the National Press Club on 19 July 1990-remember, four years laterthe Prime Minister finally discovered his conversion on the road to Damascus. This is what he said: The time has come to form a closer partnership between our three levels of governmentcommonwealth, State and local. He went on to say: Our first task is to move by sensible, practicable steps to get better co-operation within the framework of the Federal Constitution as it stands. Yes, that is a profound and correct statement, but the Opposition wants to know why, over nine years of government, it has taken so long for this Government to go such a short distance down the important road of restructuring Federal-State financial relations in this country. As I said, and as is borne out again in the general progress report released by the Premiers Conference, circulated by the  all members of this House only yesterday, the important thing is that, again, in this report are those inevitable words mentioned by Mr Bannon: The report by officials will not make recommendations but will outline issues as a b-is for sion. Throughout the entire agenda for the forthcoming Premiers Conference we find the words 'basis for discussion'. How many more months, how many more years, how many more decades do the Australian people have to wait before they will see reform that really adds up to something of real value? Perhaps the last few weeks have been the most damaging of all to this whole exercise. Only a few days ago, on Tuesday, 15 October, 25 Caucus members met and criticised the 'secretive' way in which the Federal Government is preparing for next month's Premiers Conference. During recent months a host of Ministers have been going in exactly the opposite directions to those outlined-and rightly so-by the Prime Minister in his earlier statement. The former Treasurer, for example, in his Press Club speech last week, said: Federalism is a very broad label, there is sense in a rationalisation of functions but there is no senseI emphasise that no sense in giving revenue powers back to the States, none. Says who? Former Treasurer Keating. We then heard from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), the man who stood here only a few minutes ago trying to bury us in his pseudo eloquence. He basically agreed with Mr Keating. This is what he said: I think its entirely right that the Commonwealth should retain the whip hand in these (taxation) matters because we do have to manage macroeconomic policy. We know how well the Government has done that. The Labor Caucus Community Services and Welfare Committee unanimously endorsed a motion which expressed its 'deep concern about the direction in which the Government is heading on possible devolution of community services and welfare functions to the States'. And who was it supported by? The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson); the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown); the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples); and the Minister discusfor the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and the Territories (Mrs Kelly) supported it. All those Ministers, in their own portfolios, have spoken publicly on the record in a way opposing the view being put forward by the Prime Minister. The Opposition and the Australian people once again look at this as an area of major national reform whose time has come but which, under this Administration, will turn to naught.",33
126,Mrs JAKOBSEN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was disappointed, to say the least, in the contribution of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). I believe that he has brought forward what is, in effect, a serious matter of public importance, but he did not treat it seriously. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he did not have his mind on the business of the House at the time he made his speech. By contrast, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made a more composed and substantial contribution to the debate, although I do not necessarily agree with what he was saying. I think for members of the Opposition to use the Commonwealth-State relations profile and policy as a way of beating about the head the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Cabinet of this Government is not a helpful position for them to take when representing the Australian nation because, in effect, there are many processes and reforms occurring as a result of this form of consultation with the States and the Commonwealth. There are, of course, many great centralists in this place; some of us would not be here if that were not the case. I am sure that many on both sides of the House would be members of State parliaments in their State of origin if they were not more interested in the national Parliament, national uniformity and in some way of administering the Commonwealth of Australia other than simply through the State government process. The Federal system is a system with which we live and it is the aim of our Government-and I hope all governments-to administer it appropriately and efficiently. Therefore, it is useful, important and timely to have a process which allows us to have meaningful discussion with our State colleagues and counterparts on the administration and the responsibilities we share. There is reluctance to hand powers to the States. Not all States handle these powers well and not all of them even want these powers. This is something we noticed in the last few months when things such as income tax powers were put on the table at the Special Premiers Conference when discussing Commonwealth-State relations in the context of vertical fiscal imbalance. It has not been rushed by the States as a way of achieving their funding needs. Who can blame them? They have to take the responsibility of imposing an income tax. They take very little responsibility for taking funds from the Federal Government when it has raised income tax. This is something that is recognised in this place at least, if not elsewhere in Australia. It does not mean that the division of powers that we are seeking and discussing at present ought not occur. The cun:ent review was commenced in July 1990 at the instigation of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It was undertaken in the interests of efficient and appropriate service provisions for the people we all represent in this place. As stated by the Prime Minister at that time, it is designed to improve the financial relationship between the governments; to clarify the roles and responsibilities between the levels of government for the benefit of clients and, indeed, the people of Australia; to implement social justice principles through better delivery and quality of services provided by government at all levels; to enhance the structure of the economy, building on significant micro-economic reform that the Commonwealth has already undertaken; and to cooperate on matters of environmental protection. There is a significant amount of money to be saved through micro-economic reform. I am sure the Opposition also acknowledges that, but such micro-economic reform cannot be carried to its full extent without State cooperation. Again, it is appropriate to have such discussions with the States. How do we talk to the States about such matters of mutual interest across this chamber and across the nation if we do not talk about sharing other responsibilities as well? We need to develop a national market in Australia. That is understood. We need to develop national uniform standards, which would improve efficiency. In order to do that and to avoid some of the problems that have existed in the past, we need to have a mutual recognition of standards that is an important part of the Special Premiers Conference agenda. We also need to emphasise in this context that the Federal Government has never agreed in Commonwealth-State discussions to do anything that would prejudice the Commonwealth's ability to manage the nation's affairs and to conduct appropriate macro-economic policy. The process upon which we have embarked is about reviewing all options to achieve outcomes which will benefit the people and the national interest. Consultation has been a continuing process and it occurred only after the Commonwealth Government had already commenced a number of significant reviews, for instance in the area of health and housing, because those areas of community services are the areas that come under the closest scrutiny when the Commonwealth and the States have discussions. Honourable members on the other side have talked about what happened yesterday. What did happen yesterday? The Caucus of the Australian Labor Party in this place had a seminar on the processes and the product of Commonwealth-State relations discussions to date. As the Prime Minister said, our real emphasis and our real concern should be the rights and needs of our citizens. I certainly agree with him. Community groups have expressed a very real concern about service delivery if the States take over some programs. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), has actually made that a point in the debate. We cannot disconnect ourselves from the electorate on these matters. Many people have concerns about the States taking over the provision of certain services. Therefore, it is Imperative that consultation with the community occur at the same time as the Commonwealth has consultation with .the States. It is imperative also that incentives for shifting which exist in the current system be removed. All members of this place are aware that this goes on. It is one element of the Commonwealth-State relations discussion which, hopefully, will be overcome, because by more appropriately allocating responsibility, the service provision or administration, we should be able to ensure that that cost shifting, or the incentive to do it, is reduced as much as it can be. That would be a major achievement which would occur from the changes in administration and the responsibility proposed during the review of Commonwealth-State relations. In the area of micro-economic reform, which I touched on briefly before, we have well in train-no pun intended-national rail freight, a national electricity grid, national charging and regulation of heavy vehicles, and national qualifications recognition and standards. These have not come about in isolation; they have come about as part of the mechanism of consultation presented by Commonwealth-State relations and the Special Premiers Conferences. However, it must not be overlooked that the Commonwealth is entitled to its own opinion on the proposals being put on the agenda. That is, in part, what was happening yesterday. It is one thing for the States to propose agenda items and for the Commonwealth to agree to look at them and discuss them, but it is quite another for the Commonwealth to agree blindly to these proposals; hen-e the concern in the Caucus and elsewhere ill the community about the prospect of States taking over an income tax role if they wanted itwhich they do not. Also, the Commonwealth does not favour percentages of general revenue being given to the States on a continuing basis. I think those are very clear positions of the Comnionwealth, and positions which the Commonwealth is entitled to state. There is no point in the Commonwealth rolling over and letting the States ju-p. on t-p of it, so we may as well have our oplllions m the arena, too. It appears that the excise question is up in the air, and I am certain that it will be looked at very carefully to see whether there is any way that further revenue can be made cost available to the States through that avenue. I am not aware of how that will turn out, but I think that it is still a fairly substantial area of revenue for the States if it is an option that the Commonwealth and the States agree to pursue. The Prime Minister has stated that any agreement on future roles and responsibilities must protect the interest of clientsthat is, Commonwealth and State clients-and must clearly specify national interests and set out agreed national objectives. I agree with this process and thank the House for its time. (Time expired)",35

128,Mr HAWKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"As has already been indicated by Senator Parer in another place, the coalition parties support the thrust of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill. This Bill takes up a number of recommendations that were given to the Government by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report No.3, following an inquiry which came about as a result of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referenda. This report was given to the Government in May 1989 and we are now, some 2 11z years later, debating the Bill that has come from that report. It is interesting to note the time that it has taken for the Government to take up the issues that were put to it in that report. It is a snail's pace operation-certainly nothing like Let's Elope, which has' just shown us how to move with more speed. There are a number of major provisions in this Bill which I would like to allude to and discuss briefly. First, the Bill will enable the streamlined processing of electoral enrolment forms in cases where enrolment is claimed for a subdivision in which the claimant is already enrolled. Obviously, it takes up one of the recommendations. The next concerns the provision that the address of a candidate who has a silent enrolment need not be publicly announced at the close of nominations. While I certainly respect the reasons for this being put forward, nonetheless it is a sad reflection on our society that a committee has had to bring forward that recommendation and the Government has had to legislate for it. This may be a reflection of what eight years of Labor government at a Federal level, and in most States, has done for the confidence that some individuals in this community have, feeling the need to maintain a certain amount of ,secrecy about where they live when in the past all those who wished to stand would have no difficulty in declaring not only who they were but also where they lived. In most cases people would have been quite proud of being able to do that. The next point, which again is quite straightforward, is that the Bill gives senators and members a choice of recording either their enrolled address or their place of residence when completfng a nomination form. Again, I think this probably puts into law what has been the practice on a few occasions. The fourth area of the Bill e-ables the registered officer or a deputy registered officer of a registered party to lodge the nominations of all the party's endorsed House of Representatives candidates in a State or Territory with the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or the Territory up to 48 hours before the close of nominations. Again, this recognises the 'opportunity now available through modem communications for a more centralised method. I dare say that it might also recognise candidates who have failed to nominate. On one or two rare occasions candidates for particular parties-in fact, in one case even a sitting member-have forgotten to nominate and have lost seats purely because of that. Mr Lee-It has not happened in Wannon yet.",38
129,Mr HAWKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It certainly has not happened in Wannon-and it is not likely to. The next provision in the Bill is to recognise modern - echno10gy. It provides that a nomination may, in fact, be made by a facsimile. Of course, that presumes that the candidate's deposit is received prior to nominations. I note that we are not going the whole way with electronic funds transfer and modem technology in the Electoral Office. If we are patient something may happen. The next area clears up some past misunderstanding. It requires that candidates, when completing a nomination form, specify how they became Australian citizens. Again, this is to avoid the embarrassment of someone not only nominating but also being elected only to find that he is not eligible to take up his seat in this place because he is not an Australian citizen. There is nothing particularly controversial about that. There is also a provision to ensure that any person who makes a claim in a nomination form which is false or misleading in the material respect shall be guilty of an offence for which the penalty will be a fine of $3,000 or imprisonment of six months or both. Again, this recognises the severity of a person making such claims. As all honourable members would agree, this is a reasonable provision. I now reflect on the same problem I alluded to earlier about the state of our society. There is also a provision to ensure that the addresses of silent electors not be disclosed to persons inspecting postal vote applications. As I said before, the fact that we have to increase secrecy provisions is a sad reflection on our society. Obviously, in a truly democratic society, such provisions would not be necessary. The fact that this Bill has introduced it, the fact that the Committee has felt it necessary to recommend this, is indeed sad. It is a sad reflection on the Government that it has even allowed the need for this sort of thing to arise. Another area that has caused some discussion is the provision to enable a licensed premises to be used as a polling booth subject to the Electoral Commissioner declaring in writing that he is satisfied that, during the hours of polling at the election or a referendum, no alcohol will be sold or consumed on that part of the premises to be used for polling; part of the premises to be used for polling will be segregated from areas where alcohol is being sold or consumed; and voters will have access to the part of the premises to be used for polling which does not involve passage through an area where alcohol is being sold or consumed. Obviously this takes into account the difficulties of finding a suitable polling booth in some areas. It recognises the need to separate that part of the licensed premises, but one wonders as to how some voters, having cast their votes, will find their way out of that building. The next provision restricts people living within 20 kilometres of a specified place at which a mobile polling is being conducted registering as general postal voters on the basis of the distance of their place of residence from a polling place. I acknowledge that this does not exclude people living within 20 kilometres of a mobile polling booth registering for a postal vote, but it does technically remove the choice for those who cannot claim a: reasonable reason for registering for a postal vote. The next provision introduces an infringement notice system for the enforcement of compulsory voting at elections and referendums under which apparent non-voters will be given the option of paying a penalty, showing cause why they should not be prosecuted, or having a matter dealt with in court. This seems like a mobile on-the-spot fine. It is a novel way of trying to get around the provision; some people find it rather objectionable to have to vote. For a fee of $20 the Government is now allowing them to register their disapproval at having to vote-or, to put it another way, $20 for the privilege of not voting. It is also worth noting-times have changed-the way that this Bill has been drafted. We see this in clause 22 headed 'compulsory voting'. The terminology in proposed subsection (4) is extremely blunt and not in the best of taste. It states: 11(4) The DROthat is, the Divisional Returning Officeris not required to send a penalty notice if he or she is satisfi'ed that the electorthat is, the one who did not vote(a) is dead; It is rather self-evident. It would have been a little more tasteful to say 'deceased'. No doubt the Government may wish to change that at some future date. Another grey area that has caused some confusion is section 44 of the Constitution, which in part states: 44. Any person who(iv.) Holds any office of profit under the Crown ... shall be incapable of being chosen ... as a senator or a member... As my colleague Senator Parer pointed out, he held an honorary position when he was nominating and felt obliged to resign because of the uncertainty, even though, as I have pointed out, being in an honorary position, he was not in a position of profit under the Crown. However, a clause has been inserted to define this. A clause was also added to provide that a person who is, on a nomination, an officer of the Crown is not capable of being nominated as a senator or a member. It is pleasing to note that the Government agreed to remove this clause. Although it was accepted that a definition was needed, there was also a requirement that people who nominated as candidates could get their jobs back if they were unsuccessful in the election. I think everyone would respect that right. I note also that the Government has given an undertaking to introduce some sort of legislation between now and the next election to get rid of this uncertainty. We look forward to that. I remind the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who I know has a very keen interest in this area, that, having been given that undertaking, we do expect that legislation before the next election. As mentioned earlier, clause 12 was designed specifically to avoid the courts voiding an election result because the senator or member was not an Australian citizen. That too clears up a misunderstanding that may have occurred in a recent case. I have alluded to proposed section 17 relating to the use of licensed premises. This makes sense in remote areas but clearly it should be used only when alternative premises are not available. I am sure that the Electoral Office will be mindful of that when it chooses to use such premises. Some people in the community would be very concerned were this to happen even when alternative premises were available. As I have mentioned earlier, clause 21 also brings in the whole question of the on-thespot fine approach for the privilege of having the right not to vote. Again, it may seem a streamlining method of allowing those who do not want that right not to vote, but I think it does leave the Government open to a question on a wider issue, which I do not wish to canvass too much today. Nonetheless, it has been a matter of some public debate and, no doubt, will continue to be a matter of some public debate. r think those are the key points in this Bill. As I said at the beginning, it is disappointing to note that it has taken the Government 2 1/z years to get to the point of bringing this legislation in. No doubt that has been a cause of some frustration to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which has been looking into the whole question of electoral and referendum practice. The Minister, in his summation, might be able to explain why it has taken so long. The coalition supports the broad thrust of the Bill and will not be opposing it.",38
130,Mr LEE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"This afternoon I rise to speak in support of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1991. I will respond to some comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and, in particular, his criticism that the Government has been rather slow in introducing the legislation to implement the report which I delivered in my capacity as Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in 1989. I suspect that one of the major reasons for the delay was the great length of time taken with previous legislation dealing with electoral matters and referenda. I recall that it took a number of years before the Senate was prepared to deal with legislation on these matters in the past. While the legislation might have been passed more quickly if the Government had introduced this legislative package more quickly, perhaps in the past the Government has had its fingers bumt simply due to the fact that the Senate seems to set its own timetable, irrespective of the Government's views on what might be important legislation. If the honourable member for Wannon looks at the past record of the Senate in dealing with electoral and referenda legislation, he might understand why it has taken so long for this House to debate this legislation. I note that we have quite a few primary school students in the gallery this afternoon. I am sure that, like me, the honourable member for Wannon and the Minister for Science and Te-hnology (Mr Free), who is at the table, will have the opportunity, at times, to speak to primary school students, especially year 6 students who study government as part of their course. Some of the students who are studying that course might be here this afternoon. I certainly know that, in some schools in my electorate, teachers conduct mock elections. Some students are appointed electoral officers and others are appointed polling clerks. They conduct an election campaign with people standing for one party or another. I sometimes suspect that some of the stu4ents know more about the conduct of elections than their parents who actually get the right to vote for Federal, State and local governments. I think that is to be commended. The more students who are going through schools now learn about government and our electoral processes, the healthier our democracy will be in years to come. I will also comment on some matters which have come to light during the case before the Court of Disputed Returns in New South Wales. I will be very careful not to canvass matter- which Mr Justice Slattery might be considering at the moment before he brings down his very important decision on whether by-elections are necessary in the State seats of The Entrance and Maitland, which may ultimately decide the fate of the New South Wales Government. . I understand th-t the Deputy State Electoral Officer of New South Wales has been quoted in the newspapers as saying that it is not possible to run a perfect election any more. I think he made those comments after a number of errors were exposed at that court. I do not wish to deal with the detail of those errors, except to say that I think Mr Wasson has pointed the finger at the Australian Electoral Commission in some matters. When the margins in seats in this House are as low as eight or nine, certainly single digit numbers in some cases, we have to ensure that the least possible number of errors are made by our polling staff in Federal elections. It has been suggested in the newspaper reports of that case before the Court of Disputed Returns that a large number of people who voted absentee and were enrolled for one electorate were mistakenly giv'"" ballot papers for another electorate. I understand from media reports that it has been suggested that the book of streets and roads for Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission was different for the last State election than' for previous Federal and State elections. The fact that not every street and road was listed in that book but only streets and roads in localities that were split between electorates may have resulted in polling staff becoming confused or being less willing to look up every absentee voter's proper electorate. That may have resulted in the extraordinarily large number of people who voted absentee being given ballot papers for the wrong electorates. My concern would be-I am not saying this is accurate; I am simply relying on newspaper reports-that, if a change was made to the book that we all know as the book of streets and roads for the last New South Wales State election, a similar error might result in difficulties at the next Federal election. Mr Hawker- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am reluctant to interrupt the honourable member, but I think he is going very close to canvassing issues that are before the Court of Disputed Returns. I feel that you should intervene because, if this matter is going before the court, I do not think it is proper for this Parliament to be discussing issues that are going to be judged by that court.",40
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I have been listening very closely to what the honourable member for Dobell has been saying. I know that he is also conscious of the need not to transgress. I think his comments have mainly referred to what might happen at a Federal election rather than the specific issues under consideration in New South Wales. As long as he continues in that vein, his comments are in order. If he goes too close to what is happening in New South Wales, his comments will, of course, be out of order.",42
132,Mr LEE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will abide by your ruling. My main concern is that, at the next Federal election, the book that lists all the streets and roads for my electorate and other electorates in New South Wales, Victoria and other States seeks to ensure that people who vote absentee are given the correct ballot paper. If any change is proposed from the las.t Federal election, I think the Electoral Commission has a responsibility to ensure that those changes are not likely to result in people being given the wrong ballot paper. Many people are not aware that under Federal legislation it is possible for people to move within their subdivision and not advise the Electoral Office that their address has altered. Perhaps a more accurate way to put it would be that there has been some confusion about the legality of this in the past. I understand it is the policy of the Electoral Office to sometimes have different correspondence sent to people who change their address but stay within the one subdivision. I understand that this Bill suggests that there should be a streamlined processing of electoral enrolment forms in cases where enrolment is claimed for a subdivision for which the claimant is already enrolled. That might help to clarify this matter. We have to be careful that we do not let constituents think that they should not advise the Electoral Commission of changes in their addresses. I think we have to be careful that people understand that they have a responsibility to keep their involvement accurate and up to date. The Electoral Commission should not do anything to create any confusion in the minds of voters about those matters. On the question of candidates enrolling for elections, this Bill will enable the registered officer or the deputy registered officer of registered political parties to lodge the nominations of parties' endorsed candidates up to 48 hours before the close of nominations. As the honourable member for Wannon suggested, there was one famous case where a candidate, the former Minister for health in the New South Wales State Government, Harry Jago, neglected to put in his nomination for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. According to a repolt I read in one of the Sydney newspapers, Mr Jago recently finished a book on this matter. I suspect that the finger was pointed at the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who, Mr Jago thought, had the responsibility as the then State Secretary of the Liberal Party of New South Wales to advise him when nominations closed. I suspect that the view of the honourable member for Mackellar is that he in fact fulfilled his duties and that the failure to put in the nomination was Mr Jago's error in failing to nominate by the due date back in 1973. It is certainly reassuring to members of this House and, I am sure, to the Minister for Science and Technology, who is at the table, that we can rely on the registered officer or the deputy registered officer of our Party to ensure that we do not in fact forget to enrol. Mr Free-We have John Della Bosca.",42
133,Mr LEE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"As the Minister at the table suggests, we have someone, Mr John Della Bosca, to ensure that does not happen. The legislation also seeks to alter the nomination form for candidates for the Australian Parliament. In the past we have asked people to indicate whether they are Australian citizens. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, people who are not Australian citizens are not eligible to stand for the Australian Parliament. We have not asked people in the past to tell us whether they are Australian citizens by birth, by naturalisation or by other means. I am not quite sure what those other means might be, but this Bill requires candidates to signify very clearly why they believe they are Australian citizens. It sets very severe penalties of $3,000 or imprisonment for six months, or both, if people put down any misleading information. This came about, of course, because of the famous case where Robert Wood was elected from New South Wales to the Australian Senate at the 1987 election. Unbeknownst to the good senator, he was a British citizen. I understand that because he received a call up notice during the Vietnam war he thought he had Australian citizenship. It was only when he sought to obtain an Australian passport that he discovered his parents had not naturalised him, that he was not an Australian citizen and, therefore, was not eligible to be a member of the Senate. We all know that that meant that he lost his position as a senator in this Parliament. This legislation seeks to force candidates to state why they believe they are Australian citizens and it sets severe penalties for people who deliberately provide misleading information. The legislation also ensures that if someone with a silent enrolment stands for Parliament the confidentiality of their home address is not breached. The honourable member for Wannon made a gratuitous remark about this being a sad state of affairs-that, given eight years of Labor government, people who stand for the Australian Parliament cannot be confident of public order and safety and cannot put their address on the nomination forms and have it published in all the local papers. I accept the honourable member's comment but perhaps he is not aware that a number of members of this House have received threats. I think a former Deputy Prime Minister, Lionel Bowen, at one stage received a number of threats. Where a member of this House believes it is necessary to obtain a silent enrolment, I do not think we should seek to undermine the provisions of silent enrolment by forcing the names and home addresses of people to be published in local newspapers in their electorates at election time. No doubt the honourable member for Wannon at various stages has received threatening or insulting letters in the past, given some of the stands he has taken on wool and other matters. Perhaps with that background he might understand why it may not be appropriate to blame the Labor Government for the fact that some people out there, for whatever reasons, decide to send threatening letters to members or to Ministers. The honourable member expressed a number of concerns about enabling licensed premises to be used as polling booths. Like him, I was a little concerned about this measure when I first heard about it. The Committee obtained evidence from former electoral commissioner Dr Colin Hughes. My recollection is that there was some difficulty at one stage in obtaining a suitable polling booth at Thredbo. The entire resort was declared a licensed premise. I know that the resort of Thredbo would be very well known to the honourable member for Wannon, given that previous Liberal Party conferences have been held at that resort for senior and up and coming Liberals. It is important, should therc be an election at some stage in the future, that parts of licensed premises be able to be declared polling places. Of course, it is a condition that no alcohol can be sold or consumed in the polling booth and that the part of the premises used for polling is to be segregated from areas where alcohol is sold or consumed. The last comment I wish to make in the short time available to me deals with redistributions. I note that the legislation provides for some alterations to provide for electoral boundaries to be drawn in the Act. There are some other matters affecting redistributions. My comment on this has been triggered by statements made by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), during the last sitting week after the release of the final boundaries for South Australia. The honourable member for Boothby claimed that his Party did not fare well under that distribution and that his Party would win fewer than half of the seats should it obtain more than half of the two-party preferred vote in South Australifl. Therefore, he considered that the boundaries were unsatisfactory. No doubt when the final boundaries for New South Wales are released statements may be made by one party or another that the boundaries help the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Party. I know that would not happen in Queensland. We all know that boundaries in Queensland are always honest and fair, especially for your Party, Mr Deputy Speaker. But certainly some people have alleged that boundaries might favour one party or another. I recall that when I served on the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform under Senator Robert Ray the former Liberal senator John Carrick asked Dr Hughes whether the electoral commissioners took any notice whatsoever of the political implications of their decisions in drawing boundaries during redistributions. Dr Hughes made it very clear that he thought it would be improper and would create additional difficulties and tensions for the electoral commissioner and the body given the job of drawing boundaries if they were required toÂ· sit down and start looking at the political implications of altering lines on maps. I think that is an important principle. Perhaps the honourable member for Boothby was not aware of that, given that it was evidence taken at a committee in a previous Parliament-evidence that I suspect Sir John Carrick strongly supported, given that all of us felt there should be no political considerations by the electoral commissioners when drawing up boundaries. In those circumstances it is a bit unfair to criticise electoral commissioners if boundaries have gone in a way which is unsatisfactory for one party or another. Those people would be satisfied only when electoral commissioners were given instructions that boundaries must meet a certain set of political standards that might have to make them satisfactory to one political party or all political parties. I think that is something which would be regretted. I do not think electoral commissioners should pay any attention whatsoever to the political implications of changes which they might recommend. With those statements I am more than happy to support this legislation. I am pleased to see that it has the support of the Opposition this afternoon.",42
134,Mr MACK,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"North Sydney) (4.40 p.m.)The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1991 amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum Act 1984. It gives effect to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters as a result of its inquiry into the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referendum. I notice that it has been generally regarded as a non-contentious Bill by most speakers. It was certainly seen that way in the Senate. I notice that even the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest refers to it as being non-contentious. That is a very sad commentary on this institution. I think this Bill shows two main things. Firstly, it shows the total failure of selfregulation at any level of society. It is a perfect example of the adage that when people of the same business or occupation sit around a table to discuss things, we can be quite sure it will be a conspiracy against the public. Secondly, the Bill shows the need for an independent review of our whole electoral system. Anyone who takes an impartial view knows that electoral systems in Australia at all levels-local, State and Federal government-are in an unholy mess. They all vary in all sorts of incredible ways. They are the results of many years of the various people who are in power trying to manipulate the system. They vary in all jurisdictions. We have a perfect example, referred to by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), in the confusion that existed in New South Wales because of interference in the electoral system there. If this Parliament had any real concern about elections with regard to their fairness and democratic principles, it would be looking to have a major inquiry. The honourable member for Dobell referred to the fairly foolish little outburst from the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) when he shed crocodile tears about what is happening in South Australia. Anyone who understands the first thing about electoral systems knows that numbers of seats in parliaments where we have single member electorates never reflect voting patterns. We have the example here of the present Government having 39.2 per cent of the vote and 52 per cent of the seats. In any single m-mber - l-torate system we will always get wtde vanatlons. The whole history of parliaments at all levels has shown that. I wish to deal in detail with some of the clauses of the Bill. Clause 11 refers to incumbent members or senators who have the right to declare either their place of living or enrolled addresses when nominating if they are enrolled for an electorate other than the one in which they are living. This is an extension of the unwarranted right of incumbent members to vote in an electorate in which they do not live. I take the view that if one is going to represent an electorate one has to be part of that electorate and part of that community. The amendment would allow incumbent candidates to mislead the electors as to their connections with the electorate. It opposes any form of open government and it is a very petty attempt to allow members to hide the fact that they do not live in their electorate. In many elections we have seen that people go to great lengths to try to do that. Clause 12 provides a new mode of nomination for House of Representatives candidates endorsed by a registered political party. It allows a registered officer of a party to lodge the nomination of all candidates endorsed by the party. Again I can understand the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell, because he would obviously see things in party terms. What happened to Harry Jago in New South Wales is a tragedy. I tend to see this as a further intrudoes sion by the political parties into the electoral systems and an extension of the special position of political parties in the whole system. Very rapidly over the last few years parties have become an integral part of the administration of government, yet they are really a body totally outside the Parliament and the whole administration. This amendment tightens the party's control on candidates and it is a further enhancement of party power. The amendment further erodes the principle of electoral representation and responsibility. Party candidates will not have to concern themselves with lodging their nominations. Some parties may even impose rules preventing their candidates lodging nominations individually. Political parties are not recognised in the Constitution but a succession of laws passed by party-dominated parliaments have entrenched the parties in the system and given them special advantages. That is now showing up very strongly in public funding for elections and access to taxpayers' funds for party purposes, for instance, travel to party meetings. This amendment continues the process. The Electoral Act gives a definition of 'political party', and recognises the registered officer, the secretary and the agent of a party. Indeed, much of the party structure now receives statutory recognition. The Act provides for the registration of parties and mentions the term 'party' well over 200 times. A whole part of the Act, part 11, is devoted exclusively to political parties, as are many provisions relating to funding and disclosure. Parties should be right outside the system. Under clause 13, candidates will be required to state in their nominations whether they became an Australian citizen by birth, naturalisation or other means and to supply relevant particulars. There is obviously no objection to requiring candidates to provide proof of citizenship, but it is quite another thing to ask people how their citizenship was acquired. The amendment is intended to avoid the situation where Robert Wood sat in the Senate for some months before it was real ised that he was not a citizen and therefore not qualified to be a senator. The amendment make candidates tum their minds to this aspect when nominating and it does provide some basis for assessment of their citizenship. The amendment is objectionable because it differentiates between candidates according to how they acquired their citizenship-by birth or naturalisation. Once people have acquired Australian citizenship they should not be required to make public declarations as to how they came by it. Candidates for elections are already required to declare their citizenship at the time of nomination and that should be sufficient, provided they provide some proof Of it. Robert Wood thought he was a citizen, as he was entitled to vote. As a British subject, up until 1984 he would have been entitled to take his seat in Parliament if elected. Considering the isolated nature of the Robert Wood case and the publicity given to it this amendment is quite an over-reaction; it' also introduces that new and objectionable character to the legislation. Under clause 14, a silent enrolment address will not have to be publicly announced at the close of nominations. People who are vulnerable, due to their occupation-for example, Family Court judges-certainly have some grounds for silent enrolment on the electoral roll. However, if they nominate for election to Parliament I think they have to abandon any claim to secrecy and privacy. Silent enrolment on the electoral roll should be denied to any elected representative. If we are attempting to argue, as the honourable member for Dobell did, that our society has deteriorated to such a point that that is necessary, we are dealing with the symptoms and not the disease. It is fundamental that the electoral address and home address of anyone who is representing people be known. Electors have a right to knowÂ· where their representatives live. Being a parliamentary candidate or a representative carries responsibilities, including the responsibility. to be accessible to the electors. That responsibility is not limited to business hours, as any member of this House knows. Clause 20 entrenches the right of incumbent senators who have lodged a voting ticket to have appear in inverted commas above the line on the ballot paper the word 'independent' beside their name. This amendment continues the tradition of sitting members granting themselves electoral advantages denied to other candidates. The amendment simply reinforces the impression tha! the review is a self-serving one. There IS no electoral or moral principle which supports the idea that an incumbent should be advantaged in elections in this manner. In fact, I think that is quite offensive to any democratic principle. To me, clause 22 is probably the most controversial one. It provides for an infringement notice system-in a way, like on the spot fines-for the enforcement of compulsory voting. In practice, of course, Australia has never had compulsory voting; what we have is compUlsory attendance at the polling booth. Once one's attendance to vote is recorded, one can cast a blank paper or, if there is no supervision, simply walk away without casting a vote at all. Compulsory voting has not been enforced with any rigour at any level of governrnent in Australia, and the offer of a reasonable explanation for the failure to attend at the polling booth is usually the end of the matter. In fact, the continued acceptance of compulsory voting depends to a large extent on the system being observed more in principle than in practice, and the Bill will result in many more non-voters having to pay a fine, which eventually may lead to a rejection of compulsory voting by a significant section of the community. People should, as a matter of their civic duty, exercise their right to vote. But I think it is very questionable whether they should be compelled by law to vote. Australia is one of only five democracies in the world that compel their citizens to vote in this manner. I think the others are Belgium, Greece, Luxembourgand Venezuela. The overwhelming majority of democracies recognise that the right to vote also means the right not to vote. People should not be forced to vote for a range of candidates when they favour none of them or when they feel aggrieved or apathetic about the political system. In most democratic countries where voting is voluntary in national elections, 75 per cent of electors turn out to vote in the usual situation. In Holland, compulsory voting was discontinued in 1970, and it has averaged a voter turnout of 84 per cent since then. The supposed evil of non-voting, which our compulsory voting law is supposed to redress, is not associated with social deprivation or alienation. Non-voters tend to be the apathetic, the sick, the young and those who are changing residence. Non-voting is not really related to economic levels. A minuscule number of people would refuse to vote as a matter of principle. An unknown but probably substantial number of voters are grudgingly attending at polling places owing to the compulsory voting law, but it is certainly not proven that this serves any good purpose. In fact, it disguises voter disaffection with the system and increases the proportion of votes cast thoughtlessly. There is no strong evidence to assume that voluntary voting would favour one side of politics in particular. That may well have been the case in the 1920s when the political parties of that era decided to bring in compulsory voting-and I notice, of course, that they hid behind an Independent member at that time who introduced the Compulsory Voting Bill in 1926. Where voting is voluntary, turnout tends to be much higher in marginal electorates than in safe ones, and that is the story right through every major democracy in the world. Voluntary voting tends to make it less safe for incumbents to take their seats for granted, which is probably one of the compelling forces that have kept compulsory voting in for all these years. Voluntary voting also makes for a more active and more motivated community involvement in elections, owing to the need to get the voters out. It may reduce the likelihood of voters being swayed by last minute saturation advertising campaigns. In my view, however, the most overwhelming argument on non-compUlsory voting is that, as a matter of principle, governments should not make laws to compel people to do anything unless there is a pretty overwhelming case in the public interest for something to be made compulsory. We can all argue backwards and forwards about compulsory voting, but there is certainly no definitive either way. Therefore, there should be no law compelling people to vote.",44

138,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,"In leading for the Opposition in the debate on the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991, I point out that it implements Australia's part in giving effect to decisions taken at the ninth general review of the IMF case quotas last year, where Australia joined a consensus of member countries of the IMF, firstly, to increase quotas in order to enhance the capacity of the International Monetary Fund to provide effective assistance and, secondly, to strengthen the measures available for use against member countries in arrears with their accrued obligations to the International Monetary Fund. Essentially that would involve the suspension of the voting and associated rights of such members. The proposed increase in Australia's quota-its financial subscription to the resources of the Fund-is an increase of 44 per cent, from $A2.8 billion to $A4 billion. Lest this worries honourable members at a time of Budget stringency, let me stress that this is a financing, or 'below the line', transaction which does not affect the Budget outcome. It amounts to the substitution of one asset for another in the national balance sheet, so to speak. The foreign currency and special drawing rights, or SDRs, purchased from the Reserve Bank and deposited with the International Monetary Fund count as part of this country's international reserve 'assets, as they did before the transaction is made. Of course, with the IMF, the asset is augmentable in the event of an exchange crisis actually arising. In broad terms, the purpose of the International Monetary Fund is to promote a stable international monetary system by providing assistance, advances and loans of foreign currency to member countries in 'temporary' balance of payments difficulties. That is very much in Australia's interests, particularly, as I will argue, in its current and medium term perspective circumstances. I think that what I have just said is worth stressing, as there are elements-perhaps the League of Rights and other such organisations-which look on the International Monetary Fund as a potential threat to a country's sovereignty and which run scare campaigns against it. That is not a justifiable attitude. Actually the IMF is a very notable context for bringing individuals and nations to confront reality and, in so doing, to recognise and speak the truth. Witness the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in the context of the recent IMF meeting in Bangkok! He spoke out the truth about the Australian economy-that this is the deepest recession for 60 years-since the Great Depression. The situation now is worse than 1982-83, notwithstanding his assertions made today. The collapse in non-farm growth which we have witnessed in this recession is double the collapse of non-farm growth in the 1982 recession. So we do have the worse economic circumstances for 60 years, brought on by the wrong policies of the failed former Treasurer. It is true that in the event that the IMF is called upon because of an imminent or actual exchange rate crisis, considerable pressure will be applied for appropriate changes in policy to correct the situation. That is in the country's interest and also in the interest of the good husbanding of the Fund's resources. Again, over recent years large sums have been advanced by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in concert, for developing countries by way of adjustment loans. In those cases the advance has been conditional on the country undertaking to implement adjustment policy programs generally involving firm action to control inflation, changed government spending programs, reduced import barriers, the cutting of state subsidies and the freeing up of markets. For some that probably smacks of being a bit too 'rationalist' but, as I said, it is both in the interests of the country and the interests of the good husbanding of the resources of the IMF. . Only recently Mr Edmund Dell, a member of the Wilson-Callaghan Labor Government in Britain, which was first elected in 1974, published an inside account of Britain calling in the IMF in 1976. The circumstances were that in the 1974-75 financial year, government spending in Britain was increased on just about everything. Spending rose by some 35 per cent in money terms, 13 per cent in real terms, with inflation racing up to nearly 25 per cent. Unemployment soared thereafter and sterling went into free-fall. Britain proceeded to borrow from the International Monetary Fund the largest loan that body had ever made. The condition of the loan was a British letter of intent that 'an essential element of the Government's strategy will be a continuing and substantial reduction in spending over the next few years'. Rationalist economics it may seem, but it was the only sound course for policy. In Mr Dell's book, it is pointed out that the alternative of a siege economy, as advocated by Messrs Tony Benn and Tony Crosland of the British Left, would have been much worse. There must have been something in the air at that time because here in Australia the year 1974-75 saw an increase in spending of nearly 46 per cent in the one year by the Whitlam Government, largely under the stewardship of the then Treasurer, Jim Cairns. I believe that was the definitive beginning of the thrust towards steady decline in the Australian economy.. In the developing world, to which I referred a moment ago, in the past week we have seen the long-standing President of Zambia, Mr Kenneth Kaunda, swept from power in the first free elections for nearly 18 years. In the Economist of 5 November, under the heading 'out of the Maize', there is an account of Zambia'S recent negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. Maize, which is a staple food in Zambia, is in very short supply. There has been a corrupt regulation of maize growing. State marketing agencies pay farmers a relatively low price for maize, with the result that up to one-third of Zambian grown maize is smuggled out of the country, particularly to Zaire, where it brings far more. The Government nevertheless pays large subsidies to keep the price down even lower for city dwellers. Zambia has well over half its people located in the towns, thus being the most urban black African nation. It is said that former President Kenneth Kaunda accepted that farm prices should be set by the market and not by a command economics decree. But, having ruled for some three decades, while prior to this election last allowing free-ish elections 18 years ago, the President did not relish riots against higher prices for food with the upcoming election. The result was that, on 13 September last, the IMF and the World Bank suspended negotiations that would have given Zambia $US200m, which it desperately needs but not until the country should move to more sensible policies. As I said, the issue is not one of sovereignty but of a negotiated beneficial arrangement. Mexico is a significant example of where, with the necessary political will-but admittedly not without great pain and hardship-an IMF-style program can succeed. It was in 1982 that Mexico announced that it could no longer service its foreign debt. Between 1982 and 1988, the Mexican economy went backwards and the situation was a very grim one. It was in 1988 that President Salinas came to power, albeit in what was seen as a pretty questionable election. There followed a series of substantial policy changes. Levels of protection were cut; there was widespread deregulation; the budget deficit was reduced from the order of 12 per cent of GDP in 1988 to less than 2 per cent currently; and there was a very large program of privatisation involving the sale of nearly 900 commercial and industrial government enterprises. For example, the telephone network has just been sold. This privatisation program in fact has 'financed' significant growth in spending on education, health and urban and regional development, which has risen some 40 per cent in real terms, as I understand it, over the past three years. The country's foreign debt is now of the order of $84 billion, or 35. per cent of GDP, compared with 75 per cent in 1987. Interest payments as a proportion of export income have fallen from over 30 per cent to 18 per cent, which is less than the figure for Australia. This is not to deny, as I said, that there has been great pain and hardship associated with the process but, given the political will, the program can succeed and has succeeded to the longer term benefit of the population. Reverting to our own situation, there has been something of a tendency in recent days to play down the significance of Australia's own large and persistent current account deficit and the vast build-up in overseas debt-or, rather, in foreign liabilities. As we know, over the past five to six years the current account deficit has averaged nearly 5 per cent of GDP. In 1989-90, it was 6 per centthe highest in the developed world. There has been associated with that a more than fivefold increase in the overseas debt, with all our foreign liabilities, debt and equity, increasing to a net total of $176 billion at the latest count and still increasing. That involves a servicing cost, net dividends and interest payable overseas, amounting to 25 per cent of export earnings or about 4 liz per cent of gross domestic product. I will not dwell on the causes of that burgeoning current account deficit and debt build-up. But undoubtedly the basic cause was the persistent tendency for too much domestic spending relative to our productive capacity or, in familiar shorthand, too little saving, and that occurring in a context of inadequate competitiveness stemming from persistent high inflation and high real interest rateshopefully we are getting on top of the former problem now-and an abysmal performance in respect of productivity. The too high domestic spending stemmed from the policy of Labor, from the start of its term of government being openly 'expansionist' - as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself at the time was wont to put it-in the pursuit of the 'jobs, jobs, jobs' catch cry of the 1983 summit. Significantly and perhaps ominously, the same cry is now being echoed with the Victorian Premier, Joan Kirner, and the inconstant honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), an aspirant to some higher office, leading the charge.",47
139,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,"It'll be a case of jobless, jobless, jobless, then.",50
140,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,"As my colleague says, the situation is one of jobless, jobless, jobless; it is a very serious situation and is causing much anguish and difficulty. The main factors pushing domestic demand in the early years were the Hawke-keating Budget deficits of 1983-84 to 1985-86, which produced a huge financing requirement. This was rapidly translated into monetary expansion, higher inflation, external deficit and a rapid increase in the overseas debt. For a very detailed account of that, one should look at the Tasman Institute's recent publication titled Treasurer Keating s Legacy. In the second half of the 1980s, the dramatic overheating of the economy was the problem. This included a significant component of private investment, albeit too little of it in productive plant and equipment. That dramatic overheating of the economy stemmed from too low interest rates maintained for too long on top of a surge in commodity prices. In the context of the overheated economy of 198889, the current account deficit amounted to 6 per cent of GDP. As I said, this was the highest in the Western world. I note that, having brought on that overheated economy, the then Treasurer resorted to the murderously high interest rates-business rates in excess of 20 per cent for over a year-which led to the Keating homemade recession. From the balance of payments and IMP perspective, which is the subject of the Bill before the House, what was new over all that period, as compared with earlier decades, was the high international capital mobility with the integration of international capital markets and the elimination of exchange controls. Australia has been a notable instance of the willingness of international financial markets in this new environment to continue financing what, in historical terms, have been very large current account deficits and to do so over longer periods. It is true that there was some drama with the rapid depreciation of the exchange rate in 1985-86, culminating in the banana republic comment in May 1986. There was even some alarmist talk about calling in the IMF-which again brings me back to the focus of this Bill. But in the event, the credibility of Australian economic policy was sustained. Credibility in policy is the name of the game and is what is central to marketplace success. Let me say that the sorts of leadership games being played at the moment by the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland are very bad indeed for the effective conduct of policy against the current account deficit and the horrendous problem of unemployment in this country. As I said, in the event the credibility of Australian economic policy was sustained. It was sustained because, as compared with the large Budget deficits of the early years, the Budget was brought into balance in 1987-88 and into surplus thereafter, albeit not, as would have been more desirable, by reducing the Commonwealth's own expenditure to any significant extent. Then, of course, beginning in April 1988, the disastrous high interest rates regime, which I mentioned a moment ago, with business rates in excess of 20 per cent for more than a year, was implemented and brought on this current recession, which is the deepest since the 1930s. So, albeit the antecedent monetary ease and the mix of policy, with too much reliance on high interest rates, were wrong, this was seen as tough enough fiscal and monetary policy to sustain credibility in the markets and with the IMF. Hence, the financing of deficits so large for so long. This still leaves Australia as a country at high risk. In my opinion, the recent more optimistic assessment of the current account deficit and the debt which I referred to earlier-including the Treasurer's Budget speech line that we were within cooee of stabilising the debt; that is to say, the debt to GDP ratio' the debt itself is still increasing-is misplaced and wrong. Th-t - ould be borne out by the report brought m m the last day of sitting by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). The situation is that we are at the bottom of the worse recession in 60 years. With national spe-ding dow,n by about 7 per cent and, in partIcular, wIth the collapse of business investment, of course imports have been significantly reduced-or had been until the last mon- 's data w-en they very substantially rose, which was m the wrong direction. Exports, especially exports of manufactures, are up. But, as the Business Council of Australia has questioned: at what profit margins? Dare I instance the sale of Ford Capris? And with what sustainability as domestic demand revives? Dare I instance steel. I heard an executive of BHP Whyalla say the other day, 'we are dumping the steel into the international market to keep the blast furnaces going'. There is no profit. 'The truth is that there is deep recession. Ap- from that, little has changed. As I said, ommously the cry of 'jobs, jobs, jobs' heard, and there is pressure for increased government spending to create jobs-jobs of total any sort. That is a recipe for the repeat boom-bust cycle. Carry it too far and the markets will move-this is appropriate in context of our discussion on the IMF-to sustainable exact retribution, in which event we could be grateful for a supportive IMF! It would cerfour tainly mean a continuation of the trend of - ecent years of declining living standards, mcreasmg debt and, now, stubborn high unemployment. That has been the situation. much better way is to grasp the nettle now and to implement the across the board reform agenda to achieve the fundamental change needed to meet the challenge to tum this country around. In very simple terms, taking a very long look, the fact is that in Australia we have had many years of complacency, to put it at its mildest, and a gradual slip from being a country ranking in the first half dozen of the world in terms of GDP per head down to a ranking of about 20 or so. Outside our high productivity rural sector which has now fallen on hard times and the mineral industries, Australia's standard of business slipped. Even BHP had to be rescued with public money after 1982. The rate of slippage-and I do not mean BHP in this sentence; it has pulled up its socks-accelerated in recent years. There has been a refusal to acknowledge adequately the reality of our situation. As a recent issue of the Business Review Jfeekly put it, 'the easy times have gone'. There is a vast challenge facing this country to work our way to a containment of the debt, to renewed growth and high employment and so to regain sustainable prosperity. In the context of that degree of optimism about the debt to which I have referred, very briefly in conclusion I would like to take a look at the broad orders of magnitude of what is required if Australia is to achieve low inflation, high employment economic growth, rising living standards and a reduced current account deficit so as to at least stabilise the ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP. Without the benefit of a formal model, the broad shape of what is required can be put in the following is way. As I said previously, the net income payable overseas in respect of the existing of net overseas liabilities is of the order of the of 4tlz per cent of GDP. An appropriate growth path will require this to be met by this increased net export production-from a transfer of national resources into net export production of the order of three to percentage points. Time will prevent my elaborating on that, but it has regard to the situation that now prevails and the longer term norm 2112 per cent balance of payments A deficit that Australia can sustain. In these circumstances, we will be looking at a situation in the medium term future where total national production must grow faster than domestic demand, that is, private and public consumption and investment. but National production must grow faster than domestic demand to make way for the susas tainable increase in net exports. Now there something of a consensus that to work force increasing in line with population a growth rate of total national production of the order of 3 1/4 percentage points per is necessary-say, 31fz per cent to make inroads into the existing unemployment. According to EPAe and other estimates, that is likely to require a level of public and private investment, including in particular investment in import and export replacement industries, of the order of 25 to 27 per cent GDP. As the level of national savings has averaged only 20 to 21 per cent of GDP the past decade, that will require a tal change in national savings habits. In the private sector the GST will help-and almost certainly sustained Budget surpluses in public accounts will be required. Further, with a growth rate of GDP of order of 3 1h per cent it will be difficult to contain imports to much less than that order. It is not a very easy matter to bend and reshape the structure of an economy but to effect a transfer of even half a percentage point-we talked of the need for three or four points-into net exports will require a tainable increase in exports of the order of billion or 7 per cent each year over a period of five, six or seven years. To my knowledge, there has been no time when this country has achieved such a tained growth in exports, that is, net exports over and above imports, and in gross domesMonetary tic product. That underlines the magnitude the challenge before us. I say again that country needs urgently an across the board program of reform to effect fundamental change in attitudes, the law, institutions, attitudes to performance and work, and striving in every corner of the land for best international practice. I add that there is required the reassertion of what one might call traditional individual and corporate morality. As I stressed the other day in this House, that process will be a long haul and it will be easy. Fundamental change never is easy, there is no other way. What is at stake is nothing less than this Australia in the future a dynamic, prosperous, responsible, comis passionate society-a major player in the fast absorb a growing Asia-pacific region.",50
141,Mr LANGMORE,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,"Fraser) (5.24 p.m.)annum The speech of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) was about a very important subject, Australia's current account deficit, but it really was not about the subject matter of this Bill. I would love to be able to deal at length with the comments that he made, but fortunately my own views on of that are published in a report which I tabled about two weeks ago on Australia's current in account deficit and overseas debt. I hope fundamenhonourable members will read that. We are today talking about the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreethe ment Amendments) Bill. This is a very important Bill. The IMF seems a long way from the Australia. We do not hear much news about it in Australia, but it is the organisation that has the responsibility for overseeing the global financial system. In this Bill we are asked to support an increase of 44 per cent in Australia's quota in the Fund. Overall, there are increases of, on average, 50 per cent being susapproved by all members of the IMF. The $4 increase that was negotiated for Australia this time was 44 per cent. That retains our ranking as the thirteenth largest member. It is very important to replenish and increase the Fund's susresources through this quota allocation. I strongly support the Bill. The International Fund has a very important role in of the global system. It is responsible-as is this pointed out in one of its own publications which I was sent in preparing the notes for this speech-not only for overseeing the international monetary system but also for the promoting exchange stability and orderly exchange relations among member countries. also It assists members, both industrialised and developing countries, that find themselves in temporary balance of payments diftlculties by providing short to medium term credits, and it supplements the currency reserves of its not members through the allocation of special drawing rights. Those are profoundly important tasks. The Fund was set up after the Bretton Woods conference towards the end of the Second World War and has since gone through some evolution. During the 1980s it concentrated heavily on the imbalances relating to developing countries. That suggests some criticisms have to be made of the Fund. During the 1980s there were enormous imbalances and instabilities in the world. There have been high current account deficits in many industrialised and developing countries and there have been a number of countries which have remained in surplus for very long periods. Those instabilities have contributed, through the domestic adjustment policies that have been required to try to cope with them, to the depth of the recession, and, indeed, depression, in many developing countries. There is an asymmetry in the way that the Fund operates. It gives much more attention at present to the problems of developing countries and too little to the problems of industrialised countries. The country with the biggest current account deficit is the United States, but who has ever heard of the Fund requiring the United States to change its domestic policies to reduce the extent of that deficit? That just does not happen. It is difficult for the Fund to urge its largest and most powerful member to change its domestic policies, but if it is to be consistent with its charter that is what it ought to do. There are asymmetries in the way that deficit countries and surplus countries are treated. There is much more attention given to the problems of current account deficit countries than there is to the problems of current account surplus countries. There have been statements that have urged more expansionary policies on surplus countries which would have had the effect of reducing the size of their surplus. I am not suggesting that the Fund has entirely neglected this imbalance but I think it can be accurately said that there has been an asymmetry. A common criticism of the Fund is that its policies are simplistic, meaning that the same kinds of remedies are recommended for all deficit countries. It is true that there has been a fairly high level of consistency in the policies that have been recommended and, some would say, regardless of the circumstances of the countries which are being advised. The Fund's normal approach to deficit countries has been to urge them to cut public expenditure, to reduce the rate of growth of their monetary supply, to cut wages, to cut subsidies, to liberalise their trading arrangements, to liberalise financial markets, to privatise State authorities and, in general, to impose austere policies. I do not doubt that there are many countries where some of those policies, to some degree, are entirely responsible. It is quite clear that some of the developing countries do have overblown and very inefficient public sectors. There undoubtedly have been excessive subsidies on food or energy in some places. Undoubtedly, wages have grown too high in some places. But the situation is different in every country; there has not been an adequate recognition of that difference. There has been an ideological bias in the way the Fund has addressed the problems of countries it has been advising during the 1980s which has meant that its policies and proposals have been less effective than they ought to have been. We have only to look at the developing world during the 1980s, and the relationship of the developing world to the industrialised world, to see many serious problems. Many parts of the developing world have gone through a severe depression. There has been a net flow of funds from the developing countries to the industrialised countries for much of that decade. In fact, the flow of funds from the debtor countries to the creditor countries has been substantial indeed; it totals around a net $US50 billion a year at present. That means that for the last decade the poor have been subsidising the rich, partly because the problems that those debtor countries have had have not adequately been addressed by the international financial institutions that are advising the Fund and the World Bank. There has also been a deflationary bias in the policies that the Fund has recommended. There has been a consistent pattern of cutting government putlays, cutting wages and reducing services, in ways that have contributed to a slowing down of investment and, therefore, an even greater depth in the recession and delay in recovery. That deflationary bias has contributed to worsening the conditions of the poor in many developing countries; it has certainly contributed to reducing average living standards in many of them; and, whilst the Fund would argue that that treatment might well be justified by the benefits of the cure, in many of those countries the cure is not yet evident. The policies have been so severe that in many places they have contributed to worsening the situation, rather than leading to a quick, tough policy change resulting in rapid recovery. If there had been the result that was expected at the time the recommendations were being made, then most of those developing countries would now be growing rapidly; they are not. It is true that some have pulled through. It is certainly true that the Fund's policies have been of great benefit in some countries. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) mentioned Mexico. It is true that Mexico, following a period of appalling disarray and depression, is now coming out of it and appears to be on a rapid development path. There have been improvements in a number of other countries as well. But it is also true that for most of Africa, for parts of Asia and Latin America, those policies have not yet worked; nor, without modification, do they look as though they are going to work adequately and effectively. So the policies of the Fund need to become more sophisticated, less ideologically biased and more attentive to the exact situation of each country that is being advised-in other words, in a sense, more pragmatic and more attuned to what each country needs. Of course, it would help if the industrialised countries were making more effective adjustments themselves. As long as there is an enormous current account deficit in the United States, and considerable surpluses in Japan and one or two of the newly industrialising countries, there are imbalances which exacerbate the problems. The Fund needs to address those problems symmetrically and also with symmetrical policies. It would also help globally if interest rates were reduced. I welcome the reduction that has occurred in Australian interest rates and hope that there are further reductions, both for domestic and international reasons. One of the central problems at present is that there is a global shortage of capital. That is, by the way, in sharp contrast to the situation in the mid-1980s, when it looked as though the supply of capital was growing too fast. But there is certainly a global shortage of funds able to be invested at present. The Fund could contribute to that by making a new issue of special drawing rights. Following discussions I had during a recent visit to Europe-in Britain, France and Germany-I understand that there is some increase in support for a new issue of special drawing rights for the Fund. At this stage that is not supported by the United States, but I think it is a policy that ought to be officially and rigorously re-examined, because a new issue of special drawing rights, particularly if it were targeted at the most indebted countriesor at the poorest countries-would contribute in an effective way towards increasing the global supplies of liquidity and reducing poverty. So there is a considerable amount of room for reform. I think the Fund has learnt some and lessons during recent years. The present head of the Fund is an extremely capable man and rather more pragmatic than his predecessor. I have noted, for example, that he has adopted a policy of recommending cuts in military expenditure to debtor countries-and countries in general-and that, of course, is a very wise thing for him to do, because military expenditure is a great diversion from social and economic deVelopment. The funds that are spent on armies could be far more productively spent on infrastructure. It is good to see that Camdessus was supporting those cuts in expenditure and actively calling for them at the recent meetings of the Fund in Bangkok. He received a lot of support from many governments, including our own, I am glad to say. That is just one symbol of some change in orientation. There is a recognition in the Fund that some of its policies in the mid-1980s were too severe, too sharp, and that real damage was done. There is a recognition that policies have to be more gradual. They may take longer, but if the poor are to be protected, that is an inevitable consequence. In conclusion, I strongly support this Bill because we must have an effective international financial institution that is overseeing the global financial system. Much that the Fund does is valuable, but there is considerable room for improvement in the policies that it adopts, and also it could enter new areas that so far it has not gone into. I am grateful to the Australian executive director's office for the help that it has given me over the years in providing information on the Fund, such as what it is doing and the number of member countries.",52
142,Mrs CROSIO,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,"Like my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), I rise to support the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991. Having listened to the speech of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), I note that he did not touch on anything at all to do with the Bill and the amendments that it makes. I point out for the information of the honourable member for Berowra that the International Monetary Fund was established in 1944 as part of a post-world War II burden sharing concept. Although the IMF was initiated many years ago, since its inception the Fund has been able to maintain its relevance and adapt to changes in the international economy while remaining faithful to its objectives. The basic objectives of the IMF continue to be to encourage balanced trade and, through its expansion, to stimulate employment and real incomes, to help countries balance their external payments, and to foster liberal trade and payments arrangements. The primary role of the IMF remains the giving of financial assistance to any member in balance of payment difficulties which is prepared to undertake appropriate economic reform programs. It is in this context that the roles of the IMF and the World Bank are often confused. Both institutions seek to promote the economic development of the world's poorer countries. The World Bank assists developing countries through long term financing of development projects and programs and acquires most of its financial resources by borrowing on the international bond market. It also has an authorised capital of $95 billion, of which members pay in about 9 per cent. The International Monetary Fund, on the other hand, oversees the international monetary system, promotes stability and orderly exchange relations among its member countries and assists all members, both industrial and developing countries, that find themselves in temporary balance of payments difficulties by providing short to medium term credits. The Fund also supplements the currency reserves of its members through the allocation of special drawing rights, or SDRs, and to date has issued 21.4 billion SDRs to member countries. The IMF relies on the subscriptions or quotas of its 151 member countries to enable it to continue to help members with balance of payment difficulties. Quotas are allocated mainly on economic criteria and closely reflect voting rights of the members. Australia has the thirteenth largest quota. The Fund itself now has more than $120 billion, or 90 billion special drawing rights, at its disposal in fully paid quotas. To fully understand the relevance and importance of the IMF in today's international economy-and, therefore, the importance of this legislation-it is necessary to address the Fund's objectives in more depth. One objective of the IMF which has come to the fore in recent years is the surveillance of the orderly exchange of national currencies. Each member country must keep other countries informed via the IMF about its arrangements for determining the exchange rate of its currency. It must also resist putting restrictions on the exchange of its currency for others and pursue constructive economic policies which contribute to the stability of the international monetary and financial system, and foster balanced economic growth throughout the entire membership. The IMF surveys all aspects of a member's economy which impact upon its exchange rate and also Â«valuates the country's economic performance. In this way, the Fund acts as a guardian over the total international-I stress 'international' - economy. The IMF also has the potential to provide policy advice to member countries, a valuable service to developing countries. The high level of technical expertise of the Fund's staff is a major asset which enables it to give specialised economic advice to members. The IMF evaluates world economic developments and contributes to international coordination of economic policies, particularly of major industrialised members. The IMF also runs an educational institute in Washington through which the workings of the international monetary system are taught. Representatives from any member country are welcome to participate in this if they wish. The principal mission of the IMF, however, is to make funds available to its members to assist with balance of payments difficulties. The IMF has come in for criticism of this arrangement and agreement whereby members can receive financial assistance on the proviso that they follow the Fund's suggested economic refoons. For instance, the IMF has been accused of applying identical remedies to member countries, irrespective of their circumstances. The fact is, however, that there can be no standard remedy to external payment problems, owing to the varying causes of the problems. According to a paper put out by the External Relations Department of the IMF entitled Ten Common Misconceptions About the IMF: ... the Fund can only work on a country-bycountry basis and must tailor its policy recommendations accordingly. . . As a matter of explicit policy, the Fund does not take a position on social and political issues, but works within the existing sociopolitical system of its member countries. In formulating its policies, the Fund is concerned with the broad economic aggregates that promote a viable balance of payments and economic growth. In so doing, it will seek to adapt the instruments macroeconomic management available in the country to its economic system. Sometimes there are some similarities between programs, but this is usually because there are common elements in the problems faced by the countries, such as external payments difficulties, excess government spending and entrenched inflation. Also, delays in approaching the IMF can limit the available policy options. However, the Fund claims that its approach is not a rigid one. According to the IMF, it is always ready to consider ways that will help its members restore payments, viability and growth. The IMF, in its aforementioned paper, stated that Fund-supported programs concentrated primarily on helping countries achieve and sustain a viable balance of payments. Achieving such an objective entailed some costs in the short run, according to the IMF, since a country must return to living within its means after living beyond them. By and large, the Fund's recommendations are aimed at correcting short term imbalances and improving long term competitiveness. Rarely does the IMF address areas which member countries have always considered to be the prerogative of national sovereignty, such as sectoral wage rates or individual government programs. The IMF has stated that its programs encourage the elimination of inefficiency and waste, and clear the way for longer term structural efforts to promote durable growth in members' economies. Fund-supported programs are designed to achieve the necessary adjustment in a manner that is in the interest of the members' long term prospects. According to the IMF, the general conclusion of studies of the effects of Fund-supported programs is that they have had a very positive effect by improving the efficiency with which existing resources are used, encouraging growth and increasing the amount of resources available to the countries. In the rapidly changing and new international environment of the 1990s, issues of international economic growth and development, by necessity, must take an even more prominent place on the IMF's agenda. of Substantial economic progress has been made in some regions, such as in parts of Asia and Latin America, but many needs remain unaddressed. This is particularly apparent in some areas of Africa, where unfortunately economic and social conditions have continued to deteriorate. One factor which is crucial to the economic future of developed and developing countries is the need to strengthen and liberalise the multilateral trading system--something the IMF has been endeavouring to achieve for many years. According to the IMF, the liberalisation of trade would not only boost world economic growth but also engender the stability and confidence needed by the emerging market economies of central and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as well as provide an important stimulus to development efforts in Latin America, Asia and Africa. For the benefits of balanced domestic policies to be fully realised, the major dustrialised countries must play their part contributing to the growth of developing countries through the IMF. By maintaining their contributions, these countries help foster greater stability in the international economic environment and aid in the removal of intercosts national barriers to economic development. Following the international debt crisis in the early 1980s, financial assistance from the was in great demand. However, loans which were meant to be short term have become rather long term as a number of borrowing countries have been unable to to the IMF on time. To enable the IMF to continue to achieve its objectives, it requires more financial reserves. The purpose of this legislation primarily to approve the increase in Australia's IMF quota. The quotas of all member countries were reviewed a 50 per cent increase was voted for by the Australia members. This increase in quotas will help reduce the IMF's arrears burden and will diminution mean that the Fund is in a better situation stimulate international economic growth and development. The proposed increase in quotas is therefore important for the stability of international monetary system. By taking up our increased quota of 44 per cent, Australia will be continuing to support the IMF whilst ensuring that our relative voting power in it is not eroded. the information of the honourable member for Berowra, Australia has never borrowed from the IMF and is unlikely to do so. Yet our used. subscription to the Fund is part of our international responsibility. The IMF has important role to play in helping overcome the many challenges facing the world economy and in fostering a favourable environment for economic growth. It therefore needs the support of all member countries for it to perform its role productively. The other purpose of this Bill is to formalise an agreement Australia has already made with the IMF to accept an amendment to the IMF articles. This amendment will enable the IMF to take action against members who fail to fulfil their obligations under the articles, particularly those who refuse to incooperate in the repayment of arrears. The in arrears problem has rapidly worsened since the mid-1980s and consists of overdue obligations of a small number of IMF members, some having been in arrears for several years or more. Arrears impose substantial on the IMF which require increased charges and reduced compensation for members. It is for this reason that it is so necesIMF sary for this legislation to be passed. By increasing the quotas of member countries, the IMF is relieved of some of the financial strains of having such enormous sums of repay their debt money owed to it. Also, by making the suspension of voting and associated rights a compulsory step in the review process, the amendment to the articles is will increase the IMF's capacity to deal with persistently uncooperative members. According to the Australian Financial Review on 5 in 1990, and September 1991: can be expected to benefit directly under the amendment to the extent that there would be a of the arrears problem and therefore to lower costs to be borne by other members. This is a move which I am certain the vast majority of member countries would support. the In comparison to Australia's current quota of 1.6 million in special drawing rights as of some April 1988, Chile's IMF quota was 440.5m special drawing rights, or 0.5 per cent of total quotas, according to the IMF annual report of For 1988. At the same time, Chile has used some 996.815 of its SDRs. This represents 3.6 per cent of the total IMF resources now being Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose you may an wonder why I am mentioning that particular country but, as you will realise, we have just had an inter-parliamentary conference in Chile and I was very impressed by the information that was available to us as a delegation from Australia. The funds lent to Chile by the IMF were not particularly earmarked for specific projects. Rather, they provided a pool of funds available to the government to lend within general guidelines set out by the IMP. As with other borrowers-and perhaps I disagree with my colleague the honourable memb-r for Fraser (Mr Langmore)-and consistent with the Fund's terms, the IMF imposed a range of conditions on the use of its funds by Chile. Quantitative policy targets, such as the amount of credit growth, were imposed by the IMP on many of its clients, including Chile, from the 1950s. The IMP conditions at that time were generally aimed at controlling inflation and overcoming balance of payments difficulties. The conditions imposed on Chile by the IMF following the agreement to make funds available involved credit limits, budget targets, exchange rate controls, foreign debt, restrictions on foreign exchange, wages, and prices. In 1958, credit limits were imposed by the IMF on central bank loans and investmentsÂ·and on the issue of notes and coins in Chile. In subsequent years, the target variables were changed to aggregates such as gross domesticÂ·assets and central bank domestic assets. Throughout most of the 1960s, limits were then targeted at net domestic credit of the central bank. In the mid-1970s, the target was again switched to net domestic banking credit, which included commercial banks as well as government banks. The only attempt to explicitly target interest rates in Chile was 1975. The IMF also prescribed a range limits to the amount of foreign debt held Chile's banks. In regard to budget targets most of the 1960s, the IMF required Chile produce budget surpluses so as to avoid the inflationary impact of non-financed governdifficult ment expenditure-otherwise known as At printing money. Conditions were also imposed on exchange rates, and as well the key objecAmerican tive of the IMF was to encourage clients adopt realistic exchange rates. While Chile has largely maintained a system of dual exchange rates, IMP agreements encouraged market forces to be reflected in a system of pegged rates-that is, a floating peg to respond to Chile's balance of payments problems. At present, Chile's exchange rate is relatively flexible by international standards-partly as a result of these conditions of the IMP. Restrictions on foreign exchange were addressed in the terms and conditions under which Chile borrowed money from the IMP. Assistance given to Chile in 1956 was conditional on the elimination of restrictions on payments for imports. Later, restrictions on imports were permitted only for social or political reasons, not to alter the balance of payments. Wages and prices in Chile were also dealt with by the IMP. The primary aim of all these conditions imposed on Chile by the IMP was to control inflation and stabilise the balance of payments. The programs aimed at controlling inflation which were enforced in the mid1950s had some success, but the accompanying economic slowdown led the government to expand the money supply in 1958, leading to a surge in inflation. The same pattern was repeated in the early 1960s and limited success was achieved after that. There was a period of hyper-inflation in the mid1970s and, despite strict policies, reductions in inflation were gradual. Chile's balance of payments position was heavily dependent on world copper prices, although the IMF pressure clearly led to trade liberalisation. While the Chilean economy has grown steadily since the 1960s, with that very severe downturn in 1975, growth rates were not in particularly good by international standards. of Periods of adjustment in Chile have been by associated with very high unemployment for rates-for example, 16 per cent during the to readjustment in 1975. An overall assessment of the impact of the IMF policies on Chile is due to the variety of factors at work. present, Chile is in a significantly better debt situation compared with other South debtors. The IMP regards Chile as to one of its successes, with its debt problem under control. Chile's agreement for debt rescheduling in 1990 was expected to be its last rescheduling accord, and Chile's creditors regard the country as no longer having a commercial debt problem. At the same time, economic growth is relatively healthy and inflation, though substantial, is low by South American standards. However, the implementation of the IMF guidelines was uneven, and the last few decades have witnessed sharp swings in policy making it difficult to determine how much of the present situation was due to compliance with IMF guidelines or lack of compliance, or other factors such as world copper prices, culture or political factors. After a year of democratic government, Chile's economy has maintained its inherent strengths and is characterised by a remarkable stability. The Aylwin Government has continued the pragmatic and tough-minded economic policies it inherited from Pinochet which were designed to open the Chilean economy and diversify Chile's exports, thereby moderating Chile's historical overdependence on mineral exports. A sustainable growth rate has been assisted by continuing very high levels of foreign investment. Although inflation increased during 1990 to about 27 per cent, it remained low by regional standards. Obviously Chile has been a success. story for the IMF to a large extent, and is a good example of what can be achieved with the assistance of the Fund's special drawing reserves. From the research that I have conducted into the role and the objectives of the IMP in the international economy and from the very first-hand experience I have had in seeing how the economy of Chile is now being run, I thoroughly SUppOlt this legislation and commend the Bill to the House.",55
143,Mr FREE,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,"Lindsay-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (6.00 p.m.)-in reply-I would like to thank those honourable members who have taken part in this debate. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), in a wide ranging speech, referred to a variety of matters not strictly connected with the terms of the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill. This is not the appropriate time to deal with them, but I do note his support for the Bill on behalf of the Opposition and also his support for the work of the IMF. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) made a plea for reform, pointing to the need for the policies of the Fund to take into account particular imbalances and special circumstances obtaining in particular countries. I am sure that the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) will be taking account of his views. I also thank the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) for her contribution. She gave a comprehensive coverage of the activities of the IMF, and I am sure the House is better informed as a result of her contribution. Question resolved in the affirmative.

144,Mr DUFFY,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Senate's amendment No.1 be amended by omitting from proposed clause 3 all the words from and including ""amended"" and substituting the following: ""amended: (a) by omitting 'The copyright' and substituting 'Subject to section 44A, the copyright'; (b) by omitting 'where, to his knowledge,' and substituting 'if the importer knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that'.II. The Government proposes to agree in substance with amendments Nos 1 to 4 and 6 to 9 made by the Senatej subject to some necessary amendments which are mainly of a technical and clarifying nature. However, the Government will not accept amendments Nos 5 and 10, which relate to an exception from the 30-day publication rule for Australian adaptations. These amendments are contrary to the most important reform being introduced by the Bill, namely, to provide Australian readers with early access to all overseas books. There have been long and detailed discussions with the Opposition in respect of these matters. I thank the Opposition for the constructive approach it adopted in relation to the Senate amendments. Amendment No. 1 alters the knowledge requirement for a defendant from actual knowledge to constructive knowledge. It is basically acceptable to the Government because it will bring the elements of civil infringement under the Copyright Act into line with the criminal infringement provisions, which was a recommendation of the Copyright Law Reform Committee, the CLRC. Whilst the Government originally intended that this particular CLRC recommendation be considered with other remaining recommendations in the context of all copyright material, not just books, we can accept its implementation in the Act now. However, this acceptance is subject to a minor drafting change that will reintroduce the effect of clause 3 of the Bill, which states that section 37 of the Copyright Bill-that is, the main provision concerning the infringement of copyright by importation of copyright materials for commercial purposes-is subject to the exemption being introduced by the new section 44A. I understand it was an inadvertent effect of the Senate amendment to delete that reference subject to section 44A and section 37 of the Act. Amendment No. 1 will also substitute the word 'importer' for 'person', which is also a clarifying amendment.  We are responding to the first motion moved by the Attorney-Genera] (Mr Duffy) in regard to Senate amendment No. 1. He has distributed in his name the further amendments which were passed in another place. The Attorney General is right in referring to the extensive negotiations that have occurred between the Government and the Opposition. I pay tribute to the Attorney-General for his full cooperation in this regard. As a consequence, we have changed our attitude-there were two amendments involved, but they relate to one particular' point-that is, we foreshadow Senate amendments Nos 5 and 10. I do not want to be on my feet seriatim for every amendment that the Attorney will be moving. I foreshadow that, in regard to the 10 amendments that will be made to the Bill, firstly, we will be accepting amendments Nos 1 to 4 and 6 to 9, inclusive; secondly, whilst accepting the substance of those amendments, further amendments of a technical nature are needed; and, thirdly, amendments Nos 5 and 10. as indicated by the Attorney-General as unacceptable to the Government - are also unacceptable to us, on reflection, for reasons that I will explain when we reach amendment No.5. In other words, our attitude is similar to that of the Government. The Bill was last before the House on 14 May. when it was passed with 13 amendments. Upon being transmitted to the Senate, the Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which held a public hearing on 12 August. As a result of submissions put to the Committee. the Senate made further amendments to the Bill when it came on for debate on 20 and 21 August. I reiterate that Senate amendments Nos 1 to 4 and 6 to 9 inclusive are supported by us but not Senate amendments Nos 5 and 10, for reasons which I will give later. Amendment, as amended, agreed to.",62
145,Mr DUFFY,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Senate's amendment No.2 be amended by omitting from proposed clause 4 all the words from and including ""amended"" and substituting the following: ""amended: (a) by omitting from subsection (1) 'The copyright' and substituting 'Subject to section 44A, the copyright'; (b) by omitting from subsection (1) 'where, to his knowledge,' and substituting 'if the importer knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that'."". Very briefly, Senate amendment No. 2 is acceptable to the Government for the same reasons as amendment No. 1. This is also subject to similar drafting changes, as necessary, for the Bill to restate and clarify that section 38 of the Act, concerning copyright infringement by undertaking certain commercial dealings with unlicensed import copyright materials, is also subject to section 44A, which I referred to in the previous amendment. Amendment, as amended, agreed to.",63
146,Mr DUFFY,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Senate's amendment No.3 be amended: (1) by omitting from proposed subsection (3) ""verifiable order"" and substituting ""written order, or a verifiable telephone order,""; (2) by inserting in proposed paragraph (3)(b) ""verifiable"" after ""makes a"". Senate amendment No.3 relates to the single copy provision, section 44A(3), to allow a bookseller to import single copies of books for the purpose of filling a customer's order for personal use placed by telephone. That is acceptable to the Government and also to the Opposition, subject to including an amendment that will remove the ambiguity in the provision. By allowing the importation of a book to satisfy a customer's telephone order, the Senate amendment leaves it uncertain whether orders could be made otherwise than by telephone or in writing, for example, orally, or, for that matter, across the counter. In the case of a telephone order, whether the customer's statement-that is, for personal useis required to be verifiable is also uncertain. These ambiguities leave a possible loophole that could lead to importation beyond the limits intended by the Parliament. \. Amendment, as amended, agreed to.",63
147,Mr DUFFY,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Senate's amendment No.4 be amended: (1) by omitting ""subsection"" and substituting ""subsections""; (2) by omitting from proposed subsection (3A) all the words from and including ""a number of copies"" and substituting the following: ""2 or more copies of a non-infringing book into Australia if: (a) the importation is for the purpose of filling a written order, or a verifiable telephone order, placed with the person by or on behalf of a library, other than a library conducted for the profit (direct or indirect) of a person or organisation; and (b) in the case of a written order-the order contains a statement, signed by the person placing the order, to the effect that the library does not intend to use any of the books for a purpose mentioned in paragraph 37(a), (b) or (c); and (c) in the case of a telephone order-the person placing the order makes a verifiable statement to the effect referred to in paragraph (b); and (d) the number of copies so imported is not more than the number of copies so ordered""; (3) by adding at the end of proposed subsection (3A) the following proposed subsection: ""'(3B) Without limiting the ways in which a telephone order under subsection (3) or (3A), or a statement under paragraph (3)(b) or (3A)(c) relating to such an order, may be verified, such an order or statement is, for the purposes of this section, taken to be verifiable if the person who takes the order, or to whom the statement is made, makes a written note of the details of the order or statement when, or inunediately after, the order is placed, or the statement is made, as the case may be.'."". This amendment introduces into the Bill the right to import multiple copies of books at any time to supply verifiable library orders. The Government accepts and agrees with the intention of these amendments which is to not limit libraries to the single copy provision of the Bill. However, the Senate amendments introduce a new exception to a copyright owner's rights and it should not be ambiguous or have unintended consequences in its operation. The Government considers it desirable to have consistent wording with the single copy provision in section 44A(3). The Senate amendment, as drafted, could well have some unintentional consequences. For example, it leaves uncertain whether the importation permitted needs to be for the purpose of filling that particular order. Also, the amendment does not prevent the importation of books ordered by libraries for the purpose of on-selling, as opposed to adding to their collections. Further, the amendment allows only the importation of the exact numbers specified in the library order. If the overseas supplier was able to supply only a lesser number, for example, 90 instead of 100, the importation would not be permissible under the amendment made in the Senate. We consider it is necessary to address these ambiguities and the inconsistencies with the wording of section 44A(3). It is also necessary to include a provision referring to how a telephone order or a statement relating to such an order may be verified for the purposes of both the single copy and library copy provisions. This is not a definitive meaning but provides that a telephone order or statement is taken to be verifiable if the person who takes the order or to whom the statement is made makes a written note at the time or just after the order or statement is made. Again, that is a matter which was discussed in some detail with the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable  advisers from the Opposition as well. Amendment, as amended, agreed to.",64
148,Mr DUFFY,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Senate's amendment No.5 be disagreed to. This amendment introduces an opportunity for the publisher of a new overseas book to retain control over parallel importation without having to publish in Australia within 30 days. The publisher can achieve this control if he or she contracts to bring out an Australian version and can satisfy the Copyright Tribunal that the intention to publish is genuine and that it will constitute a substantial revision or modification for Australian consumers. If the Tribunal is satisfied of these elements, it has no discretion but to stay the application of the 30-day rule to the original overseas book for an indefinite period. In the Government's view-it is also the Opposition's view, as indicated earlier-this amendment would substantially weaken the basic reform being introduced; that is, earlier access by Australian readers to new overseas books. In principle, we reject the notion that Australian readers should be deprived of that access to the original book for a substantial period while readers in other countries have such access. We do not accept that a publisher of a new overseas book not published in Australia in YO days should be able to retain some control over distribution based on the intention only to publish an Australian version. If there is a perceived market for an Australian version, it will not be the same as the market for the original. Apart from the Government's fundamental objection to Senate amendment No.5, there are other objections in detail. For example, there is no time limit on bringing out the Australian version, so the publisher could delay the loss of importation right indefinitely. A bookseller wishing to import copies of any new overseas book not published in Australia within 30 days would have to make an additional check with the copyright owner or the Copyright Tribunal to ensure that an application had not been made. Further, there is no provision for interested parties, such as booksellers, to contest an application to the Copyright Tribunal. Another example is where the Tribunal is obliged to make an order-that is, it has no discretion if it makes the two findings triggering the obligation-it has been given no jurisdiction to rescind the order, nor is the order otherwise able to be terminated.  Senate amendment No.5 and foreshadowed Senate amendment No. 10 seek to provide an exception to the 30-day open market rule in cases where a copyright owner entered into contractual arrangements to publish a version of a book for the Australian market. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has shown a propensity, in the period in which I have been shadow Attorney, to listen to the wisdom of my remarks from time to time, and to act upon them. So I thought that on this occasion I ought to reciprocate. In fact, when this matter was dealt with earlier in the year, I suggested this amendment and argued its worth. The Attorney has pointed out to me that, noble and all as the aspiration is, it could create a loophole through which many copyright owners could gain protection and not make books available. I have therefore put this to the shadow Cabinet and the Opposition party room and they agree with me that we should go along with the Government's reasoning on this occasion. The objective of the Senate amendment is to encourage the production and publication of Australian versions of international books-versions that are, through much effort on the part of local authors and publishers, made relevant to Australian readers. It is a point that I touched upon in the debate on, I think, 14 May, when I stressed the importance of giving short term protection to Australian adaptations of tertiary textbooks produced for the international market. What I am suggesting is that many technical works expressed with examples relevant to, say, an American market could be adapted in Australia with references to relevant Australian examples, et cetera. Whilst there was much merit in that, I can see that a loophole could be created. On reflection, and despite some distinct benefits in allowing such adaptation and putting the matter to one side for the time being, we now accept that the particular form of the amendments put forward by the Senate would, as the Attorney says, have adverse consequences that would outweigh the benefits that the amendments seek to produce. In essence, the amendments-in this instance, amendment No.5 and foreshadowed amendment No. lO-would unduly restrict the ability of Australian readers and booksellers to gain early access to overseas titles. The mere makqlg of an application to the Copyright TribUnal would result in copyright owners being granted an extension of time, and that period is not specified in the amendment. Accordingly, I agree with the Attorney's reasoning and the remarks that he has made. Question resolved in the amnnative.",64

This is another matter which was discussed for some time with the Opposition, particularly with the shadow Attorney, the honourable  he mentioned in his opening remarks, the Opposition also agrees to this proposal. The Government finds that this amendment is unacceptable for the same reasons as were given for amendment No.5. One further objection to Senate amendment No. 10 is that it is not known what an Australian version of an overseas published edition actually is. Further, the amendment suffers from drafting problems, and one example of that is that it confuses 'works' and 'published editions'. Mr I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Motion (by Mr Duffy) proposed: That the report be adopted.  Mr Deputy Speaker, it would be appropriate for me to make just a few remarks at this juncture. I thank the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for his cooperation. I think he has reciprocated in pointing out earlier the satisfaction that he had with the negotiations with the Opposition. There remain, however, different views between the Government and the Opposition as to how the whole matter of copyright ought to be handled. We take the view that the Government ought to be responding positively to the Prices Surveillance Authority's view that there be an open market in books. He has not done that. In fact, we go further than that. We believe that this Bill should have been extended to all other areas of copyright rather than adopting a glacierlike rate of progress in having this Bill deal solely with books. We would have extended the Bill across the field of copyright. Had we been in government and therefore had the opportunity of extending the Bill in this way, we would have been implementing the Prices Surveillance Authority's recommendation of an open market. There are impediments at the international level in the way of immediate implementation of that. We would expect the Government to be working to remove those impediments. I simply say in conclusion that we on this side of the House are committed to the recommendations for reform made by the Prices Surveillance Authority and, in government, we will give effect to those recommendations. Question resolved in the affirmative. Report adopted.

154,Mr DUFFY,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up the reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 5 and 10 of the Senate, I present the reasons, which have been circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsSenate amendment No. 5 is not acceptable because: (1) It is contrary to the most important reform being introduced by the Bill, namely, to provide Australian readers with early access to all new overseas titles. It has been a very widespread complaint that there is often considerable delay before new overseas titles are published in Australia and that, in some cases, there is no publication in Australia at all. The Bill gives the publisher of a new overseas title 30 days in which to publish in Australia if the publisher wants to have control over distribution in Australia; if publication does not occur in that time, booksellers will be free to import copies without the publisher's licence. (2) The Government does not accept that, as is proposed by the Senate amendment, a publisher of a new overseas title not published in Australia within 30 days should be able to retain some control over distribution of the book by reason of having made arrangements to publish an Australian version. If there is a perceived market for an Australian version, it will not be the same as the market for the original. But in principle, the government rejects the notion that Australian readers should be denied full access to the original for a substantial period while readers in other countries have such access. (3) Over and above the Government's objection to the Senate amendment in principle, there are several objections of detail, viz there is no limit on the time that may be taken in bringing out the Australian version, so that full access to any version could be delayed indefinitely; before importing copies of any new overseas title not published in Australia within 30 days, the importer would need to check whether an application had been made to the Copyright Tribunal by the publisher under the Senate amendment on the basis of a proposal to bring out an Australian version; the Senate amendment makes no provision for any interested person, eg, an importer, to seek to be made a party to the application to the Copyright Tribunal; the Copyright Tribunal has no discretion whether to make an order having the effect of restricting importation of the title, and has no power to rescind its order. Senate amendment No. 10 is not acceptable for the same reasons as have been given in relation to amendment No.5. In addition, (1) the Government does not accept that any instance has been put forward of an Australian version of an overseas published edition; and (2) there is also a confusion between works and published editions in the drafting of the amendment. I move: That the Committee's reasons be adopted. Question resolved in the afftrmative.",67
155,Unknown,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 8 p.m. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 October, on motion by Mr DutTy: That the Bill be now read a second time.  We have before the House a Bill to amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act. There are essentially three elements to the Cash Transaction Reports Amendment Bill: firstly, the title of the principal Act and of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency will be changed to the Financial Transaction Reports Act and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre respectively; secondly, a new division 3 will be inserted into part 2 of the Act to provide for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data; and, thirdly, section 15 of the Act will be amended to define the exact time when a person is required to provide a report to a customs officer when bringing currency into or taking currency out of Australia. Dealing with the third element first, namely amendments to section 15, in a judgment of Mr Justice Duggan in the Supreme Court of South Australia delivered on 28 June this year in the case of Schultz v. Taylor, it was held that the obligation to make a report under section 15 did not arise until after a person had passed the baggage counter at an international airport terminal. His Honour's decision accorded with the administrative procedures adopted by Customs officers in that the form for making a report was made available at the baggage counter and not earlier. In those circumstances, the opportunity for the traveller to comply with the statutory obligation to provide a report simply did not arise. Clause 7 of the Bill will insert new subsections (7B) , (7C), (8A) and (8B) into section 15 of the Act to define when currency is brought into or taken out of Australia. When entering Australia, currency will be deemed to be brought in once a person has reached the area in which passports and personal luggage are examined. Where the point of entry is not at an international airport or sea terminal, currency will be deemed to be brought in at the time the traveller had the first opportunity to provide a report under section 15. Proposed subsection 15(8A) will redefine the offence of not providing a report when bringing currency into or taking currency out of Australia to the value of $5,000. The new definition of the offence will be in similar terms to the definition for bringing currency into or taking currency out of Australia to which I have already referred. I might add that the offence is a strict liability offence which carries maximum penalties of a $5,000 fine or two years imprisonment, or both. I should have said earlier that, whilst we have discussed the measures that will be brought about by the Bill, the Opposition will not be opposing the Bill. The difficulty that I have with the provision that I have just referred to is that no exceptions are permitted for situations where a traveller, upon disembarking, may not be given an opportunity to provide the report. This was the very essence of the judgment delivered by Mr Justice Duggan in the case of Schultz v. Taylor that I referred to earlier. In order to avoid any injustices which may come about through this strict offence, it will be necessary to ensure that the procedures adopted by customs officers, unlike the situation which came about in Schultz v. Taylor, give travellers an adequate opportunity to make the requisite report. It is therefore necessary that those procedures reflect the legislative prescription set out in the amendments contained in clause 7 of the Bill, and I hope that the Attorney General (Mr Duffy) will ensure that this is done. Turning to the operations of the Agency,on .previous occasions when the Cash Transaction Reports Act has been debated, I have indicated to the Attorney that, in my view, the title of the Act is really a misnomer. Those comments were made in the context of the very wide provisions found in section 16 of the Act, which deal with the reporting of suspect transactions-transactions which are not limited to simply cash transactions. The amendments in this Bill will change the title of the Act and the title of the Agency, and it would seem that the Attorney now accepts that the use of the word 'cash' in the title of the Act and the Agency is, in all the circumstances, inaccurate. During previous debates I have touched on two other matters: firstly, the need for the Act to be subject to a comprehensive review, particularly in the light of the fact that many of its provisions alter traditional concepts of criminal liability; and, secondly, a concern that the Agency may, through the use of section 16 of the Act, be concentrating on minor matters and not directing its efforts to the more substantial questions of tax evasion and money laundering. With respect to the first matter, it is pleasing to note that the Attorney-General, by way of a press release dated 27 June 1991, announced that an advisory group has been established to monitor and report on the operation of the legislation and on the need for any legislative changes. I congratulate the Attorney for acting on what, frankly-no false modesty here-was obviously my suggestion, and I await with interest advice as to the progress of the review being conducted by the advisory body, which I assume will be made available to us. In relation to the second matter, I note that at paragraph 7.14 of its annual report for 1990-91 the Agency concedes that its earlier efforts were directed toward more minor matters. The report said: CTRA (that is, the Agency) has generally found a great deal of support for its work. What criticism there has been was that CTRA has been concentrating on smaller issues. That was to be expected in the early stages since the readily apparent suspicious behaviour by persons (such as those engaging in Social Security fraud and the lowest scale of tax evasion) were the first matters to come to CTRA and were passed on in that raw form for action by the relevant authorities. However, to give full credit to the Agency, it goes on to note that it now hopes to concentrate its efforts upon more substantial matters. The principal object of the Act, as set out in subsection 4(1), is to facilitate the administration and enforcement of taxation laws. It is to this ,object that the Agency must direct its efforts, 'and this leads me to consider the third element of the Bill, namely, the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data. In an internal memorandum dated 26 October 1988 from the manager of the complex audit unit in the Melbourne office of the Australian Taxation Office to the Commissioner of Taxation, at paragraph 9 it is estimated that abuse of the 10 per cent withholding tax payable on income distributed to non-residents gave rise to a revenue loss of $1.8 billion per annum. That is, to put it mildly, a staggering figure. The abuse of the withholding tax system, which is the subject of income tax rulings 2344 and 2466 dated 7 August 1986 and 18 February 1988 respectively, comes about through the use of complex back-to-back loan arrangements whereby income is nominally distributed to non-residents but, in reality, is retained in or reimbursed to the resident trust or its associates so as to avoid the payment of residential income tax rates. Notwithstanding the wide powers that the Commissioner of Taxation has to deal with avoidance and evasion of Australian taxation, his wide powers to obtain information that may be relevant to such avoidance and the repeated claims by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), that this Government had cracked down on tax evasion, it is clear that inaction on the part of the Government to tackle this problem has led to a monumental rip-off of the tax system. It really takes a touch of exquisite genius to just forgo $1.8 billion in revenue. The amounts of lost revenue involved are scandalous. The Government, for its lack of prompt action in responding to the problem should, at the very least, be condemned. Until 1 July last year, tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls under the banking foreign exchange regulations monitored the movement of funds into or out of Australia. With the introduction of the foreign source income accrual provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Act 1990, the former Treasurer, in all of his wisdom, decided that the tax screening arrangements should be brought to an end. In removing the tax screening arrangements, the former Treasurer claimed that the reporting provisions found in section 15 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act would provide information relevant to tax avoidance. However, that section only applies to hard currency transfers and does not apply to international telegraphic transfers. The result of this-overlooked totally in the Treasurer's reading at that time-was to leave a glaring gap in the provision of information which may disclose an abuse of the non-residential withholding tax system through international profit shifting arrangements. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its report of March 1991, found that, with the removal of the system of tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls, a gap existed with respect to the monitoring and reporting of international funds transfers. Estimates as to the revenue losses that arise through the absence of a proper system for the detection of possible abuses, of course, vary enormously. The Committee, in its report, indicated that it was not possible to put any firm figure on these losses and instead-and perhaps quite properly-concentrated on what needed to be done to address the problem. Lord knows what would have transpired and what the nation would have lost if a parliamentary committee had not been scrutinising this arena. Accordingly, in recommendation 19 of the report, it was concluded that a system of monitoring and reporting international telegraphic transfers should be put in place and that such a system be administered by the Cash Transactions Report Agency. That recommendation now finds its way into the Bill that is before the House. Unfortunately, however, the measure under present consideration represents too little action taken too late. What needs to be tackled-and this was recognised by the Committee-is the source of the problem, namely, the incentive for abuse that our tax regime provides by distinguishing between residential and non-residential tax rates. The need for lower non-residential tax rates arises due to double taxation treaty requirements that Australia has with a number of countries. However-and this is the crux of the problem-the concession goes beyond that in that it applies to all non-residents and, in doing so, makes the system amenable to abuse. In a submission to the House of Representatives Committee, the Taxation Institute of Australia argued that the source of evasion in this area can be tackled by amending and utilising the winding up incentive provisions found in the foreign source income accruals provisions. In particular, the Institute argued that increasing the rate to which income is subjected from international profit shifting arrangements wound up under the incentive provisions, together with providing a guaranlation, tee that the general anti-avoidance provision will not be applied upon winding up, would lead to many existing withholding tax it. schemes being brought to an end. The House of Representatives Committee also recognised that there is a need to tackle the source of the problem rather than its effects or consequences. In recommendation 1 of its report, the Committee concluded that the Industry Commission should review, first, the appropriateness of retaining the existing rate of interest withholding tax; secondly, appropriateness of having a common rate interest withholding tax applying to interest income earned in Australia by non-residents tion. living in countries with which Australia has entered into comprehensive double taxation arrangements and non-residents living in countries with which Australia has not entered into such an agreement; thirdly, the equity of tax sharing arrangements between Australia and other countries; and, fourthly, the extent to which there is equity of taxation treatment between resident and non-resident individual investors. Unless and until these questions are resolved, law abiding Australian taxpayers will not be able to expect that all other taxpayers carry their proper share of the tax burden. In conclusion, it is-bluntly put-an outrage that the withholding tax system has been a source fOf tax evasion for so long. is scandalous that the Government has not faced up to the problem. Provision for the reporting of international telegraphic transfer data should have been brought in over a year ago, at the time the former tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls were bought to an end. Australian taxpayers deserve a better deal. They will only get a better deal when the present anomalies and inequities in our tax regime are brought to an end and, no doubt, it will fall upon the next coalition government to do just that.",68
156,Mr DUFFY,CASH TRANSACTION REPORTS,"In reply-I think that, as the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable  ed, the Opposition is not opposing this legisthe Cash Transaction Reports Amendment Bill. In fact, it was quite clear that the shadow Attorney sees a considerable need for I think that he addressed the most significant aspects towards the end of his speech. He first raised the question of the amendments to section 15 of the Cash Transactions Reports Act. That was the question arising out of the South Australian decision. He pointed out, as was done earlier in the second reading speech in this place, that section 15 (SA) then came into being and redefines that offence. It was at that stage that the shadow Attorney the indicated that, while he was not opposing, he of was concerned about the question of strict liability and the fact that there was no excepThe shadow Attorney mentioned the advisory committee which was established in July. He was not prepared to engage in any false modesty. He said that that committee was something that he called for some time ago, and I concede that. It is not called the Peacock committee, but he can take some credit for it. The ministerial advisory committee is there to monitor the operation of the Act, which will, 1)f course, include the amendment to section 15. But it is a bit difficult at this stage to know what could have been done with that problem that arose with section 15 other than to have moved the amendment to provide for a new subsection 15(8A). NeverIt the less, the point that the shadow Attorney makes will clearly be drawn to the attention of the ministerial advisory committee which will be monitoring the operation of the Act and the Agency generally. The Opposition has in the past raised a somewhat minor matter in a sense but nevertheless it is entitled, I suppose, to have an indication that some note has been taken of it. It is true that the Bill does amend the name of the Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre which, as indicated, more accurately reflects the nature of the Agency's major operation, particularly with the addition of the extremely significant aspect of international telegraphic transfers as a result of this BilLIt is true to say that only a minor proportion of the Agency's operations will relate to cash transactions. Of course, for the same reason, the name of the Act will now be changed to the Financial Transaction Reports Act. As the shadow Attorney said, these amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act provide for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data. I - ow that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) was listed to speak tonight, but he must be otherwise engaged as he is not in the chamber. This amendment arose out of the report in March of this year of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which was known as the Martin Committee. It considered a lot of issues, one of which was this question of international profit shifting. It found evidence of revenue loss on a very large scale, with estimates of possibly between $100m and $25Om. The Martin Committee recommended a system to monitor and report these telegraphic transfers of funds. One of the other matters that was dealt with at some length by the Opposition and which was pointed out in the Martin Committee was that, because of abuses in the withholding tax arrangements, the likelihood of associated transactions being reported through the Cash Transaction Reports Agency's current reporting arrangements was minimal. Evidence was given to the Martin Committee that the arrangements operating in Australia allow Australian residents to avoid their taxation obligations by paying that 10 per cent withholding tax instead of personal or company rates of income tax. I must say that it is pleasing to hear that the question of deregulation in some areas has in a sense caused some concern to the shadow Attorney, who said that this sort of operation should have been put in place earlier. It is very pleasing to hear that when-if, whenever, maybe-those opposite come into government, there will be no more rorting of the tax system and that their record will be impeccable, unlike their previous performances in government. At the end of the day, the Bill does go a long way towards meeting the concerns which came to our attention as a result of, but not solely from, the Martin Committee report. Those opposite have said that this should have been acted upon earlier and that more action should have been taken at an earlier date. Of course, it is easy for them to say that from their position. But this Bill, particularly in dealing with the major matter of providing for the repOlting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data, will go a long way towards meeting the concerns that the shadow Attorney has put before us tonight. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duffy) read a third time. NA NA 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 October, on  That the Bill be now read a second time.",71
157,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bennelong) (8.26 p.m.)The Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect to a number of amendments to legislation falling within the administration of the Prime Minister. The four Acts in question are the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act, the Public Service Act 1922 and the Public Service Reform Act 1984. The Opposition does not intend to oppose any of the specific amendments before the Parliament to these four pieces of legislation. However, as each of the amendments deals directly with industrial relations matters touching upon the employment of Commonwealth government public servants, it is opportune for the Opposit,ion to make a number of wide ranging remarks about industrial relations matters generally and, most particularly, industrial relations policy in so far as it affects the public sector. It is the intention of the Opposition to move an amendment to the second reading of the Bill and I will come to the detail of that amendment towards the end of my remarks. It will encapsulate the application of the Opposition's industrial relations policy so far as the public sector is concerned. I will deal very briefly with the four specific amendments in the Bill. The amendment to the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act purports to amend the Act to provide that a woman on unpaid maternity leave, which can last for a year, does not become an unattached officer-that is, does not have her position declared vacant without her written consent. The proposed amendment is intended to bring the detachment provisions applying to maternity leave into line with detachment provisions for other forms qf leave without pay. Staff on other forms of leave without pay cannot be declared unattached before the expiration of a period of 12 months. Whilst the provision is intended to achieve consistency between forms of leave without pay-and consistency is desirable-the notion that a position should be held vacant for up to 12 months is, in the eyes of some-including me and others in the Oppositioncontrary to sound management practice. Under the existing provisions of the Act, an unattached woman returning to duty after maternity leave returns to her previous position if it is vacant. If it has been filled her absence, she is appointed to another position as near as possible in salary and status to her former position. It is our view that provisions of this kind ought, along with a lot of other provisions, to be affected by the workplace bargaining principles that we would bring to bear on the Commonwealth Public Service. For that reason, the Opposition does not intend to vote against this amendment because there is some, perhaps tenuous, logic in the proposition which seems to be the basis underlying this provision that, in the name of consistency, while we have an inferior system, all elements of the system ought to be equally inferior. The next amendment is to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act. We simply have no objection. It follows some recommendations of a Senate committee. It goes further than that committee recommended, but we do not mind that and do not raise any objection. Next, the Bill makes two amendments to the Public Service Act 1922. There is a long list of amendments implementing the restructuring of the Senior Executive Service into three bands, increasing the flexibility of existing SES arrangements by devolving greater responsibility for deploying SES officers to heads of departments and agencies, and simplifying existing procedures for deployment. We have no objection to any of those. In fact, I am not the least bit reluctant in saying that we would support quite a number of amendments that the Government has proposed in relation to the SES. A number of the changes that the Government has made to the Public Service over the years have had a great deal of merit. They have involved a good deal more flexibility being injected into the system. To the extent the Government has moved along that path it has been my c011&istent personal view and that of the Opposition over the years that it should have, as it has, drawn the support of the Opposition in relation to those changes. We do not intend to make or score any political points in relation to that. I could say precisely the same thing in relation to the proposed amendment to the Bill in relating to statutory authorities. The amendment gives a lot more authority to the heads of the statu-ory authorities. It devolves a lot more responsibility for individual executive decision making, and that is very much in line with the goals that we have in this area. Once again, we are quite happy to support, and indeed we compliment, the Government's going in that direction. I should, of course, note though that in his second reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime  Nonetheless, all statutory authorities will still remain covered by the Government's general industrial relations coordination arrangements, which ensure the consistent application of the Government's wages and industrial relations policies. That really spoilt a good story. If I may say so, my friend opposite was going very well until he added that caveat. I thought for one fleeting moment we were going to witness a great leap forward to flexibility but no, it was dragged back under the aegis of the allembracing reach of the industrial relations club. I will come to that body corporate in a few moments. They are my specific views and the specific views of the Opposition on' four particular amendments that are put forward. As I said at the commencement of my remarks, I wanted to say something about industrial relations generally and also particularly about the application of our industrial relations policy to the Public Service. In the wake of the decision handed down by the Industrial Relations Commission last week, there has been a great deal of exaggerated and misplaced euphoria. It would be fair to say that the Industrial Relations Commission last week decided to do what it had declined to do in April of this year, and that is to embrace the very limited steps towards what it described, and the supporters of the decision described, as enterprise bargaining. Let me say in the clearest possible terms that, to the extent the decision handed down by the Commission last Thursday provides for more flexibility than the system which it replaced, to the extent that it allows for greater account to be taken of productivity issues in determining wage increases, and to the extent that it encourages employers, employer organisations, trade unions and the ACTU to focus more heavily on the workplace and the needs of individual workplaces in determining whether and to what extent wage rates shall be granted, I support and welcome the decision. The industrial relations regime we now have is better than the one we had before last Thursday, but it falls a long way short of the euphoric reaction of some of the media in Australia and some of the industrial relations commentators. We believe that there will be true enterprise bargaining in this country only when it is possible for individual Australian employers and their own employees to reach an agreement regarding their remuneration, their working conditions, and all the other things that affect the way in which they relate to each other in the workplace, and to give effect to that agreement without having to receive the imprimatur, the endorsement or the legal approval of any outside force, individual, body or third party. In other words, if John Howard Pty Ltd, employing 20 people, wants to make a deal with those 20 people which varies the award conditions under which they now operate, and, those 20 people willingly give their consent to that agreement and believe that agreement is in their best interests, then neither the managing director of John Howard Pty Ltd nor any of those individuals should be compelled to go off to a trade union or to an industrial tribunal in order to have that agreement rubber-stamped. That is the crucial divide between us and those who sit opposite. We are not arguing for an industrial relations regime which precludes trade unions. One of the great myths spread about our approach to industrial relations is that we, as a future government, wish to shut out trade unions. That is not the case. What I do plead guilty to is that we, as a future government, will ask the Parliament to change the law to allow individual Australians to shut out trade unions if those individual Australians want it. But we will never interfere with the law of this country allowing individual Australians to form themselves into trade unions and operating, if they so desire, through trade unions to achieve their industrial goals. What is wrong about the present system is that people are forced to deal through a trade union whether they like it or not and whether or not they regard it as being in their own best interests to do so. We merely want create a situation where people have a free, unfettered choice. I will go on arguing only in this Parliament but also on every available opportunity I have around this country the simple proposition that the proach of the Liberal and National parties industrial relations does not rest on some of primeval hostility to trade unions, some lustful political desire to destroy the organised union movement of this country, but on the simple proposition that in a free society right to associate also implies the right not associate and that free men and women in country should not be forced by dint of loaded, unfair law to deal through a body they may in fact despite. The truth is that in Australia at the present time only 31 per cent-that is, less than in three-of Australian men and women who are employees belong to a trade union, and award. yet despite that demonstration of their attitude' of their choice as to whether associate or do not associate, lOOper cent them are forced to have their award condicompany tions determined according to the whims, essentially, and in the final analysis, unions, irrespective of whether they belong them or not. I have quoted in other places the example of a company in Melbourne that got in touch with me. It is quite a well known manufacdecision turer employing several hundred people. tion. Before Christmas of last year it was trading in very difficult circumstances, as most panies in Melbourne were then-and still, that regrettably, are-and sustaining heavy loslaw ses. Essentially it put this proposition to work force: 'Unless we can effect some ecobad nomies it will be necessary for us to some of our employees. We put this proposition to you. Will you agree to forgo the 171h per cent holiday loading for Christmas 1990? If you do and if we are able to trade into the black next year, not only will we make it up to you but also we will pay the loading at 25 per cent rather than at 17 11z per cent. In view, that is the only alternative to effecting some retrenchments'. That proposition was overwhelmingly ported by those in the work force, to whom, incidentally, belonged to a union. Since the arrangement was a variation of an not award, the company knew it had to get the approval of the Commission. It went to the Commission and the Commission said, 'We apcannot entertain an application from you or to from your employees per se because they are kind not the respondents to the award; you will have to enlist the assistance of the union'. Reluctantly that was done. The workers did not want to do it, because they had decided the not to join the union. They were repulsed by to the union; they were rejected by the union this secretary, who said that the union was not a interested in promoting arrangements of this that kind. They were left high and dry. The company was not prepared to enter into an illegal arrangement because under the legislation it one would expose itself to prosecution as breaching the terms of a legally enforceable Inevitably, as the new year dawned and they because the arrangement could not be of implemented, a number of employees in that were retrenched. Nothing that was decided last Thursday by the Industrial of Relations Commission would alter the chain to of events which affected that company. For all the much vaunted flexibility that we were alleged to have been given last Thursday by the Industrial Relations Commission, the would not have touched that situaThere, quintessentially, at the workplace level, it was overwhelmingly in the interests comof the employer and the employees to make deal. But they could not do it because the of this country does not grant that simple its freedom to adult men and women. That is a law; it is a law that must be changed and retrench it is a law that will be changed. In making my remarks about last Thursday's decision, I do not criticise in any specific sense the Industrial Relations Commission. I have a different philosophy of industrial relations from that of the people our who sit on the Commission, but that does not mean that I am going to lapse into personal abuse, which unfortunately has been the stock in trade of a number of the industrial players supin recent months and which has achieved none of absolutely nothing. Under the present law, it is not within capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to create the kind of industrial relations system that we in the Opposition support. The only way that that industrial relations commission system can be created is for the law of this country to be changed by this Parliament. It is manifestly obvious that there is no way on earth that the present Government will ever put legislation before this Parliament to remove the representational monopoly which registered trade unions enjoy under the laws of this country. I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, who is handling this tion, that that is the nub of the industrial relations debate. We do not deny that the present system is now a little more flexible than it used to be. We do not seek to destroy trade unions. We do not seek to deny people the right to join or not to join a union. will defend that legal democratic right. we will never concede the principle that it fair, just or an exercise of the essential ciples of freedom in this country for people to be forced to have their affairs determined by a body to which, demonstrably, they decided not to belong. Yet that is what we left with, despite the description of the sion that was passed down last Thursday by the Industrial Relations Commission as 'eua phoric', 'trail blazing', 'landmark' and so Four essential principles lie at the heart the Opposition's approach to industrial relanow tions. The first of those principles is the that I have enunciated over the past 10 minutes, that the law of this country should be changed to allow individual employers their employees to make a legally enforceable bargain about remuneration, working conditions and so forth without the mandatory intervention of a trade union, an employer organisation or an industrial tribunal. That does not mean for a moment that if those people choose to employ a trade union, employer organisation or industrial tribunal they will in any way be prevented from doing so. We are not saying to people that under our policy they will be prevented from reachPeople ing an agreement that might be certified section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act. the We are not saying that if they want to remain within an award system they will be prevented from doing so. We are saying that, whereas at the moment people have no alternative but to be bound by the Commission and by the system and to deal with the union, under our system, if people want to go right outside that system, they will have complete freedom and opportunity to do so. For the life of me, on ordinary principles of freedom of the individual, I cannot understand why anybody would object to that, except as a result of an historical desire to maintain a legal privilege the for a section of the Australian community. legislaThat is the first principle. The second principle is the implementation of the concept of voluntary unionism and an end to the closed shop. In Australia examples are legion of how compulsory unionism operates very effectively and very vindictively We inside the Commonwealth Public Service. I But never cease to be amazedÂ· when the Prime is Minister (Mr Hawke) stands up in this place prinand says, 'There is no compulsory unionism in Australia'. In my office I have letters from people who responded to advertisements by have the Department of Immigration, Local are Government and Ethnic Affairs last year for deciinterpreters. Some people had all the qualifications under the sun, yet they received letter from the Secretary or an officer of the on. Department saying, 'I am sorry, we cannot of look at your application because you do not belong to the Public Service, and since one we advertised to fill the vacancy we have done a deal with the Public Service Union about the filling of those positions'. If that is and not compulsory unionism, if that is not a closed shop, I do not know what is. Honourable members on the Government side have the nerve to tell the Australian people that there is no such thing as compulsory unionism in the Australian Public Service. The Australian Public Service reeks of compulsory unionism. Why else would there be something like 68 per cent union membership in the public sector, yet only 31 per cent union membership in the private sector? have to be in the union to get on in under the Public Service. Our view and our philosophy in government will be to bring that to a very sharp and definite end. People will be promoted on the basis of productivity and merit, not according to whether they belong to a union or to any other organisation. That will be our firm policy. That is the second principle. The third principle is that the rule of law should continue to run and that all sections of the Australian community should be governed by the ordinary laws of Australia administered by the ordinary courts of Australia. One of the great advances that have been made in industrial relations over the past few years has been the establishment of the principle that, like any other bodies in Australian society, if unions destroy somebody's livelihood they can be made accountable for damages. That principle was established in the Dollar Sweets case, in Mudginberri and in the pilots dispute, when the plaintiffs were cheered on by the present Prime Minister. That wi1l ever be a memorial to the Prime Minister's reformist zeal when it comes to industrial relations. One indelible impression that the present Prime Minister has made on industrial relations over the last two years is giving to a future coalition government an outstanding precedent, an outstanding and splendid example of why the laws of this country should never be changed to weaken the control of the ordinary courts over the conduct of those who would seek to destroy the livelihoods of their fellow Australians. The final principle is that if those people who decide to join unions in this country are to have a free choice, not only should they have a free choice about joining or not joining but, having decided to join a union, they should also have a right to join an industry union, a craft union, or a company or an enterprise union. Once again, the present Government falls down on basic principles of freedom. Not only does the Government force people to join unions; it also forces them to join unions of its nomination and choice. It is a double jeopardy and a double penalty on their freedom as individual Australians. We say, firstly, that the individuals decide whether they join or do not join a union and, if they do decide to join a union, they ought to be able to join any union they want and they ought to be able to form a company union or an enterprise union. How on earth can we be said to be moving towards workplace bargaining in this country? When it comes to union structures, we are going 100 miles an hour in the opposite direction. In the last 12 months the Government has passed a law, with the support of its Democrats mates in the Senate, which says that the minimum size of a trade union in this country has to be 10,000. That excludes just about every workplace in this country. We cannot have enterprise unions when the minimum size is 10,000. It is a nonsense, yet the Government is trying to tell us that it has an enterprise bargaining system worth its name. That industrial relations approach has clear implications for the operation of the Commonwealth Public Service and that is the subject matter of the second reading amendment. I have already talked about compulsory unionism. It follows from our approach to compulsory unionism that we are against Federal awards of any kind containing preferences for members of trade unions. Another important step that we will take towards reducing the legal privileges-not penalising, but reducing them-which are now afforded to trade unions in relation to Commonwealth government employees will be to abolish the automatic deduction of union dues within Commonwealth departments and authorities. That was introduced in 1970. It was progressively suspended during the years of the Fraser Government and was reinstituted by the Hawke Government when it was elected in 1983. We will be making that decision as an employer in our own right. We will not be saying to private sector employers, 'You should stop deducting the dues of your union members'. That is a matter for them. We are not in the business of dictating individual arrangements, but we, as an employer, can make our own decision to terminate the deduction of union dues, and we intend to do that. More importantly than the things that I have mentioned, we intend to implement the principles of workplace bargaining in relation to Commonw.eal th departments and statutory authorities. We propose to devolve upon the heads of departments and statutory authorities the plenary powers that ought to belong to managers having those kinds of responsibilities. I acknowledge that the Bill before the House does go some way towards the goal that we have in mind-earlier in this speech I complimented the Government and offered my support for those changes-but we want to go further. I take the example of the Commissioner of Taxation, an example that always comes to mind when one thinks of Commonwealth departments that affect the citizen. We would want a situation where we said to the Commissioner of Taxation, 'Here you are. You have X million dollars for salaries in the Australian Taxation Office for the next 12 months. You'-Trevor Boucher or whoever it may be-'go away and decide how many people you are going to employ, at what classification, at what level, and the combination that you choose. Provided you do not exceed the salary cap that we have given you, and provided, of course, you do your job and collect the requisite amount of tax, we are not going to be concerned'. That is the kind of workplace bargaining and devolved responsibility that we should move towards. On that basis, departmental heads will focus on productivity and there will be more innovative management decisions and far better morale in the departments and the statutory authorities. That is an example of how the workplace bargaining principles of the Opposition can be made to work in the Commonwealth Public Service. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure to acknowledge Commonwealth employees' freedom to associate, and the Government's failure to capture the productivity improvements to be had from enterprise.bargaining with the federal Public Service by: (a) proscribing compulsory membership of trade unions; (b) proscribing preference for trade unionistS in awards and federal legislation; (c) abolishing automatic deduction of union dues within Commonwealth departments and authorities; and by (d) giving the chief executive officers of Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities the same responsibility as their private sector counterparts in deciding the size, composition, deployment, pay and conditions of employees, subject only to a budget constraint"". Mr Reid - I second the amendment.",72
158,Mr CAMPBELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am amazed that anyone could speak for 30 minutes on the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. Of course, no-one can unless it is a wide ranging debate. In this case, it was based on the honourable member's own ideology. I will dispense with the Bill first, which should take me about two minutes, then I, too, will indulge in a far ranging debate. This is an omnibus Bill which contains a lot of common sense amendments, some which I would query. The Bill amends the Act so that after the spouse of a Governor General remarries she can continue to collect the pension she is entitled to receive on the death of her husband. Apparently, we are doing this because it is felt that the Act is inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act and discriminates on the grounds of marital status. I would have thought that this was a very good reason for changing the Sex Discrimination Act. It seems to me to be stupid. Frankly, if love is so blind that the Governor General's surviving wife feels the inclination to get married again, she should be prepared to make those sacrifices. If not, she should live in sin like the rest of us.",78
159,Mr REID,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Like the rest of whom?,78
160,Mr CAMPBELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Those of us who do. This Bill gives legislative power to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. It is a common sense thing. Until now he has had to rely on the good offices of ASIO, which is not a basis on which I would like to . rely. I think it is very sensible to give him the authority to command access to these documents. The amendment the Bill makes in regard to maternity leave is not of great consequence. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) says, it does add consistency to the Act, but I do not think it involves any great complication for the Public Service. It has been working around it fairly well up to date. The Bill contains an interesting amendment regarding Norfolk Island. It would exempt the Norfolk Island Administration from the Resource Assessment Commission Act. I think this is a very good step. It was never intended that the actions of the Government should be subject to scrutiny by the Resource Assessment Commission. I commend the Government to make this the first in a step by step process in which we can exempt everyone else from the Resource Assessment Commission Act. I think that details the relevant issues 'relating to this Bill. I move to industrial relations. I believe that the honourable member for Bennelong believes wholeheartedly that his party does not hate trade unions and does not have any desire to thwart trade unions or stop them. I accept that he believes that. The problem is that I do not think the Opposition has this view. Unfortunately, it just does not know. It is operating on the basis of ignorance. It does not know how the real world lives. I will give honourable members a few examples. I will deal with the company in Melbourne to which the honourable member for Bennelong referred. He said that that company wanted to make a special deal with its employees. It sounded to me like a very common sense deal. The company could not get it through because the Industrial Relations Commission said no and the union said, 'We are not going to be a part of this'. Why would a union with no members in this particular organisation be interested in assisting? Of course, it was not. It was churlish about it. The reality is that had that company had the support of its work force, as the honourable member claims-and I am prepared to believe him-it would simply have had to obtain workplace agreements between individuals. The reality is that no government, authority or union would have dared to take it to court. The company knew that. The fact that it did not go down that road proves either that it is particularly obtuse or that it was not sincere. If it is particularly obtuse, it is doubtful whether it will survive in the long term, anyway. What the honourable member for Bennelong put was an absolute nonsense and it is a sham to bring it forward now. The honourable member then railed against this Government for saying that the minimum size of a union should be 10,000. I think there is a very good reason for this. I used to belong to a union, a very militant union-the FEDFA. I started off as a greaser and became an engine driver. In the mining industry the power in the union was held by the winder drivers. They could stop a mine dead. They, along with the AWU, were the only people who could. If there is no-one to work winders, simply no-one can go down a mine. This bestowed on them enormous power. Do honourable members think that in any industrial negotiations the mass of that union had any power? We were in the hands of those winder drivers. History has made those winder drivers fairly irrelevant because most large mines today are open cut. But previously the winder drivers had enormous power. Had we had a much broader based union, we would have been able to outvote them, but here was a minority group which had enormous power and was prepared to use it. If very small unions are in charge of key positions, people in elite positions will get into positions of power and use them to the detriment of companies. I know many mining companies want a unionised work force because it gives them a basis on which to negotiate. If one understands what actually did happen at Robe River, one would understand this-but I think that is tautological, Mr Deputy Speaker! The honourable member for Bennelong does not understand it, but I will tell him what happened. At Robe River there was an enormously slack management, a company that had decided it would get in and rip out on a quick profit basis. The mine had been designed for a life of 10 years. A corrupt State government decided it would take the leases away from one great Australian, Lang Hancock, and give them to the Robe River company. This bestowed on that mine a long life. When we have a long life mine, priorities change from keeping thi,ngs going at any cost and giving into the workers on any demands just to keep things going, to having to consider wages and total costs of the operation. Unfortunately, the company had entrenched a system in which it had kept the effective unions out. Although there were union members, management and control were exercised by the shop stewards and the convenors, not by the union as a whole. I was one of the people responsible for getting the iron are consultative committee up; I think it has been very useful. When we as a body approached the workers at Robe River, we were told-not only by the workers but also by the company-'Look, we see no future in this; we can handle things ourselves; we have a very good arrangement'. They were told it was an arrangement that could not and would not last. We know what happened shortly after that: a company was assigned to go in and there was heavy handed stuff. We now know the consequence. We have been regaled also with some of the myths. One myth is that this arrangement has given the company enormous productivity. The reality of Robe River is that it has one of the simplest mines in the world to operate. It simply brushes a bit of dirt off the top of the mesa, down the side of the mesa, then scrapes the top off and gravity feeds that down to the trains-unlike a lot of iron ore companies which have to dig out a lot of overburden, which is a much harder job. However, productivity in eRA is much higher than in Robe River. It has an overburden problem, but certainly it has done better in increasing productivity. Another problem is that a situation such the one the honourable member for Benthe nelong apparently wants bestows on indirection dividuals enormous power to It takes only a couple of dissident Kiwis to get into a mining site and find a bit of asbestos, and all hell can break loose. If the honourable member were a mine owner, he would be very grateful in those circumstances if he had a very large union which was prepared to negotiate and see common sense. I admit not all unions are prepared to do that, but there are a lot of responsible unions. The union movement has shown its responsibility in many areas. But then those opposite make a great case for free wage bargaining. I have lived through free wage bargaining. Back in the 1960s I was involved in the opening of the Nullarbor. It was the last great path of development that Australia will ever see. On that project we were stripped of labour. Why? Because of the unilateral action of the mining companies to raise wages. The mining companies tripled the pastoral award. They dragged all the good people out of the pastoral industry into the mining industry and left us virtually without labo-r. We were forced to develop the Nullarbor, which is pretty hard work, basically with drunks, criminals and pommies-and thank heavens for the young pammy kids who were out in Australia for six months looking for experience, who were not just chasing big money but were out for the adventure. Without their assistance the Nullarbor would not have been developed. The proposal of the honoUrable member for Bennelong is a two edged sword. When industry talks about its free wage bargaining, it means bargaining wages downwards. There is no incentive, no reason for industry to do otherwise. We have laments about the 17112 per cent loading. We are told people do not get it in America. They do not. But in America people get a much higher hourly rate, which more than compensates. If we are going to make this country survive, we have to have an industry policy that is relevant to Australia. Sadly, the truth is that today in Australia the Labor Party has a policy that does not work very well and the as Opposition does not have one at all. That is reality. Without that policy, without in industry, there can be no future cause disruption. for Australia. We can ask what sort of industry Australia needs. Clearly it needs industries based on the things we do well. It needs support for the mining industry and the rural sector. I do not believe that in recent times any government has given those industries a lot of support. Honourable members opposite should not kid themselves. They will find in government that they are just as subject to pressure groups as any other political party. In fact, history has shown that. We need just look back at the record of Malcolm Fraser. Having determined that we are going to support industries, we should seek to process downstream to add as much value as we can and then find industries that fit into them. For example, we should support industries that manufacture equipment that people need. This is the way forward for Australia. The Opposition has acknowledged that only 31 per cent of people are involved in the union movement. Obviously, if that is true-and it is true-it means that the union movement is not as all powerful as the Opposition says it is; it is not the thing that is holding back development in Australia. We must also ask where the 31 per cent is involved. It is involved, overwhelmingly, in the mining industry, which is very highly unionised, and, of course, in the Commonwealth Public Service. This is a sore issue. I think the Commonwealth Public Service unions need a thorough going over. However, people do not join the Commonwealth Public Service because they are dragooned into it but because they get so many perks from it. They would be mugs not to join the Public Service Union; it is one of the easiest rides in the country. I think that Clyde Cameron, who set this in motion, belatedly realised the problem he caused. One of the problems we have in Australia today is the disproportionate power of white collar unions in the ACTU. But honourable members opposite-those heroes-are going to stop them collecting dues from their members. If honourable members opposite do that, good luck to them. But that is not the problem. The Opposition needs to stand up to them and stop conceding conditions to them. That is what really needs to happen with the Commonwealth Public Service. I am sure that could be achieved. Instead, members of the Opposition prattle about increased productivity in the Commonwealth Public Service. What does this mean? How do we get increased productivity in some of these areas? In some areas the last thing we want is increased productivity. Who would suggest that this country benefits, for example, if this Parliament passes more laws? Does anyone think this country would be better off if we suddenly doubled our output of laws? Of course not. Productivity is another one of those shibboleths which honourable members opposite hang their hats on. They do not really understand what it means. They utter absolute nonsense. We have the four industrial relations principles. One is the right to free association. In the context of Bertrand Russell's dictum, to treat equals unequally is discrimination, it is abhorrent and it should not be allowed. I am sure honourable members opposite would agree. It is just as abhorrent to treat unequals equally. So to suggest that a few employees will have the same sort of clout as some employer who happens to be unscrupulous is nonsense. But do not worry; it already happens in Australia, and in a big way. There are very many industries where one cannot get a job if one is in a union. It is made very clear that if one joins a union, one is out. That is made very clear to lots of people throughout Australia. What would honourable members opposite propose to do about this? It is clearly against their stated guidelines-although, of course, in reality they support it wholeheartedly. The reality is that the Opposition could do nothing about it; it would go on as it goes on now. Another principle is the right to bargain directly. What sort of a bargaining situation is it when the boss says, 'This is the score; take it or leave it'? This falls right back on the fact that we do not have any real idea in Australia of the industries we want. I will make a few remarks about the industries we want. I touched on the major industries, the ones we carry on well. We are, after all, the best miners in the world, partly because of our climate. But there are other industries that are basic to Australia, and they are what I call the strategic industries, the industries that Australia needs for its survival. I refer to surveillance technology, communications technology, medicine, particularly tropical medicine, and transport. These are industries that Australia needs for its survival, and we should be supporting them. Neither the Opposition paJ,ties when in government nor we as a government have ever had any coherent plan to make sure that Australia is self-sufficient-in fact pre-eminent-in those industries. Unlike Israel, we have miserably failed the people of our country in developing a real industry policy. Honourable members opposite talk about the right to bargain. Now we have the rule of law. What rule of law is there when we have a large company with inexhaustible resources, tax deductible resources, to implement the law at every opportunity? It simply exhausts the funds of unions. What would it do to individuals? Again members of the Opposition are talking nonsense. I have no great brief for the industrial relations club. I think the latest decision was an attempt at its own survival. I must say that free wage bargaining worries me, as I think it will lead to a blow-out in wages which will not be contained, except by the most draconian measures. One of the Opposition's former heroes, Senator Withers, said that if one pays people peanqts, one gets monkeys. That is true, and that is bad. But it is not as bad as paying coconuts and getting monkeys. That is what happens in a lot of these things. I remember Mr Bond saying, when he was paying one of his people some enormous salary, that he had to pay those salaries to get good men to make sure the interests of the shareholders were looked after. We have to be very careful. After all, we freed the Wool Corporation from the structures of the Public Service Commission. I would not have thought the Wool Corporation excelled itself, despite the higher level of wages received by its members. What type of unions will we have? Is the Opposition suggesting we will have such a proliferation of unions that no union will have any influence or power at all? That may suit members opposite very well indeed-and it will certainly be the result of their policies. Mr Beale-If you have them at the enterprise level they will have enormous power.",78
161,Mr CAMPBELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,If we have them at the enterprise level it could very well mean one of two things.

People think in the short term. They think they can screw and get those sorts of rates in. Of course they do; they have done it before. The fact is that free wage bargaining is fraught with all sorts of dangers. There are two solutions. One is that we get increasing differences in the country, where people who can bargain get the big wages and people doing essential jobs without clout get left behind. Is that the sort of unfair society honourable members opposite need? Mr Beale-It is not going to be unfair. If you have a free society, that won't happen.",82

Mr Beale-You don't think I spent my working life in industry dealing with this kind of problem?",83
171,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,He knows more about industry than you do.,83
172,Mr CAMPBELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is a value judgment of which the honourable member is not capable, never mind worthy. Here I am trying to eke out my time. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have no idea how long it takes for that light to go out in circumstances like this. (Time expired)",83
173,Mr REID,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased to be able to make some comment on the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. I certainly will not try to upstage the contribution of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mf Campbell). One point I agree with him on is that this is a Bill which contains a number of amendments. It is a real grab bag of a number of Acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), of Acts containing provisions which relate to the Public Service, matters which have been dealt with by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I want to address a few comments firstly to the amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. That amendment will make it possible, where the Ombudsman of the internal investigation division of the Australian Federal Police is investigating a complaint, for the Ombudsman to refer a question to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an advisory opinion. Currently, the Ombudsman does have that power, but he has to refer it through the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. This amendment will allow him to refer that question directly to the AAT. The second amendment in this Bill is an amendment to the Governor General Act 1974. It was referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The Bill amends the Governor General Act 1974 by removing the limitation on the entitlement of a surviving spouse of a retired Governor General to an allowance. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie took some exception to this. If he really looks at it, he will see it would be inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as it discriminates purely and simply on the basis of marital status. The surviving spouse under this amendment will have the ability to have it reinstated where she previously had no entitlement to an allowance on remarriage. The next amendments relate to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. There are three amendments proposed to that Act. 1\\'0 of them are administrative in nature and are intended to bring the office of the Inspector-General into line with other statutory bodies. Provision is now made for appointment of an Acting Inspector-General in the event of the absence of the Inspector General or of a temporary vacancy in that office. The second amendment ensures that should a person appointed to act as Inspector General also hold a judicial office, that person may continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of that judicial office while acting as Inspector-General. The final amendment provides the Inspector-General with the right of access to the annual or periodic reports of the intelligence and security agencies and to ministerial directions or guidelines given to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate of the Department of Defence. The further amendment to the Ombudsman's Act 1976 caused the coalition some concern. I conferred with the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for  much consideration, we decided that the coalition would support the amendment foreshadowed by the Government. Subsection 9(4) of the, Ombudsman Act presently provides that there is no excuse for a person not to furnish information where provision of the information: (a) would contravene the provisions of any Act, would be contrary to the public interest or might tend to incriminate him . . . or (b) would disclose legal advice furnished Minister, a Department or a prescribed authority ... Subsection 9(4) goes on to provide that such information cannot be admitted into evidence in proceedings against the provider of the information. 1\vo exceptions apply: namely, where the Ombudsman applies to the Federal Court under section 11 for an order that the information be provided; and, secondly, proceedings under section 36 of the Act for the offence of failing to provide such information. The Bill will change the aforementioned provisions by giving specific reference to communications between a lawyer and a public servant-that is, in addition to legal advice being disclosed, instructions to a lawyer would also need to be disclosed. The safeguards preventing admission in subsequent proceedings are retained. Paragraph 22 of the explanatory memorandum says that on the basis of advice from the Attorneythe General's Department, communications I between client and lawyer would already be covered by the public interest ground referred to in paragraph 9(4)(a). This is probably correct. The test for claiming professional privilege in discovery in litigation is resolved weighing up, firstly, the public interest favour of full and open discovery and the administration of justice against the public interest in fostering confidentiality between client and lawyer. On this analysis, the - e-dments simply express what is already unphed. Whether the existing situation is in itself desirable is a much broader and larger question. For example, a quick reading of the Act indicates that there are no express limitations on how the Ombudsman may deal with or publish through a report these forms of sensitive information. Perhaps the Parthat liamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  that question in his response. There is, however, an alternative argument. Parliament, in specifically addressing a form other of privilege in paragraph 9(4)(b), has excluded other forms of privilege in that that paragraph, dealing with public interest to a gr?-ds, is not meant to cover professional pnvllege. In other words, the express mention of one thing-legal advice-excludes the mention of the other-client instructions. If the analysis by the Attorney-General's Department is wrong, the only extension brought about by the amendments relates to instructions to a lawyer, as opposed to legal adv-ce, . which is already covered. If legal adVice IS to be made available which is the present .situation, .the natural c-rollary to that IS to disclose chent instructions. However, there may be some inherent dangers in such an extension, given that legal advice tends to be expressed in cautious terms whereas client instructions tend to be more frank and open. After a quick perusal of the Ombudsman's report for 1989-90-the latest report, that for 1990-91, has not yet been tabled-I can say that there is no mention of the need to address - laims .for privilege with respect to client mstructions. The Parliamentary Secretary at table should take note of the concerns that have raised on the legal implications of that subsection and may be in a position to comment. The other amendment in this Bill is to the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 The Act is to be amended to remove the Adby ministration of Norfolk Island from the in definition of 'Commonwealth authority'. The Norfolk Island Government is deemed to be a Commonwealth authority by reason of its status as an incorporated body. As a result the decision by the Norfolk Island Government on a resource matter can be referred to the Resource Assessment Commission. However, it was not intended that the Resource Assessment Commission be able to inquire into decisions of the Norfolk Island Government. It has always been the view of my party the coalition respect the fierce independence of the people of Norfolk Island and their wishes. Norfolk Island is one of the most historic of Australia's external territories and is integral to our national heritage. Norfolk Island has its own legislative assembly, system of local administration and law and its own courts. The Australian Government is responsible for its defence, its international relations, its heritage conservation and, ultimately, its good government. The residents of Norfolk Island-I understand that the population is now somewhere around 2,000 in number-are a unique blend. There are descendants of the original Pitcaimers, Australians, New Zealanders and others, with 25 per cent of the population being temporary residents. The legislative framework of the island has its own unique history, a constitutional battle for independence-that is what I was talking about, with our party recognising its fierce independence-which in 1979 resulted in the creation of the Norfolk Island Act and a degree of self-government for the Island. The coalition parties are committed to seeing this process continue. We believe that it has been a success. We would not want to see the Government giving the Resource Assessment Commission the power to inquire into decisions of the Norfolk Island Government. Norfolk Island has achieved a high degree of self government. It has proved since 1979 that it is able to act with goodwill in developing a range of laws designed to safeguard and meet the express desire of territory residents. The financial impact of these measures contained in the complaints section, the Governor General's section and the amendments to the Ombudsman Act, is not expected to be major. Similarly, with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security amendments financial impact will be minimal. I believe that they do merit support. We had thought one stage that the coalition would give serious consideration to moving an amendment to Resource Assessment Commission amendsuggests ment. However, in view of the fact that it does reduce the strength of the Resource Assessment Commission rather than increase its powers, we decided to accept the Governin ment's amendment in this case. However, it is the view of the coalition parties that the Resource Assessment Commission shall be abolished upon our coming to government. Finally, I have pleasure in supporting the amendment which was moved by the honourable member for Bennelong. I believe that my colleagues on this side of the House will be making further contributions.",83
174,Mr SCHOLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to delay the House long, but the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), forced me to rise. I suggest that the honourable member should read the report from earlier this year or late last year of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Members of his Party were involved in that Committee and were strongly in support of the recommendations. Those recommendations are not in accordance with what the honourable member said were the policies and aims of his Party. I want to make one other thing clear: the Norfolk Island Act set up a framework for self-government on Norfolk Island within the Act itself. The Act is basically the constitution of Norfolk Island and, whilst it has been modified over the years, it was fully in force at the time of the change of government in 1983. Norfolk Island had no powers over subdivisions-they were signed by a Commonwealth Minister here-and it had no powers over a number of aspects of the island where it was deemed necessary for those aspects to be protected for future gendrations because of the small size of the island - nd its inability to support a boom or bust type of economy based on a short term advantage. It is an island which has a great deal of the autonomy-in fact, practically total autonomy - and I think that it has been governed at responsibly by those people who have been elected to do it. I recommend to the honour the able member for Bendigo that, before he that his Party supports independence for the island or anything else, he might read the views of his colleagues who spent a lot of time with members on this side of the House the preparation of that report. Whilst Norfolk Islanders may be upset about Australians on Norfolk Island being able to vote in Australia and may be extending that to a threat of independence, having been Minister for that area I believe that Norfolk Island is well served as it is. It has all the independence that it needs to do whatever it desiresexcept to destroy the island.",85
175,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have never been to Norfolk Island. I must say that it is a place that I would like to visit at some stage. Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment as a Deputy Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives. It is a great pleasure for me to have one of my Queensland colleagues in that position, and I am sure that your constituents in Wide Bay will also be complimented by the fact that you have been so appointed. I note that there has been a fairly wideranging debate, so, with your pelmission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will enter into the spirit of that in a moment. I will begin by dealing briefly with the portion of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill that proposes a series of changes that are intended to improve the management of government employees by increasing the flexibility of existing arrangements, by devolving greater responsibility to heads of departments or agencies, by simplifying and sometimes rationalising existing procedures and by clarifying perceived anomalies. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, members of the Opposition, of course, have no argument with the aims of this particular Bill in that respect; nor do we have any particular reason to object strongly to any of the proposed amendments. However, as the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out-I would like to pick up on some of his remarks-the Government's policy of devolution in this respect falls far short Opposition's commitment to make the chief executive officer of each department or statutory authority responsible for his staff establishment, terms, conditions of employment and deployment of staff within an overall budget constraint. Having said that, what I really want to do is to support the Opposition's amendment and the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Bennelong here tonight. I remind the House that the honourable member for Bennelong moved the following amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure to acknowledge Commonwealth employees' freedom to associate, and the Government's failure to capture the productivity improvements to be had from enterprise bargaining within the federal Public Service by: (a) proscribing compulsory membership of trade unions; (b) proscribing preference for trade unionists in awards and federal legislation; (c) abolishing automatic deduction of union dues within Commonwealth departments and authorities; and by (d) giving the chief executive officers of Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities the same responsibility as their private sector counterparts in deciding the size, composition, deployment, pay and conditions of employees, subject only to a budget constraint. This indeed is an extremely worthwhile amendment. I believe that it really comes to some of the core issues of the problems that we have in this country today. I was quite astounded to listen to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who, I must say, is something of a breath of fresh air in this place, because he does seem to have some original thoughts of his own and some original contributions to make, whereas most of his colleagues seem just to go along like sheep and do what they are told. Mr Bilney-Especially on your side.",86
176,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, not on our side at all. On our side we are all original thinkers, but on the Minister's side I must say that the of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is one person who seems to be able to speak up for himself. Some of the propositions that I hear him put forward from time to time are, to say the least, interesting and challenging. He admitted here tonight the failure of the present system of industrial relations, but what he was not prepared to bring himself to recognise was how much the industrial climate has changed in Australia in recent years. There needs to be a recognition of how the present system has failed. Basically, up until the last few days we have adhered to a centralised wage fixing system. Almost alone in the industrialised world we have subscribed to and maintained the system. We are starting to recognise at last that Australia cannot prosper with the shackles and constraints of that system any longer. Even the Government has been dragged to a recognition of that fact. Of course, members of the Government are only dipping their collective toes in the water of change in respect of industrial relations. We on this side of the House believe that they are really incapable of coming to grips with the extent of change that is necessary in this particular area if Australia is to move and become prosperous once again. The big difference, it seems to me, is that there is now, hopefully, a new level of maturity in the Australian work force. The Industrial Relations Commission has changed its position on that, and I think rightly so, because there is a new level of maturity. I think someone on the other side of the House said once that the caravan has now moved on to the point where I believe that workers and managers can get together and suitably negotiate conditions-and it has been shown to work The honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked for some time about abuses of power. There is that potential when there is an uneven playing field, as some workplaces may inherently seem to be. But, essentially, we have seen example after example of how, in today's climate, workers and managers can get together and talk about pay and conditions and come to arrangements whereby each is better off. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know what has happened at Power Brewing in our State. One cannot argue with the fact that the employees there got together with the management and came up with an arrangement which was better for everybody. Of course, it turned out that the employees were earning $60 or $80 a week more than their union counterparts outside Power Brewing. What is more, the company was much more productive, and the result of that, of course, has been a success. One cannot argue with that as a model of success. Power Brewing is now almost a market leader in Queensland, and people who enjoy beer tell me that it is an excellent beer.",86
177,Mr REID,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,There is no such thing as a bad beer.,87
178,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am prepared to take the honourable member's word on that point. Power's is an excellent product, and it is an excellent product because there is a commitment of both management and staff in the organisation to achieve an excellent product. We have that model. We have the model of the Metway Bank as well, which we hold up as being an example of employees and the employer getting together to negotiate terms forward and conditions of employment.  dockyard?",87
179,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not know about that particular example, but I would be prepared to look at that. If that is an example of where it did not work, then let us try to understand why it did not work. What I am concentrating on is the potential that it has to work if it is allowed to. The trouble with the people on the other side of the chamber is that they do not want it to work because they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. After all, they are here largely at the pleasure of union bosses and people such as Mr Kelty and others. We saw Mr Ferguson trotting around the world holding the hand of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and telling him what to do and what not to do. I can understand that honourable members opposite have a real problem doing away with that system. Ultimately it will do away with them. I am sure that will happen in the not-toodistant future anyway. However, this new approach has worked in many circumstances. We saw it work recently at Shepparton; once again an example of how an enterprise could be saved by doing away with the old system and the sort of work practices that had crept in over the years. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about abuse. If we really want to talk about abuse, then let us look at how unions have abused the power and privilege that they have enjoyed. The honourable member for Kalgoodie mentioned Robe River. I will talk about Robe River for a moment. Fortunately, that company finally ended up with someone there running the show who decided that enough was enough. Some of the rarts that existed there, and which had been brought in plainly through union abuse of power, were quite incredible. They included having a chef to bring both hot and cold meals to the drivers of company trains so that they had a choice. What about the 'wattle' bags they had there, so named not because of their distinctive yellow colour but because of employees asking 'What'll I take home tonight?'. A moment ago I was talking about SPC. In that particular case, the workers enjoyed a shiny allowance which was apparently compensation paid to the fork-lift drivers for the glare from the fruit cans. That is the type of abuse that had crept in. And they wondered why they could not survive! The Darling Harbour project ultimately destroyed the New South Wales Government. I notice that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) is not with us tonight, but he would know all about that. The unionists on the Darling Harbour project ended up getting a Chinese meal allowance because they were working close to the restaurants of Chinatown and the wafting aromas from those establishments apparently strained their delicate culinary disposition. We could go on about the abuse of power that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was talking about. This country has been subjected to the abuse of trade union power for years. It has ultimately almost brought country unstuck. I believe that now that position is entirely indefensible. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie continues to live in those past glorious days, as members of the Labor Party see them, when those union abuses could continue. We could talk about the Builders Labourers Federation. The history of that particular union is a catalogue of abuse of power and union thuggery almost beyond belief. We could talk about the painters and dockers and what a great institution they were members of. We could read the catalogues of the Cooke inquiry in Queensland which Mr Goss, when elected, could not close down quickly enough because of the great embarrassment that it was to him with, revelations of unbelievable abuse of privilege and abuse of power by the trade union movement. Tonight we heard from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as we usually do, an outstanding explanation of the Opposition's very rational, modern and progressive approach to industrial relations. We on this side of the House see industrial relations, along with taxation, as being one of the key areas for reform. Members of the Government are aware that we intend to radically reform the taxation system. However, in tandem with that, we see the reform of the industrial relations system as being absolutely fundamental if Australia is to become prosperous again. Over the last seven, eight or nine years Australia has ceased to be prosperous. One of the reasons for that is the almost manic adherence of the Government to an outmoded, discredited and what has now turned out to be an unworkable system of industrial relations. One outstanding feature of industrial relations in the last 10 years has been the fall off in trade union membership. The latest ABS figures show that only 41 per cent of the overall work force in 1990 were union members. Only 31 per cent in the private sector were union members. Tonight we are talking particularly about trade unionism in the public sector, where a much higher percentage of employees-68 per cent-are members of trade unions. The reason for that, as the this honourable member for Bennelong clearly pointed out, was the compulsory element of trade unionism that still exists within the public sector. Compulsory trade unionism in itself is a vestige of the past. Unions have been significantly protected and they have, of course, taken advantage of that protection. We have identified, in the amendment that we have moved tonight, some of the most objectionable aspects of trade unionism as we see it today. As I said, the first is compulsory union membership. I must say that I have never really heard a reasoned, logical debate which would convince the average person that there is some real rationale for enforcing membership of anything on anybody in our society. It seems to me that to enforce membership of a trade union on people would deny their most fundamental right, and that is the right in our society to associate or, conversely, the right not to associate. I would like to hear some reason why people should be forced to join unions, whether they be public service unions or private sector unions. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, we hear members of the Government saying that there is no such thing as compulsory unionism in Australia. We are challenged by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to go out to the work place and see what is happening. When we do, what do we find? We find a closed shop-effectively, compulsory trade unionism. That is one of the reasons why productivity levels have fallen so deplorably low by world standards. The second objectionable aspect of the current system, particularly within the Public Service-the honourable member for Bennelong alluded to some particular exampleswas the preference for employment clauses; in other words, it effectively means that unless you are a member of the union, you are not likely to get a job. The third plank that we object to is the automatic deduction of union dues. We intend to reverse each of those elements. We regard them all as being counterproductive and, ultimately, we do not believe that they are in the best interests of the workers or the management, or indeed Australia as a whole. I would not want to put down public servants in general because I am one of those who believes that a vibrant, efficient and effective public service is important in any society. I think there are many public servants who take great pride in their work; that they are well motivated and do their jobs well. But I do not think that anyone could argue with the proposition that underemployment is fairly rife within some parts of the Public Service. However, I do not see any reason why we should not have an effective and efficient public service. Opposition policies in general and the policies that we are talking about tonight, which are the changes that we are foreshadowing in our particular amendment, have special implications for the Public Service. They will allow the sort of flexibility that should restore the Public Service to the, level of effectiveness and efficiency that it ought to have. In doing that, those who are public servants hopefully might be able to stand with some pride in that they are public servants or civil servants and that they are, in fact, making a contribution to society in general. OECD research has shown that, for public utilities, labour productivity in Australia has been less than half of that of our major trading partners. I believe that greater efficiency and productivity is a worthwhile goal. As I said before, I am concerned that the maintenance of the present system and, particularly, the high presence of trade unionism still within the Public Service is really all about power and influence and, particularly, the power and influence of the ACTU. I observe in passing that the ACTU is patronised to a very great extent by this Hawke Government. There is a plethora of ACTU representation on government boards and advisory committees. I have lists of them here and I would not even be able to start to read them out. But for all on these boards, of course, there are payments for sitting fees and for travelling allowances. I think it is important to put on the record that the since the Hawke Government came to office, it has actually given the ACTU taxpayer-funded grants totalling more than $25m. (Time expired)",87
180,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have chosen to enter this debate for a couple of reasons. One reason is that I have a continuing interest in both the industrial relations area and, of course, some of the proposals that come up in this Bill, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. I primarily entered the debate because of the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) when he talked about a company in his own electorate, namely, Robe River Mining Co. He made some interesting remarks which I think require a bit of further comment. Robe River, of course, is driving the trade union bureaucrats of Australia crazy for the simple reason that it keeps achieving. It is interesting to note the claims of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that the CRA is somehow more productive, but it is not. I think they were the words that he used. He said that it was more productive but that it had an over-burden problem. By over-burden, I do not whether he means that it still has compulsory trade unionism or whether it has some dirt on top of its iron ore. But it could be a bit of both. I quote the simple facts: What has Robe River Mining accomplished? It has lifted its loading rates from 2,000 tonnes per hour in mid-1986 to 5,000 tonnes per hour in mid-1991. The frequency rates for all injuries have dropped from 433 to 268 in the same period. In 1986-87 there were 63 lost time injuries and in 1990-91 there were 12. Ships residence port time has dropped from 173 hours prior to 1986 hours to an average of 74 hours today. Tonnage output per employee for the years ending March 1985, 1986 and 1987 was approximately 10,000. This has risen to a staggering 31,000 tonnes per man, per year at March 1991. Robe River Mining has achieved a 400 per cent increase in productivity. This has been achieved by workplace reform. It is an interesting point that it is not long ago that Dr Lawrence, the Premier of Western Australia, congratulated Robe River because it won the commodities award in this year's Australian export awards. That is what others saw of it. A lot of things have to be understood about Robe River. The first is that, unlike some of the other bigger operators, it operates principally in the spot market. The only reason it survives is by being super efficient. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie also painted this picture of a management that did not really care what it paid and did not really care what sorts of deals it did with the union bureaucracy. It only had a short term mine and it did not really matter. We know that all those deals were done, but I do not think that they were done by policy of the board of directors. They were done by the then manager who now has quite a bit of notoriety in Western Australia. His name is Wyvern Rees, better known as Ollie Rees. Olli- Rees, when he got the sack at Robe River, of course was rewarded by Brian Burke, the then Premier of Western Australia, when he got the sack at Robe River, for his great services to the trade union movement in Robe River. However, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has just pointed out that they got enough food for the family every time they took a train a couple of hundred miles. Rees was rewarded with the general managership of the State Government Insurance Commission. Rees is the bloke who threw all the Western Australian taxpayers' money around. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie wants to suggest that, while he was there, there was some broad company policy. Rees was a union plant. I do not know what his long term background is with the Labor movement, but Charles Copeland and others recognised the disastrous performance of the company he managed, due principally to the most stupid of arrangements. We had more people trying to get in a crane than could fit in it. There could not be one person in there operating the levers, there had to be two. There was no room for them, but that did not matter because they both got paid. People refused to be driven along roads because there was a little bit of dust on them or something. They then refused again when a water truck was put on those roads because, of course, they then were too wet. It is absolute union thuggery organised by trade union bureaucrats who have an entirely different agenda on the welfare of workers. That is the other point I want to make. These disputes have been going on at Robe River for quite some time. The only phone calls that I have ever received from Robe River-and there were a number-were from workers ringing me up because we had some passing acquaintance in the north-west during my time up there. They were saying, 'Wilson, for goodness' sake, tell those stupid politicians to get off our backs. We do not want their help. What is happening up here is great. It is giving us some pride in our job. We do not like the thugs who have gone into this place, are standing over us, threatening us and wanting to knock us around if we vote other than according to their recommendations. We rather like the new jobs that we have. We are better paid'. But above all came this common thread, 'We have a bit of pride. We are now proud of what we are doing'. When is trade union bureaucracy going to wake up to what is best for the workers? Of course, the amendment proposed by the Opposition talks about some of this. It talks about compulsory unionism. The best thing about making unionism voluntary is that the trade union bureaucrat - of course, these benches are full of them-will not have a career path now. A union bureaucrat starts off in university and does not go out and do a bit of hard work up at Robe River to find out what workers want. There is no way that person is going to get that sort of dirt under his fingernails. He goes straight to the union bureaucracy. There is a divided career path then. If he is really smart, he can become a Bill Kelty or, of course, he can be like the other fellow who is a bit slow and has joined the banking industry. I will think of his name. He has joined Westpac Banking Corporation. He has himself a nice little career. He got himself well-known and they have plucked him in. Or he could become a member of parliament with the hope, of course, of becoming Prime Minister. These are well-defined career paths. No wonder honourable members opposite do not want to change it. But, with voluntary unionism, membership is got on performance. Those opposite should not worry; people would join. I am a member of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association. It does not send the heavies out to collect my dues. It does not get it from my wool cheque. It sends me an account and I pay it. I will tell the House why I pay it. It is because I think it gives me good service. But what sort of service do people expect to get when they have to join a union? They get nothing. That is what the workers are getting fed up with. Metway in Queensland is fighting to the death the staff association and the members who work there, trying to fend off the loving embrace of the traditional trade union bureaucracy. The company does not want it. But, of course, the present Government in Queensland does not want to worry about the company's views. The Government knows where its bread is buttered. It knows that 64 per cent of the preselection vote in Queensland, as in every other State, resides with the trade union bureaucracy. When the trade union bureaucracy says, 'Jump', the Government says, 'How high?'. ",89
181,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Well, if that is not the case in New South Wales; that is unique. It might be just the national average. Perhaps it is about 60 per cent in New South Wales; it is certainly above 50, and that is very unhealthy for democracy. It is time that this situation was stopped. We are going to give the Australian people the opportunity. I will tell the Government something about the trade union bureaucrats. In a free situation, with some genuine negotiation, it could be argued that the work force has more need for the services of a union than in the present centralised system. But workers will have to be convinced about it. They will have to know that they are getting good service. I think that is excellent. That is in the interests of the workers. I come back to Robe River for a moment. Some outrageous things have happened. The last thing that Robe River did, which has infuriated the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), is that it actually took a business decision. It decided that it was fed up with employing its own seamen on its own tugs. I will tell the House why it was fed up. Those seamen on those tugs have roughly the same industrial award as an Australian seaman on a ship sailing around the world. I made some points here the other day. I think that is a stupid arrangement, too, but we probably need to change some of the aspects of shipping so that people can take their families to sea. There is some argument about seamen being absent from their families for long periods and therefore having similar periods at home. But that is very costly and makes us uncompetitive with the rest of the world. I remind the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that it removes one of the greatest and simplest forms of value adding for Australia-shipping the products, be they primary or secondary, from this country. We are an island nation we have no shipping industry because have these literally bloody-minded trade bureaucrats who until recently demanded a butcher be on a ship on which all meals were pre-prepared before the ship left port and which were reheated in a microwave say in his letter; oven. I have been told about it by blokes whom I have sat next to in first-class seats on aeroplanes-who have been going off to case operate their couple of cray boats weeks in which they were supposed to be catching up with their relationships with Mum. That is silly. The situation is that a tug sits at Cape Lambert, which is the port servicing Robe River, and goes out five or six miles to shepherd in a tanker or bulk ore carrier then ties up again. Those blokes are living within cooeeof Mum. Why should they have the one-on, one-off arrangement and all those things? Robe River got fed up with this made a sensible decision. It advertised throughout Australia for bids from people provide a contracted service. That is surely the right of any business in Australia. We not yet a totalitarian state, although when goes to open a bank account one might wonder. But the reality is that, when Robe River did that, it got an application from company which is saving it $1.6m year of operation and $0.6m per annum after that-and doing it at a profit. I understand that the company is doing it at a profit because it is a small business organisation, owning, operating and servicing the tug itself. What is wrong with that? We are a nation of small businessmen. Government has a Minister for small business. But one is not supposed to have a small business in the tug business because that very big preserve of the trade union bureaucracy. That was the crime committed by Robe River and which caused the Western Australian Parliament, under Carmen up Lawrence-notwithstanding that she bothered to put out a press release congratulating Robe River for its export performance-to pass motion condemning Robe River. Robe River gave its work force on the existing tugs six months notice-and no doubt there but other form of settlement. Senator Cook and we members of the State Parliament have gone union on about it. Larry Graham, the member for that Pilbara, actually wrote to the manager of Robe River to give him the resolution of the Western Australian Parliament and went on to In our democratic society, the Parliament is the manifestation of the will of the people, and in this clearly the Parliament has condemned the in the six actions of your companies. It was trying to save some money for its shareholders by employing a small businessman because the trade union bureaucracy would not let its day workers work at reasonable rates. That was supposed to be somehow anti-democratic. It sure is if you are a trade and union bureaucrat because it might mean your job one day. What is the greatest anathema to trade union bureaucrats? It is workers negotiating with the boss, making their own arand rangements, because, if enough of them did that, the simple fact is that the trade union to bureaucrats would not be needed. For goodness sake, fancy losing all those opportunities are to be Prime Minister! That is outrageous, is one it not? It is doubly outrageous when one goes into the small business premises in Australia and, as I have and I guess most a members have from time to time, one goes in its first looking for the boss. If it is a metal shop or some such business, it is pretty hard to work out who is the boss. He is probably running around in a pair of steel-capped boots, black shorts and blue singlet. He does not look any different from the other fellows. He sits down at morning tea The with them and they have a good chat about their business. They happen to like the boss and to be grateful that, through his bit of is a energy-and probably through mortgaging his family home-he has created a job for them. There are 760,000 similar operations. Those workers do not need Bill Kelty. They are fed with this Government's award structures because of their complexity. They would much prefer to have simple, flat, hourly rates a provided they are at a reasonable level. Mr Hollis-Yes, on $2 an hour; . that is was some what they'd be getting.",91
182,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"What a stupid man. That is his problem: if he had any brains, he would be dangerous. Who other than someone of his mental capacity would accept two bucks an hour? I think he would probably go for three. What is his background? He was one of those who took the big quid from the workers and gave them nothing but trouble. I well remember a strike in the Pilbara which went on for six weeks and the '.vorkers got $10 a week extra. One can work out how many weeks they had to work to get back the wages they lost during that period. More than anything, I support what my Party is doing because it will give a few breaks to workers who choose something different. Let us make it very clear what we propose. We propose that people can have award arrangements; that they can stay with the trade unions; that they can seek the coverage of trade union bureaucrats. But we are just giving them also the right to say, 'No, thanks; I am quite happy to represent myself because, from the examples that I see around me at Power Brewing, Lincoln Electric, Metway and thousands of other small businesses where it does not pay you fellows to come around and heavy the trade union fees out of a couple of workers, the people seem to be doing pretty well, thank you very much.' We often talk about transport in this place. Let Government members find for me a long haulage driver who wants the award. He wants trip money. He wants it to be generous, and he will always argue for a bit more, but he wants something he can understand. More importantly in this day and age, knowing how voracious the Government is in taking its share, he wants to know how much he is going to get in his hand. Into the bargain, he is fed up with the tax scales and their complexity. Let Government members grab one of those fellows as I have time and again-I bet those opposite who are trade union bureaucrats never have-and ask him, 'Would you like to own this truck?'. Every time he will say, 'Yes'. I am still guarantor for a couple of truckies whom I set up in business. I gave them a break. They did not want the Government's protection so that they worked only a 30-hour week. They wanted to own a truck and to work a lot more than that, and to work hard for the extra money they could make for themselves and their families. Those opportunities are what Australians grasp at when they can get out of the web of the trade union bureaucracy. That is why, when we give people the choice, we will find out how good trade unions are, because the good ones will keep members and give proper services. If they do not, they will die. That seems a good ending for those who do not. At the moment they all do not, and they live in some prosperity. It is interesting to find the addresses of some of those senior trade union bureaucrats today. We do not find them in the working class suburbs. Consult the electoral roll. There would not be too many in the electorate of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). They all want to live up and to live it up. Of course there are some other aspects of that which are at times a bit hard to explain. I thought we should put the record straight about Robe River. It has done wonders for the Australian economy. It is helping this Government out of the mess it created for Australia. It does not deserve to be attacked for trying to make this country function properly. (TIme expired)",93
183,Mr HOLLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I had not intended to enter this debate on the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill, but when watching it on television in my room I was somewhat provoked, and I was even more so by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) when I entered the chamber. For his information, I point out that I have never been a trade union bureaucrat but all my working life I have proudly been a member of a trade union. Each year I proudly take out my membership in my trade union. I still hold my membership card. Mr Bilney-Which one is that?",93
184,Mr HOLLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Australian Workers Union, one of the great traditional unions of Australia. From listening to Opposition members speak to their amendment it is obvious, as it always is, that they have absolutely \fiO understanding of industrial relations at all. They talk about the brave new world they are proposing. If they want to see an example of the brave new world, let them come with me tomorrow to Port Kembla, where the workers at the giant steelworks are on strike and will remain on strike until Thursday-and they were on strike last week. These strikes are as a result of the stupidity of the Greiner Government and its industrial relations Minister, John Fahey, who are trying to bring in contract workers. I say to those opposite here and now that the workers of Port Kembla will not accept that, and I support them. I support them wholeheartedly. I joined the picket line, and I will join it again on Friday. The only thing that the Opposition understands about industrial relations is a threat to put troops on the waterfront. It says this to the workers at Port Kembla and at other places. The strike at Port Kembla is about contract workers. The honourable member for O'Connor reacted very strongly when I interjected about the wage rates for contract work. Contract labour is about reducing working conditions that workers in Australia, with their unions, have fought for and achieved over many, many years, and it is about reducing .their hourly rates. Quite frankly, the workers I am proud to represent are not going to tolerate that. They are not going to see eroded the conditions that they have worked for over many years. They are not going to see wages go down. The last thing that Australia wants at the moment is industrial disputation. If we follow what the Opposition is suggesting-and we have only to look at what is going to happen over the coming months in New South Wales-we will find industrial mayhem throughout the whole nation. The policies of the Opposition are a recipe for industrial mayhem. The honourable member for O'Connor and other Opposition members waxed lyrical about voluntary unionism. That is fine; it is great to stand up here and talk about the choice of the workers and whether they are going to join a union or not. The question I would like to ask is this: if there is to be all this freedom in allowing people to decide whether to join a trade union or not, will there be the same freedom of choice in deciding. whether or not to get the benefits that the unions negotiate and fight for? Will those people who are not going to join unions refuse the benefits that the unions get? Of course not. They want the best of both worlds. They want the benefits achieved through unionism, but they do not want to be a member of a union. They cannot have it both ways. If people are going to take the benefits that the unions get through fighting and struggling, it is up to them to join a union. I know that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) supports what is happening in New South Wales and supports the industrial legislation that Mr Fahey is bringing in. He is different from his Leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) who, when in Wollongong last week, admitted that he had not even read the legislation.",93
185,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,That is not correct.,94
186,Mr HOLLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"At the University of Wollongong, in answer to a question from Paul Matters about the legislation, the secretary of the South Coast Labour Council, the honourable member for Wentworth, admitted before an audience of 200 people that he had not read the legislation. I know the honourable member for Bennelong has read the legislation, because he came out publicly and said he supported it. I used that quote many, many times. I wrote to every branch member of the Australian Labor Party in the Throsby electorate quoting the honourable member for Benne1ong, and I thank him for the quote. It will make sure that my vote goes up even more next time. Maybe with his intervention he has assisted the honourable member for Wentworth to understand what is proposed by the legislation in New South Wales, and it is the legislation that he is going to introduce. The honourable member for O'Connor reacted rather strongly when I mentioned $2 an hour. It is not fanciful. In many of the cleaning jobs going on it will be the lowest common denominator. It could well be $2 an hour. The honourable member for O'Connor said that many people say they do not need uniens. Like many members of Parliament, I often have people come to me when they have been thrown out of a job and there is some dispute about their severance payor their wages. 1 could quote numerous examples. The first thing I ask these people is, 'Have you seen your union?'. Many of them say, 'I am not in a union'. It is very difficult then for me to go in and do battle for them to get their entitlements. Most of the people who come to me and who have not been unionists most certainly join a union after that. Maybe when things are going well they think that they do not need a union; but let us see when things do not go well just how important the union movement is to them. It is all very well, as the honourable member for O'Connor said, that when people are asked to join a union they say, 'No, thanks. I do not want to be member's of a union'. That is fine if they want to say that. But let them say, 'No thanks, 1 do not want to get any of the benefits that the unions deliver for me. I do not want to get the correct rate of pay. 1 do not want the conditions.___Ldo-not want the safety requirements onfhe job. I do not want any of these conditions'. As I said, it is not fair for these people to be taking the benefits that they get from the union movement and then saying that they do not want to be a member of a union. What the Opposition is proposing here would lead to industrial mayhem in Australia. We have got to look only at what is going to happen in New South Wales in the coming months to see that this is a recipe for the mayhem that Australia will endure in the unlikely event of the Opposition members gaining the Treasury bench. The honourable member for Bennelong has said that. He has been quoted extensively in the lllawarra media and extensively quoted by me as saying that this is a recipe that Opposition members want to introduce; New South Wales is a dry run for what the Opposition members want to inflict on the whole of Australia. 1 warn those opposite that there is no way the workers in Port Kembla and the Illawarra will accept it. If they want an example of that they should come down to Wollongong or the lllawarra where the mighty steel works are silent and will remain silent over the next week until this stupidity that the New South Wales Government is inflicting on the lllawarra is done away with.",94
187,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to rise tonight to enter into this most significant debate. Like other honourable members before me, 1 will concentrate on the industrial relations portion of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. The contribution that we have just heard was undoubtedly one of the most ill-informed and unstructured approaches to this debate that I have heard in many a long year. I inform the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that I know a wee bit about the steel industry. 1 spent 7'/z years in a steel mill, the first 4'12 on the floor of a blast furnace-I have been there, done that-and 1 know all about collective bargaining. I grew up with collective bargaining. Is this not what the Industrial Relations Commission last week in its newest national wage case, in response to the April national wage case-which was a Clayton's wage case-has given Australia? I support the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) that any action by the Government, any action by the Industrial Relations Commission which opens up our constrained and constricted system, is to be applauded. In that respect I am pleased that the Industrial Relations Commission has said, 'Let us have a bit more action in section 115, and perhaps in the odd case we will even look at section 112 of the Industrial Relations Act'. In April the Commission said that Australia was not mature enough for enterprise bargaining. In October it said, 'Maybe you are and maybe you aren't; you can have it', but its description of enterprise bargaining, the Government's description of enterprise bargaining, the Labor Party's description of enterprise bargaining, bears no relationship to my description or that of the Liberal Party or the National Party-the coalition. Enterprise bargair-ing to me means a free discussion between management and the people who work in the workplace about how they are going to share the profits of the workplace or business, those profits being what is left after money has been spent on material cost inputs and on government charges-which are excessive in this country-on regulations, on taxation, on overheads and on selling expenses. Finally, we get around to the cost of people-people being a major cost input in most businesses. We on this side of the House say that those people ought to have the right to negotiate freely the kinds of benefits that they are going to receive out of what is left. The problem we have at the moment is that frequently there is nothing left and, increasingly frequently in this recession that we 'had to have', more and more businesses are disappearing because of the total inflexibility of the system. The newest national wage case will not decrease that inflexibility because it says, de facto, 'Award wages are the minimum, award conditions are the minimum, award hours of work are the minimum; you can pay more if you can do a deal with your work force and if you get the union to agree' - not your work force-'that it is okay, you can do a deal'. Terrific. That is very positive stuff. The problem is that it does not put into the equation the local people at the local plant, at the local workface, where it really happens. They are the ones who are concerned, they are the ones who want to keep their jobs. In these hard times they may have to negotiate down a bit. Next year, when times are better-if they get better next year, and that is under question-the work force gets a better slice of the cake. That is positive. Perhaps they could keep their jobs; perhaps more Australian businesses would not be going bankrupt. We hear an awful lot of rhetoric from the Australian Labor Party when it comes to industrial relations. We do not hear much rhetoric from this side of the House. We talk about real people; that is, working men and women, and that is mostly everybody out there. There are very few so-called capitalists left in this world. If we look at the composition of those who own theÂ· business enterprises in this country, we find that 90 per cent of the business enterprises are owned by small people in small business with very few employees, who do good things for this country, and we have to learn how to support them. Voluntary union membership is something we are talking about in the amendment to this Bill; not union bashing, but truly the opportunity to belong or not to belong. I have been an employer for a long time; I have also been a real worker. As an employer I have been required time and time again, because of this thing called the 'closed shop', to tell new and intending employees, 'If you want to work for my company you have to buy a union ticket, mate, before we will put you on the payroll'. If he says, 'I don't want to belong to the union', I say, 'That is tough. If you want to work for this company you buy a ticket because the Government of Victoria says that you will build no buildings in Victoria with any people who do not belong to not only a union but the right union'. Increasingly, that right union must have a minimum of 10,000 members. That is wonderful. In itS heyday my company employed 45 people. We would love to have an enterprise union because my people do not like the constraints of the central system, they do not like the award conditions. They would like to work longer and smarter. They would like to get rid of closing down an industry for 12 rostered days off a year. What an absolute nonsense that is. It destroys any chance of productivity to close an industry down for 12 days a year so that the union bureaucracy bosses can make sure everybody gets their RDO and nobody is cheating. The honourable member for KalgoorIie (Mr Campbell) really went over the top when he talked about the power of the winder drivers. He was talking about the innate power inherent in the trade union system as practised in this country through centralised control, because we give the unions that control over the system. We give the unions control over the system because we allow compulsory union membership, we allow the closed shop. Some day my private member's Bill will be passed and we will have true voluntary union over membership. Some day it will happen. I do not know whether it is going to be in 1991there is still time for an election, is there not?-or in 1992. We on this side of the House are not sure who we will be facing. Will it be the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), or the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins)? It looks like he is in for a shot shortly, too. I will get back to industrial relations. Voluntary union membership is not about union bashing. Unions ought to. supply a service to their members. If they ate supplying a service they will get members. I can give an instance of a company in the United States that for many years had an enterprise union and that enterprise union ultimatelyDebate interrupted. NA",95
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10,30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.  put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA NA Second Reading Debate resumed.",97
189,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will give an example of an enterprise union that I know of in the United States. Over some 30 years it accumulated several hundred members. It developed such inefficient practices, and shop stewards in their dividual areas developed so much control, that the place became an absolute nightmare inefficiency. Finally, after 30 years, that enterprise union reached a boiling point frustration and its membership went on strike. The world was going to come to an end. Seven days later they went back to work. In the process of going back to work they made a decision to join a national union. When they did, life changed immediately. Now, instead of 37 single job classifications, there are five. Now, instead of lines painted on the floor past which people do not walk, everybody does what they are capable of doing and what their training will enable them to do. When a bloke on the lathe rings up the AF of L and says, ' Mr National Union Organiser, would you please come and help me because the boss is making me sweep the floor', the national union tells him to get lost because it has more important things to do. It says, 'Go back to work and do the job and perhaps the company might make a profit and you can earn more money next year', That is an instance in which an enterprise union has not served the company or its membership well and the national union is doing a better job, I make the important point that unions are there to serve their membership. It is long past time they did. AU too frequently in this country they do not. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred to the winder drivers and how much power they had, and whether it was not time that we devolved a bit of it. Everybody has talked about Robe River. The honourable be member for Kalgoorlie said that HamersleyeRA is more productive than Robe River. I dispute that. They are different operations; they process different ore and they have different clients. But it is clear that in the last four years, from March of 1987 until March 1991 of 1991, output per employee at Robe River increased by 320 per cent-that is, 320 per cent in 48 calendar months. That has to be an Australian record. If we could do half as well with half the major enterprises in this country, we would not be worried about our balance of payments; we would have the problem work solved. We would not be worried about inprotectionism and we would not be worried about interest rates; we would be in the best of shape that anyone could imagine. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie of talked about the Liberal road leading to industrial chaos. From my viewpoint, we have industrial chaos in this country now, and we have had it for the entire time that I have had the privilege of living in this great nation. We have the most archaic, antiquated, misdirected industrial relations system in the world. It makes absolutely no sense. I am certain that our foref-thers who devised that system were convinced that what they had-the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and its Act, which was at the forefront of industrial relations at the time-was the best thing since sliced bread. The only problem is that time marched on and we did not. Our system did not march on; all it has done is become more and more centralised, to the point at which we are so constrained that we do not allow our people on the shop floor to earn more money, we do not allow them to work the hours they would like to work and we do not allow them to communicate with their managements. On 17 October 1991 in the Senate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) made a speech on reforming the industrial relations system. He said: In 1979 an average of 3.8 per cent of full time employees were absent from work because of illness, accident or absenteeism. In 1989 the remained relatively steady at 3.4 per cent of full time employees. This reflects the fact that management has yet to address fully issues such as work organisation and job satisfaction which are central to reducing absenteeism. It is not just management. Talk about kick the can! We have had a kick the management can concept in this country for about the last two years. We constantly kick management because we say management is incompetent. That is why we have industrial action; that is why the workers are unhappy; that is why the industrial relations system does not work; that is why we are inefficient in this countrybecause management is terrible. The work force is terrific but management is terrible. Our system says that a boss, an owner of an enterprise, cannot sit down at the table in his own premises and negotiate wages, conditions of employment and work practices with his own people; that he has to deal through a union and he has to deal through the Industrial Relations Commission. That is nonsense. How on earth can management ever develop the skills that the Industrial Relations Commission in the April wage case decision said it did not have? The IRC said, 'You are not mature enough, Australia; you are not mature enough as workers and you are not mature enough as managers to handle this thing which John Howard, the honourable member for Bennelong and shadow Minister for industrial relations, employment and training, calls enterprise bargaining'. The concept of enterprise bargaining is an Australian concept, not a worldwide concept. It is not a Yank concept or a German concept or an English concept; it is not French, Italian or even Iranian. This really is an Australian concept for Australian conditions. It came from this side of the House, from the Liberal and National parties from work done in 1986. I have been the greatest supporter of that work because I believe it offers us a solution to many of our problems. It offers us the opportunity to move from this massive centralised control system to something that will work in the Australian context without going quite as far as New Zealand went-that is, totally abolishing the system. There are times when I believe that perhaps figure we should just scrap it and start all over again, because we are pretty mature in this country. Yes, we need to learn something about bargaining and yes, we have to practise at it. But we will get better with practice. I am sure managements will learn, and I know the workers will learn, and I think even the unions will catch on that they have to work to keep their members. They have to provide them with some services that they find valuable. That way the unions will keep their membership, regardless of my Bill for voluntary union membership. But we do not need to go all the way down the New Zealand track. Voluntary union membership and voluntary employment agreements will be all about the free choice of workers and management to make decisions for themselves about things which are their business only. What business is it of Bill Kelty or Martin Ferguson if the management and workers at Du Pont (Australia), fibre makers in my electorate, want to make a deal between themselves? What sh()uld Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty have to do with how many hours production line workers at Glaxo in my electorate work on their new production facilities? Glaxo is run by a pretty enlightened mob. It has four new lines and $40m worth of some of the highest technological production equipment in the world. Those workers work 12 hours a day, three days a week-that is a total of 36 hours-and then they go home. So the lines run for six days a week non-stop and are shut down on Sunday. That is a very enlightened approach. Because of our system it took those parties two years to negotiate the agreement. And then the unions came in and said, 'No, you can't do that'. They messed the agreement up and it took another 12 months to sort it out. The unions said, 'Only the greenfield part of this plant, only the four new production lines worth $4Om, can run 12 hours a day'. Guess what? Nine months later, the whole blessed plant wants to work 12 hours a day. (TIme expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Brereton) adjourned. NA  That the House do now adjourn. Social Security System",97
190,Mr FORD,ADJOURNMENT,"Dunkley) (10.41 p.m.)Several weeks ago one of my constituents, an elderly lady in receipt of a pension, withdrew $5,000 in cash from her bank account. Shortly afterwards. her home was broken into and the money was stolen. This tragic event is simply one example of the fear and the anxiety that this Government has engendered amongst the elderly folk and other recipients of social security. Since the election of this Government, there have been constant changes to the social security legislation and continued attacks on the savings of the elderly. To find evidence of the Government's arrogance in this regard, one need look no further than my own electorate of Dunkley. The Department of Social Security in Frankston has recently cancelled payments to sole parents who had failed only to inform the Department of their tax file number. Not only does this raise the ugly spectre of Big Brother and a de facto Australia Card, but also it is clear that the Government is now so desperate to raise revenue that dollars are being grabbed from anywhere and everywhere. This kind of treatment directed at those who are amongst the most vulnerable in the community is nothing short of bullying and blackmail. The pampered social engineers who inhabit the Department of Social Security here in Canberra have little regard for the contribution that Australia's senior citizens have made to the development of this nation. The last few years in particular have seen a concerted attack on the elderly, especially by the bureaucracy and its supporters-the professional do-gooders who lead comfortable lives on the public payroll. Why cannot the elderly people just be left alone to enjoy their retirement in peace and quiet? They have worked hard all of their lives and paid their taxes. It is bad enough to have to wait in line for so-called elective surgery, but there are over 70,000 people on the waiting lists of public hospitals, many of those persons being the elderly. Regrettably, Frankston hospital in my electorate has quite a long waiting list, which is not the hospital's fault. It is a great facility with great staff. Why are many on the waiting lists the elderly? Many elderly, to avoid these delays, are joining expensive private funds. Again, I ask: why should they? They cannot avoid the pharmaceutical bureaucracy; records must be kept for Big Brother. But why are they being pestered for tax file numbers? It is just a new rule dreamt up in Canberra. All this comes on top of incomprehensible changes to roll-over provisions and superannuation. The bureaucrats whose telephone numbers are given for advice do not answer, so no advice is available. Opening a bank account was once a fairly simple and straightforward task. But, thanks to the introduction of yet more rules, intending depositors are subject to a Gestapo-style inquisition and demands of proof of identity. If the elderly try to open a bank account, it is almost impossible, as they do not in many cases have driving licences, credit cards or tax file numbers. If they do eventually open an account, their interest rate is deemed at 8 per cent, which attracts provisional tax apart from the normal tax. The constant introduction of more and more rules regarding aspects of people's lives, their finances and thcir medical problems is, to say the least; a pathetic example of this Government's real attitude to older Australians. I ask the GoveJ;111Ilent: why has life become so complicated for our elderly? Take a person over 65 on a small income from superannuation, receiving $368 per fortnight pension, including $62 rent allowance and a $5 pharmacy subsidy, with no tax payable up to $9,699. To this point, it is quite complicated enough. But from here on, it becomes ridiculous. For gross income over $9,699, there is a rebate of 12.8 per cent which cuts out at $16,995. Coupled with this is a 50c tax on each dollar earned over $84. The result is a nasty trap for anyone unlucky enough to fall into this horrendously complicated web of unnecessary regulation. As if that were not enough, to add insult to injury, a 50c reduction in pension for every dollar earned is an effective tax rate of 50 per cent. I wonder how this compares with the favoured status accorded to the Prime Minister's media mates. Their tax rate is reported to be as low as 10 per cent.

Whilst delighted to be entrusted with the task of presenting that petition, I wish now to add my voice to others protesting against the treatment of Syrian Jewry. Ironically, welcome developments in global politics have left us in danger of bypassing this fundamental issue of human rights. The new acceptability of the Assad regime in the wake of the Gulf war and subsequent Middle East peace process, coupled with the euphoria surrounding the mass emigration of Soviet refuseniks, can conceivably divert critical eyes from Syria's reprehensible internal policies. Indeed, since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the spectre of Western leaders tripping over themselves to embrace President Assad has become so familiar as to lead one to think that all pre-August 1990 grievances have been completely forgotten. In the meantime, the oppression of Syrian Jewry and other minority groups such as the Kurds continues unchecked. Welcome as we should the current Middle East peace process and related thaw in SyrianWestern relations, let us not forget that little has changed in Syria. SUppOlt for the allies in the Gulf war, while commendable, had more to do with President Assad's antipathy towards his Baathist enemy, Saddam Hussein, than it did with any new world order. The people of Lebanon will testify to this. As it now stands, a cash-strapped Syria is being richly rewarded for its judicious opposition to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Economically and politically, it is also benefiting from participation in the Madrid peace negotiations. Any pay back for this new mood of conciliation in Damascus must not involve turning a blind eye to the treatment of Syrian Jews. In the same way as lasting peace in the Middle Eac;t depends on Israel's acceptance of Palestinian rights, so it also depends on Syrian acceptance of the rights of its Jewish minority, in palticular the right to emigrate. Just as aid to the Soviet Union was made conditional upon the free emigration of refuseniks and just as aid is now being used as a weapon in American attempts to halt new settlements in the occupied territories, economic assistance to Syria should be made conditional upon a relaxation of controls over the Jewish community. For as long as Jewish emigration is prevented, Syria will continue to violate article 13 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. A restriction on the right to emigrate is but one of the constraints under which the Syrian Jewish community lives. Constant surveillance of the community by a special branch of the Syrian secret police, the Makhabarat, intrudes into daily life to the point where all travel over five miles requires prior approval. Virtually every activity must be reported to the Makhabarat, whilst every word uttered by the community leaders is monitored, particularly where it involves contact with foreigners. Intrusive personal dossiers are also kept on each member of the 3,800 strong community. Of greater concern is the confinement of the majority of the community to a single ghetto in Damascus, from which contact with the rest of the population is largely prohibited. In a manner reminiscent of a previous regime, the Syrian Government marks the identity cards of all Jews with the word 'Mousawi' , meaning member of the Mosaic faith. No other religious group is identified in such a manner. Past experience should alert Australia to the dangers of ignoring the plight of an oppressed minority group for geopolitical purposes. This is particularly so when the case in question bears a resemblance to past tragedies, the most recent of which was the betrayal of the Lebanon to Syria. As one would expect, the Syrian plans for peace in the Middle East involve Israel's surrendering all territories acquired in the 1967 war. This of course raises questions about the plight of Jewish settlers in the affected areas. On this point the Sydney Morning Herald reported on 1 November: Syria is not demanding the departure of all Jewish settlers from the West Bank. Whilst not suggesting that all settlements would be allowed to stay, prepared to contemplate Jewish residents who would have free passage to and from Israel. Aside from the observation that this is a minimal concession to make, Syria's treatment of its own Jewish minority hardly inspires confidence in such an undertaking. Like most people, I hope that the current Middle East peace process will bear fruit. Yet, as the Treaty of Versailles showed, in the fruits of current peace sometimes lurk the seeds of future tragedy. All issues must be dealt with in the current negotiations if we are truly to bring relief to the long suffering people of the Middle East. Let us ensure that no minority group is forgotten in the process. Operation of Legal System",100
192,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a most extraordinary matter whereby one of my constituents, Mr Edward Rice of Bourke, has been unfairly and unjustly treated by the legal processes in this country. Mr Rice owns a cordial factory in Bourke. Over the years this has been a constant target for petty break-ins, usually by Aboriginal children. It used to be broken into frefor quently-about two or three times a week. left. However, if the culprits were caught and reported to the police, it was a waste of because if they were under a certain age were not charged; if they were over a certain age, even if convicted, little or nothing happened anyway. Mr Rice found that if he caught someone and reported them he would waste half a day in court. Therefore, he soon learned not to do that. Some time ago Mr Rice spent $6,000 building a six-foot high steel fence around his factory. That was relatively successful because it cut the break-ins down to once a month. Recently he was broken into a couple of times. The last time some cash was taken and his truck keys were pinched. He was annoyed about this because the keys were of no use to anyone and he could not conduct his business in a proper manner. After a few days someone told Mr Rice the names of two of the four Aboriginal children who had broken in. He tracked down one of them, an ll-year-old boy, Aaron MCKellar, who admitted he was involved. He went to it is his house. The mother was not there at the time. The father was not there either because the parents had separated. However, he spoke to the boy's uncle, Tom MCKellar, who Ted Rice thought was the boy's father. Ted Rice explained to the boy's uncle that he did not want him charged by the police and that the boy should be made aware that what he had done was wrong. Instead of letting him off scot free, he wanted to take him back to the factory to get him to clean up some of the mess that had been created. The uncle agreed to this. Mr Rice even offered the uncle the opportunity to come along too, but he declined to do so. Mr Rice drove the boy to the factory, gave the boy a hefty kick up the backside and set him to work. A short time later his mother arrived home and rang to see what was happening and to say that her son had not yet had breakfast. Mr Rice explained the situation to her satisfaction and went and bought the boy breakfast, which he ate. An hour or so later the boy's mother arrived to pick him up, but Mr Rice said he wanted to keep her son another hour or so. She agreed to that and A policeman, having been alerted to what time was going on, also arrived to check things they out. Again Mr Rice explained what was happening. The policeman agreed it was a better course of action than having the boy charged. He left satisfied. I might add that while the boy was there he retrieved the stolen truck keys from up a tree on the other side of the road, though they were of no use to Mr Rice as he had got a new set cut in the meantime. After about 31/2 hours Mr Rice drove the boy home. He even offered to pay the boy if he would come back the next day to work. The following day the police rang Mr Rice and said that on the insistence of the Western Aboriginal Legal Service they were charging him with kidnapping and assault. Now kidnapping is a very serious charge; if convicted, one can get between 14 and 20 years gaol. Even though this was obviously a ridiculous charge, Mr Rice, a layman, was understandably terrified. He flew to Sydney, hired the best solicitor and barrister he could and largely disregarded the expense. When the case came up for hearing in Bourke last week the prosecution dropped the kidnapping charge. However, Mr Rice was found guilty of assault. He now has a criminal conviction against his name and he is on a three-year good behaviour bond. He has had to pay $2,000 to a women's refuge in lieu of a fine. On top of that he has paid out $14,300 in legal fees so far, he has paid his own travelling expenses, and he could be up for a lot more money yet. What do we have from this situation? We have a kid who is guilty but has not been charged. We have no attempt by the police to locate the other three people involved, let alone charge them. A man who tried to do the right thing has been charged and has been worried sick for months about a ridiculous charge which has been devastating to his personal family life. He has been convicted on a criminal charge and he is out of pocket, in money and time, to the extent of nearly $20,000. I think this raises a lot of questions about our legal system and about our Aboriginal legal aid system and how it operates. A travesty of justice has occurred in this case. Ted Rice is not the only loser. Bourke, a town which is enraged by what has happened, is not the only loser either. All of Australia is the loser. The sooner the Attorney-General of New South Wales, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) and all other people concerned with this decision get together to right the wrongs and to see that such a stupid decision can never be made again the better it will be for everyone. Commonsense in this instance has gone out the window, and the sooner it is regained the better. Seaworthiness of Overseas Registered Ships",101
193,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (10.56 p.m.)Tonight a Norwegian registered coal ship, the MV Rerlina, is in Port Kembla Harbour unfit to load. It has been correctly referred to as a rust bucket by the local Illawarra media. This vessel was built in Japan in 1973. Its port of registry is Grimstad, Norway. The owners are K. S. Loven Investments, Norway. The crew of the ship is Filipino. This ship arrived at Port Kembla on 28 October 1991. It was surveyed by the port . surveyor, who inspected the vessel on arrival and immediately ordered that the vessel not begin .loading due to large cracks in the main deck in between all the cargo hatches, as welL as numerous other' difficulties and safety problems. In fact, many of the cracks were covered with tar paper. I was telephoned at my home on Sunday night and asked to come down to inspect the ship. The complainant has not yet received a copy of the surveyor's report even though this is a requirement under the Act. It should be noted that the procedures of this section of the Act are seldom carried out by the Department of Transport and Communications, even though the Department has received numerous complaints. The repairs needed on the vessel include repairs to some 15 air pipes and various walkways and handrails over pipes on the main deck. There are no exposure covers for lifeboats; lifeboats and sail rigging parts are missing; there are no freshwater containers for lifeboats; two fire extinguisher hoses are perished; an IPERB manual needs to be supplied; the lifeboat lockers are damaged; the manual release of the life rafts needs to be fixed and supplied; accommodation doors on the port side of the FRD main deck and boat deck have all frames loose on the accommodation doors; there are cracks in the main deck plating between all cargo hatches and cracks in the hatch combings on Nos 3, 5, and 7 holds. As I said, many of these cracks were covered just with tar paper. This is a list of only 12 fundamental repairs that are required. The Berlina is the fourth ship held at Port Kembla in the past 12 months because of the need for similar repairs. Over the last few months, many ships have gone down. In fact, over the last year, in 1990 alone, over 200 seamen were drowned, killed or went missing from bulk carriers. Twelve ships were lost, and these 12 ships were lost through structural faults. In the first four months of 1991 a further six of these ships have gone missing, with additional loss of life. All of these ships were carrying iron ore and some of them sailed from Australian ports after loading ironstone in north-west Australia. The mining industry is most vocal about the need for the cheapest ships possible and says that the OECD standard is not valid for comparison with Australian shipping. Some of the ships which have foundered or sunk off the Western Australian coast from late last year up to the present include the Mineral Diamond, the Manila Transporter, the Alexander P and the Malete. How much longer will these rust buckets be permitted to enter our Australian ports? I remember some people here talking about bans being put on ships. When there was a ban on a ship in Port Kembla harbour, I made it a point to go down and look at the ship. The seamen's union always telephones me when these bans are on. Most of these ships are just rust buckets. I would not go out to sea in these ships. They are really dreadful. I always say to members of the Opposition, 'Come down with me to Port Kembla, talk to the workers there and we will see what is going on.' It is interesting that although those opposite have always been very quick to criticise they have been very slow to accept my invitation. In fact, they have never accepted my invitation to come to Port Kembla. We have a ship there at the moment which will not leave Port Kembla. I invite them to join me in inspecting this ship.",102

The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Question No. 771) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) What projects does the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) undertake which are not directly dependent upon the presence of or access to the MOATA or H1FAR reactors. (2) Is it a fact, as stated in the 1986 review by the then Australian Atomic Energy Commission, that closure of the HIFAR reactor would not have a major effect on the present research program. (3) Did Dr Cook, the Executive Director of --hould ANSTO, claim before a hear-g of the Public countsCornmittee that replacement reactor woulo costbetween-$75 million and $100 million; if so, (a) on what size and type of reactor operating in what megawatt range was this figure based, (b) does the figure include costs and site development costs and any other additional costs beyond the cost of the new reactor itself and (c) would a research reactor of be perfectly suitable for ANSTO's purposes. (4) Does much of the justification for the IDFAR reactor's present operations lie technetium 99m for medical purposes. (5) Has imported molybdenum 99 been used in substitution for technetium 99m. (6) Could imported molybdenum 99 replace technetium 99m produced by the HIFAR reactor for medical purposes; if so, based on current demand, what would be the cost of replacing technetium 99m produced by the H1FAR reactor with imported molybdenum 99. (7) Has a contingency plan been prepared for the absence of a reactor at ANSTO; if so, what are its contents; if not, why not. (8) What programs does ANSTO conduct which have a close relationship in respect of objectives with programs run by other public research bodies. NA (9) What degree of communication and cooperation takes place between ANSTO and other research agencies where there are overlapping or related research activities being undertaken. (10) What commercial programs are undertaken by ANSTO. (11) Are any of ANSTO's commercial programs cross-subsidised by (a) way of appropriations from Consolidated Revenue or (b) drawing on pre-existing research infrastructure; if so, how does ANSTO factor this into its commercial pricing policies. (12) Who are the (a) domestic and (b) international business rivals with respect to each commercial program undertaken by ANSTO. (13) Does ANSTO hold a monopoly with respect to any of its commercial activities; if so, why each activity not be conducted by a separate Accommercial entity which pays for access to of the HIFAR ANSTO's resources. (14) Why does ANSTO not privatise its commercial activities to allow the formation of spin-off all construction companies. (15) Has ANSTO ever investigated the potential for the creation of spin-off companies; if so, what this type were the results; if not, why not. (16) Will ANSTO work towards the formation of spin-off companies; if so, within what timetable; in the production of if not, why not. (17) Will ANSTO create an independent company from the recently acquired Fox-Anamet Pty Ltd and Pluteus (230) Pty Ltd. (18) Against whom in the commercial market will ANSTO's new company, Enviromet Pty Ltd, be competing in respect of environmental services. (19) Does Enviromet Pty Ltd have any involvement with the HIFAR reactor; if so, what involvement. (20) Has ANSTO considered the value of establishing private companies in its business and technology park rather than acquiring them. (21) Would ANSTO be able to retain a more stable research and development effort if it budded off viable business concerns. (22) Has ANSTO adequately assessed budding off viable business concerns; if not, is it prepared to examine the issue. (23) What were the Auditor-General's findings concerning ANSTO's borrowing restraints. (24) Has ANSTO's main current account gone into overdraft; if so, (a) on how many occasions, (b) why and (c) is this in breach of the ANSTO Act. (25) Was ANSTO's profit overstated by $2.3 million; if so, (a) why and (b) is ANSTO satisfied with the accounting procedures which arrived at the overstatement. (26) What is the value of ANSTO's intellectual property royalties and licensing agreements. (27) What sum has ANSTO spent on the Synroc process. (28) What part of the sum referred to in part comprised direct Government grants. Dependent --------------------------------------------Waste Conditioning Materials Science and Technology Radiation Detectors and Standards Nuclear Instrumentation Reactor Applications Neutron Scattering Isotope Technology Radiation Technology Environmental Physics Advanced Analytical Methods Ore Processing and Waste Management Quality Technology Safety and Reliability Environmental Chemistry Nuclear Applications Radiation Biology Radiopharmacology Monoclonal Antibodies Radiochemistry Product Development Neutronics Thermal Engineering (2) The closure of HIFAR would have a major adverse effect on the 22 projects identified in (1) above as depending on access to a reactor. Closure would have similar serious effects on research carried out by Australian universities and industry using HIFAR. (29) What additional sum does ANSTO intend to spend on the Synroc process before it becomes a commercially viable technology. (30) Has a cost-benefit analysis been conducted on licensing the development of the Synroc process abroad for user groups. (31) When will a commercially viable and marketable Synroc process be available. (32) Why has there been such a long development time for the Synroc process. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As ANSTO shows in its 1990-91 'Program of Research' publication, ANSTO's programs are conducted within the scope of 35 projects. Of these, 13 do not depend in any wayan the presence of or (27) access to the MOATA or HIFAR reactors, as shown in the following table: Not dependent Advanced Ceramics Plasma and Surface Technologies Underlying Research Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Accelerator Applications Neutron Sources Laser Enrichment and Development Instrumentation and Control Biological Impacts Geosphere Applications Alligator Rivers Analogue Project Modelling and Dosimetry Maralinga Studies (3) Yes. The estimate was only notional and not based on any specific replacement device for HIFAR. (4) One of the justifications for HIFAR is the production, of technetium 99m for medical purposes on a cost-effective and reliable basis. (5) No. Molybdenum 99 is a precursor for technetium 99m-that is, technetium 99m is created through the radioactive decay of molybdenum 99. Molybdenum 99 itself is not suitable, and is not used, as a radioactive tracer for medical applications. (6) Molybdenum 99 is imported at considerable extra cost on occasions when HIFAR is shut down for extended maintenance. The excess cost of importing finished radioisotope products to replace those produced in HIFAR would be in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million each year and up to 90 per cent of this would be for products incorporating molybdenum/technetium isotopes. Importation of medical radioisotopes would lead to uncertainties in supply and erratic delivery of patient care throughout Australia. (7) The absence of a reactor at ANSTO is not seen to be a situation that could occur on a short unanticipated timescale. A contingency plan for the absence of a reactor at ANSTO is therefore unnecessary. (8) The ANSTO Act requires that 'In undertaking its functions the Organisation shall have regard to the national science and energy policy objectives of the Commonwealth Government.' It is inevitable therefore that the objectives of a number of ANSTO programs will have a close relationship with programs of other public research bodies subject to the same Government policy objectives. Examples are ANSTO programs in advanced materials, environmental science and biomedicine and health where the objectives are to contribute towards Australia's industrial innovation, and envirtechnologies onmental and health management. A high level of cooperation ensures that these ANSTO programs complement those of other research bodies as indicated in (9) below. (9) The unique multidisciplinary skills and facilities of ANSTO have always been made available to the wider Australian research community through a well developed network of communication and cooperation. For instance AINSE, the Australian Institute for Nuclear Science and Engineering, was established by ANSTO (then the AAEC) in 1958 specifically for the purpose of coordinating and facilitating access to ANSTO's expertise and national facilities for scientists from Australian universities and similar organisations. Membership of AINSE now stands at 21 universities plus CSIRO in addition to ANSTO itself. ANSTO liaises closely with other government and university research bodies as well as industry. Such liaison is facilitated through regular meetings of a series of Program Advisory Committees established in each ANSTO research program area which contain representatives from industry, universities, medical bodies, and relevant State and Commonwealth Government bodies. ANSTO also has bilateral arrangements with several universities and teaching hospitals, eg the National Medical Cyclotron (NMC) located at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, which is currently being commissioned, and the Australian Centre for Advanced Risk and Reliability Engineering (ACARRE) with the University of Sydney. Additional networks are under discussion in the context of the Government's new Cooperative Research Centre proposals which will further enhance this communication and cooperation. ANSTO is already party to one of these CRCs, the Centre for Waste Management and Pollution Control, in cooperation with the Universities of NSW and Western Sydney, the CSIRO Division of Water Resources, BHP Co Ltd, ICI Australia Ltd, Australian Defence Industries, Brambles Australia/Cleanaway, IBM Australia Ltd, Sydney Water Board, NSW Public Works Department, NSW Department of Water Resources and the NSW Waste Management Authority. (10) ANSTO's commercial activities are driven by objectives and strategies contained in ANSTO's Strategic Plan, including the objective of ensuring that ANSTO's applied research, commercial and training activities in nuclear science and associated contribute to Australia's industrial innovation, and environmental and health management. ANSTO's commercial operations also have the objective to earn external revenue of 30 per cent of appropriation by 1993, which the Organisation is already close to achieving. Commercial activities consist of: the provision of expert advice and services on a fee for service basis the performance of joint R&D with industry the operation of joint venture arrangements such as: Tracerco Australasia, a partnership arrangement with ICI Australia to market tracing services ACARRE, a company established in conjunction with the University of Sydney to promote risk and reliability techniques Australian Supercomputing Technology, a partnership arrangement with Fujitsu Australia to operate a supercomputing bureau the ownership of a public companyEnviromet Limited, an environmental laboratory Australian Radioisotopes, an ANSTO unit which produces and distributes radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes. (11) (a) ANSTO commercial operations are maintained administratively and financially separate from the Organisation. Payment is made for all services provided by ANSTO. Depending on the nature of the service this could be assessed at a marginal, cost recovery or profit rate. Other than Australian Radioisotopes (ARI), ANSTO commercial operations are only in the early stages of establishment and, as is normal for new ventures, ANSTO expects there may be a need for limited operating subsidies in these early stages in accordance with agreed business plans. ARI is expected to operate on a self-sufficient basis in the 1992/93 FY. (b) All ANSTO interaction is based on an existing and developing research infrastructure. ANSTO's charges for expert advice and services are calculated in accordance with the relevant industry norm. (12) Information on competition is addressed in the business plans for the various operations which are commercial-in-confidence to the respective operations. (13) No. All ANSTO commercial activities are open to competition. (14) While ANSTO has purchased one public company to undertake routine laboratory work in the environmental area, any future similar decision would need to take into account the important interaction between ANSTO's commercial operations and research activities. (15) Yes. ANSTO undertakes its activities in accordance with its legislative charter and in line with the objectives contained in its Strategic Plan. Neither rule out the creation of spin-off companies and ANSTO evaluates such opportunities on an ongoing basis. (16) See (15) above. (17) Yes. The companies Fox-Anamet Pty Ltd and Pluteus (230) Pty Ltd purchased by ANSTO with an effective date of 13 March 1991 now operate as Enviromet Ltd. (18) See (12) above. (19) No. (20) In principle, ANSTO does not propose to acquire companies which will be located in its Business and Technology Park. It is planned that the Park will house technically oriented entities or individuals whose activities complement ANSTO core activities and who can exploit the unique expertise and resources available within the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories. (21) ANSTO is striving to achieve commercialisation of its research and other activities without destabilising its core activities which are established in terms of Australia's national needs in applying the benefits of nucle.ar science and technology. As potentially viable business opportunities are identified these are carefully examined by the Organisation to determine how best to pursue commercial exploitation while at the same time maintaining broadly based nuclear expertise as required to provide advice to Government. (22) Yes. ANSTO has several commercial joint venture or other arrangements with private sector partners as evidence of its attitude towards commercialising its research activities, as indicated in (10) above. (23) In Audit Report No. 20, 1990-91, the Auditor-General reported: 'It was noted that on 20 June 1990 ANSTO's operating bank account was overdrawn by $42,219 without the approval of the Treasurer as required under Section 33(1) of the Act.' (24) Yes. (a) On five occasions over the 1989-90 and 1990-91 financial years. (b) During the 1989-90 financial year the main current account was overdrawn on one occasion (20 June 1990). This was due to the late transfer of an appropriation drawdown due on 4 June 1990. The delayed lodgement was caused by a breakdown of the DITAC computer system which processes appropriation drawdown. ANSTO was unaware of the delayed lodgement until after the event. During the 1990-91 financial year the current account was overdrawn on four occasions. The first occasion in December 1990 was due to a delay in lodgement \of appropriation funds (requested for 3/12/90 but received 12/12/90). The other occasions in February (twice) and March 1991 were caused by ANSTO's banker processing the fortnightly salary electronic transfer one day ahead of the instructed lodgement date. Action has been taken to avoid repetition. (c) Technically the above occurrences are borrowings. As such, they represent a breach of Section 33 of the ANSTO Act. However, as explained in (b) above, at no time did ANSTO act with intent to overdraw the account. (25) ANSTO is a budget dependent statutory authority and hence is not required to keep accounts in accordance with commercial practice. It does not produce a profit and loss statement. In accordance with Guidelines for the Form and Standard of Financial Statement of Commonwealth Undertakings issued by the Department of Finance, ANSTO produces for each financial year an equivalent document titled Statement of Activity. For financial year ended 30 June 1990, of Activity disclosed a surplus before provisions and other unfunded charges of provisions and other unfunded charges $309,834. -.- . -.. This Activity Statement has been audited by the Â· Na t'IOnaI Au d't AustraI Ian 1 Off'Ice. (26) Approximately $45,000 annually. (27) Approximately $26 million. (28) The funding in (27) is made up of ANSTO salaries and direct overheads $13.5 million, grants authorised by Cabinet $10.8 million and NERDDC grants $1.7 million. (29) The ANSTO Board has approved a 5-year plan for further Synroc development over the period 1991-96 involving the expenditure of $2.5 million annually. (30) ANSTO and the Australian National University are investigating the potential commercial opportunities for Synroc in the nuclear waste management field in conjunction with four major Australian companies, BHP, CRA Ltd, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd and Western Mining Corporation Ltd. (31) Commercialisation of Synroc depends upon many technical, design, engineering, marketing and social factors. As indicated in (30) above, these factors are in the process of being addressed. Nevertheless, because of the uncertainties involved, it is not possible to nominate a specific date. (32) Management of nuclear waste which exhibits high levels of radioactivity is a long lead-time process. For instance, the development of borosilicate glass commenced in the 1950s. The first small commercial glass plant (AVM, Marcoule) commenced operation in 1978 and the first large plant at La Hague followed in 1989. Even so, development and improvement of glass as a waste form is still proceeding. Thus the time taken so far for Syruoc development (1979-1991), with comparatively low expenditures, is far from excessive. Technology Development Discretionary Fund (Question No. 774) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister' for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) On what specific projects has the Technology the Development Discretionary Fund expended its rethe Statement sources during 1990-91. (2) What are the criteria for obtaining support $4,478,991 and after from the fund. '"" ,(3) - ow do the cntena dIffer from those for the plscretlOnary . Grants Scheme. . (4) Over what peEod do grants.-ply. (5) Are funds dispensed on a matching basis. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Technology Development Program (TDP) is part of the Commonwealth Government's program to support industry research and development. The TDP has two components: the National Teaching Company Scheme (NTCS) provides financial support towards the cost of employing a graduate jointly supervised by a supporting public sector research institution and a company undertaking a company based project; and the Discretionary Fund which provides the flexibility to respond to new and emerging technological developments of importance to industry in a dynamic technological climate. During 1990-91, there were 6 projects approved for funding from the Discretionary Fund. In 1990-91, some funding from the Discretionary Fund was made available to the NTCS because of the number of high quality proposals received. (1) (a) National Teaching Company Scheme (NTCS) The NTCS is part of the Commonwealth/State Government's program to facilitate the growth and international competitiveness of Australian industry. The scheme encourages links between companies and public sector research institutions by providing financial support over two years towards the cost of employing and supervising high-calibre graduates on projects designed to improve company performance. The objective of the NTCS is to enhance the international competitiveness of Australian industry by fostering the development of new and longer term working relationships between public sector research institutions and companies in the manufacturing and service sector by: improving company performance through: the adoption of appropriate technology or methodology in manufacturing, marketing, management accounting, design, strategic planning etc; and the development of new products or services. providing graduates with experience in industry; and providing institution staff with the opportunity to collaborate with industry. In order to obtain a grant, a company and a supporting research institution make an agreement to undertake a particular company-based project under the NTCS and specify the qualifications a graduate would need to perform the day-today work on the project. A joint application for support for the project is submitted. Applications are considered by an independent committee of business leaders, academics and officers of the Department of Indnstry, Technology and Commerce. The Commonwealth Government is the primary source of funding for the NTCS, with additional funding being made available by State Government industry departments. (b) Service Industries Research Project (SIRP) The Service Industries Research Project was established to promote the study of service industries in Australia and to identify public policy issues for consideration by the Government. In June 1990, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce announced that $250,000 would be made available this financial year for research into the services sector and issues affecting the sector, providing there was matching funding with the private sector. The Minister made it clear that while the research would be supported by the Government, it should be private sector led and reflect commercial priorities. The private sector contributed about $170,000 to the Program against $250,000 contributed by the Commonwealth. In order to determine recipients of funding under the SIRp, the Department, in February 1991, placed an adveltisement in the national press inviting researchers and consultants with a track record in service sector issues to submit research proposals. Approximately 70 proposals were received. The proposals were considered at a meeting of the Service Industries Research Program Advisory Committee (SIRPAC). SIRPAC is comprised of 4 private sector representatives and 1 Commonwealth representative. The projects selected and funded under the SIRP are: 'Policies affecting service sector performance: assessing reform priorities'. Centre for International Economics; 'Public policy issues and opportunities for Australian service industries in Digital Video Technologies'. Queensland University of Technology; 'Quality based competitiveness of service sector organisations'. GSM-Melbourne University; 'Legal Services: an applied case study'. Peter Jenkins International; 'Attitudes of business leaders to services marketing in the international context'. AGB MCNair; 'The opportunities for Australian service industries in Southeast Asia'. Macquarie University (Langdale); and 'The development of services associated with Australia's mining and rural industries'. Applied Engineering Management. It is proposed that the SIR Program will continue until the end of 1991-92 at which time it is proposed to hold a Service Industries conference where papers relating to each study under the Program will be presented. (c) Support for the Discipline Review of Computing Studies and Information Sciences Education The Federal Government has initiated a major review of computing and information science education in higher education institutions in Australia. The Review will consider the effectiveness of current arrangements in meeting the present and likely future needs of the economy and the labour market for people with qualifications in these areas, and will make recommendations on future directions for computing and information science education in Australia, including required developments in the higher education system. The Review is being carried out under the direction of an expert panel chaired by the former South Australian Minister for Education, Mr Hugh Hudson. The Review commenced officially on 18 February 1991 and is expected to be completed in nine months. It was announced in a joint Ministerial Press Release dated 13 March 1991. To facilitate the undertaking of the Review, it was agreed that DITAC would provide $250,000 towards the cost. In addition to this, the Department of Employment, Education & Training (DEET) will contribute $137,000 and the Information Industries Education & Training Foundation (lIETF) will contribute $100,000. (d) Science and Technology Policy Development Project The Department funded a project relating to the development of Australian science and technology (S&T) policy undertaken by the Centre for Technology and Social Change (TASC). The project had the following three elements. The first involved examining a framework for bilateral science and technology relations with Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. In this component TASC assessed recent trends in S&T linkages by: reviewing the organisation and direction of industrial research; assessing the linkages developed by other countries to their target countries; and developing a framework for promoting strategic Australian links including opportunities for collaboration and a methodology for assessing priorities. The second component consisted of case studies of Thailand and the Republic of Korea. In this, TASC reviewed all current multilateral and bilateral S&T links for the purpose of assessing trends in international S&T and possible strategies which Australia might consider. The case studies included: a review of the likely direction and causes of growth and change in regional S&T; the assessment of the significance of this for national S&T policy (including the role of science parks and similar mechanisms); and the examination of the issues for Australian participation in, and initiation of, regional (including multilateral) S&T activities. The third component was a study to identify the benefits of having leading-edge customers in the Australian context and the role they play in modernising and developing suppliers and competitive clusters, and why leading edge customer/supplier relationships are not better developed in Australia and how governments can assist. The study itself consisted of four separate parts. Part A explored the theory and previous literature and developed methods for the following Parts. Part B was case studies of specific leading-edge customers and their suppliers. Part C developed strategies for becoming a leading-edge customer or a supplier to a leading-edge customer and Part D examined the wider aspects of developing competitive industry clusters in Australia. (e) Million Dollar Idea The Department in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), the NSW Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training is participating in the production of a television series entitled 'The Million Dollar Idea'. The Program was conceptually developed by Mr James Mitchell of Aurora Pacific International Ltd. Mr Mitchell has a successful track record as producer of 'Beyond 2000' and 'Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls' for the ABC. The primary objective of the Program from the Department's perspective is to promote an awareness, within firms and the community, of the need to commercialise Australia's inventiveness, what is required to take an idea through to commercialisation and of the central relationship of S&T to innovation in industry competitiveness. It will also raise awareness of the Commonwealth programs available to assist in this process, by exposing examples of companies that have been successfully helped by DITAC. (t) International Cost of Capital Project This project addressed the question of whether Australia has a higher cost of capital than other major trading partners. The study looked at the cost of capital for the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Germany, Japan and Australia and addressed issues such as: do Australian companies have a higher cost of capital than their major international competitors; if the cost of capital is higher in Australia, what are the underlying causes; does the internationalisation of capital markets--fespond suggest that the domestic cost of capital will become a less important competitive factor as Australian companies increasingly lower-cost capital on the global markets; if there is a higher cost of capital in Australia and it is inhibiting investment, what will be longer term consequences to the Australian nomy of this competitive disadvantage; and if there is a higher cost of capital having a damaging effect on the Australian economy, what policy measures could be undertaken to reduce this higher cost and improve the investintending ment climate. The report will be discussed at a seminar organised by the Australian Manufacturing Councils' Secretariat in October 1991. (g) Sustainable Development Research ProjeCt The Commission for the Future (CFF) was provided with funding to undertake a multi-faceted research project examining the issues relating to sustainable development including: the domestic and export market potential for Australian designed and manufactured energy efficient and renewable energy technologies; the identification of leading-edge technological revolutions taking place abroad in energy efficiency; renewable energy technology; and how Australian scientists and technologists are placed in relation to their international counterparts; the identification and assessment of institutional rigidities and structural obstacles that impede the export market potential for Australian designed and manufactured energy efficient and renewable energy technologies; and to undertake a study of an efficient and renewable energy economy for Australia by preparing a baseline map of current Australian energy use and its environmental correlates and implications, assessing the potential of a wide range of new and improved technologies, formulating a small number of implementation scenarios embodying different rates of change towards a high efficiency renewable energy economy and examining the economic implications, relative environmental costs, and policy settings associated with each scenario. (2) The Technology Development Program (TDP) provides the Department with the means to to new and emerging technological developments of importance to business and industry in a climate in which the rate of technological change gain access to is often rapid. (3) TDP differs from the Grants Scheme within GIRD in that the latter is limited to supporting the industrial research and development on the basis of ecoproposals submitted by industry. In contrast, the TDP has enabled the Department to fund consultant and it is studies of selected technologies. Under the GIRD Discretionary Grants Scheme assistance is directed to companies carrying on or to carry on the following activities in Australia: manufacture of goods; mining operations or operations for the recovery of naturally occurring petroleum or natural gas; construction operations related to buildings or works; production of software for computers or similar equipment; other activity eligible for grant assistance (subject to Ministerial declaration); and development of systems and processes in relation to the above categories of activity. Decisions on discretionary grants are made by a committee of the IR&D Board. Proposals for expenditure under the TDP are made by the Department on a case by case basis. (4) Discretionary Component grants are made for the current financial year. The funds can be rolled-over to a future financial year under Department of F4tance guidelines. (5) The Department has encouraged the participation of the private sector and State Governments in a number of Discretionary Component projects. Where such participation has occurred, it has been mentioned in the Department's response to question (1). However, matching funds are not required in all cases. Ambassadors: Employment Conditions (Question No. 813) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 14 May 1991: (1) By what criteria does the Minister's Department determine whether (a) a serving ambassador for Australia should be relieved of duties and (b) an ambassador for Australia who stands aside from his or her duties should be paid for a period following his or her resignation during which he or she is no longer serving as ambassador. (2) Are there precedents for either of the situations referred to in part (1); if so, what are they. Dr BleweU-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There are no clear-cut standards by which the Department judges whether serving ambassadors should be relieved of their duties. Serving ambassadors could be relieved of their duties if they failed to perform their duties with professionalism, integrity or efficiency required of their position. An ambassador could also be relieved of his or her duties where circumstances were such that the ambassador was not able to meet the operational requirements of the Department at the post. This might occur where the ambassador was ill or was required to be absent from the post for a protracted period. In any of the above cases, it would be the circumstances of the particular case, and not any set criteria which would determine whether the removal of the ambassador was the appropriate course. Similarly, there are no formal criteria covering the 'standing aside' of ambassadors. Nor is my Department aware of any case where an ambassador has been 'stood aside'. The question of payment of an ambassador who resigned would depend on the particular circumstances, including: (i) in the case of a non-career diplomat, the Terms and Conditions under which the ambassador had been appointed; and (ii) in the case of a career Departmental officer, the relevant provisions of the Public Service Act and Regulations and whether the individual resumed duty as an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. (2) I am advised by my Department that the only precedent of which it is aware for either of the situations referred to in part (1) occurred recently when the appointment of an ambassador whose conduct was the subject of a formal inquiry under the Public Service Act was terminated when it became apparent that his protracted absence from the embassy during the course of the investigation and inquiry would hinder the effective operation of the embassy. The decision to terminate the appointment in this case was not in any way intended to prejudge the outcome of the inquiry but was based solely on the Government's responsibility to ensure that its overseas missions can perform their tasks effectively. CSIRO, AIMS and ANSTO: Research Charges (Question No. 839) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 28 May 1991: (1) What are the current practices of the (a) Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, (b) Australian Institute of Marine the Sciences, and (c) Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in respect of the setting charges for contracted research. (2) In what circumstances do the organisations referred to in part (1) include the full cost of overheads and other additional costs as opposed to marginal research costs when making arrangements for contracted research. (3) Are any overhead costs frequently excluded from arrangements for contracted research; if so, which costs. (4) For each of the organisations referred to in part (1), by what factor or percentage would existing charges increase if additional costs and overheads were included in arrangements for contracted research. (5) Can he say whether any Government department has undertaken a review of the setting of charges for contracted research; if so, (a) what were the summary findings and (b) is a copy of the report of the review publicly available. (6) What would be the implications for externally funded or contracted research activity if the full cost of overheads was included in meeting the charges for the research. (7) What are the capital requirements until 1996 for replacement and refurbishment of buildings and purchasing new equipment for each of the organisations referred to in part (1). (8) If the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has developed or is developing strategies to meet the requirements referred to in part (7), what are those strategies. (9) Has the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce received representations or submissions from the organisations referred to in part (l) concerning capital or infrastructure requirements since 1988; if so, in each case (a) what was the title of the representation or submission, (b) when was it made and (c) what was the Deprutment's response. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The general practice of each of the three research agencies is to perform contract research on a commercial basis. (2) In operating on a commercial basis the research agencies generally include the full costs of overheads, a profit margin and other additional costs when making arrangements for contracted research. When the contracted research clearly falls within the existing research strategy of the agency and there will be benefit to the agency's own programs in performing the contracted research, a decision may be made within the agency to forgo the profit margin and/or cover some of the overheads itself. In addition to performing contracted research, the research agencies may enter into collaborative research and development agreements directed towards generating defined products or processes, where both the contributions to the research and the benefits from it are shared on an agreed basis between the agency and a sponsor. Arrangements which generate industrial property owned in whole or in part by the agency can result in an on-going income stream. (3) No overhead costs are frequently excluded from arrangements for contracted research. See answer to (2). (4) In the majority of cases there would be no increase in existing charges. See answer to (2). (5) The Department of Finance has produced a booklet entitled 'Guidelines for Costing of Government Activities' which assists managers in Commonwealth departments and agencies in the costing of the delivery of public service programs and activities. It reviews charges for contract research. The latest edition of the booklet became available in July 1991 and is available from the Department of Finance. A working party of the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology (CCST) is currently investigating research pricing and funding in the public sector. The working group was established in February 1991 and is expected to report back to the CCST later this year. (6) External funding includes funding obtained from Commonwealth Government competitive granting bodies as well as research contracted from the private sector. Commonwealth competitive granting bodies usually provide only marginal funding to the research institutions. The granting bodies provide an opportunity for the research agencies to acquire additional research funding in areas relevant to the research agencies' mission and areas of expertise. Clearly, any increase in research costs would imply that existing Commonwealth granting programs would be able to support fewer projects. In relation to research contracted from the private sector, see answers to (2) and (4). (7) The three research agencies review their replacement, refurbishment, repairs and maintenance (RRRM) strategies as part of their ongoing planning process. The Government has announced its continued commitment to triennial funding for the research agencies. This facilitates and provides a better decision making environment for their financial planning, including that related to capital requirements. In the 1991-92 Budget additional funding was provided to the three agencies for a planned capital asset management program encompassing capital replacement, refurbishment, repairs and maintenance additional to what otherwise would have been possible. For 1991-92, CSIRO was provided with $10.7 million for these purposes with ANSTO and AIMS each receiving $640,000. (8) The development of strategies to meet the capital requirements of the research agencies is a responsibility of the agencies themselves and is under constant review as part of their long-tenn planning processes. (9) No. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has not received representations or submissions form the research agencies. The research agencies make representations on these matters directly to the Government. Australian Securities Commission (Question No. 970) Mr Filing asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 August 1991: (1) Does the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) impose a $6 surcharge for mailing out corporate search documents; if so, why. (2) Does the ASC charge a postage levy for the results of each search sent simultaneously to the same address; if so, why. (3) Do the imposts referred to in parts (1) and (2) represent economic impediments to the competitiveness of businesses.",103
195,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Item 61 of the Corporations (Fees) Regulations imposes a fee of $12 for the supply of a document issued by the Australian Securities Commission where the document is not requested in person. Where a request is made in person a fee of $6 is payable. The difference between the two fees is intended to cover the additional administrative costs incurred by the ASC in responding to requests for searches which have been lodged by mail. (2) The $12 fee is not a postage levy. It is a fee which is payable for the supply of a document issued by the Commission. Where a number of documents is requested the fee is payable for each particular document requested. The fee applies to each search irrespective of return address. (3) It is not considered that the fees represent economic impediment to the competitiveness of businesses. The level of the fee needs to be compared with alternative means of obtaining corporate search information. The alternatives are to undertake the search in person, to engage a professional searcher to undertake the search, or to obtain the results of the search or the information from an authorised information broker. This type of differential fee for the supply of information not requested in person applied under the former co-operative companies and securities scheme. Air Traffic Rights Agreements (Question No. 1036) Mr JuU asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 4 September 1991: Is the Minister able to say what air traffic rights were agreed with the USA between 1945 and 1960; if so, in respect of each agreement, (a) between which countries was the agreement concluded, (b) what ports were involved, (c) were individual carriers nominated to operate the routes specified in the agreement; if so, which carriers and (d) what arrangements were made within each agreement to substitute carriers for those which were specified.",116
196,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Air services agreements concluded between the United States and countries other than Australia do not come within the jurisdiction of my Department and I am therefore unable to provide the information requested by the honourable member. President Soeharto: Visit to Australia (Question No. 1043) Mr Barry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 4 September 1991: Further to the answer to question No. 878 (Hansard, 22 August 1991, page 464) providing details of visits of foreign heads of state and government to Australia, did the list omit the visit of President Soeharto of Indonesia in April 1975; if so, will the list be amended.",116
197,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The answer to Question 878 was confined to an official visits to avoid the need to list the many purely private/transit visits which did not seem relevant to the theme of the question. The visit of President Soeharto was omitted from the list because it was recorded as non-official. However, President Soeharto was a Guest of Government during his stay in Townsville and therefore in the context of the question could have been included in the list. Mr Deafallah Elfah (Question No. 1053)  upon notice, on 5 September 1991: (1) Was a Mr Deafallah Elfah due to appear before a Sydney committal hearing on 30 September 1991 on charges alleging conspiracy, receiving stolen property and attempting to bribe police. (2) Did the same Mr Elfah leave Australia on 7 June 1991 and travel to Jordan. (3) Despite there being ween Australia and Jordan, has he instituted executive action requiring Mr Elfah's return; if not, (a) has he refused to do so and (b) why.",116
198,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The information sought by the honourable member in parts (1) and (2) comes within the responsibility of the Attorney-General of NSW. I therefore approached him to obtain the relevant information. He has provided the foHowing answers: '(1) Yes-there are several co-defendants and a number of charges, including those mentioned. Elfah was on bail granted by the Supreme Court on 13 February. (2) Yes-when the matter came before the Court for mention on 12 July 1991 the Court was informed that Elfah had left Australia for Jordan on 7 June 1991.' (3) (a) Yes. (b) As the question notes, there is no extradition treaty between Australia and Jordan. It is possible for a request to be made for the return of a person in the absence of a treaty, although whether this would be granted is a matter for the law and practice of the country concerned and its decision in a particular case. A request without a treaty basis normally requires a reciprocity undertaking; that is, that the requesting State would extradite to the requested State in like circumstances. Where there is no negotiated arrangement, and the special arrangements between Commonwealth countries do not apply, extradition is considered on a country by country basis. Where a request by Australia is granted by a country on the assumption of reciprocity, a serious risk of misunderstanding arises. This is because of the need for Australia, if subsequently asked to extradite, to apply the Extradition Act (which requires the making of Regulations) and the consequent application of statutory bars to extradition from Australia. In view of possible differences in legal systems and the desirability of exchanging information on conditions and limitations on extradition, my decision was that it was preferable to seek to establish a treaty basis for extradition with Jordan rather than proceed with an ad hoc request. Australia has informed the Jordanian Government that Australia would be happy to enter into negotiations on an extradition treaty with no extradition treaty bet- Jordan. Commonwealth Employment Service: Criteria for Placement (Question No. 1062)",117
199,Mr RUDDOCK,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 10 September 1991: (1) Is there discrimination in favour of migrants and other disadvantaged groups in the allocation of job training and employment courses by the Commonwealth Employment Service or the Department of Employment, Education and Training. (2) Does the Department allocate places in job training and employment courses on the basis of first in, first served; if not, what criteria are used. (3) Are regional offices of the Department briefed on procedures for the assessment of those applying for employment and training courses. (4) How is the performance of regional offices in course allocation monitored. (5) Can he say what is the breakdown by country of birth of persons attending the courses referred to in part (1). (6) Are there waiting lists for courses; if so, (a) how large are they, (b) how long would they take to clear and (c) can he say what is the breakdown by country of birth of the persons on them. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Migrants are not given special treatment under the Commonwealth Employment Service's programs. However, disadvantaged groups do receive priority access to these programs. The majority of the job training and employment courses provided through the Commonwealth Employment Service are components of the Employment Access Program. This program aims to assist job seekers who are disadvantaged in the labour market to gain access to and secure long-term employment through the provision of measures to suit their circumstances. To be eligible for the major elements of the program, job seekers must be unemployed for at least six months or be especially disadvantaged. Job seekers who are given priority for assistance under the Employment Access Program are those who are: unemployed 12 months or more; or deemed to be especially disadvantaged: Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders; Job seekers with disabilities; Job seekers aged 50 or older; Homeless people; Ex-offenders; Spouses of Newstart Allowance recipients; Youth at risk; and Sole parents under the Jobs, Education and Training (JET) Program for Sole Parents. Migrant professionals may be eligible to participate in a course established under the JOBTRAIN bridging training element to assist them obtain recognition of their qualifications in Australia. (2) No. The management of the program requires that Departmental officers assess the relative needs of job seekers and establish local priorities consistent with the needs of the local labour market. Those unemployed for twelve months or more, and those considered especially disadvantaged in the labour market, are given priority for program assistance. (3) Yes. Each Area, Regional and CES office is provided with a copy of the Employment Access Program Guidelines, contained in the CBS Manual. A document entitled 'The Employment Adviser's Guide' released June 1991, is provided to CES staff, providing a 'user friendly' approach ing individual client needs. Area offices provide CES staff with training on assessment of client job readiness. CES staff are also trained in identifying clients meeting Departmental definitions of 'disadvantaged' or 'at risk', as well as being provided with the skills required to choose appropriate training or other options from the Department's menu of assistance, for these job seekers. (4) Each Area is allocated program resources according to the identified needs of its local labour market. Area Managers are responsible for the monitoring of program performance within regions, including participation levels of priority client groups on courses. To assist in program performance monitoring, statistical data on program approvals according to various client and associated criteria are collected, on an Area and national level. These data are examined against Area operational plans and program objectives. (5) No, this data is not currently obtainable. (6) No. Meeting the eligibility criteria for assistance under the Employment Access Program does not automatically create an entitlement to assistance for the individual. Resources available under the Employment Access Program are limited, and therefore not all those eligible will be assisted. Priority goes to those most disadvantaged in the labour market including those unemployed for twelve months or more. To recruit for a course, CES staff interview a number of eligible clients and from these select the most disadvantaged for placement on the course. Those eligible clients who are not selected could be placed on courses if clients initially selected drop-out. AQIS Meat Inspectors (Question No. 1073) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 12 September 1991: (1) Has there ever been a formal or informal authorisation of payments beyond the official rate of remuneration for Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) meat inspectors. (2) Were two AQIS meat inspectors replaced at Tennant Creek, NT, about July 1991; if so, why. (3) How many AQIS meat inspectors are located in towns or cities where abattoirs no longer operate and at which centres are they located.",117
200,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourto assessable member's question is as follows: (1) No. AQIS inspection staff are paid in accordance with their award conditions. In addition to the basic salary determined under this Award, they are paid, where appropriate, allowances for expenses incurred in the execution of their duties. The amounts paid are in accordance with determinations prescribed by the Department of Industrial Relations. (2) Yes. One officer resigned from the service, effective from 31 July 1991. He was replaced for the period to 27 August 1991, after which time the abattoir closed. The other officer was on a Food Technology Training Course from 27 July to 2 August 1991. He was then in court on 6 August and was suspended from duty without pay from 7 August 1991. However he is being paid a hardship allowance under Section 63C(2)(a) of the Public Service Act.
