2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for reducing presentation as follows and copies will be secretanes referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth in Parliamore ment assembled.

Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament petition of the undersigned showeth: That because television and radio (a), affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) against self-regulation by the broadcasting and television industry, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Falconer. Petition received. Non-State Business Colleges To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned students, parents, teachers Australia respectfully showeth: That the report of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations on Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation, July 1977, p. 197, states that, in respect of Stenographers-Secretaries: With the exception of new business college graduates the demand for less experienced and less skilled people in Sydis in balance with the supply. Business College graduates are exactly what the market wants and employers demand. PETITIONS In one of the few fields of employment shown by the repon to be under-supplied, the Government is effectively the ability of business colleges to train enough and stenographers for the positions which are available. The sixteen technical colleges in the Metropolitan area of Estate Duty Sydney which accommodate 3,220 students in day secretarial studies do not have the capacity to accommodate than 6 per cent of the 2,435 students at non-State business coUeges in the same area who will be disadvantaged by the Government's recent decision to withdraw fees subsidies and living allowances from the end of 1977. of a deceased estate passes to 1977 School leavers who wish to undertake a course in Secretarial Studies and thus ensure they obtain a worthwhile position of employment on graduation are being forced to pay fees of the order of $ 1,400 for the year and also to forgo Jones, Mr TEAS living allowances. The Government's decision is unfair, unjust, discriminatory, unreasonable and capricious. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will act immediately to undertake a thorough review of the position of non-State business colleges, guarantee interim funding forthwith and reverse its assembled. The humble decision. citizens of Australia respectfully And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the freeze in expenditure on schools, universities and colleges of higher education will severely hinder the progress of education in Australia; more specifically in our state of New South Wales and the region of the Lower Blue Mountains. This step has caused the shelving of many building and maintenance programs in schools; inadequate equipping of schools; and a pool of unemployed teachers who could be used to reduce class sizes in our schools. Your petitioners call on the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to restore education funding to the level advocated in the 1975 Schools Commission report And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Klugman. Petition received. Commonwealth Grants to New South Wales To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth of and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That the grants and payments made by the Commonwealth to the State of New South Wales have consistently been less per capita than the Australian average. 2. That although the High Court has determined that ownership of off-shore oil rests with the Commonwealth and not with the States, the Commonwealth has made arrangements which deprive New South Wales of its fair share of the benefits from such oil. 3. That New South Wales has thus suffered adverse discrimination at Commonwealth hands. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House wdl cause these matters to be investigated and ventilated without delay, so that due restitution can be made the people of New South Wales.

5,Mr DOBIE,REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"I ask a question of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I preface it by referring him to the representations I have made on behalf of ASSISTANCE my constituents in Cook, and in particular the Notice of Motion Miranda sub-branch of the Returned Services League, who have expressed concern and some about recent variations to repatriation benefits. I ask the Minister whether he can give inform the House what the real position is a Bill regarding the Government's record concerning repatriation benefits since coming to office two",15
6,Mr GARLAND,REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on the matters raised by the Notice of Motion honourable member, because I have received a few letters along the same lines. Clearly, some are not fully aware of the whole position. Although there has been some rationalisation in recogthree or four areas in the last two years, I emphafamsise that it has been handled with humanity and it for its restraint. The Government's whole two-year single fathers full social serrecord has to be recognised. It is a good record. for Total expenditure on repatriation benefits has of this risen from approximately $690m in 1974-75 to support for the $ 1,100m in the current year. Further, as promised, the Government has integral committed itself to a continuing and separate government department for repatriation matters, expanding it to include the defence service homes scheme and war graves functions. Whether there would remain a separate department was of considerable concern to many people. The Government has committed itself to keeping the repatriation hospital system separate. Much concern has been expressed years about the need for that. There has been a Salaries considerable work program. In the current year General expenses $23m has been made available for hospital development in the States and $28m will be available for smaller works, repairs and Other Benefits maintenance. The biggest benefit of all is that for the time disability pensions and service pensions have been automatically indexed to increases inTotal the consumer price index, with the result thatCapital rise in pension payments has been from $477m in 1974-75 to $766m in the current year. In other words, because of this automatic indexing ofSpecialised equipment these two categories of pension, over the periodFurniture and fittings there will be a 60 per cent increase-an increase Total of no less than $289m. There is a need to keep an eye on the big things, because much has been done. I will write to the honourable member setting out details of further benefits and will Repairs and Maintenance confirm policies adopted by the Government Total during that period.

There is no other field of government activity in which the Government and the interested national bodies enjoy closer consultation than thefield'of repatriation. NA 1976-77 1977-78 Mr HAYDEN- I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I preface it by reminding him that $m $m about this time last week I asked a question of the Treasurer about the successful suppression of 248.918 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publication 'Review of Australia' 147.548 165.248 due in December this year. Is it a fact that that review has been completed? Is it a fact that the 347.855 review shows the gross domestic product deflator for 1977 at 11 per cent, it being higher than the 9 .853 1.045 per cent that the Prime Minister has been quoting recently for an earlier 12-month period? Is it 763.066 a fact that the review shows the GDP deflator for 1978 at 10V* per cent, only a marginal 112.099 improvement over 1977? Does the review also show growth in the economy in 1978 at 2Vi per cent? If so, is the implication of growth of that order, allowing for productivity of about 2 per cent and a labour force growth of about 2 per cent, an increase in unemployment of about VA per cent? Is it because of the consequences which would flow from the publication of such unpleasant information that the Government sought the suppression of and was successful in having suppressed the publication of this review from its normal period in December and having it held over until the middle of next year?",16
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OECD FORECAST FOR AUSTRALIA,"I will see what information additional to that which the Treasurer provided last week is available and whether it can be provided to the honourable gentleman. The potential Minister for Foreign Affairs, Defence, Economic Development or Control, or whatever happens to be in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition at the moment, is continuing on the path he has pursued quite consistently over the last 18 months. I am afraid one can only say that that is a path of instability and utter irresponsibility. It was not long ago that most of the major editorials in this country were attacking the honourable gentleman for trying to destroy the value of the Australian dollar. He was doing that quite deliberately and quite designedly. I think we can see a very great transformation from the sorts of comments of the honourable gentleman now and those he was pursuing at an earlier time. At an earlier time he said that on economic front inflation was this nation's most menacing enemy. He said that the Government aimed at curbing it. Of course it did not; it fuelled inflation. The fact that this Government has curbed it and demonstrated that very clearly over three quarters is something which I suppose the honourable gentleman very much regrets. He ought to applaud all the indicahad tors coming out in relation to the Australian economy and at the same time he should take $3,000m note of economic advisers to business who, in problems. The Australian their newsletters, are indicating that inflation being broken and that the Australian economy poised for a very real recovery in activity throughout 1978. The honourable gentleman will not succeed in whatever he might try to destroy the record of this Government in repairTreasury ing the damage he left behind. NA",17
10,Mr HODGMAN,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Has the Government any proposals to increase Government spending suddenly by an amount in excess of $2 billion as certain people have been suggesting? What effect would such a proposal have on the deficit, on inflation and on taxation rates applicable to Australians?",17
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"This Government has no such plans. I believe that overwhelmingly honourable gentlemen in this House will be very glad that this Government has no such plans. I think everyone in Australia would be looking with great dismay at the spending proposals that have been coming from the Leader of the Opposition and from other Opposition spokesman over last two or three months. Since August, Labor has announced the following proposed expenditure: On hospitals, sewerage, growth centres, area improvement programs, tourist development and leisure facilities, nearly $250m. There is a national compensation scheme costing over $500m and an old form of Medibank costing something approaching $700m in addition. On 11 August last a spending program which would cost $800m was announced. Some of those proposals were repeated in the spending proposals which were mentioned yesterday, but the total proposal had been substantially added to. The cost of water resources, funds for hostels and accommodation is over $200m. Also the shadow Minister for immigration and community relations, the honourable member for Melbourne, committed Labor to a dramatic increase in education spendthe ing. Now what is dramatic in Labor terms? One hundred million dollars could hardly be called Labor dramatic. Would it be $500m? We have a situation where the Leader of the Opposition is once again suggesting that he can solve problems by throwing money at them, by rurining to the printing presses as he did when he an opportunity once before. The total commitments of the Labor Party add up to over to solve at the present time. Again he is seeking problems by throwing money at those people know that that is cannot be done. Perhaps he is seeking to comis ete with a television program and would like to E e called the Three Billion Dollar Man. That might be a good slogan for him in the election do to campaign. No wonder he wants to strip the of whatever powers it has in relation to responsible economic financing. I think it would be well to remember the words of the honourany able member for Oxley when he said: It would take the total deficit to more would be a prescription for ing monetary measures and high interest rate hikes leading to widespread corporate failures and unprecedented unemployment levels. One could hardly have a better description of the sum of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition. NA",17
12,Mr MORRIS,PURCHASE OF LAND FOR OMEGA,"My question, which is sed to the Minister for Transport, relates to the report 308 hectares of land at Darnman in the Minisregarding ter's electorate purchased by the Government. It for the Omega base. I ask: What was the price paid for the land? Is it a fact that the price for the land was above prices for comparable land in the area and well above the value of the three land having regard to its usage at the time of chase? Further, is the vendor known personally to the Minister and his family and is it a fact the vendor is that well-known supporter of the National Country Party, Mr John MCDonald of tion Sale?",18
13,Mr NIXON,PURCHASE OF LAND FOR OMEGA,"It so happens that the vendor the land in Darriman is known to me, as are of the landholders in the area. By some chance most of the landholders in the electorate of Gippsland know me personally and I know most declining. of them personally. I just happen to have a happy relationship with my constituents. That might sound strange to the honourable member for Shortland who looks for conspiracies in these sorts of matters. To lay the matter properly rest let me tell the honourable member that the land was purchased for the sum of $ 190 per acre. That can be converted to hectares if somebody would like to do it; I am an old fashioned farmer and I still talk in terms of acres. Four properties were offered to the Departweather ment of Administrative Services which handled the matter and I understand that this was the cheapest of the four properties. The price finally agreed upon was not the price Mr MCDonald asked for but the price that the taxation valuer recommended to the Department of Adseem ministrative Services ought to be accepted. I know that implicit in the honourable member's question is a suggestion that I have some perness sonal interest m this matter. Let me assure the House that I have no knowledge of the activities of the Department of Administrative Services. That Department is totally independent of my Department. If the honourable member had had experience in handling such matters he would have been aware of that and would not be than $4,600m and asking stupid questions. roaring inflation, with devastatNA",18
14,Mr MILLAR,DROUGHT ASSISTANCE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industry. No doubt the Minister will be aware of the serious drought conditions prevailing in several areas of Australia. Is the Government being kept up to date with advice on the position? If so, what action does the Government propose if it beBASE comes evident that assistance is necessary? addres Mr SINCLAIR-Onl y today I received a from the Department of Primary Industry drought conditions around Australia. is quite tragic that, in a country such as ours, the rural sector, which has gone through such paid difficult labours in recovery after those other years of hard Labor, now seems to be running into a drought which is affecting most pur-States. In southern Queensland currently 15 shires have been declared drought areas and apthat plications from a number of other shires are pending. In New South Wales 19 pasture protecdistricts, mainly in the southern and western areas, have been declared drought areas. Whilst of currently in Victoria no areas are declared mostdrought stricken and no relief measures are operating, rain certainly is critically needed there and crop yields at the moment unfortunately are In South Australia the position is probably the worse of any mainland State with 85 per cent of the State drought affected, the worse areas being the Eyre Peninsula, the northern Mallee, Balaclava, Owen and Pirie. Unfortunately, the at drought is expected to be worse than either the 1959 or 1967 droughts. In Western Australia 18 shires currently are drought declared and applications are pending for a number of others. With respect to the overall picture, it is certainly true that throughout Australia the present trends seem to be moving against the farmer. We have had quite a run of favourable seasons. This has meant that livestock numbers have crept up and there has been a climate of expectation that those good weather conditions would continue. Unfortunately, that does not to be true, and in a country like Australia, which has had this cyclic pattern, it is necessary that governments demonstrate their prepared to provide drought assistance according to an established formula to ensure that the offset economic disadvantages of drought do not affect the farmer too severely. We operate federally through State governments, and when there are requests from State governments we are only too prepared to assist them. In each State there minimal amount which the Federal Government requires the State government to spend first drought relief. A wide range of measures already been approved. Where a State feels thatsuggestions those measures are insufficient or not applicable to the particular circumstances of drought, the Government certainly is prepared to expand the areas of approved assistance. The Federal Government stands prepared in each State to provide whatever assistance supplemental to as I can. State assistance is necessary to ensure the well-being of those districts affected by drought and the producers in those districts. SHOP ASSISTANTS UNION: BALLOT",18
15,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DROUGHT ASSISTANCE,"My quesuon is dithe rected to the Minister for Employment and tive ofathe Industrial Relations. I refer to the ballot that is tralian Capital about to begin in Victoria for the Shop AssistantsHouse of the outcome Union and to the fact that the challengers of the sitting officials are unable to obtain a copy of the voters' roll. Is the honourable gentleman of the fact that the Electoral Officer has refused to allow the challengers to pay, at their own for the computerised copy of the electoral roll which will be used in the ballot that will 24 November? Is he aware of the fact that when the roll was brought back to the Australian toral Office yesterday the Electoral Officer told the candidates concerned that they still could have a copy of the roll because the computer company had made some mistakes? Does he Nobody know that the challengers have only the names which were published on the roll for about March of this year and that the many thousands of names which have been added since are not known to them? They are, however, known the encumbents. Will the Minister take urgent steps to arrange for the Electoral Officer to pone the opening date of the ballot so that all candidates will have a proper opportunity to put out their voting material? Will he take steps to have the Electoral Officer comply with the quite reasonable request of the candidates conlonger cerned, that they be permitted to purchase at their own cost duplicate copies of the compuaction terised account of the electoral roll?",19

As these on issues have been brought to my attention by the has honourable gentleman I shall look into the that he has made.

I will make immediate investigations to find out and I will let the honourable member know the results of those investigations as soon NA NA,19
17,Mr GOODLUCK,LONE FATHERS,"My question is directed to Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister receive deputation yesterday from a representaLone Fathers Association of the AusTerritory? If so, can he advise the of the visit? aware Mr MALCOLM FRASER- I think my colleague the Minister for Social Security has cost, already issued a statement on this matter. A deputation was received from the Lone Fathers start on Association which was introduced by the honourable gendeman who asked the question. ElecThe honourable gentleman has been pressing this matter, as have other honourable gentleman not in the Government parties, for a very considerable period and with a great deal of vehemence. ever doubted the justice of the case. It was a question of when the matter could be fitted into the totality of the Government's overall expenditure commitments. But I must say that the arguments that were put by the deputation to yesterday to Senator Guilfoyle and myself seemed to be so compelling that we should take postadvantage of the opportunity to move amendments to the social security legislation that is before the House so that lone fathers will be able to also get the same benefit as supporting mothers and so that they will not be denied that benefit any than is absolutely necessary. The Government is acting accordingly. I believe that this will be hailed throughout the Australian community as a measure of social justice. I had COMMONWEALTH POLICE RAD) ON the amendCANBERRA POST OFFICE: ELECTION NA",19
18,Mr UREN,CAMPAIGN FUNDS,"My question is directed to the Minister. Did Commonwealth police raid the Canberra Post Office this morning and fingerprint all employees working there? If so, by and whose direction was this done and why was it done? Is the Government using the Commonwealth Police Force to investigate an ment to the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party? Does the Prime Minister concede Federal Treasurer of his party was making appeals for campaign funds at a time when was denying that there would be a Federal election?",19
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CAMPAIGN FUNDS,"I think the torial in the Australian Financial Review this morning accepted that it was an appeal for the funds for the normal runmng of the Secretariat, which I must say is an extraordinarily efficient secretariat and is of great advantage to the Government parties and to the party organishim ations. Quite obviously that Secretariat requires funds for its normal annual maintenance. I think honourable gentlemen would be a little bit more nervous about this question if they knew in the sequence of events and what happened; they would not have rushed in quite so hastily or quite so eagerly. The matter which was referred to yesterday's Australian Financial Review had viously come into the hands of the reporter coninvestigation cerned before it reached the Secretariat because the letter arrived in the Secretariat after the Diany. rector had read about the matter in the Australian Financial Review. The letter had been opened. It was marked 'Opened in error'. It not only been opened in error; it obviously also had been read and whoever had read it clearly put it to good use. As a result of that",20

As I said last week, these rumours have been supported by Mr Gruzman who has a vested interest in a building at Mascot servicing commuter airlines. I underter a question stand his natural interest in mawtaining the number of commuters using his buUding but I think he ought to be intellectually honest in putweeks ting his case before the commuter operators. The facts are that there will be no change to the comOn muter services going into Mascot aerodrome. Governmenttheapproached There are no plans to shift the commuter services implement to Bankstown nor are there any plans to shift any regional of the major domestic or regular public air services out of Mascot to Bankstown.

When I saw the report-especiall y one report yesterday which named my Department-I asked the Secretary of my Department any complaints had been reaching him any of the other senior officers of the Depart1 no been received. Whether some people down the have said something or said something to the media, I would not be able to judge.

Why is it taking him so long-ove r four so far-to answer my question which inquires: what dates, in what form and with what results has the the Queensland Government to Inquiry's suggestion that the 2 governments should jointly undertake research into the effects on the economy of a decision not to approve the export of transport minerals from Fraser Island I also direct his attention to another part of my into Mascot question which states: Which Federal Departments have undertaken this and aircraft carrying a research.",21
38,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER ISLAND INQUIRY,The honourable gentleman will know that considerable funds were made available to the Government of Queensland as a result of that particular matter. substantial sums have been offered by way of compensation. I think those matters are not unrelated to any such proposed study. I . will have a look at the Notice Paper to see that whether there is any information tnat can be given to the honourable gentleman. NA NA,21
39,Mr FALCONER,SERVICE,My question is directed to prothe Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Has the Government noted the recommendation in the Norgard report on the Commonwealth Employment Service regarding the role of computers in the CES? What action has the Government taken on this figure-an recommendation?,21
40,Mr STREET,SERVICE,"Yes , the Government has noted the recommendation in the Norgard report about the use of automatic data processLudeke ing in the running of the Commonwealth Embe ployment Service. I am pleased to be able to inform the honourable member ment has sent a team overseas to examine the operation of this form of assistance in the employment services in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. The team is being by an Assistant Secretary of my Department It also includes an official familiar with the erations and two other officers-on e from the Public Service Board who is expert in automatic and 1975data processing. They will investigate, as I said, the use of ADP in the employment services of the United Kingdom, the United States to see whether its application in those places could have application in Australia. Mr Norgard made the comment that introduction of such a scheme would be expensive. He recommended that we look at the experience of other countries to see whether it would feasible to introduce an existing system into CES. The team will be away for a couple of months. It will report to the Government feasibility of using ADP in the CES on the lines of one of these overseas countries. The Governreport ment looks forward with a great deal of interest toreceivingthis report. DOCTORS' FEES",22
41,Dr KLUGMAN,SERVICE,"My question is directed the Minister for Health. Does he recall that Justice Ludeke, in his recently concluded inquiry into doctors' fees, assumed a 3.2S per cent increase in the consumer price index for the tember quarter and based hisfindings,in part, on this assumption? He is no doubt aware that the consumer price index rose in fact by per cent. When will the Minister therefore ask destroyed. Mr Justice Ludeke to re-open the inquiry and save Treasury and the contributors to private 27 I June health funds a significant proportion increase recently wrongly awarded to the mediister for SecondaryforIndustry cal profession?",22
42,Mr HUNT,SERVICE,"Thefiguresused by Mr Justice Ludeke were only indicativefigures,as indeed they only could be when the inquiry was being held. If there is any over-estimate on the part Mr Justice Ludeke, these over-estimates will be taken into account in the inquiry that will place next year for the setting of fees for 1979. The amount involved is not terribly great over the course of a full year. It was a quarterly indicativefigure-ratherthan a full yearfigure.Both the Government and the Australian Medical Association agreed that they would abide by the determination of Mr Justice with respect to medical fees. So there will no re-opening of the inquiry, but the figures will be taken into account in the inquiry that will that the Governensue next year. NA",22
43,Mr BAUME,TARIFFS,"Can the Prime Minister indicate led whether his Government has ever considered cutting tariffs by 25 per cent, similar to the cut CES opintroduced by the Labour Government which brought unemployment in my electorate in 1974",22
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFFS,Order! The honourable member will not recite facts. He will and Canada ask for information.,22
45,Mr BAUME,TARIFFS,Can the Prime Minister inform the House what recent experience would tell us the about a tariff cut of that order?,22
46,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TARIFFS,"The Government be has never considered such an action. It would not the consider that kind of action because of its implications for employment. I think that the on the concern for employment of the previous Administration can be shown very clearly by the on possible ways of increasing imports. In other words, it was also a report on possible ways of exporting Australian jobs and of reducing Australian employment. That would have been a more proper title for this report because it indito cates how additional imports could be Mr encouraged to come into this country. For every additional car, every additional washing machine and every additional television set that Sepcomes into Australia, Australians are being put out of work. For additional textiles that come into this country Australians are being put out of only 2 work and Australian investment is being think it should be noted that in a letter dated of the $65m half of the MrMinister Whitlam asked a committee, on beOverseas Trade and Minand himself, to report on tariff or other action which could stimulate a significant inflow of imports. The then Prime Minister asked Mr Rattigan to advise him how to increase unemployment in Australia. of The letter was written on 27 June. There was obviously a very great urgency attached to the mattake ter because thereportwas received on 15 July and the date of the announcement of the 25per cent across-the-board tariff cut was 18 July. That was only three days after the receipt of the report, the committee concerned having been lowed very few days to examine these matters. That committee included in its membership Mr tions. Rattigan, Mr Taylor, Mr Harris, Mr Gruen, Mr Brogan and Mr Bennett. Part of that report his stated: The following table lists those industries where estimated that a 25 per cent reduction in tariffs will employment by more than S per cent. The report pointed out that employment would be reduced in those industries as follows: work, Women's and girls' blouses and frocks, 8 per cent; women's and girls' outer wear, 7.6 per hosiery, 6.9 per cent; household textiles, 5.9 per cent; textilefloorcoverings, 4.6 per cent; men's honourable trousers and work clothing, 8.1 per cent; men's suits, coats and waterproof clothing, 9.6 per cent; and underwear, nightwear, shirts, 7.7 per cent. It for goes on to mention footwear and other elements Prime of textiles. In spite of having that report and the ent line of argument advice that employment in those industries would be reduced, the Government acted on the report three days after it was received. I whether all members of the Cabinet of the day had the report and were allowed to see it, or whether the then Prime Minister kept that to himself so that his colleagues would not and would not know what was going to happen to employment. I wonder what the honourable member Hindmarsh would have thought about this.entering cannot believe for one minute that he would have supported the implementation of this leave report, designed as it was to increase unemployment in Australia, because I know that he is concerned for employment in this country. I know that. The Leader of the Opposiuon certainlyparable showed his lack of concern, by the speed with which he wrote a letter, the speed with which exactly committee was compelled to provide the report and the indecent haste with which it was acted on-a mere three days after it was presented. man the Labor Party to pretend that it is a party concerned about employment is the greatest hypocrisy I have seen in my life. Mr Speaker, 1 askoffor leave to have this report incorporated in Hansard.",22
47,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFFS,Is leave granted? Mr E. G. Whitlam-No. It was tabled four find years ago.,23

EMPLOYMENT: SCHOOL LEAVERS al Mr BRYANT- I address my question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial RelaI refer to the advertisement in today's Australian which includes a notation from him and signature. The advertisment is entitled 'This year's school leavers are next year's future'. How it is many school leavers will there be at the end of reduce December? How many jobs will be available for them by the end of January? If the answer is that the greater proportion of them will be out of is not the theme of that advertisement misleading and an unethical use or a misuse of pubcent; lic funds as part of a political campaign?,23
50,Mr STREET,TARIFFS,"I find it strange that the member should apparently take objection to the Government trying tofindjobs school leavers. In view of the answer by the Minister to the last question, the honourable gentleman does exhibit an entirely consistwith those of other members of his party. wonder Mr BRYANT - Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Perhaps I should clarify the quesuon. The question is: How many jobs will be available for advice school leavers at the end of January? see it Mr SPEAKER-Order! No point of order is involved. The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I call the Minister. for Mr STREET-The number of school leavers I the work force, of course, never can be given precisely, because some young people school at the' end of the year, indicating that they will join the work force, and return to school at the start of the next year. I think the experience in this coming year will be roughly comwith the experience in the last few years. I would like to illustrate that. It will not be the comparable because of the extra job opportunities which will be created by the advertising campaign to which the honourable gentleFor has just referred. He may be interested to know that employment offices are now starting to get extra inquiries from employers as a result the campaign which has been launched. The experience of the last few years has been that roughly less than half the school leavers actually register for employment. More than half jobs for themselves. Another interesting fact is that approximately 80 per cent of school leavers are in employment by the middle of the year. The remaining 20 per cent are the ones who difficult to place, who left school at a miniget it mum age within minimum qualifications. The training programs which the Government has instituted have been successful in absorbing into employment a considerable proportion of those. That proportion will be greater in the coming year as a result of the substantial improvements to thettainingprograms that we have insututed. TELEVISION RECEPTION IN OUTBACK dissolution",23
51,Mr KATTER,TARIFFS,"I preface my question, which addressed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, with a brief comment. As many areas throughtout Australia are still deprived television reception-centres such as Pentland and Greenvale, with hundreds of meat and ing workers and their families, Aramac, Mutsubstantial. taburra, Jericho, Isisford, Tambo-and as the [ >eople in those areas are already underprivion eged in so many ways",24

I cannot give the honourable member a deproposal finite time-table today for the area of Pentland his electorate. I can only say that the and I are looking very closely at a number of short term and long term schemes that might ease and, I hope, solve the majority, if not all, the problems that exist. We are committed to sisting communications generally, whether apply to postal services or telecommunications services. I am working closely with my colleagues to ensure that the television viewing the honourable member wants for his constituents are provided as quickly as possible. NA",24
55,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT,"I direct a question the Prime Minister in view of the public disquiet about the interruption to normal commercial activity cause by the frequency of elections, the next one being the fourth m the five years, and in view of the the Governor General in India in 1975 that there was no need for premature dissolutions of Parliament if the government had a workable majority. Will the Prime Minister table in the House his request to the Governor General for an early and his reasons? Will he also table AREAS the Governor General's letter of acquiescence is and his reasons for granting a dissolution?",24
56,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT,"I am not sure of whether the honourable gentleman was in die House when I announced the dissolution, but minthat announcement gave the reasons. They are They are similar in many ways to the reasons that were advanced to Sir William Slim an earlier occasion. I think the honourable gentleman would accept that it does not make a great deal of sense to have the Senate elections the House of Representatives elections held separately. That in itself is a substantial matter. If the elections for both Houses are to be brought together, obviously the options for election dates may receive are somewhat reduced. The honourable gentleman knows that he supported a referendum designed to see that the and the Senate were elected at the same time, and that that referendum failed because in States more support was needed. There is a contradiction in the Opposition's this matter. In November 1975 the are made Leader of the Opposition expendiSupply crisis by having aproposed half to resolve the Senate election. engineerAfter such an election he could not have Suphave changed the numbers in the Senate for another or seven months. That being so, how the honourable gentleman could suggest that the for a half Senate election could alter the incircumstances at all or resolve that situation I Department utterly fail to understand. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith of seems to be taking a view that is contrary to that asof his leaders, but maybe a large number of E they eople on the front bench of the Australian abor Party at the moment say, as Senator Button did, that what the Leader of the Opposition services that says is irrelevant.",24

59,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT,I will check whether there are any precedents for tabling such correspondence.,25
60,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT,I assure you there are.,25

NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION",25
62,Mr MOORE,DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT,I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Has the Australian Government taken any particular initiatives in pursuit of a safer clear proliferation environment?,25
63,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT,"The Australian Government, amongst others, has taken initiarelated tives in this matter. Out of discussions that the harmonyForeign Minister and I have had with the Ambassador-at-Large and out of our own examrelated'. ination of the matter has grown a proposal for international control over possible reprocessing cilities. Honourable gentlemen will know that the United States had advanced policies desigrelated'. ned to stem the moves towards reprocessing. Those moves are already under way in some countries and already reprocessing is being undertaken in some countries. Against that background, how does one with establish the safest possible international environment? In his speech at the planning conAustralia ference for the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle seas where Evaluation program, the Ambassador-at-Large put indicated that we would be exploring the possibility of the internationalisation- I think that the word used-of reprocessing plants. That is just pretending one initiative that I believe is certainly well worth pretending examination and on the advice available to me is that one which is being pursued and is attracting interest by people expert in these things from number of other countries. That again just shows and the advantage of having an Ambassador such as of the Ambassador-at-Large overseas and working us. in Australia's interest and in the interests proliferation generally. I think it ought to be noted that the last senparts tence of the document that the Deputy Leader of document the Opposition somehow found yesterday, reads: We were 'dean-skinned' and were now in a position to exert influence. I repeat the words 'were now in a position to exert influence'. That is a very substantial phrase in the minute, and we are doing just that. It indicated there that this proposal for internaclarification tionalisation had been suggested. Earlier the document indicated some reservations about some aspects of policies of other countries, including the United States. The Ambassador has written to me in recent days and I have spoken to him this morning. He is happy for me to quote one sentence out of the letter to indicate the circumstances of the current situation, because it is a moving scene. It ought to be noted that since this minute was drafted by the Department of Foreign Affairs as a record of discussion, there have been many discussions between Mr Justice Fox and experts overseas about these matters and I know he has put views forthrightly and constructively, seeking a better and an eversafer international environment. In relation to nuthis, in indicating some shift in the views held by some United States officials, he wrote: Whether my arguments and the changes were casually I cannot tell but I find myself now in almost complete Mr E. G. Whitlam-I think he said 'causally fa Mr MALCOLM FRASER- Mr Speaker, the letter happened to have in it the words 'casually If the honourable gentleman can see through aboutfivebrick walls and know what was in that letter, then he has some capacities which I had not regarded as being available to him. The letter reads: . . . but I find myself now in almost complete harmony the views of leading United States officials. I think that again indicates the importance of being involved in these forums overAustralian views can be responsibly to the advantage of a safer regime for was Australia and for the world. The alternative, of that these matters do not exist, of there are no problems, of pretending countries like Britain do not need uranium for peaceful purposes, is an idle and foolish pola icy and one which would be doomed to disaster to destroy whatever influence Australia might have in forums which are important to all of non Mr UREN - Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

Mr Justice Fox agreed with that. Otherwise it is a personal confidential document.",25

87,Mr STALEY,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"On the date I mentioned, sented the annual report of the operations of Consumer Affairs Council and the Consumer Affairs Bureau of the Australian Capital Territory for the year ended 30 June 1977. On the same day the House agreed that the report be published in accordance with the provisions the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908 and that the report be printed. Subsequent to this it was covered that an error was made in the report naming Des Cooper Constructions Pty Ltd of 8 Beltana Road, Pialligo, on pages IS and 16. The company which should have been Cooper Conversions Pty Ltd of 5 Perkins Place, Torrens. I deplore the fact that Des Cooper Constructions Pty Ltd has been wrongfully named in the Council's report. The House should be aware that every effort is being made to remedy the consequences of this mistake and to make sure that similar errors do not happen again. In this regard the following action is to be taken or has been taken: All unsold copies of the report have been withdrawn from sale; all copies of the which have been distributed gratis are being retrieved; all copies of the report will be and a public apology will be issued by the responsible authority. Because of the error it is necessary to submit a substitute report of the with the appropriate corrections. I now for the present that substitute report.

This is thefirstof them others to come. This Government in the history of parliament. For three months we have sat here doing nothing.

It is a fact that the Government is responPty sible for the damage that has been done. mention is made in the statement by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) of any financial remuneration for the firm concerned. is relevant to say that the Government is making a mess of the way in which the business of this House is being conducted and Des thefirstvictim. I cannot see that it is irrelevant to talk about other matters that have come before this House as a result of the way in which business of the House has been conducted. If Government time had been taken to look seriously at these not matters over the last three months these events independent could have been avoided. But for three months we sat here doing nothing. Now that the election has been announced in two weeks we have to take deal with every document, every report and wishes more legislation than has been introduced in two gest years. As the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) pointed out yesterday, it relevant to what is happening in this Parliament Council that the members do not know what is going through the House. The laws that are being made in this House now are a farce. Des Cooper Constructions Pry Ltd is just one of the victims. Later the electoral boundaries in New South it. Wales will be shown to be the second victim. Then, there is the Scotch whisky industry, which great damage was done a little earlier. Honourable members can see the effect on some prominentfiguresin Australia since the duues have been reduced.",28
92,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Order! The honourable giving member will resume his seat. I ask the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) to listen what I am about to say. My understanding is that a report was formulated by an independent and was tabled here; that there was an error that report; that the error has been discovered and that the independent body is now asking the Minister to table a substitute report. On that basis the Leader of the House has moved: That this House, in accordance with the provisions Parliamentary Papers Act 1908, authorises the publication of a substitute repon of the Australian Capital Territory Consumer Affairs Council and tory Consumer Affairs Bureau for the year 1976-77 and that the repon be printed in substitution for the paper ordered to be printed by the House on 27 October 1977.

Responsibility for mistake regarding Des Cooper Constructions Ltd must rest with the Government. Whilst No we rush the business and reports through the House in this manner there may be other mistakes that will be found after 10 December or Itafter this House rises when we cannot repair the damage that has been done, as it has been done in this case. There are so many mistakes being Cooper is just made by this Government",28
94,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I rise to a point of order. The the mistake in this instance was made not by the but by an independent body, the report of which is being tabled. The mistake is by the Government but by a body entirely of the Government. The body, having found its mistake, has asked the House to note of that mistake. If the Opposition to be dissociated from the mistake, I sugthat the comments of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) be relevant to is the motion related to the Consumer Affairs of the Australian Capital Territory. It is not the Government that made the mistake. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, on the point of order, the original faulty document only came before the Parliament because a Minister tabled A Minister took responsibility for it. The faulty document would only have been protected in its to defamatory references because a Minister asked the House to make it a parliamentary paper and give it immunity. Sure there are faults in the document but somebody must take responsibility. The Minister must take responsibility. My colleague is making the point that Ministers are insufficient attention to their responsibilities. Faulty the document is. Protected the docuto ment is. But we would not have the document; the document would not be protected but for an body overburdened or negligent Minister having in tabled it and sought protection for it. My colleague's remarks are completely in point. Mr Groom-On the point of order, I seek clarification of one point. Is it proper for members opof the posite to speak as they are now, criticising the action being taken, when they in fact supported the publication and printing of the original the Australian Capital Temreport?",28
95,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"There is no substance in the point of order raised by the honourable member for Braddon. I will permit the honourable member for Port Adelaide to proceed. If he goes beyond my ruling, I will require him to resume his seat.",28
96,Mr YOUNG,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Again, let me say, in dissociating the Labor Party from this mistake, that it not receive the report before it was tabled in Parliament. In no way can the Opposition held responsible for the damage that has been done. I think insufficient explanation is given the Minister's statement. We are not quite sure what damage has been done to Des Cooper Conings structions Pty Ltd because it was named incorand rectly. Was the mistake overlooked because the Minister's staff has been cut and reports cannot be checked sufficiently well?

97,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I present the second report of the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, together with minutes of the proceedings. The Committee's first report, which was presented on 3 May 1977,In indicated that the Committee had agreed to program which would enable a fully functioning, Stage I, Parliament House to be constructed occupied by 26 January 1988-the 200th anniand versary of European settlement in Australia. The purpose of this second report is to inform Parliament of the progress which the Committee has made in preparing a design brief for the new Parliament House. The report also recommends that a similar committee be appointed early in the life of the next Parliament so that the program of work leading to construction of a new building will not be delayed. The Committee iterates that it remains feasible and practical achieve occupation of thefirststage of a new building by 26 January 1988. Ordered that the report be printed. NA",29

Additional copies will be available for retain its 90 dominant general distribution in the near future. Ordered that the report be printed.",29
99,Mr BONNETT,SELECT COMMITTEE ON TOURISM,"by leave-Since it was first did appointed in December of last year, the Comthe mittee has become acutely aware of the probbe lems and potential of the Australian tourist industry. One hundred and sixty-two witnesses in representing 73 organisations have appeared before the Committee. Twenty-seven public hearhave been held in 14 cities around Australia the transcript of these hearings now runs to almost 5,000 pages. Because of the calling of an early election it has not been possibleforthe the Committee to conduct all the hearings it had had planned or to present afinalreport. This interim report covers a number of the issues which have the arisen during the course of the inquiry. governThe Committee found that, whilst there is a general acknowledgement of the economic importance of tourism, there are few statistics which indicate that importance. The specialist advisers to the Committee, Dr Pigram and Dr Cooper, prepared a paper for the Committee on the economic significance of tourism to Australia. The estimates made by the advisers are more in the nature of indicators of magnitude than absolute distributions of economic activity. It was estimated that the contribution of tourism to gross domestic product in 1974-75 was $3,300m. addition to its direct effects, tourism also has a indirect effects on the economy. In 1974-75, overnments are estimated to have gained and 172m in indirect tax, $165m in company tax $355m in income tax. The advisers also estimated the multiplier effects of tourism. For every dollar generated by tourism a further 25c is generated in the rest of the economy. Similarly for every two direct jobs in tourism one further job is created and an increase in tourism turnover of $10,000 creates 1.21 jobs. It was estimated by the advisers that tourism provided direct full time employment for 263,000 repersons and indirect employment for 136,760 to persons. Tourism also makes a significant contribution to Australia's balance of payments as well as increasing the community's knowledge of Australia and the Australian heritage. There is no hard evidence available as to the benefits of holidays to community health and welfare. The Committee recommends that the Department of Health should make a study of this matter. The tourist industry can play a positive role in regional development and decentralisation. It is a relatively low cost industry with distinct growth motor vehicle is expected to mode of transport and per cent share of recreational trips. The role played by the air transport mode is expected to increase while that played by sea and rail transport will decrease. The role of the tralian Tourist Commission was considered by the Committee. The Committee attaches contives siderable importance to that organisation and trusts that it will be given sumcient funds mote Australia effectively overseas. The Committee has commented on the need create an awareness of the holiday opportunities available to Australians within Australia. The Committee is aware of a proposal by the Ausport, tralian National Travel Association for a governmtrastate ment industry program to generate in national tourism areas. Representatives of that organisation appeared before the Committee on 20 October and were questioned on the proposal. The Committee sees considerable merit m the proposal and recommends that should the indusnext try commit itself to raising $2m over two years then the Commonwealth Government should establishment grant $2m over two years to the Australian Tour-Advisory ist Commission to allow it to conduct a joint promotional campaign with the Australian touras ist industry. The Committee supports the view that visitation to environmentally significant sensitive areas should be controlled and in some cases restricted. It recommends that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community transport Development identify those areas requiring long term management plans to protect them. The Committee sees a need for the registrationState of travel agents and recommends that the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduce legisFinally, lation to register travel agents. The problem seasonality is one in which little progress been made in recent years. The Committee recommends that each State and Territory personally should establish committees to consider the introduction of staggered holidays. During course of the inquiry particular reference was made to the training needs of the industry. Committee recommends that a survey of the training requirements of the industry needs to carried out as soon as possible. Many of the submissions received by the mittee referred to the problem of penalty wage rates. The Committee notes that wages and conCommittee ditions are determined within an industrial for framework which includes the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Committee has recommended that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations establish a tripartite working group to consider the terms and conAustralia ditions of employment within the industry and that any changes agreed to by that working Ausgroup be submitted to the Arbitration Commission. There are a number offinancialincenwhere the tourist industry is at a disadvantage when compared with other industries. The to pro-Committee recommends the introduction of a depreciation allowance for income producing buildings and amendments to the investment alto lowance and export market development grants scheme. Recommendations have also been made in relation to access tofinance,the Brisbane airregional routes for domestic airlines and pick-up and set-downrightsfor longemployment distance coaches. As it has not been possible to consider all the parts of the terms of reference nor all the issues raised during the course of the inquiry, the Committee recommends that it be reappointed in the Parliament and given access to the records of this Committee. The Committee welcomes the of the Travel and Tourist Industry Council and recommends that its membership be announced and itsfirstmeeting held soon as possible. Should the Committee be reappointed it recommends that the Minister for and Transport make available to it the reports of the steering committees of the Department on international civil aviation policy and domestic air policy. In conclusion, the Committee considers the long term future of the industry is a prosperous one. I also pay tribute to the cooperation the Committee has received from the ments governments, Commonwealth departand the industry. I would like to pay a sincere tribute to of the members of the Committee, especially my has Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Lang, Mr Frank Stewart, whose assistance to me has been invaluable. And to the sec the Alan Kelly, Mrs Anne Marie Nagle and Miss Virginia Greville, I would say a special thanks. The The Committee members and the staff have worked over and beyond the normal work of be committees, and I would like to record my appreciation of their co-operation.",29
100,Mr YOUNG,SELECT COMMITTEE ON TOURISM,"by leave-It Comwas my privilege to serve for some time as a member of the House of Representatives Select on Tourism whilst I was responsible the area of tourism as the shadow Minister. It was a privilege because thefindingsofthe Committee have vindicated the Opposition's view that tourism should be given far greater emphasis in government policies than is given today. has an enormous amount to offer the people of Australia. It is a great tragedy that so many people are unable to take a holiday in this country of ours. Some times the number of people who do not have holidays in Australia is submerged by the fact that as parliamentarians we do so much travelling and have access almost any day to some of the best spots in Australia when we are carrying out our parliamentary duties, but that is not the case for all Australians. I think this Committee has unravelled many of the problems which are confronting the average Australian citizen. I rise not only to mention these things and the importance of the Committee, which I hope will be able to continue in the next Parliament-it certainly will because we have already made up our minds to reconstitute the Committee-bu t also because I want to pay a tribute to the Chairman of the Committee the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett), because he has announced his retirement from Federal politics. He was a perfect public relations officer as far as the National Parliament was concerned and a great judge of places to go for hearings. I do not trunk that we missed any of the good spots. I think that the evidence that was given was always given in very pleasant surroundings. The Chairman was always held responsible for making those feasant speeches in response to mayors, counciltruth-an f ors, aldermen and the chairman of local tourist associations and he did it with great style dignity which served all in this Parliament very well. While the inquiry may not have been concluded it has not been a waste of time and those honourable members who served on the Committee have served in an area which is tremely important. It is a great pity that the travel agents legislation which passed through the House of Representatives some years ago under the Labor Administration, in 19751 think, was not brought into law in sadly needed. I am sure that when thefinalevi- . dence of any committee is brought before House that aspect certainly will be in the top ority of its recommendations. Tourism is an ex-Prime tremely important area. I was privileged to on the Committee, especially under such a 2542 gentleman as the honourable member for and address Herbert. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-I wish to make a personal explanation. I was misrepresented by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser).",30
101,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Leader of the Opposition may proceed with a personal explanation. Mr E. G. Whitlam-In Question Time today the Prime Minister said that in November 1975, at a time when the Senate was refusing to vote on the Hayden Budget, I had proposed that there should be an election for half the members of the Senate although the Senate as it was constituted then would continue until the end of June 1976. The Prime Minister apparently forgets that Acts which had gone through at the Joint Sitting in 1974 provided that on the first general election for either of the Houses there should for thefirsttime also be elected senators for the two mainland Territories. Accordingly, if an election for half the members of the Senate had been held in December 1975 the senators elected from the States would have taken office in July 1976, but the senators elected for the two mainland territories would have taken office forthwith. The Prime Minister ought to remember that it was the possibility of getting two Labor senators from each of the mainland Territories in the circumstances of that time that so disturbed him and prompted him to continue the Senate obstruction to the Budget. I also take the opportunity to point out that last Thursday the Prime Minister disputed the d in Hansard the word 'truth' appears in inverted commas-of what I had said in and answer to a question on This Day Tonight the previous night. He also said that I had misled all the people watching the TDT program that previous mght. I made no point at thetimeof his mis-statement because, at my suggestion, the transcript of the TDT program was incorporated in the Hansard of last Thursday. I have noticed, exhowever, that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Withers) has similarly misrepresented me in respect of this matter. The misrepresentation is this: The Prime Minister quoted a question from the TDT program in this country. It is these words: . . two years ago you signed a statement that you'd this like to see uranium mined . . . priThen I gave a reply the accuracy of which the Minister has challenged. In actual fact the serve question I was asked on TDT appears on page of Hansard. The third line gives the name of the person telephoning in with a question and reads: She was listening to the Senate today and heard a senator say that in Perth two years ago youthat is myselfsigned a statement that you'd like to see uranium mined and she would like some clarification from you on that. The Prime Minister last Thursday omitted the crucial words 'in Perth' and I regret to say that Senator Withers omitted those crucial words in statements he made in the Senate on that subsequent days. The documents which have been incorporated in Hansard, the Press stateone ment I made at that time on 28 October 1975, memorandum which appears on page 2489 of Hansard and the memorandum of understandterrible ing signed by me and the Ranger partners which appears on page 2491 of Hansard, support compened pletely the answer I gave on TDT. I rise on occasion because in the Senate, I regret to well as in this House, the leaders of the Governchance ment have omitted the crucial words that the statement. I was alleged to have signed was 'in Perth'. As I said, I have never signed such statement. Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",31
102,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I have received letters from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), the honourable member for Firstly, Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the honourable memnuclear ber for Denison (Mr Hodgman), the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) and the Leaderfast of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. required by Standing Order 107,1I have selected one matter; that is, that proposed by the honouramong able member for Mackellar, namely: The implications for Australia's policy on duction and nuclear safeguards of the views of Mr Justice Fox released yesterday. I therefore call upon those members who apreprocessing prove of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members requiredother the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",32
103,Mr WENTWORT H,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The text which has been released has been regarded as an authentic text. I will not therefore go into the question of how it was released. I want to go into the question of its implications. It has been stated in the Press and tliink by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) that the statement is opposed to the Government's policy. It seems to me, on the conto trary, that implications of this statement support the Government's policy. I will speak on a very limited front. The ment itself is concerned with the investigation the proliferation problems. There have been many doubts and heartbreakings about the nuA clear energy program and the whole matter of the atom. Some of these have been of small consequence, but some are of the very greatest and consequence. The one that Mr Justice Fox is speakmg of is the most vital. A nuclear war, if should ever come, could destroy not just the the whole fabric of our society but indeed the whole fabric of the world. There is no doubt as to the nature of the weapons which are being evolved. Mr Justice Fox describes what has hapand suggests a positive policy. Unhappily this there is now no watertight proposal which can say, as prevent the possibility of nuclear war. The of having that kind of safeguard is now gone. All we can do is reduce the probability of nuclear war. We cannot getridof the possibility a entirely. That does not mean that we should not be doing our best in every way to reduce the probability of this ultimate disaster. NA I speak now of President Carter's policy to which Mr Justice Fox directed hisfirstremarks. That policy, which Mr Justice Fox said was now becoming ambiguous, had two main points: the prohibition of the processing of the fuel from reactors and, secondly, the suspension of the program for what is known as breeders or power breeders which make more fuel than they consume. Doubts have been raised on this matter in two ways. First it is said As that the Carter policy has been counterproductive because it is raising resentments other countries which want to produce their own nuclear programs. It has been said-it uranium prowas said to me by experts in the United Kingdom when I was there recently-that it is all very well for President Carter to suspend when as a matter of fact the United States is having technical difficulties about reprocessing and other countries are not having technical difficulties. Reprocessing plants in by countries are working perfectly satisfactorily. I put that aside. There is no doubt, as Mr Fox has said in the conference which has been reported, that other countries are resentful of what the United States is doing and they think that this is spragging their own nuclear development and doing them harm. If this is so, these I aspects of President Carter's policy are in fact counter-productive. But there are more important things than this. If nuclear energy is denied the world there will be an energy crisis and a starvation crisis and all the tensions which can lead to war. Honourable members should not think for one moment that in the ultimate consestatequence there is no possibility of a nuclear of weapon being drawn. There is. policy which denies nuclear energy is a policy of making nuclear war. Let us be quite clear about this. I know that a number of wellintentioned but rather ill-informed people are going around saying that by cutting out a nuclear program of peaceful development some kind of security is being given against nuclear war. This is exactly die opposite of the truth. The people who are against a nuclear program are in point of fact the warmongers, although their intentions in many respects may be good. Here is the dreadful truth. Let us face it. There is no restriction upon mining and supply of uranium which can give the slightest security against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. speak as somebody who knows the techniques, have seen them and known them for years.",32
104,Unknown,URANIUM,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.1S p.m.,33
105,Mr WENTWORTH,URANIUM,"Before the suspension the of the sitting I was saying that no denial of uranium would possibly prevent the dangers of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Furtherpossible more, no attempt to stop the development of clear power will be in the slightest way effective in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is the dreadful danger which certainly shadows every other kind of nuclear danger. It is so much greater than any other nuclear danger that in comparison the others arereallynot worth talking about Iremindthe House that countries such as France, Communist China, South Africa and Israel, which are now believed to have nuclear weapons capacity, did not get that capacity in any way through nuclear power. If one wants to make plutonium, one would not use power reactors. One would use a simple reactor of the old Calder Hall type with which ing. would be much easier to make plutomum. its Indeed, if one is talking about nuclear weapons, one is not bound to plutonium. The concentrated uranium isotope 235 will be equally, or perhaps war. even more, efficient for that purpose. I will not go into the technical details of this, although them. I have been through the various plants in Europe and know the details of these processes. can assure the House that anybody who thinks that by stopping the mining of Australian uranium or by stopping the development of clear power he is thereby impeding the processes of proliferation of nuclear weapons is very much astray. It is much more than that Those people are acting in a way which makes nuclear war more likely to occur. I am not saying that they are doing that deliberately. I believe that most of these people are naive and well intentioned. They are perhaps a little foolish, thinking that they know more than they do, but what they areAll doing when they go out on a campaign to stop what nuclear energy is making nuclear war more likely to occur. In thatregardthey have a very heavy burden on their consciences. If we deny to the world nuclear power, if we deny to it energy, we are going to have the tensions created by starvation and the elements that make for war. I know-this report of Mr Justice Fox makes it very plain-that no system is or can be watertight in regard to nuclear material. It cannot be. What we have to do is not just to wring our hands and say that nothing can be done. We have to think I out the best system which gives us the best chance of avoiding nuclear war. It is in that regard that the positive contributions of Mr Justice Fox, as outlined in this report now before us, are most important. He saysfirstlythat although plans of President Carter are not without their doubts, difficulties and ambiguities, nevertheless we should try to make them work as far as and to help President Carter in his nuefforts to prevent nuclear weapon proliferation and prevent nuclear war. For that purpose, we have to ensure, as President Carter himself overpoints out, that there are ample uranium supplies. If we are not going to process the spent fuel rods-if we are going to store them-in the interim we will need much more uranium. Secondly, if we are to have a proper plan to give nuclear energy to those people who will starve without it-the world s population is doubling every 35 years-w e will have to make available the necessary uranium for the nuclear energy program to proceed. Even if President Carter's plan is faulty, we should at least be helpit We should be helping to remove or minimise faults and helping as far as we can to make it successful. The plan is directed to what we want, namely, the security of the world from nuclear I know One of the things which has been suggestedAustralia can give a lead in this area-is that as I the elements of President Carter's plan become out of date and are superseded, there should be a plan for thereprocessingof spent fuel elements num a way which gives a multinational responsibility and the maximum of control. Do not let us think that any plan can be perfect. It cannot. But it is much better to have an imperfect plan than no plan at all. If the kind of nonsense that has been spoken by the Opposition is allowed to proceed, all that will happen is that we will be putting the world into nuclear anarchy. I do not suggest for one moment that die Opposition intends to do that. I am saying is that it does not understand it is doing. The course it is putting before us is one which- I was going to say 'is calculated' but it is not calculated-wil l achieve exactly the opposite consequence to that which it intends achieve. This is something which the House to consider. I think in a way it is fortunate the report has now been leaked-the circumtributing stances of its leaking are reprehensible enoughbecause these rather sound views of Mr Justice Fox will now be able to be considered by this House.",33

I assume that I take the minutes that is allocated normally to the Oppoand sition. So not only has the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) run away from the extra five minutes allocated to him, and from asking any questions this morning, but he has revealed himwould self as having joined that equivocal band of is hand-wringers-Hayden , Hawke and Whitlamwho have refused to debate this topic previously. On this' occasion, as in the past, I assume the same ideological line will be poured out now that the speech has been delivered to the honourable gentleman by his writers. We have heard it previously. I support the honourable member for to Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) on this matter of E has ublic importance. As a consequence of the that onourable member for Reid receiving and disthe document to which the honourable member for Mackellar referred, the honourable member for Reid could be, prima facie, a felon. We have no problems in supporting the matter raised by the honourable member for Mackellar. The contents of that leaked document support viewpoints put forward by the Government. I with the remarks made by the honourable member for Mackellar, particularly when he said that a policy, I think he put it, of denying nuclear energy was a policy leading towards nuclear war. Honourable members will recall the statements of the Government along this line. The people opposite who proclaim themselves the moral spokesmen of the Parliament are the ones who not only lacking direction politically and lacking determination intellectually but who are reality lacking any moral basis for the stand my right. The that they have taken. Moral principles alone do not determine how the one acts on questions such as these. They are multi-faceted ones. Moral principles, intellectual be determinations and realistic assessments-al l these aspects-ar e combined. Honourable members opposite are mouthing moral principles, as they frequently do, as if they are the ones who are putting forward a moral argument. To do so is to deny the reality that nuclear power is now adopted as a growing, major and significant If force of energy in the world. They are denying the opportunity not only of having jobs and having factories operating but of developing their own countries. I have pointed out previously in this place what British trade unionists, for example, have On Tuesday I quoted the General Secretary of the Electronics Union in Britain who, in supporting the development of Britain's nuclear 15 industry, said that death from starvation, cold wars of conquest would be the fate of the world if energy supplies ran out. Joe Gormley, the well known and oft quoted British miners' leader said that an anti-nuclear energy motion 'send us back to the jungle'. That attitude not for the hand wringers on the other side, the cheap expedients who will grab those fringe operators who want to propagate on the periphery of politics. No reasoning, no moral principle, no rational assessment can support the stand they take. The debate which they have sought to provoke in Australia is not a debate simply revolving around Australia. It is not constrained to this nation. It is part of a global debate which ing place against the background of ing world energy crisis of quite unprecedented and potentially disastrous dimensions. The crisis does not lie in some indefinite future. over Unless rapid action is taken it will be upon us decade. If it is allowed to occur will be not only economic and industrial but will posite believe that have profound, social and political effects, with which is forthcorrdng, foreign policy implications. The consequences would be particularly great for the energy reliant in Western countries and energy reliant, as they arena? develop, developing countries. would sweep that aside. The need for to act now is a result of the ever-mounting mands made upon it by the energy deficient and effectively guard against misuse nations which are desperately aware of the ergy supply difficulties that they face in the few decades. It is generally recognised that, by the mid-1980s, the expansion in world demand the for oil will exceed the rate that thereafter the world's oil come increasingly depleted during a relatively broader the consensus, short period-probably only decades. tell me that the Opposition is putting forward argument on a moral basis. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition directed remarks in a rather scatty, to put it mildly, statement accompanying the document that he put out yesterday, which he illicitly received ing the course of the day. He implied that it denigrated the Government's case. Why does not look at the basic documents on which the policies of this Government rest-namely , the documents flowing from the Ranger inquiry? This Government has never denied, because it in the report of the mquiry, that the Ranger inquiry chaired by Mr Justice Fox concluded that there are defects in the existing safeguards rangements. Those defects, as I recall the words in the report, 'do not render valueless the confor cept of international safeguards'. The Ranger inquiry reported, and the Government agreed, that it is both essential and possible to make safeIt guards arrangements more effective. The multi-lateral Government's safeguards policy, frankly, does just that. We have always said that the safeof guards are an evolving thing and that we working to strengthen them. The fact that we probably have the tightest safeguards the world today is ready evidence that we are not out on a mad grab for sales of uranium but that we want to influence people totightentheir safeincentive guards. The safeguards have worked. They are not yet totally effective. As the honourable memis absurd. ber for Mackellar said, we could never give a is takcastiron guarantee about them, but we will an impendsteadily evolve and improve them.

Press The Ranger inquiry identified a number of defects in existing safeguards arrangements. No durone has run away from those. We have never said that we live in the perfect nuclear world. The he Government has overcome these defects in its own safeguards policy by introducing measures which go beyond existing multi-lateral safeguards arrangements. The Opposition, from its is vantage point at the heights of confusion, represents the safeguards that would apply to all deliveries of Australian uranium under future arcontracts as being the same as those that the Ranger inquiry criticised. They are not. It is time die Opposition to get the facts. It is time indeed for it to tell the truth. It istimefor it to examine the facts and from that develop a policy. is time for it to cease its criticism of existing safeguards arrangements and start making contributions towards the strengthening safeguards.

No wonder the Opposition seriously on the subject of improvement of safeany questions about uranium this morning. guards. To leave Australian uranium in the ground until multilateral safeguards are improved, as is suggested so frequently by Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is to low me in the debate, is a policy of weakness inaction. In fact it is turning our back on the needs of the world not merely for supplies of ergy but in fact to strengthen the very element that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition attacks, namely, the safeguards. It is irresponGovernment sible and it condemns Australia to total powerlessness on this subject. the rest of the international community to deterlatched onThe mine the safeguards.

It is not to already geared say, as I recall the Leader of the Opposition (Mr field of reprocessing. E. G.

If one wants to take at face value remarks of the Opposition, one can only conreal clude that it regards the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards as static as well as ineffective.

What is the point of conclusion of the document recordwith ing Mr Justice Fox's views? It is that Australia a clean skin. To use his very words, we were 'clean-skinned'.

The Minister's time has expired. con Mr UREN (Reid) (2.40)-The nuclear debate is of extreme importance. It is one of the most important debates of our time because it deals the whole future of mankind, the whole is future of the human race. Therefore I make no apologies about the document that was passed to through the post to my office. That document dealt with a three hour discussion between senior government officials and Mr Justice Fox. I made that document public. I did not select newspapers. I gave it a broad circulation among all members of the Press Gallery of Canberra.states sent it to concerned people throughout the nation. I sent it to conservation and community groups throughout the nation. I sent it to every one of my Labor parliamentary colleagues soIn they could make up their own minds about it.the that we can get it into Hansard, I seek leave proposals, incorporate the whole document in Hansard. Australian",35
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Is leave granted?  granted. We are not going to allow classified material to be put into the parliamentary record.,37
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Leave is not May granted.,37
115,Mr UREN,URANIUM,"We know that the Government will not allow it to be included in Hansard. make a couple of quotations from the document. When talking to officials, Mr Justice Fox said that in the United States he had found the Carter non-proliferation policy to be ambiguous and uncertain and that there were widely divergent views within the administration. He went on to say that the United States and Canadian policies were deeply resented in Western Europe, Brazil and Japan and that there was general opposition elsewhere to the proposition that there could no reprocessing of American supplied material without consent of the United States. He went to talk about the countries that were deeply discountries. turbed about it. He referred to Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, India, Argentina and the Philippines, all of which in my view want to have their own nuclear power stations and do what they want us with the by-products of those stations with restrictions whatsoever including in some cases acquiring nuclear weapons. That is the real cern. What does the Minister for Foreign Affairs  PM last night: It, in fact, endorses the very thing the government been saying. It is, of course, only one small document whole host of documents - . . In other words he was saying: 'This is right; support it'. He was saying that the Government supports the utterances made in hope that he expresses that view to the upper echelons in Washington. He knows that diploergy matic representatives of the United States and needed other countries of the western world in Canberra because for are greatly disturbed about this document of potentialthe which the Foreign Minister says: 'We support it transport services. There all the way'. ",37
116,Mr UREN,URANIUM,"The Foreign Minister again says by interjection: 'Indeed we do'. The report also I that Mr Justice Fox said there was concern about the ability of the International Atomic Energy Agency to administer the safeguards satisfactorily. the few moments I have, I want to deal with So so-called energy crisis and the safeguards to and I want to say a few words about Labor Party policy. Let us look at the phoney approach of the Fraser Government to contracts with Britain and the phoney Fraser not Government so-called nuclear safeguards. The nuclear safeguards policy which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced on 24 has already been shot to pieces. To take one example, I refer to the eighth safeguard stated by the Prime Minister. It provides that in bilateral agreements between Australia and countries I will importing uranium the Australian government shall insist that any reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia should take place only with the consent of the Australian Government. I ask the Government to think about that question and correlate what is said there with what is said in the document that I distributed to the Press yesterday. We know now that this safeguards policy is completely unacceptable to Japan. It is completely unacceptable to be EURATOM. The Government can either drop those safeguards or write off any possible conon tracts with Japan or EURATOM or EURATOM Much has been made in the past few days of possible contracts with the United Kingdom. Let get at this question of the hypocrisy on the part no of this Government. What has been said about the British Government spokesmen, particularly conby the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony), is completely on false and I nail it to the mast. The United Kingdom has no independent power to make contracts outside the EURATOM agreementhas and I stress that. What the Government has said of a in the past few days about its alleged negotiations with Dr Mabon is completely misleading we and false. The United Kingdom cannot make bilateral agreements of this sort, and the Fraser the report. I Government knows it. Let me quickly look at the question of the encrisis. It has been said that our uranium is transport fuel. Now that is not true so-called 'energy crisis' is due to a shortage of liquid propellant fuel for is not a shortage of fuel for electric power generation. There is enough coal for that for the next 100 to 200 years. Then there is the question of conservation. Organisposition. ation for Economic Co-operation and Developresolved. ment countries are beginning to reduce ergy consumption. In 1975 and 1976, OECD countries did not increase their consumption of expired. energy. In part, this was due to the international economic recession, but it also reflects increased concern for conservation. Sweden and West Gerspeak many have already announced long term energy in conservation programs. The Central Electricity Generating Board in Britain 14 per cent in electricity sales last year. There have been no new orders to power stations, clear or otherwise, in the United Kingdom for least five years and there are unlikely to be for several years in the future. Let us look at the question of reduced power demand. Over the past decade official pectations of the contribution that nuclear ergy will make to world energy consumption the rest of this century have been moving ily downwards. This process is gaining momenSpeaker, tum. For example, at page 46 of thefirstRanger report, using August 1976figures,it is predicted that for the OECD countries, at least 400,000 megawatts of electricity would be nuclear generated by 1987. In January 1977 World Energy Outlook gave a comparable projection of 325,000 megawatts of nuclear generated electricity in 1985. By early May, official OECDfigurehad declined still further 253,000 megawatts. I am told by OECD sources that thefigureis now 224,000 megawatts. In other words, there has been a decline of 44 cent in the projected 1985 levels of nuclear generated power in a period of less than one year. This decline in nuclear generated electricity projections must continue. I now turn to the Labor Party's policy which not a 'leave it in the ground' policy. The Labor Party's policy is a policy which is concerned about the future of mankind. We are concerned about the many unresolved problems that now exist within the nuclear fuel cycle world. The two paragraphs of the Labor Party's policy on uranium state that we recognise that the vision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the rights and well-being of the Aboriginal people. Labor beUeves that, having regard to the present solved economic, social, biological, genetic, vironmental and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium, the development of nuclear power should not continue at this stage. Therefore, we are clearly saying that that is We want time until these matters are their en Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has",37

149,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Corangamite-Minister for this Employment and Industrial Relations) (3.5)move: That the Bill be now read a second time. As honourable members know, one of the steps division in the process of re-distributing the electoral for boundaries of a State is the determination of the 4,000, quota of electors for each proposed division based on the whole number of electors in each State, as nearly as can be ascertained the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for that State. respect of the recently approved redistributions, the quota was determined as at 24 June 1977. The Government has just been advised that in one of the then divisions in New South Wales there was a continuing and cumulative error the procedures for mamtaining enrolment stathave istics. This was not an error in the maintenance the electoral roll but in the enrolment statistics relating to it. As a result however, the enrolment statistics for the division of Berowra were, at time of the determination of the quota, stated by some 4,000. Consequently the State quota, on the basis of which the proposed enrolabout ments of all divisions are fixed, approximately by 96. This in itself would not have been significant. However, all the overstatement related to the one division. In essence, the proposed division of Berowra was, on the basis of the statistics provided, Commissioners to contain some 71,000 electors. In fact, because of the divisional Returning Officer's error, the enrolment in terms of the true Junefigures,was of the order of 67,000. Government, however, believes that, having been apprised of the error, it would be improper for it not to advise the Parliament. At time, because the Commissioners acted in good faith in respect of their deliberations application of the required criteria, the Government believes also that the Parliament would want to ensure that its approval of the tions could not be ruled invalid because of a That clerical error. This is the purpose of the Bill and it will apply to each of the redistributions approved by the Parliament. Honourable members will note that, apart from this special validation, the normal time. procedures required by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 are being maintained and the electoral divisions determined for the States remain subject to the provision that they stand until altered in accordance with the CommonThat wealth Electoral Act 1918.1 commend the Bill to the House. Second Reading Mr LIONEL BOWEN - Mr Speaker, I understand Bill is to be debated at a later hour this day. I I wonder whether the Minister, when he is mentioning thefiguresagain in the course of that debate, could indicate clearly thefigurefor the subof Berowra as at 1977-that is, the figure the total sub-division-and how in fact the miscalculation, which is deemed to be an error of was made.",41

151,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,I am not in a position to give a In response now but I will see whether the honourable gentleman's request can be acceded to.,41
152,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Mr Speaker, the distribution shows clearly and it is on record that the in sub-division of Berowra, for example, would had about 9,000 electors. Thesefiguresare of only approximate. It shows also that approximately 2,000 electors were moved from that subdivision to the sub-division of Dundas.

159,Mr CHARLES JONES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1977 now before the House reason takes the establishment of the Australian casting Tribunal a stage further and defines its functions. Among these functions the most sigBill nificant are: To grant, renew and revoke licences, to determine program standards and conditions of advertising, and to determine hours during which programs may be transmitted. The Bill Parliament also provides that the inquiries of the Tribunal, including those related to licensing, to be public unless the Tribunal is satisfied that it is desirable that all or part of the proceedings should be vate. The Bill follows up some of the recommenpening. dations of the Green report that the Tribunal should have these functions. They are an exteninquiry sion of those of the Australian Broadcasting trol Board in that the Tribunal will exercise powers now held by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) in but regard to the granting, renewing and revoking licences for stations, translator stations repeater stations, the licensing of public as well as commercial stations and it can hold public inquiries into licence renewals. However, this is most important, the Bill does not follow the recommendations of the Green report on the establishment of a broadcasting The Opposition is most critical of the provisions in this Bill and the criticism relates many clauses of the Bill that we propose to the an amendment to withdraw the Bill because we consider that it is a Bill that cannot be amended such a way as to make it a good Bill. So there is of only one thing to do about it and that is to move against an amendment. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to suboccurs first.stituting the following words: House is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted because (a) it greatly increases the of the Minister in relation to licensing of broadcasting and television services and is contrary to the stated intention of the Government to ""take broadcasting out of (b) the functions of the proposed Special Broadcasting Service are vague and imprecise and do not proadequate machinery for the provision of ethnic broadcasting services, and (c) there is inadequate provision for public participation and involvement in the process of broadcasting regulation'. In support of that amendment, this legislation is important legislation. It has been rushed into the Parliament. It is a matter of great public importance but there has been inadequate time for Second Reading consideration on this Bill. The Minister has said again and again that he wants full public debate and participation in broadcasting policy. This Bill was listed on the business sheet yesterday and the day before. It was listed for debate on and then it was put at the bottom of the list for debate on Wednesday. Obviously the for this is that there is still conflict within Broadthe ranks of the Government as to what is required to be written into this Bill. As I said, the is being rushed through. It is not in the best interests of the industry as a whole that this legislation should be pushed through in the manner in which it has been brought before the We make the point that the Minister is giving lip service to the claim that the Government requires full public debate on and participation priin broadcasting policy because that is not hapThis is something that he has said time and time again. He said it when the report of the into broadcasting was tabled in the ParConliament He said it again when the report of the Tribunal on self regulation was tabled m the Parliament He has said it on numerous occasions he has given only lip service to the statement. of I think he is a victim of his own Party. Nothing and really has been done to implement the recommendations of the Green report on broadcasting. Nothing really has been done to implement the and findings of the Tribunal and as happened in December 1976 the Minister has rushed legislation into the Parliament without adequate time planning board. for public debate. This legislation has been criticised by to so representatives of the Australian Broadcasting move Commission, by public broadcasters, by the commercial sector of the industry and by munity interest groups concerned with broadgood casting. No group associated with broadcasting is satisfied with the provisions of this legislation and no group concerned with broadcasting, if I might say so, is satisfied with the performance the Minister as far as this legislation is concerned. When I talk of various groups not being satisfied with what is going on, I mean that as I said a moment ago, that the Minister is havSenator ing problems inside his own party. I refer to the power report in the Age of 13 October headed 'MPs of the force change to new bill'. That does not mean the over. changes were made in the Parliament. It members of Parliament in the Liberal Party room. '1 he statement goes on to say: Government MPs strongly criticised the Postal and Telecommunications Department over the drafting of the bill. When someone condemns a department he is condemning the Minister as well. The article continues: The bill has been changed at least six times over seven weeks by backbench pressure. I congratulate the honourable member for man (Mr Jull) on his achievements in this regard to harrass the Minister but it has hot been done with any honest intent. It has been done at the instigation of his former employer who wields Parliament. great influence on the Liberal and National Country parties in this Parliament. The Press report goes on to say: Yesterday's attackThis is dated 13 Octoberon the Postal and Telecommunications Department by Mr Jull (Queensland) and Senator Townley (Tasmania). Incidentally, none of these statements that appeared in the Press have yet been disowned any of these members to whom I refer. They all have an opportunity as we all have, as you know Mr Speaker, because all we have to do is to whisper in your ear that we have been miswith reported and you will give us the opportunity denying something or explaining now we have been misreported. I cannot recall the honourable member having stood up in this place and such claimed to have been misreported. Therefore, take it that this Press report is a factual report just what has been going on as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. The article goes on to say: Mr Jull criticised a clause which would have given the tribunal discretion to reissue cences for a minimum period of 6 months as a disciplinary measure. It is believed the minimum period has been increased 12 months in the final draft to the tabled today. Congratulations to the honourable member; he stood over his Minister and Reg will give him compat on the back and say: 'Well done my man; man. When you get tossed out on election day on 10 December I will give you your job back again with Channel 0'. f congratulate him on doing his job faithfully in this place on behalf of of Sir Reg. The next one referred to in the Press article was Senator Townley. He did not do as well as the honourable member for Bowman. it is obvious, The article reads: Townley attacked the clause giving the tribunal to suspend stations for up to seven days for breaches law because of the effect it could have on their turnHe indicated he would try to change the clause before refers to the Bill was debated next week. It was damned bad luck; he did not get away with it. I believe that he has been one of the supE orters of the Government who, over the years, ave found Sir Reginald to be a great benefactor. Senator Townley found him to be of great assistance when he stood as an independent Liberal in Tasmania. With Ansett support he was able to get out sufficient propaganda and set the past himself elected. So, congratulations to the honourable member for Bowman and bad luck Bowto Senator Townley who did not get away with what he was trying to do. One of the tragedies is that Ansett has wielded such great influence in the decision making of the Liberal Party in this I come back to the Bill. I draw attention once again to the way in which the Minister has been treating this Parliament and to the way in which legislation has been brought in at short notice. In 1976 the Minister introduced the Government's was led first amendment to the Broadcasting and Television Act. Like this Bill, they were rushed into have Parliament The Government at that time hoped by to sack the Australian Broadcasting Commission without any public criticism and with the minimum of fuss. The Government also hoped to disband the Australian Broadcasting Control Board a minimum of fuss. But public concern and of pressure, I am pleased to say, saved the ABC on that occasion. Although this legislation was rushed through Parliament in 1976 some of it, as the provisions for the appointment of a I broadcasting council, has not yet been of proclaimed because of the pressure of a section of the commercial industry. As I understand the present setup of the industry, it is not prepared to serve on the council and is not prepared to work in the original draft of the Bill liwith the ABC. A section of the piece of legislation that was rushed into Parliament in the dying hours of that year has still not been to proclaimed. We are going through the same process again of rushed legislation, a lack of opportunity for public debate and legislation which a does not reflect the reports and advice which the Government has received. I will deal with that matter in greater length later in my speech. The Government's policy on broadcasting has been characterised by a series of mquiries accompanied by inadequate legislation. In other words the inquiries do not do what the Minister wants them to do. So the Government has to get around the matter the best way it can. The major refrain of the Minister has been the frequently expressed and supposed policy of the Government of taking broadcasting out of politics. If ever a government spoke with a forked tongue in relation to its policy it is this Government in relation to this aspect of its broadcasting policy. This legislation, the old two-card.trick, the thimble and pea trick, has involved the Government more heavily in broadcasting policy than ever before. A traditional objectionable feature of the broadcasting policy over many years has been the power of the Minister to grant broadcasting licences. This traditional objection has existed since Sir Robert Menzies overruled the advice of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in order to give his mentor, Sir Reginald Ansett, the licence for the 0-10 network. It is always interesting to see, as I have said, the way in which Sir Reginald can influence this Parliament and get what he wants in regard to television stations and airline policies. Amendments to be moved later today clearly are associated in principle with the two-airline policy with which the air transport industry istiedup. So that honourable members will be aware of what the Labor Party's policy I refer them to a written policy which clearly spells out the things that we believe should be done in regard to broadcasting and television. This is in contrast to the verbal statements that are made from time totimeby the Minister and members of his party which, as the Prime Minisupon ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has shown time and time again, cannot be believed because they say that circumstances change and that they are enand titled to change their policies with the circumEven stances. I ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard the Labor Party's policy on broadcastconditions. ing and television as determined at the Perth Conference in July of this year.",42
160,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsNA NA Labor Party Policy The establishment of a broadcasting structure comprising(1) A Broadcasting Advisory Council composed of representatives of the National, Commercial and Public Broadcasting sectors and community interest groups, with the functions of: assessing the needs of the Australian community and the industry in respect of radio, television and associated communicauon facilities. considering and commenting on planning proposals and research material for the development of broadcasting services. acting as a liaison body between the various sectors of the broadcasting system and the public and receiving and recording complaints or comments in respect of broadcasting standards. overviewing the administration of technical standards. consulting with or advising the Broadcast Licensing Tribunal in relation to overall management of the radio spectrum or on any matter relevant to the functions of the Tribunal. reporting regularly to Parliament. developing social standards in relation to broadcasting programs, particularly the elimination of sexist and racist attitudes. (2) A Broadcast Licensing Tribunal with the function of issuing and renewing licenses in the commercial and public sector and conducting inquiries on specific matters referred to it. Proceedings of the Tribunal will be conducted in public and interested parties and members of the public will be entitled to make submissions regarding the conditions of licences and the functioning of the Stations. Reports of the Tribunal will be tabled in Parliament and be public documents.",44
161,Mr CHARLES JONES,BROADCASTING,"I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Garland), who is at the table, and the House. This Bill proposes to take is the licensing function away from the Minister and give it to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. To this extent the legislation is worthy of support. But the power of renewing licences given to the Tribunal is a very empty power in view of the new powers which the Minister takes himself by virtue of this legislation. The Minister will decide what applications for licences he will call for and what specifications conditions will be attached to these licences. during the currency of a licence, the Minister is empowered to alter its specifications and It leaves little room for confidence for a licensee who wants some security in relation to a licence. It gives little opportunity for public involvement in the licensing process. It may mean that the Minister calls for no licence at all. Effectively and theoretically at least it would enable the Minister without any public involvement to determine the nature and content of broadcasting programs in the commercial and public broadcasting sector. In the national sector, the ABC, this Government has already shown by financially squeezing the ABC, and by attacks by prominent Ministers that it is prepared to interfere with the dence of that sector. Let us look Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) in the changeover period after the Labor Government was sacked by the Governor General in November 1975. One of thefirsttilings that the then Acting Minister for Transport, Peter did was to conduct a violent attack on the tiality of the ABC. Unfortunately, Government 1. supporters see partiality of a broadcasting system as presenting both sides of an argument. 2. Government supporters have become accustomed to one-eyed partial points of view that have been put out in the Press, on the radio and on television. Amendments to be moved later will set out once again to protect that partiality. The Tribunal is left with very hmited real powers. Broadcasting has not been taken out of politics. It has been put in the hands of the Minister. The Minister will now have sole control over planning a broadcasting structure which will become more susceptible to political pressures and decisions and less open to public involvement. This can and may lead to intolerable political pressures in the broadcasting system which the Annan Committee in Great Britain criticised for its lack of freedom of expression and news. Rather than pass over the matter, I propose to read from the report of the Committee on the Future of Broadcasting chaired by Lord Annan. The report, which was presented to the British Parliament in March of this year, states: Yet when London Weekend ran into difficulties, the authority seemed willing to jettison this principle and allow Mr Murdoch substantial power within the company. This was one of the reasons for public concern. In Australia, newspaper interests have gained control of television stations with very sharp repercussions upon political expression and news. Istltere a risk of the same thing happening here? Honourable members should not forget that the Murdoch referred to in that report is the Murdoch of Australian fame who owns so many 6. radio, television and newspaper companies in Australia. This Committee, which was chaired by Lord Annan and which had great credibility in the United Kingdom, was concerned that British media was not to follow the rackets that exist in Australia today and the one-eyed apreport proach to the presentation of news. The Government has completely ignored the proposals of its own inquiry into broadcasting that a broadcast planning board be established If which would give at least some independent sibilities advice on the planning of a Instead, these powers go to the Minister and broadcasting is put right in the political arena. Rather than read the recommendations of the Government's inquiry, I seek leave to incorindepenporate 'Section L: Summary of Recommendaat the case of the tions 'in Hansard.",44
162,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCASTING,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The extract read asfollowsNixon, SECTION L: SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS impar48S. This Inquiry recommends as follows: That the Australian Broadcasting Control Board be disbanded. That the administrative structure of the Australian broadcasting system be rearranged as follows: (a) the planning involved in the implementation of government policy to be carried out by a Broadcasting Planning Board; (b) licensing and public inquiries on broadcasting matters to be the responsibility of an Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; (c) broadcasters to be represented m planning and regulation through a Broadcasting Council. 3. That the disbandment of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the establishment of the Broadcasting Planning Board, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the Broadcasting Council take effect upon a date to be proclaimed. 4. That the powers and functions of the Broadcasting Planning Board be as outlined in detail in paras 183 to 185 and summarised as follows: (a) undertake detailed planning for the introduction or extension of broadcasting services in the national, commercial and public sectors including: (i) social and economic planning, research and development (ii) technical planning, research and development including determination of station operating parameters and the recommendation of operating frequencies for broadcasting stations; and (b) assemble industry data relevant to its functions. 5. That the Broadcasting Planning Board should consist of three full-time members, all of whom should be appointed by the Governor General. (Paras 186 to That if Recommendation 2 (a) is not accepted, planning responsibilities be allocated to the Postal and Telecommunications Department. (Paras 193 to 196) Mr CHARLES JfONES-I thank the Minister the for Veterans' Affairs and the House. I draw attention in this section of the Green Committee to the fact that it recommends the setting up of an independent tribunal to consider the matter of planning and the like. As an alternative, in paragraph 6, the report states: recommendation 2A is not accepted planning responbe allocated to the Postal and Telecommunications broadcasting system. Department. Yet, in this Bill, the Minister has seenfitnot to accept the recommendations of the Green Committee which was set up by him especially to inquire into the broadcasting and television industry. He sawfitto completely disregard recommendations of his Committee in relation what it considered was the best proposition. Minister also sawfitto treat the Committee's ond choice with the same contempt. He went to something which was not recommended in any way in the report. This is a clear indication Government continuing to keep broadcasting and television in politics, not out of it. For example, the media is critical of what is happening and clause 25 transfers the power from the Secretary of the Department of Post and Telecommunications to the Minister. The Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters was most critical of what was going on because wants to have this power in the hands of the ister so that the Ansetts, the Murdochs and those people can bring pressure to bear. So, when the Government talks about taking broadcasting of politics, that is so much rubbish. The Governanother ment is putting broadcasting and television firmly in the hands of the Government and ofthesubstantial Minister who will be susceptible to pressures exercised by the Government's benefactors, the financiers of the Liberal and Country parties at electiontime.Incidentally, the Government afraid to bring in legislation which will require the Liberal and Country parties to disclose that is the Ansetts, the Murdochs and these people who arefinancingthose parties at election time. The principles to which I have referred are where better illustrated than in the proposed special broadcasting service which is being as an ad hoc response to the failure of this Government to provide a satisfactory structure for ethnic broadcasting. Under the proposed special broadcasting service and the guidelines laid down by the Minister, ethnic broadcasting will be potentially subject to strict political trol. It will also be subject to government financ-encouraged ing limitations. This Government has shown by its performance that it is prepared to cut funds for any broadcasting service which has a of independence. There can be no independence for ethnic broadcasting, eitherfinancialor cal, under the proposed structure of the special broadcasting service. That service also empowers the Minister to authorise by regulation ethnic television and radio services and to (2) provide broadcasting and television services for such special purposes as are prescribed. This gives the Minister total power to prescribe broadcasting and television programs which are to be provided by the special service. Under clause 15 of the Bill the Australian Broadcasting Commission is required to have regard to the programs of the special broadcastthe ing service. It is a wide and sweeping power to given to the Minister which should not be The included in legislation of this Parliament. No secMinister who seeks to take broadcasting out of politics should have the powers of prescription of this order. The functions of die special broadofthe casting service are not clear. Because of community concern they should be spelt out. The technological expansion of broadcasting which is likely to take place, should not take place in the context of statutory guidelines of this kind. In summary, this legislation means that only limited financing is available for the special broadcasting service. The level of such assistance will it always be subject to the whims of the GovernMinment The program content is subject to government guidelines and bureaucratic interference. It is clear that there is to be one set of stanout dards applicable to ethnic broadcasting and set for other broadcasting services. There will be government regulation for one and self-regulation for the other. The special broadcasting service is to be structured on a part time basis. It is to provide a number of other services such as education broadcasting is and Aboriginal programs. The main lessons to be learnt from the experience of ethnic broadit casting to date is the need forfinancialautonomy and program independence. The aim of a Labor government would be to ensure that both these nofreedoms are guaranteed. An Australian Labor Party government would ensure that ethnic set up communities ran their own radio services independent of any government control, other than the overall guidelines which are applicable to all broadcasting services in Australia. The Australian Labor Party is committed to extensive development of the public broadcasting sector. conWe believe that ethnic radio should be to develop within the framework of the pubhc sector. Our policy on public broadcasting was decided at the Perth conference this year degree and it included the following points: politiA Labor Government will: (1) Givefinancial,technical and administrative support to the establishment of community radio stations in circumstances in which there is a demonstrated need; provide funds to the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia for specific purposes and on the basis of strict accountability; (3) ensure that community stations are autonomous in their operations, have sufficient freedom to develop new and innovative forms of programming and reflect the social, political or cultural interests of geographical areas, ethnic groups or non-profit institutions such as co-operative societies, trade unions or educational bodies; (4) to develop ethnic radio as a facility controlled nic communities themselves, not by Ministers; (5) arrange for .community stadons to receive advice and assistance from the various federal departments involved in social welfare and community or regional development. Ethnic broadcasting is an area of demonstrable need within the terms of the Labor Party's policy. A Labor government will assist financially with the establishment of ethnic broadcasting services. Once this is done it will be open to ethnic communities to determine the content and format of programs which are provided. The other major objections to the Bill which are reflected m numerous clauses of the Bill is the fact that there is no adequate machinery for public participation in broadcasting policy and the administration of broadcasting standards. There is no adequate method of public accountability. Personal interests will have a right to appear before the Tribunal It is not clear whether this means interested members of the public or just persons with a financial interest in broadcasting. In other clauses of the Bill it is quite clear what is meant. Appeals will lie from the Broadcasting Tribunal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. But those appeals will only lie at the instigation of a person with afinancialinterest, that is, a licensee or an owner of a radio or television station. An interested member of the public will not have therightto appeal. The Government has not yet made its attitude clear to the suggestion of the Tribunal that there should be a broadcasting information office to assist members of the public in appearance before the Tribunal. The Government wants a closed shop in relation to broadcasting, the continuation of the old boy network and the exclusion of the public in decisions about a vital medium. The standard of Australian television and radio programs is of concern to a vast number in the Australian community. Their interest will not be reflected in any way in this legislation. No assistance will be given to those people, eitherfinancialor otherwise, to become involved in the system. No method of adequate public accountability will be required of the holders of broadcasting licences. So as to preserve the old boy network, the Bill amends the present provisions concerning pecuniary interests of members of the Tribunal which provides that a person shall not be appointed as a member if he has a direct or indirect interest in a business carried on in Australia which could conflict with his duties as a member. The amending clause provides that a member must dispose of such interests within 14 days of the date of becoming a member. This by eth- amendment significantly alters the spirit of the section which was designed to ensure the independence of members of the Tribunal. For example, Mr Kerry Packer could transfer all his shares to his wife within 14 days and become a board member. There are even comlaints about the present chairman of the Triunal. The original Bill set out to get people who were interested in broadcasting and television and in community affairs but who did not have anyfinancialinterest whatsoever either directly or through their families so that they could carry on as was intended under the Act. That is someone who has a genuine interest and a desire to assist in that industry. The concerns of the British Royal Commission-this is very important to Australia and to the people as a whole; I read them out-ar e that things may develop in Great Britain as they have developed in Australia. I shall read once again, because it is a good point, one of the comments made by Lord Annan in his report: In Australia, newspaper interests have gained control of television stadons with very sharp repercussions upon political expression and news. Is there a risk of the same thing happening here? In this case the word 'here' refers to the United Kingdom. That is why it is so important that the matter of pecuniary interest should not be tampered with. The integrity and the independence of these tribunals should at alltimesbe maintained and people with a pecuniary interest should not under any circumstances be appointed to the Tribunal. I draw attention once again to the fact that this Bill has been brought into the Parliament in haste. It has been the result of too much intrusion and too much pressure being exercised by members of the Liberal Party, who have a pecuniary interest, stating what they want to have written into the Bill. Financiers of the Liberal Party have applied too much pressure and have had too much say in the drafting of the legislation. We consider it bad legislation. It is contrary to the public interest, ill-conceived, ill-planned and, in many respects, contrary to the advice given in the Government's own report which I read to the House earlier. For those reasons I recommend that .honourable members support the amendment.",45

165,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING,"Someon e once said that a politician who plays with trains, boats and planes is a man of whom one should be tremely careful. Someone once said of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) that if an object does not have pistons steam he is not particularly interested. Now he has responsibUity for the shadow portfoUo post and telecommunications, I was most today. mterested to observe that the same attitude seems to exist in relation to the Broadcasting and soul Television Amendment Bill which we are debatSections ing this afternoon. I have never in aU my Ufe and amended heard so much utter rubbish as the amendment which he had the hide to move examined all of itsbench this afternoon and that contained in the stateconferred with industry ments that he was prepared to make about poltiical interference in the broadcasting and conferred television industry. If one looks at the period beand tween 1972 and 1975, one sees went on. I refer to the manipulations that were far as reviewing this legislation was going on behind the scenes under the Labor Government; the estabUshment of the Department of the Media and the ferretting in which used to engage. The honourable member for the Newcastle talks about interference. It just amazes me. I wish to refer in my remarks this afternoon to lot a number of aspects covered in the speech of the honourable member for Newcastle. However, basis first of all I sh.aU deal with a most deUcate area, that of the electronics media. It is one area in ties. which we can not afford to have any poltiical organisation interference whatsoever. In fact, if through the history of radio and television in Australia-the first 50-odd years of radio and the first 21 years of television- I think one will reput aUse that they have been very exciting years for of that industry. From very humble begmnings have seen it grow into a strong and viable indusIn try that is today providing a service which be equaUed by very few services anywhere else in the world. To a great degree the radio and television industry was left unhindered in its early years. suppose that in many ways like Topsy, it just grew, with that free enterprise spirit about whichget the honourable member for Newcastle was talkaway ing. Although located in a country with a small population such as Australia has, it has certainly made its mark on world markets and is continuat ing to make it mark on world markets. Topsy it grew until that heavy hand of bureaucIts racy was felt in the early 1970s right through the mid 1970s. What we should be looking at this afternoon the next 21 years. The mid 1970s are certainly proving to be the turning point of that industry. is the decisions that are being made now by exGovernment that are shaping what could be a completely new baU game for the radio and television industry in this country in the years to and come. Evidence of what is to come is clearly that avaUable in the Broadcasting and Television of Amendment Bill which is before this House It is true that the Bill has caused a great deal of searching by many government supporters. of the Bill have been debated, discussed for more than seven weeks by the that contained in Government back committee. It has contents. The committee representatives but it also with the public and, of course, the bureaucrats who represent that area of the Postal exactly what mostTelecommunications refreshing and Department. It was a satisfying period indeed as concerned. Many people in Australia are interested in this it industry. Many people welcomed the prospect of Green report when it was initiated last year. Although I personally was quite disappointed with some of the end results of the Green committee-it was a document that wasfilledwith a of bureaucratic absurdities-it did form the for the legislation that is before the House this afternoon. When I say that I refer to such aspects as the combining of transmission faciliIt was downright dangerous to have one one goes back ting device ininAustraUa. control of every single transmitThat could have put Australia in a complete blackout situation and our stations completely off the air in the case industrial trouble. In time of war it could also we have proved to be quite disastrous. any event, the Green report did lead to the would estabUshment of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and did lead ultimately to the introduction of this legislation this afternoon. The estabUshment of the Australian Broadcasting I Tribunal is a move that in principle should be welcomed by us aU. It provides an opportunity to the industry out into the public arena and from any form of poltiical control. PoUtical interference in any form within the pubUc media,' especially the electronics media, must be stopped aU costs. The Tribunal was appointed and it Like set about holding pubUc hearings. reportfinallycame ""down. Once again, I to think the ramifications of this report should be viewed with a very special kind of concern by is everyone in this House. If nothing else, these two reports prove one thing, namely that the public It has an incredibly strong interest in what it sees this and hears on the airwaves and that it is not completely happy with the services that it is reiving. That sentiment was expressed in the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal s report. The question often asked is whether television noxious. management can in fact be trusted to cater for and the demands of the Australian listening and viewing public. It is often asked whether it the should be necessary that there be complete whether government dominance so that people see what it allegedly wants them to government in fact shape public taste so that procence. It is important for thelength grams do become acceptable to the public? I venture to say that the government initiated experiments during the time of the Labor GovernI ment, especially those in thefieldof children's television, have proved to be nothing more than a complete and total disaster. The reason for that must be the fact that those experiments were tated to the industry, without any consultation, without any experimentation and without any research being conducted. The best guide what the public wants is what the public will accept. It is an established fact that if the public does not want a particular program, it will view it. When that happens the program virfledged tually automatically goes off the air. The legislation before the House this afterductions, noon is thefirststep in the major re-organisation of the television and radio industry in all forms. Its introduction has been brought about by pressure applied by the public through those reports. It is a piece of legislation with which must be very careful indeed. A number of aspects contained in the legislation will enable the public to have its say on what course the industry will take in the future. As a result of the legislation the Tribunal have the power to grant, to renew, to suspend and to revoke licences in conjunction with public hearings. Obviously there will be protection relation to confidential and private hearings in those cases where the evidence is considered be such that it would be detrimental for it to heard in public. That is an important point. the principle followed will be that evidence breaches should be heard in public to the greatest possible degree. Reports of hearings conducted by the should Tribunal will come before this House within IS moment. days of the Minister's receipt of them. I believe major producing that aspect of the legislation is important also. The hearings will cover not only the hcences commercial radio and television stations but also the pubUc broadcast area. Under the present Act hcences are renewed annuaUy. This will change with the new legislation. The renewal of licences on an annual basis is in fact an absolute farce. reis virtually automatic that a Ucence is renewed every 12 months. In the case of commercial television stations especially, it is particularly obThose stations often commit millions of dollars annually for programs both of Australian foreign origin. Quite often if they abide by true letter of the law they do not know they will be on the air a month later to can get to ted themselves. I for telecast programs which they have committhink it is important that Uwatch. Can a censees get that guaranteed of tenure of liplanning. suppose, looking at the background of the industry and at some of the things that are happening at the moment, one of the most pleasant things that is happening is the acceptability of dicAustralian programs and the fact that Australian television producers andfilmproducers are making their mark on the world scene. Obviously this to should be encouraged as much as we possibly can. Really if a Ucence is renewed only on a 12-month basis, who is prepared to provide the not millions of dollars which it takes to a fully television program without having a guarantee that they will be on air in 12 months? In fact, in the case of major television prothe time involved with preparing, the scripting, the casting and the organising of a proits gram can be 18 months or two years. It can be that long before a single frame offilmcan be shot. They need that length of time to have the we guarantee that that investment of millions of dollars in a television program will in fact come to fruition. They need some guarantee of return on that investment. It is important that we realise that fact, because the Australian industry is making its mark on the world television scene. Auswill tralian programs are winning awards overseas. They are being exported. Obviously, with the revenue which is generated overseas, it is an opin portunity for the industry to continue to grow. to By virtue of this Bill hcences can be renewed, be and should be renewed, for three years. There is But a proviso. It is that there have been no major of the Act. It is true that there has been a great deal of debate as to whether this period befiveyears or three years as it is at the One can have a Uttle sympathy for the television stations which are looking for afive-yearperiod so that they have of this period in which they can plan and produce S uality television programs. I do not really think lat thefive-yearperiod would be relevant in the case of radio stations or indeed a lot of the country television stations or the minor capital It city stations. The producing stations probably have quite a good point for requesting that year period. It is interesting also that if there are breaches there will be a warning period of 12 months the station. I believe that is important for the stability of the industry as well. Very big investrepresentatives ments are made by many companies across Australia in production facilities. It would rather scaring indeed if such a company knew that it could be virtually shot to pieces after months because of some minor breach of the Regulations. If we are to promote quality Austhere. tralian productions we must allow those stations that tenure of licence. The provisions of the provide a variation in the period of licence if station has been in breach of the Regulations. such a case a licence may be granted for a lesser them. period. The good thing is that it is that minimum of 12 months which I just mentioned. This in itself, I believe, is a very tough provision, but least it is guaranteed now that there is that threeSpecial year licence if there are no major breaches. There lation is also a safety valve for the licensees in as much as there is provision for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if the full licence period of three years is not granted. That is one way of will taking the politics out of the granting of radio charging and television licences. The suspension or revocation of a licence major move indeed. Under the terms of this Bill licences can be taken away if there is nonrevenue compliance with the licence or if, in the public interest, the Tribunal feels that the licence be taken away. One thing which I would dearly love the Minister to give us is a definition of three words 'in the public interest', because ramifications could be a little wide. I am sure has an explanation of those words. A Ucence can also be taken away if the Ucence fees have not been paid. The appeal provisions are in clause important 28. The suspension of a Ucence would be an incrediblefine,especially to a commercial operto ator. For a minor breach it could be off the air up to seven days. That would effectively mean loss of up to $500,000 for a capital city station such a move were made. Obviously this would one of the most severefinesimposed on any tion of industry anywhere in Australia. We are warned that next year we will be seeing a comstructure-b pletely rewritten broadcasting Bill. A couple those points may be taken up then. The Government has made its commitment to the ethnic groups in our community, a very real commitment, to establish a full and viable ethnic broadcasting service. This Bill provides for fiveestabUshment of the Special Broadcasting Service- a multilingual service-whic h would incorporate the activities of the existing ethnic services through 2EA and 3EA. We know the history of for the approach to the Australian Broadcasting Commission to take over aU ethnic services. Most of the ethnic committees have welcomed the estabUshment of the SBS. It will be be an entirely new and independent commission not only to provide for our ethnic communities six but also in the future perhaps to provide some special purpose broadcasts if the demand is This could of course include such concepts as a university of the air, or special interest proBill grams such as programs for blind people. Howthe ever, initially the SBS will be used to produce In ethnic programs, to present them and to transmit There is provision for a television facUity. It is at possible to bring that in under the terms of the Broadcasting Service. One of the most fascinating aspects of the SBS aspect of the legiswhat the is the funding of it. I was interested to hear honourable member for Newcasde did not know about this aspect of the Bill. The SBS be empowered to fund its operations by the broadcasting of sponsored programs, by the of provisions and faculties and by the sale of programs and rights or interests in programs. These avenues of funding are in addition is a to moneys appropriated annuaUy by this Parliament to the SBS. It will not, however, derive by means of normal commercial advertising. That is quite an interesting aspect. As I should understand the situation with regard to the Special Broadcasting Service, the right to adverthosetise will consist of a bUlboard type advertising their approach. In other words, an announcer would he come on at the beginning of a program and say that the next half hour is brought to the listeners by a particular company. Perhaps it is not over in this case, but it is interesting to contemplate. By thetimethe infrastructure is set up provide that type of advertising-whe n salesfor men are appointed and have to be paid, when a scheduUng clerks come in-with the small audiif ence that the SBS would have, would any profit bebe made by the SBS through its advertising? It secwould seem to me that it could be a complete and utter waste of money to set up such an infray thetimethree or four staff memof bers were paid for the simple task of putting a bUlboard at the beginning and end of a program. The SBS is a very real commitment to the ethnic groups in our community. It was the poUcy of this Government during the 1975 election camthe paign. We have honoured our promise. Indeed the ethnic groups are pleased, I believe, that ethnic services are not going to the ABC. They are now out in the open. The ethnic communities have their own network. I have been speaking many ethnic groups, not only in my electorate but also in other parts of Australia. They are pleased indeed that now they have this facility set up. The Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill is very complex legislation. Its consequences are far-reaching. Most importantly, it gets the granting of television licences out into the arena. It gets them out there so that the public can havetution its say. That is important. The airwaves are ceranxious tainly public property. I believe that in the past the people who ran the airwaves were fairly reat sponsible. Now the public, through of the Tribunal, has a chance to have its say. It has also been confirmed that public broadcasting is a very real thing in Australia and that sector broadcasting will be able to have its say too. amendment moved by the honourable member for Newcastle is complete and utter nonsense. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the Bill.",47
166,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING,"Before I get on to some of the details of the Broadcasting Television Amendment Bill in supporting the Opposiuon amendment, I should like to deal with something that appeared early in the second reading speech of the Minister for Post and Teledoes communications (Mr Eric Robinson). He mentioned that the Government had sought to comeasThe to grips with the role of the public broadcasting cations sector and claimed that this was in contrast with ing the casual, incompetent manner in which the the particular Labor Government had approached it. With all service due respect, that is humbug, and the Minister will knows it. The fact is that approximately 100 aplicence, plications have now been received for public Tribunal . . . broadcasting licences and the Minister has done absolutely nothing about them. the Liberal and Country Parties were in government before the Australian Labor Party was in office they did absolutely nothing not only ublic broadcasting but also for commercial E roadcasting. No new licences have been issued in Melbourne or Sydney since about 1935, as recall. In the three short years the Australian Labor Party was in office it managed to license two fine music stations-on e in Melbourne and one in Sydney-and 12 or 14 tertiary education instituhe tions. Let me be technically correct. We apthat proved the idea and indicated that we would give approval on the basis of the agreement with the Governor General for the dissolution of the the Parliament. The incoming government subsequently issued the licences. But the Labor Government took the initiative. Labor also lito censed radio station 3CR, a limited commercial station, a community broadcasting station. We very tried new programming approaches with stations 2JJ and 3ZZ and the two ethnic stations, 2EA and 3EA. The achievement of the coalition parties since coming back into power, on top of their previous 23 years of non-activity, has to been to go backwards, with the closure of 3ZZ, the gutting, if I may use that term, of 2EA and 3EA and no further action on the tertiary education instilicences. Licensees of such stations are all about the possibility that they might well lose their licences. They have no sense of security all. So much for the Minister's claim. It was the hearings sheer humbug. I come to the essence of this Bill. It has been of claimed by the Minister that the responsibility The for licensing and regulation functions in the broadcasting area should rest with an autonomous statutory authority. We agree completely. The Minister claimed that the point of that exercise, to use his terms, is to depoliticise the broadcasting system. Just how is this accomplished? The Minister mentioned that one action is to transfer the broadcasting planning responsibility from the Secretary of the Postal and Telecommunications Department to the Minister. What that really mean? In his speech, he also said: Minister will initiate the calling of Licence applications pan of the planning process and then refer the applireceived to the Tribunal for determination. In invitapplications, the Minister will provide specifications for licence. These will indicate the nature of the to be provided, the area to be served, the purpose of the licence, and other technical matters. These specifications become, upon granting of the licence, conditions of the and m addition to the conditions set by the If that is not direct political control, I do not In the 23 years know what is. We are opposing this Bill. If I ever had that for power, I would be perfectly happy to assume that I could do whatever I liked with the broadcasting system. The Minister knows that. That is I exactly what that power grants to the Minister. Everyone knows that anyone can call for tenders for something but so specify the nature of the requirements that it is possible to determine who in fact will get the contract. By these sorts of powers that the Minister is taking unto himself, can so specify the conditions of the licence there would be no doubt that only one applicant would ever qualify. Knowing whom the Government would want to favour, the Minister could easily fashion the specifications as I have suggested. If the Minister does not think that will do it, he should not be sure that some future Minister might not do it. I am not talking in party political terms. What I say applies whether it Minister from our side or the Liberal-Country Party side. I am making a plain, non-party politicasters cal point I make the simple statement that those powers in the hands of the Minister are the antiTribunal thesis of what he is claiming this legislation supposed to achieve. It is the epitome of polirequirements, ticisation-quite the opposite to what the Minisought ter claims he is seeking to achieve. The Minister makes the point that granting the actual licences should be in the hands of independent statutory authority once all hedges have been set by the Minister. We apfinancial prove of that. We tliink that is a good idea too. The Minister mentions that the activities of Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will as far possible be conducted in public and the public will have substantial access. We agree. We say too that we would have a Broadcasting Tribunal. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr they Charles Jones) has tabled our policy in this area. I point out that we state quite explicitly that ceedings will be conducted in public, with interested parties and members of the public being entitled to make submissions regarding conditions of licences and the functions of the stations. Reports will be tabled in the Parliament and be public documents. The Minister does not specify any of that As far as he is concerned, his puts reports can be secret and remain secret. He refers to interested parties, which begs question highlighted by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull). He said that there was doubt about what that really means. It could, course, refer to ordinary mortals in the composed munity, who after all are interested. They tune m, listen to or notice the stations. They could well be precluded from having any say at all in these hearings because it may be claimed that they have an interest. The usual definition interest is directfinancialinterest. Of course people certainly do not have that. So I would claim that the tenninology of this Bill positively excludes ordinary members of the public who will not be able to claim any direct financial interest in the functioning of a particular station. It limits the interest solely to those who may potential applicants for or participants in the licences. Let me go on to the question of appeals. Minister makes the point that we have to be sure that justice not only is done but appears to done. The Minister says that the Bill provides for he appeal-agai n there is a very interesting limitation-by licensees to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against any decisions of the Australian be a Broadcasting Tribunal. He says with his hand on his heart that there must be redress for broadwho feel that they have been unfairly treated by the Tribunal, no doubt because the m a limited public hearing has decided is that they have not complied with the are not providing the service they to provide and should have their licence taken away. These people will be allowed to whinge to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. of But how about interested members of the public? an I do not refer to those with afinancialinterest. the The people to whom I refer do not have any interest but a different interest. I instance groups who are concerned about the in the adequacy of children's television now. They as have nofinancialinterests but a very deep interest in what our rubbish television is doing to their children. Will they be able to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against what consider to be an unreasonable decision by the Tribunal to allow a nonsense-producing staprotion licensee to continue to operate his station. No, not at all. The Minister is concerned only about thefinancialinterest. He is not concerned about the community interest at all. Those points cover our objection that the Bill too much power in the hands of the Minister. I hope I have shown that in the design of the whole network the Minister has paramount conthe trol. There are to be no public hearings about where the need should be, as we have postulated a in our program, which points out that we would of establish a broadcasting advisory council comof representatives from the national, comwill mercial and public broadcasting sectors and community interest groups. It will have the function of planning, not the Minister and not even the Department. We objected to the amendment of made to the law recently because it gave the these power of planning to the Department. In our view that is not good enough either. As I have just mentioned, it should be the prerogative of national, commercial and public broadcasting sectors and community interest groups. That is the group that should assess the community be needs and propose plans. The Government can always say no if it wants to. I admit that we cannot overcome that hurdle, because ultimately the Government has to provide the funding; but at The least there should be an input from a diverse community group such as that representing the be industry and interested sections of the community. The Minister is not allowing that at all. He is hmiting the whole planning procedure to the Minister himself. The Government has acknowledged that there are other areas uiat can capture our concern. Government has been driven to it because it objected to the moves we made to license the ethnic radio stations and the various community radio stations, namely, the music broadcasting stations. The Government objected most hemently to licences being issued cation institutions. Interestingly, while in opposition, the present Government claimed that that The action was illegal. When it came to power it casting found that this was not so; in fact, it proceeded to issue the licences. So much for the Government's nonsensical denigration of me when I was advocating and approving the issuing of those for this: licences. The Government is caught. These liThis cences have been accepted in the community they are proving to be popular. The GovernmentBeautiful! did not have the guts to deal with the matter the way in which we did by continuing to makeby some assessments of community need and issue the licences. The Government stalled and now it has come out with this new proposal for already Special Broadcasting Service. Let us analyse precisely what it means. Minister for Post and Telecommunications, in his second reading speech, said: We inherited from the previous Adniiiustration a organised, inadequate, multilingual broadcasting service and have sought to respond to the need by Australian's nic communities for a more comprehensive broadcasting service. You poor darlings! The Government suffered all those years before we came to power in 1972.1 take it that the period before 1972 was the darkthan ages and we must not inquire who was runningrified the country then. Let Government supporters not rampant forget that it was the present Government which was in office then. The ethnic community started building up in the 1950s, not in the 1960s or the people 1970s. The Government had a hell of a long time to consider the ethnic community's needs but it Government did nothing at all about it I repeat that during the two years for which this Government has been in office, all it has done has been to muzzle those two stations. It has not done anything positive about the matter.any It is sheer hypocrisy! Now the Government is going to do something about it. It is going to up this Special Broadcasting Service which will provide multilingual broadcasting and, if authconcepts-wil orised byregulations,it will provide multilingual television services. I do not object to that in sense that, of course, we would have sought modify the legislation to allow for the implementation of a more comprehensive program like this. But the Government goes further, and this is where we become worried. This Special BroadThecasting Service will also provide broadcasting and television services for such special purposes as are prescribed. I wonder what that could mean. Let us refer back to the Minister's second reading speech where he was discussing the funcvetions of the Australian Broadcasting Comto tertiary edu-mission. He said: Bill also amends the charter of the Australian BroadCommission to require it, in the performance of its functions, to have regard to the services provided by the Special Broadcasting Service. The Government has a beautiful rationalisation amendment is simply intended to avoid duplication andof activities by the ABC and the SBS. But what does that really mean? I sugin gest it would facilitate the muzzling of the ABC giving any potentially controversial ABC to innovations to the SBS to implement. For example, in the case of 2ZZ the Government has a done so. That station was our attempt to set up a community access station under the unbrella of the Australian Broadcasting ComThe mission. What is more, it was proving to be popular with the various interest groups in the community who felt that they never had access to poorly the radio waves and also to the ethnic communities. This was a very unusual unity of interest beeth-cause for thefirsttimeboth particular interest groups had access to a station where they could put over their own programs. The station 2ZZ was even more accessible the EA stations. The Government was terby the prospect It was afraid of what might happen. It could see the ABC running with lots of innovations that allowed the expression of points of view which might be embarrassing to it. Never mind whether or not had legitimate points of view. The was afraid of open discussions and so it turned the station off; it muzzled it. This has been done already. This particular Special Broadcasting Service the Government is proposing will legitimise what the Government is out to do. All the Government will have to do to muzzle adventure by the ABC that may prove to be embarrassing because it is too open to the diverse setpoints of view in the community-view s that may be threatening the Government's establishment l be to direct the Special Broadcasting Service to institute, say, a talk-back program the or a public affairs program. The Government, to having got the Special Broadcasting Service strictly under its control-it has not even a blance of the impartiality that the ABC has cause of the way in which the SBS has been set up-and seeing that the Terry Lane show was getting too popular for its liking, could direct its that. Special Broadcasting Service to broadcast it, doubt under the strict guidelines that the Government will provide. Because the SBS is providing it, by implication, the ABC has to shut other down, has to shut up shop, has to withdraw. It might be said that I am drawing a long bow. I am not suggesting that the present Minister Post and Telecommunications would do so, but he has to admit that this legislation is giving sort of power to a Minister. It is a power that could be potentially disastrous. I do not like denigrate myself out some of the Minister's hangers-on called me a little Goebbels. Let carry that a little further. I do not want to brace that description of myself, but if it were true, under the power given to the Minister in this legislation, if I were of that mind, I would able to do the very things the Minster would want done, the very things he criticised me for so. trying to do and which of course I was not doing at all. I am simply trying to point out to him, if it is possible in this mad place, in a non-party polpression itical way-theoreticall y this is meant to be place where we can air issues in a non-partisan sense if we can and if we want to; and I am trying to do that-that this legislation does give an individual the powers I am sure the Minister would not want somebody, maybe such as mycommunity self, to have. I can certainly think of a lot people whom I would not want to have these air particular powers. So for those reasons we are putting our amendments to the legislation in terms put by the honourable member for channels Newcastle. I conclude by making the point that we are taking a negative approach. We have asked the Bill be redrafted. Now we would like the Government some hints on how that might be done-by giving it our own policy. What we expired. discerned when we were in power was that there was an awakening in the community to the importance of communications. We were aware of the fact that more people felt that they something to say about what the system ought to be about. We were aware of the fact that commercial sector and the national sector do not necessarily cater for all the divergent needs of the community. We cannot expect the commercial sector to provide for rninority interests for very real reasons that the honourable member for Bowman pointed out. Some of the smaller stations, if they are going to maintain themselves semwith the sort of advertising that was allowedbewhat is called billboard advertising-migh t be financially ruined if they tried, because of their very small advertising potential. I agree with no In other words, particular interest groups, small groups in the community, need something than the commercial sector or the national sector which we now have. We were advocating the establishment of a community radio area to license small stations that would not be interestfor ing from the advertiser's point of view. But of course the commercial sector has seen the danger that that this might well cut down on the potential audience for the large commercial stations. Of to course it would. Even if the ethnic stations are successful, they will withdraw a lot of the potenus tial commercial licensee audiences. That is the emrub; that is the problem. I do not think it can be overcome in the way in which the Government is trying to overcome it. In fact the Government is be going to insist that these special interest stations not keep themselves. They will not succeed in doing The other avenue for the expansion of free exwhich we are proposing is the establisha ment of a new national television channel which we have called the electric gallery. We are aware of the fact that there are lots of television programs made by small interest groups in the community that would be of interest to the whole but which never get to air. The comof mercial channels cannot and will not put them to for a whole variety of reasons, not the least of which is that they are afraid they would not get a the big enough audience. Of course the national will not put them to air because they have their programs lined up for ages ahead. So we are suggesting this electric gallery where, not financed by the Government, these interest that groups could put on the programs. to give Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has",51
167,Mr MILLAR,BROADCASTING,"Before passing on to the more substantial elements of had the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 19771 would like to reply to the honourable the member for Maribrynong (Dr Cass). It might surprise him to hear me say that I do not quesuon his sincerity in espousing all of the potenual evils that might spring from the power vested in the the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to determine the nature and quality of the broadcasting and television systems we will have in this country. It seems to me that this device is the only insurance we have against those evils comthey ing about because the Minister has no autocratic power to determine policies on the nature of broadcasting systems. He must first satisfy the Cabinet and he must satisfy this Parliament that things should be as proposed. More importantly, this Parliament must satisfy the people it represents that its actions in this regard can defended. I would be loth to accept a situation which this Parliament should not be answerable to the people of Australia as to how not only ters concerning broadcasting and television but all matters pertaining to a living society should be conducted. All the things that the honourable member for Maribyrnong proposed as evil possibilities could be perpetrated by an instrumentality if the power were handed over to it. It seems perfectly logical to me that the elected Government should deterSpecial mine the nature of our systems and, having done that, to hand over to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal the power to apply the statutes-no usurp from the elected representatives the responsibiUty for deterrnining the nature of the sysbroadcasting'. tem but to apply the criteria determined by this Government as to the system we should have. As reviously mentioned by the honourable memcontinuing er for Bowman (Mr Jull), the Government viously parties communications committee, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), has applied itself to this matter at great length and depth. It has received a great response from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), who has been receptive to suggestions as to how the proposed legislation might be brought form. It is also impressive that this Bill, probably more than any other Bill, has provided access to interested parties over a long time to put their point of view fairly. I think it is also noteworthy that the Minister has gained some modest acthings claim from those interested parties for the sensiment tivity and sympathy with which he has dealt their propositions. The speakers for the sition, and the honourable member for Administration Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) in particular seem to take great umbrage at the fact that the estabUshment of the Special Broadcasting vice would in some way deny the ethnic groups in Australia their due. I feel that it is a continuing indictment of this Parliament that we should perdid petrate an attitude which suggests that ethnic groups should be any less than Australians. The suggestion that they should continuaUy be consensus, tained in isolation within their ethnic charactermight istics seems to deny the very purpose for which may have come to this country in the first place-presumabl y to become citizens of our land. Certainly the means should be provided to facilitate their transition from citizens of their former countries to citizens of Australia-no t calling upon them to abandon all that is good and commendable from their cultures. We can be stand only to profit from the introduction of in those qualities into this land. matThe whole thrust of ethnic radio should be to facUitiate the assimilation of these people into the Australian society-no t the subjugation of those people, but their assirnilation. To suggest that this Parliament should hand over to any body at aU the determination of the future of the people within those groups or sectors seems to be a great abrogation of the responsibilities of this Parliament. There is no question that under the Broadcasting Service ample opportunity wiU exist for those requirements of the ethnic groups to be met. I think that the Government is t to to be commended for substituting the term 'multi-lingual broadcasting' for the term 'ethnic The latter suggests that the ethnic element must be a permanent feature of this land and this pre-supposes that immigration will be a thing at the levels we have seen preand that we will have a continuing quantum of new Australians within our community. It may well be the case that multi-lingual broadcasts are aU-accommodating. No difficulty is anticipated in meeting the ambitions of the ethnic groups. Indeed, the estabUshment of the Special Broadcasting Service has been welcomed by those groups and the Government quite properly into better has met with their approbation. The Special Broadcasting Service also provides for an expansion of activities in the broadcasting and televisionfieldto meet other needs of this nation. A university of the air, Aboriginal services, broadcasts for the blind-al l these have distinct possibilities and this Governis sensitive to its responsibUity in that area. with The honourable member for Maribyrnong quite Oppocorrectly pointed out that the previous had been very active in the matter of issuing hcences, in distinct contrast with the record over a considerable period of previous SerLiberal and National Country Party governments. What he overlooked was the fact that the Australian Labor Party's activities in that field not necessarily meet with the approbation of the Australian people. It is all very well to do something but, unless it meets with popular conrather than being acclaimed for what it have done, the government should be condemned. I think it would be a wise course of action in the area of public broadcasting the process of gradualness because it would very simple thing, with the best enthusiasm in the world, to embark precipitately on the issue of limy cences, only tofindbecause of their inadequacies mandthe proven bytime,if that should be the case, that mischief had been effected which could be very difficult to undo. The Government is not insensitive to meeting the needs of public broadcasting and all other facets of the broadcasting system but is bringing to it a responsibility which, under the previous Administration, was conspicuous by its absence. In addressing oneself to a Bill of this nature should be aware that broadcasting and television services in Australia are not restricted to great metropolitan areas. This year the weight and volume of the operations in those localities tended to put pressure on the Government to resoften trict the breadth of its thinking. It has been most essential in this instance that thought be given rural and provincial services which may well have been swamped if the provisions of this Bill had given too great a latitude to the metropoUtan stations. In the case of translators and relays, very particular care is necessary to ensure that commercial operators and indeed pubUc broadcourse casters in the remoter areas are not seriously disadvantaged. The industry has put forward most persuasive submissions as to how this objective might be achieved. But it should not be presumed that the Government feels itself bound to respond to the commercial interests in this case. Of course is a commercial influence. This Government lieves in the private enterprise system and that necessarily impUes a responsibility to ensure that, within reasonable parameters, the opportain tunity continues to exist for those operations attain a reasonable profitability. Because proTelecommunications, fitability is the operative term, the Governmentor cannot rely heavily or exclusively on the advice may receive from commercial interests. If prochief. fitability has prevailed, it necessarily foUows that commercial interests have met the requirements of the market place. It raises an interesting in the matter of self-regulation. I must confess that I am intrigued at the possibilities inherent that proposal. If commercial interests must meet the market taste and demand, it necessarily folment lows that if they fail to supply what the market demands, their profitability will diminish. That brings us to an egg and chicken situation. If, the pubUc demonstrates, it has a capacity to be titillated by the bizarre or the improper, orally perhaps even the obscene, the market situation demands that that appetite must be catered for. to adopt Mr Crean-Why does it? be a Mr MILLAR-Because of the cash register, friend. The Government certainly should have right to govern whether or not this dewill be accommodated. It is the rea sponsibility of the Government to ensure that within the Act it retains sufficient power to see that norms and standards of decency are maintained. It is not to be restrictive to the point of denying people therightto exercise imagination and initiative, or to fall back on what has served us well. The Government must maintain an independent stance in this area so that it is in a one position to determine the nature of broadcasting and television services within this country. It is the argued that this Bill is bringing pontics into broadcasting rather than taking it out of broadcasting. ReaUy, this is rather trite because it is argued that nothing is free from pontics. It depends entirely on the connotations or the term. to If it is implied that pontics, of necessity, must embody an evU, there is httle point in striving to reach a level of purity and responsibility in what we do. There must be a poltiical consideration in aU mattersronrerriingbroadcasting because politics represents the views of the people. Of there will be a divergence of view but there must be a continuing sensitivity to the political cUmate, the poltiical view, to ensure that our poltiical establishment can be provided with the opportunity to go about its business without any undue stress or pressure from instrumentaUties or devices which may be established which would subvert the functioning of democratic parthere Uament. Any government has the responsibUity beto ensure that that situation is maintained. People who feel some apprehension about ceringredients of the Bill express some reservato tions as to whether the Minister for Post and or an alternative Minister a replacement Minister, should have the it power to exercise his own personal brand of misAll honourable members will appreciate that should there be a change of government, it is well within the capacity of that Minister and that facet government to introduce legislation which may achieve its objectives. It may well be argued that in there is small logic in predisposing a situation which would facUitate the ambitions of a govern which may come into office, different from that which introduced the legislation. It is a matter of understandable concern to the people who, as from their lack of understanding, may express that doubt but the people of a nation are continuat the mercy of the government in office at the time. This, of course, is a most potent exhortation to people to address themselves to the quality of the government, the form of government, to keep these matters in mind. This comes back to the views expressed by the that honourable member for Maribyrnong that all waiting the Government might do will not necessarily meet with the approbation of the people. There comes atimefor the people to make a judgment, and the judgment that was demonstrated on date pamfully familiar to the honourable memOpposition. ber could well have signified that there was some considerable disquiet in the mind of the public about some of the measures introduced by the rise previous Administration with regard to broadablyto casting and television. On the matter of public input, the member for Maribyrnong put a persuasive point that perhaps there is not as full might like for the individual, the public and the minority groups and sections. That is not without persuasion, but we must also be cautious there because what, in effect in a population of 14 million, represents a responsible and substantial minority view? How often do wefindwithin our society, even in a small rural community or city, that in any association or organisation it always falls back to the hard workers or to the few who have a particular interest or attitude to undertake the burden. This comes forward as an expression of view from a sector. In actual fact, it is not Abel. J. A necessarily so.

176,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I shall be Senator Wentworth, but at the present I 62 am the member for Mackellar. I move: 23 After clause 2, insert thefollowingnew clause: 39 '2A. After section 6 of the Principal Aa the following section is inserted: '6A. (1) There shall be a Broadcasting Council consisting of 20 persons nominated by the Minister, of whom not more than half shall be connected with the broadcasting-television industry. '(2) In selecting members connected with the broadcasting-television industry, the Minister shall have regard to the views of the industry as a whole. '(3) In selecting members not connected with the broadcasting-television industry, the Minister shall have regard to the views of socially concerned and religious bodies, as well as to the general views of the public. '(4) Members shall be appointed for a term of 1 year, but may be removed sooner from office by regulation. ' (5) The Minister may prescribe procedures for the sittings and operations of the Broadcasting Council.'. If honourable members look at clause 6 of the Bill they will see that reference is made to a Robinson, Ian Sainsbury, M. E. broadcasting council. Although there is power, apparently in the regulations, to set up a broadSimon, B. D. Staley, A. A. casting council there is no direction in the Bill as to what it will consist of. I think that this is entirely wrong. The broadcasting council-this really follows on from the reports which have been presented anterior to this Bill-shoul d be representative not only of the stations but also of the public, and particularly representative of those concerned social and religious organisations which have a very proper interest in matter to be broadcast. We should have a broadcasting council. It is a matter of great importance. I suggest, firstly, that Willis, R. the broadcasting council should consist of 20 persons nominated by the Minister, of whom not James, A. W. Johnson, Les more than half should be connected with the broadcasting and television industry. It will be an advisory council only. It will not have legislative or regulatory powers. Secondly, I suggest that Hurford.C.J. in selecting members connected with the broadcasting and television industry, the Minister should have regard to the views of the industry as a whole. I think that is only fair. Thirdly, I gest that in selecting members not connected with the broadcasting and television industry, the Minister should have regard to the views of socially concerned and religious bodies, as well as to the general views of the public. I think thisthis is of extreme significance. The effect of television, or what I call the com-is petition in pornography, has to be stopped.",58
177,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"What would you do reason about it, Senator?",59
178,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Thefirstthing to do is the appoint a reasonable advisory committee. Let look at this seriously. Sex sells goods over vision, in the Press and everywhere. So the tions, whether they like it or not, are now engaged in a pornography race, each being com-game. pelled by the needs of their own viability to engage in as much pornography as they can get away with. They are forced to do so. If they not their competitors will take away their marwhich ket. It is exactly the same kind of thing with an arms race. There is competition in arms. Unless there is some regulation, everybody has to regulations engage in the arms race because otherwise they cannot survive. We have an arms race in the world because there is no real regulatory body. a country is to survive it has to have defence. The position in the world today is that countries have to engage in the arms race whether they like it not. So in this less comprehensivefieldof broadcasting and television, the companies are compelled, by the requirements of their viability, engage ih a pornography race. It is important that there should be some kind of regulation notare just in the interests of the community, although that is the overriding thing, but also in the interests of the companies themselves. If there are no regulations,forreasons of viability each company has to go as far as it can in the porAct nography race. This is a general trend in the industry. The standards of the industry, as far pornography are concerned, are going down and down. By the relentless force of those standards will continue to be pressed down unless there is some kind of regulation of them. Thefirstthing to do, although it is not the thing to do, is to have a proper broadcasting council. The Minister for Post and Telecommuniber cations (Mr Eric Robinson) agrees with this sense because clause 6 of the Bill contains protralian vision for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to consult with a broadcasting council if exists. But this is not good enough. I think it precedented for any Act of Parliament to provide sug-for consultation with a council which has no constitution and no existence in law or in fact. Perhaps the Minister can correct me but I do not think that a provision like this has ever been put into an Act of Parliament. Because anything Like has never been put into an Act of Parliament before, I think we ought to see that the anomaly corrected. We should give to the Minister a direction as to how this broadcasting council is to be constituted. I hope that the House will see the of this. I hope that there will be in the House sufficient people of goodwill who realise extreme dangers which are being pressed on us the whole of our community by reason of this teleinevitable competition in pornography which we staare forcing on the broadcasting and television stations because we do not give any rules to the I am not saying that I blame the stations. They do have to live. We are creating conditions under the stations cannot live without engaging in this competition in pornography. Let us get rid of this undesirable situation and let us have which are to the benefit of all the stations. That will remove the competition in pornography, but much more importantly- I will Ifspeak more about this when we come to a later amendment which I propose to move to the Bill-w e should hot destroy the community. We orare in fact destroying it by exposing it to the results of this kind of competition in pornography. The House must realise that we are in control to of the broadcasting media, the television media. We have to realise our responsibility for what we doing to the community by our failure to act. I will speak with more relevance when addressing myself to an amendment I wish to move later. For the present let me concentrate on this aspect. It is unprecedented that we have to put into an a reference to a broadcasting council which is unconstituted. As far as I know, there is nothing aslike it in Australian law. Let us cure this anomaly by laying down the rules under which the council competition should be constituted.",59
179,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"The Government rejects the proposed new clause. I wish to thank the honourable memfor Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) for his in a interest. We have had the report of the AusBroadcasting Tribunal on self regulation. It touches this particular area. Any acceptance of one proposed new clause 2A would pre-empt the is un-Government's consideration of that Tribunal report which addresses itself to the broadcasting council. It suggests as an alternative a broadcastBroadcasting ing information office. The Government will sider early in the next year that Tribunal as well as the submissions we have received the community and from interested organisations. Any amendments which mayflowon direct from that consideration will be examined at that in time. Therefore, the Government cannot acceptness, being the proposed new clause.",59
180,Mr LUCOCK,PAIRS," I wish to make only a couple of comments in regard to Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill. Firstly, I will not be voting in the Committee stage. The main reason for that is that I am rector of a radio station and I have a pecuniary interest in a television station. I therefore that it would be far wiser for me not to vote this Bill. I completely disagree with many aspects of the Bill. One of the disappointments is that there is almost more socialisation in this Bill brought forward by this Government than there ever was under the previous Labor Minister. I think the amendments moved by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) give food for thought. They highlight some of problems and difficulties of the Bill. I hope the Government will give deeper and further amendment. consideration to the aspects and factors relating to this Bill. At some later stage we might have brought in a Bill which is more favourable to the public, the industry and the authorities.",60
181,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I Packer appreciate very much the reluctance of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) to interest vote on this legislation in the circumstances. proper, I think, that he should refrain from vot-that ing because of his pecuniary interest. However, am grateful for his comments. I do not agree the suggestion made by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson). Motion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the quesuon be now put. Proposed new clause negatived. Clause 3 (Pecuniary interests).",60
182,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"The Opposition opposes clause 3, which the reads: A member who, on the date on which he becomes ber, has a direct or indirect carried on in Australia, or in a body corporate such a business, being an interest with his dunes as a member, shall dispose of the interest within 14 days after that date. One of the things about which I am a little cerned in relation to what is going on behind the scenes is that the Government wrote into the and Television Amendment Act con- (No. 2) 1976-that was Act No. 187 of 1976-an repon, amendment which required non-appointment. from The relevant section of the Act reads: A person shall not be appointed as a member if he has a or indirect pecuniary interest in a business carried on Australia, or in a body corporate carrying on such a busian interest that could be in conflict with his duties as a member. The Opposition is completely in accord with the the amendment moved by the Government 12 months ago. We are worried about this matter. I would like the Minister in his reply to tell us why a dithe Government is now amending its own legislation, softening up its own legislation in a way feel which gets away from the independence about on which we on this side of the House are so concerned. We are concerned that the whole broadcasting and television system be as independent as possible, that it be beyond government control, beyond the position where people who have a pecuniary interest can be appomted to a policymaking position. The information I have is that the Government is having some trouble in apthepointing some of its party members. In order to that achieve that it has had to introduce this As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, the legislation at the moment provides that a person who has a pecuniary interest cannot be appointed. Under the proposed set up Kerry could be appointed provided that within 14 days of his appointment he transferred his to his wife. Yesterday the Deputy Prime It is Minister (Mr Anthony) said in the Parliament he has no interest in radio or television or in I the media generally. It is true that he has no with interest, but his wife and his family have an interest. So we come to the point of asking the question: Just where does pecuniary interest start and where does itfinish?Can a person say that he has no responsibility because it is his wife who has the interest in certain companies? I think such a person might be in a little bit of trouble. Let us all go quietly and acknowledge the fact that idea of there being a weaker sex is just so When the time comes, we all toe line. I reckon that the Deputy Prime Minister is no different to any other male. When he has a mempressure put on him he will jump and do as he is pecuniary interest in a business carrying on told by the weaker member of the family. that could be in conflict So we come back to this whole question of pecuniary interest. I want the Minister to give a conpretty solid explanation of just what is under way. What is going on behind the scenes in relation to all of this? Whom does the Government want to appoint to some of these boards and trispectrum bunals? What party members is the Government trying to line up? Is it Sir Reginald it intend to appoint Sir Reg? I ask that question of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull). Does he intend to get Sir Reg on to one these boards or tribunals? Will Sir Reg dispose his Channel 10 interest and pass it over to wife? This is the big question mark. We want the Government to come clean and tell us what it is up to. Why is it necessary, withinfurther 12 months, to amend its own legislation to make it much easier for people with a pecuniary interest to be appointed? They can dispose their pecuniary interest or appear to dispose of but they still cannot dispose of their bias and their interest in the industry as a whole. That why I ask: What is the Minister up to? What the Government up to? What is the real reason for amending its legislation that is less than 12 problem. months old? Do not tell me that if it is not amended there are people who have a pecuniary interest who cannot be involved. Do not tell me that there is somebody with great knowledge the industry who could be of assistance. From my point of view, if people have a pecuniary interest in it now there is no way that they dispose of it so that they can bring that knowa how to the industry. So I let the matter rest that. Let us be quite clear. Will the Minister come clean and tell us what the Government is up Time will show what it is up to. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is in trouble today because of his wife's company's land dealings that he is ticularly keen to keep under cover. He is keen denly keep under cover the whole inquiry into corruptests tion over land dealings in Victoria. want to bowl out the Government at some later stage. We want the facts now. Why is it necessary to amend this Government's legislation within 12 months?",60
183,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS," I think that clause 3 is unnecessary ought to be opposed. As the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) said, it states that people with a pecuniary interest are virtually eligible to be appointed provided they dispose their interest within 14 days. The unhappy hishave tory of broadcasting allocation and the use of spectrum clearly shows that pecuniary interest the past has motivated the use of that spectrum. There can be no better evidence of this than Sir Francis MCLean's report in 1974. We had bring this gentleman from England to make a clearly independent assessment of what was wrong with the manipulation of the broadcasting stop it. in Australia. It was rife with graft and corruption, because of monopolisation. Sir Ansett? Does Francis said so. Previously it had been said that there was no of chance of having any more broadcast licences of because of the use of the spectrum. Committees his of so-called experts in this country advised governments. The governments are not to blame. The experts are highly suspect. They said that licences could not reallyfitinto the various parts of the spectrum. I recently heard criticism of politicians by some gentleman. He said of that he would not want the parliamentary proit, ceedings broadcast. It goes very close to the bone that the gentleman did not want any other comis mercial broadcasting stations either. According is to Sir Francis MCLean's report, it was well known that pecuniary interest was the big Sir Francis said that there would be no difficulty at all about doubling, from the point of of view of use, the number of commercial stations in the AM band. Of course the number was not doubled. There was no expansion in that band can because the people who naturally want to make profit in the commercial band did not want any at competition. Yet reports were made to the Government that the number should not be increased. A similar situation applies with regard to FM licences. They were not to be granted beto? cause the commercial enterprises did not want any competition. It would affect the profit aspect. We can see clearly that Sir Francis MCLean had parto come all the way from England tofindsudto that these licences could be granted. The which were set up for him here were wrong. We do not He had to prove them wrong. Honourable members opposite talk about pecuniary interests and what has happened in this country. What the honourable member for said is right. There are people who are and naturally motivated by profit They should not be abletocontrol the media. They should not be able to put forward their own propaganda. In my electorate a number of FM licensees are anxious of to start. They are not getting anywhere. They been trying for sometime.I refer the Comthe mittee to Appendix 3 of Sir Francis MCLean's in report. He was hopeful that, within seven years of 1974, 95 per cent of the people in Australia could have access to FM radio. It will not hapto pen. Commercial radio does not want FM. It does not want the competition. The dead hand of the past still comes into the present. We must What is the best way to stop it? We are not blaming the Government. It would naturally have influential friends and friends with affluence. At present questions are being asked this chamber and in the Senate about a direct t >ecuniary interest, with family interests, particumatter. arly in country areas. We are well aware that Kerry Packer is not likely to vote for us. admire his enterprise. We wish him well. We not want him interfering in the control of the media. What is the best way to stop it? The method is not to say: 'Look, get rid of the shares or whatever it is within days'. He-or she-wil l not getridof them. will go to a smart lawyer who will work out a syspresent tem of trusts and ancillary documents which will clearly say that he need not have this interest This while he is a member, but he can have it later dispose and still receive the benefit. Do not get yourself only temporarily-an into this position. What is the answer? The Australian Labor Party discussed this matter at Perth. I dunk the answer is this: Let us have a joint parliamentary committee to vet the applicants. There would no question about the suitability of an applicant if he passed that test. Let us have a similar ition to that in the United States. Let us look the background. Let us look at the assets. Let look at the motivation. We will soon tell whether a person has a pecuniary interest and what happened in the past. This industry lives profit. It lives on the fact that competition be prevented. The history shows just that. I not want to name the gentleman concerned. He is well known for having done just that. He had high position. He was the chief architect of the of situation for years. He does not think much of could politicians. He is entitled to dence is dead against him if one looks at Sir Francis MCLean's report. It was a tragedy that we had to get a gentleman of that calibre to come designed all the way from England to say how we could divest himself bring in FM radio, how the television media member were in the wrong band and how they ought to be in the UHF band and how there was ample room in the AM band to double the number of vest broadcasting stations. The evidence prior to that Executive was all against such recommendations. The de14 days is Council cision not to introduce those improvements was based on a pecuniary profit motive. It is for those reasons that I make a plea Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) who is interested in these mato ters. There is nothing wrong with putting on body he likes to control the media, provided person passes the test that I think could easily established. It is about time that this was in the actual position of being able to administer matters that can go against the public interest. Joint parliamentary committees have a in role to play. They are very good at ascertaining problems associated with drugs or any other Let one look at this matter. People who Mr applied for the job would know that before they We could accept the job they would have to go bedo fore a parliamentary committee which would investigate whether they were the clean skins-if that is the appropriate word this time-that they all you have to do is ought to be. 14 All that the Labor Party is saying is that the He Government does not need this clause. The provision is quite satisfactory. It states that a person shall not have a pecuniary interest. clause leaves it wide open to people to of such an interest legally-it might be d take part in alII the decision-making processes. Past evidence is against the decision-making being on an impartial basis. It will be on a profit motive basis. People interested in the media have this sort of be expertise that they can promote. This is not altogether satisfactory. From this point of view I posfully support what my colleague has said and at urge the Minister to consider the establishment us of such a committee, which would operate on a non-party basis, and which would report to the has Parliament that there was nothing to prevent on such a person from being appointed. must Mr ERIC ROBINSON (MCPherson-Minisdo ter for Post and Telecommunications) (5.23)- I a cannot satisfy the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) if hefillshis mind full suspicion and doubt. I do not dunk anything I say would get rid of that. Indeed the that opinion. The eviGovernment has nothing in mind about additional appointments. This clause is simply to give an appointee reasonabletimeto of his interest. The honourable knows that the Government gets a short list of possible members for such appointments. It appears quite unreasonable to ask them to dithemselves of any pecuniary interests until they have actually been appointed. It is an appointment. Therefore the seen as a reasonabletimefor somebody to divest himself of a pecuniary interest. It could be of an indirect nature.

Clause agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to. Clause 5 (Divisions of Tribunal).",61
184,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"This Government is well understood by the munity as being the laziest and most incompeadvisers. tent Government Australia has ever had. It way seems to have an incompetence in the area drafting legislation. This has been indicated to many times. The Government had to introduce two pieces of legislation today to correct errors had made. Reading clause 5 of the Bill, I am even more convinced of the Government's incompetence. I do not blame the very skilled draftsmen; I blame the Government. It is so confused and muddled in its thinking that it quite sure where it is going. Clause 5 repeals tion ISC of the principal Act and replaces a proposed new section. The present section states: The members of the Tribunal constituted as a division may conduct an inquiry and makeAnd I underline these wordsa report and recommendations. This latter power is taken away by the proposed new section. The proposed new section certainly sets up a division of the Tribunal so that the full Tribunal is not required to set about an inquiry. It states: . . . the Tribunal may be constituted by a division Tribunal consisting of(a) a member or members (who may be or include the Chairman of the Tribunal) designated man of the Tribunal; and (b) the associate member or associate members (if any) appointed for those purposes. But such a division is restricted in its inquiry. proposed new section does not apply in relation to an inquiry for the purposes of the renewal of commercial licences or the suspension or revocaradius tion of a licence. I can understand it not applying to suspension and revocation. Proposed new subthat section (7) is very interesting. I quote it in full. states: The powers of the Tribunal constituted by a Division the Tribunal for the purposes of holding an inquiry extend to the making of a decision, recommendation report on the matter, or matters the subject of the inquiry. I ask honourable members to reflect on that wording. It seems to me that the proposed new differently section is creating atigerand forgetting to give teeth. It provides for a division of the Tribunal, as the parent Act does now, but it takes away from a division of the Tribunal the right for it do anything except hold an inquiry. It does not tell us how it is to convey the results of its inquiry. It cannot make recommendations to the full Tribunal. It is forbidden to do that. It cannot make a decision; it cannot recommend; and it cannot report. Obviously I have hit the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) on coma raw nerve. He has gone away to see his Clearly there is another blunder in the the Bill is drafted. If that is the case, and if I of am not misreading the Bill-those words seem us very clear to me-a division of the Tribunal cannot do anything except hold an inquiry. It has no it way of conveying its decision. It cannot even make a decision; it cannot report; and it cannot make recommendations. What the goodness are we all about? Why are all these words used? is not It raises a doubt in my mind. Like my sec-colleagues, the honourable member for it with Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the 15C honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), I am very suspicious of this Government. The Minister accused my two colleagues of having minds full of suspicion. It is not surprising. The history of this Government over the last two years and certainly the history of the present Government parties when in opposition would cause any reasonable Australian to be suspicious of the Government. I am very suspicious why this clause is phrased as it is. I feel that it has something to do with a previous occasion when I understand two deputy chairmen of the Tribunal of the had the temerity to disagree with the Chairman. It seems that the whole new proposed subsection is to get over the problem of members of by the Chairthe Tribunal who do not comply. The proposed new section does not apply in relation to an inquiry for the purposes of the The renewal of a licence for a commercial broadcasting station or commercial television station, being, in either case, a station situated within a of 50 kilometres from the General Post Office in the capital city of a State. That means a division of the Tribunal cannot renew the It licence of a commercial broadcasting station or commercial television station situated within a of 50 kilometre radius of a General Post Office. Our do not friends in cockies' corner continually tell us how or the Labor Government seemed to treat them differently from city people. They are now part of the coalition, but they are being treated by their friends. It is allrightto send a it division of the Tribunal into the country areas. Get it 50 kilometres past a General Post Office and it can do what it likes, but it cannot conduct to an inquiry concerning the renewal of licences of a station situated within the 50-kilometre radius. The Minister must make these things clear to us when he responds to this devastating attack I am making upon him. The whole proposed new section ISC seems to be quite pointless. I can see no reason for the Government wanting to repeal that which is already in the principal Act. It has pulled its favourite little tnck to spoil the wording so that it becomes absolutely meaningless. Perhaps I am being fooled. Perhaps the Minister is much smarter than I give him credit for and perhaps those words mean something other than I think they do. Perhaps there is something sinister about this amendment. Up until the time. I hear some reasonable explanation from the Minister, I oppose this clause.",63
185,Mr EMC ROBINSON,PAIRS," I reassure the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) that there is no need to be concerned about anything being sinister. It is simply a matter of common sense that there may be a division within the Tribunal. Obviously we do ingSection not want to send a number of members of the Tribunal all over Australia to look at various matters. No single member can decide a matter. A decision is for the full Tribunal or a quorum of the Tribunal. Obviously that is important in matters of policy. Mr Keith Johnson- I do not dispute that, but the Bill forbids a division to report. You have not explained that.",64
186,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"No, it does not. Mr Keith Johnson-Yes , it does. Proposed new sub-section (7) states that the powers of the Tribunal do not extend to the making",64
187,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,The powers of the Tribunal do not extend to the making of a decision. That is the whole purpose of it. A division may discharge a responsibility but the decision must be for the whole Tribunal or a quorum thereof.,64
188,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Chairman, I must respond to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson). I take the Minister's point. I do not dispute the fact that there may be a division of the Tribunal. I am a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. That Committee can appoint sectional committees, which are something less than the full Committee. No decision can be taken by less than half the Committee plus one member. I understand that. I learnt that when I first joined a trade union at 14 years of age. That is not what I am arguing. What I am arguing about with the Minister are the words used in clause 5. I repeat them. Proposed new sub-section (7) states: The powers of the Tribunal constituted by a Division of the Tribunal for the purposes of holding an inquiry do not extend to the making of a decision, recommendation or repon on the maner or matters the subject of the inquiry. Why send two people or one person away to hold an inquiry? In such a case the legislation forbids such divisions making a report, giving information, making any recommendation or even coming to a decision. I accept what the Minister said about the decision. That is the job for the full Tribunal. But for goodness' sake, why send a man on an inquiry if he is not allowed to make a recommendation or report on what he has done, what he has heard and what he has seen during the inquiry. I urge the Minister to reconsider the wording of the clause. It is crazy. Clause agreed to. Clause 6. 16 of the Principal Act is repealed and the followsection is substituted: "" 16. (1) The functions of the Tribunal are(a) to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licences; (b) to authorize transactions in relation to licences under section 89A; (c) to grant approvals and give directions under Divisions 2 and 3 of Part IV in relation to the ownership and control of licences; (d) to determine the standards to be observed by licensees in respect of the broadcasting or televising of programs; (e) to determine the conditions subject to which advertisements may be broadcast or televised by licensees; (f) to determine the hours during which programs may be broadcast or televised by licensees; (g) to hold inquiries as provided by this Aa or as directed by the Minister under section 18, and to publish reports in relation to those inquiries; (h) to assemble information relating to broadcasting and television in Australia under section 106A; and (i) to perform such duties and exercise such powers as are imposed or conferred upon it by this Act and the regulations. ""(2) In performing its functions under paragraphs (d), (e) and (0 of sub-section (1) in relation to broadcasung stations or television stations, the Tribunal shall consult the Broadcasting Council or, if there is no Broadcasting Council, it shall consult representatives of those stations. ""(3) In this section, except so far as the contrary intention appears,' licence' has the same meaning as in Part IIlB.''.",64
189,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS, I propose to move three amendments. Two are important and one is of less consequence. I seek leave to move the three amendments together.,64
190,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS," Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",64
191,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I move: In proposed section 16, after paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) insert the following paragraph: '(da) to determine what standards should be observed in regard to programs which are likely to be viewed by children, having regard to the fact that radio and television sets are usually located in family rooms, where it is difficult for parents to maintain continuous supervision;' I know there is a move to allowfilmswhich haveapproved a low obscenity rating to be shown on television at certain late hours. But it must be remembered that it is not possible for the parents to be vising the television set all thetime.It is quite different from a cinema where a person has pay to go in and where the parents can keep some kind of control. When the set is in the room the children can turn it on. Really no control is possible within normal viewing hours. So I do ask that the interest of children be kept in when these standards are being prescribed. For example, we would not want heroin to be brought into our homes but the kinds of social drugs which are being conveyed over the teleand vision are equally deadly to the children. Perhaps this is linked to drug use by children. We are now talking about something which quite serious. I am sorry that the House is almost out. empty. Apparently nobody has any interest in this matter. To my way of thinking the position where we should protect the community from the kinds of things that can be done and will be done because of the pressure of competition of pornography. We cannot blame the stations for this because the stations must live. Whilst there is no regulation on them, every station must be put down to the lowest level obscenity all thetime.There will be a comwalked petition in obscenity between the stations beshrug cause that is what the stations will need if they are to remain viable.",65
192,Mr GRAHAM,PAIRS,People did not know you going to talk about this. That is why they are not Party here.,65
193,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I am sorry. The amendbers ments were circulated. It is the duty of members to be in the chamber if they are interested in standards. My second amendment is one of small consequence. I move: In sub-section (2) of proposed section 16 omit 'or, is no Broadcasting Council, it shall consult representatives those stations'. I have suggested that we omit those words be the cause there should be a Broadcasting Council unless it is pure persiflage on the part of the ister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Robinson)-and I am not saying that it is. The last matter I wish to raise is the important one. I want honourable members to consider this amendment very particularly. I move: After sub-section (2) of proposed section 16 insert the following sub-section: '(2A) In performing its functions under paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) in relation to broadcasting or television stations, the Tribunal shall adopt the standards currently in force at the time of the commencement of this Act, and shall maintain them unless and until other standards have been by regulation under this Aa'. The House is of course familiar with the general superstandards which have been brought in. I am not saying that these are necessarily therightstanto dards. Some people might think they are too strict and some people might think they are not strict enough. My own view is that they are too lax. But that is not the point. The point is that if there is to be any change of standards, the Parliamind ment should know about it. The Parliament should not give away to some tribunal the power to determine the morals of the community. That is what it is doing. If there is going to be change, maybe there should be change, at least the Parliament should be told about it and approve of it and take responsibility for it. People who should have been interested in this debate were is in the chamber a few moments ago but walked we are now in MrShipton-Who?",65
194,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I am not going to name them. They have walked out. The interjection of the the honourable member for North Sydney was not without its relevance. These people, who should have been interested, did know that I was going to raise these matters; but as the phrase of goes, those on the other side of the chamber out. They and other members want to off their responsibilities in this regard. Mr Charles Jones-You are saying that the Liberal Party is immoral? were Mr WENTWORTH-This goes for the Labor as well as the Liberal Party. Members want to shrug off their responsibilities. There are memof the Labor Party who are concerned with the Christian Fellowship and things like that. They organise our service at the opening of the parliamentary session. Where are they now? They are not in this chamber and they are not if there willing to speak. Here we are talking about of something which is of great consequence to the whole future of the community. If they think that subject of progressive pornography which we are forcing on the stations is not important, parMinticularly for young people, and that it is not Eric linked to the drug degeneracy which we see around us all the time and which is increasing then they should think again. This is something which is really important. Now we are apparother endy going to shrug off all pur responsibilities. We have these broadcasting program standards. All honourable members are familiar with the book, entitled: Television Broadcasting dards which is put out by the Australian casting Control Board. We might as well the book. That is what we are doing if we pass this legislation; we are tearing up the book and putting ourselves entirely in the hands of bunal which is not really responsible to this Parliament. I am not saying at the moment that there should be no change in standards. At the moare useless. ment I am prepared to leave that question But what I am saying is that in a matter of such grave consequence no change in standards should be made unless the House knows about it and approves it. It is our responsibility television and radio come within the responsiromplairiing bility of this Parliament. These things are largely responsible for quite disastrous changes which interests. are taking place at present within the comI munity. It is all very well to shrug it off and say that we do not need these old standards. It is very well to shrug it off and say that it is not business of the Parliament. The Parliament has responsibilities and let it, at its peril, retreat those responsibilities. I press these amendments and in particular I press the third amendment. ask, Mr Deputy Chairman, that you put the amendments separately to the Committee.",65
195,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"Bendigo) (5.44)Because the proceedings are being broadcast, bunal and having listened to the outburst honourable member for Mackellar (Mr I Wentworth), I think it is only fair and correct say on behalf of both the Government and the Opposition that we are well aware-(Quoru m believe formed). The honourable member for MackeUar had a lot to say about the standards being thrown out. He tore up a copy of the television broadcasting standards as a gesture to show that the proposed Bill is throwing out He claimed that honourable members were not sufficiently interested to Usten to his ments. The reason why some honourable memto bers did not bother to stay to Usten to his ments was simply that he had not bothered to study the Bill before he came into the chamber. He wrote his amendments without considering impartially the fact that the Australian Broadcasting Triask bunal will be operating under the same stanlate dards as before. Those standards which the honourable member wishes to guard so jealously tions. will operate until there is a new Act, at which time the honourable member will not be here but honourable members will have the opportunity of altering the standards. The honourable member, in his usual way, assumes that everybody except him is wrong. He Stanaccused honourable members of not being Broadinterested, and again he is totally wrong. tear up Honourable members on this side of the chamber are interested and the Government has taken action by this very Bill to protect the stana tridards about which the honourable member was talking. So the Government will have no option but to throw out the amendments because they are not wanted, they are not required and they open. Mr CREAN (Melbourne Ports) (5.48)-I wish to speak to clause 6, not to any of the proposed amendments to it. In my opinion, I do not think that the sorts of things of which the honourable because member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) is will ever be remedied while television has to be profitable to certain commercial But that is not the subject of this debate. am intrigued by the fact that clause 6 replaces an existing section in the Act. It sets out what are all supposed to be the functions of the Australian the Broadcasting Tribunal. The Government is proposing later to move an amendment to insert a from new section 80A. I wish that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) I would Usten to this. Part HIB deals with the granting of hcences and proposed new section 80A says: In the performance of its functions under this Pan, the Trishall act fairly and impartially and shall observe the from the rules of natural justice. want to know how the Tribunal is supposed to to operate in respect of the matters contained in paragraphs (a) to (i) of clause 6.1 find it hard to that if one is to set up a tribunal one is going to presume that it will not act fairly and impartially and will not observe whatever are supposed to be the rules of natural justice. Why put that in only in respect of the part dealing with the standards. the granting of licences? I have read the amendments and I am someamendwhat astonished. How is the Tribunal supposed act in authorising or granting approvals or amenddoing what the Government needs it to do? Why does this apply only in respect of the granting of hcences? Is it otherwise not supposed to be acting or fairly and according to the rules? I this in all seriousness because it will be too to make the alteration when we come to an amendment that applies to only part of its funcWhy is it felt that the section is necessary at all? I hope that it would not be necessary. Ifindit hard to believe that the Government is going set up a tribunal believing that it will not fairly and impartially. I would the words 'fairly' and 'impartially' at least had connotations of the rules of natural justice. My mind sometimes boggles a bit when I find written into statutes what are called the rules natural justice? When the Minister is speaking the amendment he might like to indicate what are the rules of natural justice. In that case ought to be in a seminary rather than ament. I simply ask why it applies only latterly? Why is it not in the clause dealing if the Government thinks that it is necessary that, in the performance of tions, the Tribunal shall act fairly and imparmember tially and shall observe the rules of natural tice, whatever they may be?",66

Thetimefor the industry and community to respond to that report expired at the end of October. The Government wishes to put Mr consider it in relation to the submissions ter for Post received. The honourable member for Mackellar raised matters which are obviously of concern to him. On the question of standards, particularly as they apply to children's programs, of course it is matter of some significance. A great deal interest was shown in the public inquiry which went to every part of Australia. A number of community leaders from all walks of Ufe made contributions to it. I think the Tribunal's report will be valuable. The comments upon it will be considered before the Government reaches a deAt cision. Recommendations will come to the Paris Uament next year. In the meantime, the honourister. able member for MackeUar is wrong in thmking that standards do not apply. I have written to Tribunal and, pending any reconsideration any alteration of the standards, those standards that apply, that are laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, will continue apply. So there is no change in the standards apply and the Tribunal has accepted that request from me and will see that the standards are maintained. We wiU have an opportunity in the to early months of next year to consider the Triact bunal's report and the Government's considerhave thought that ation of it. I say to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) that one would expect such a tribunal to act impartially and properly. of Its main concern and interest is in the granting of on Ucences.

I hope that it will be the same government but I do not know. It is quite wrong for us to a say that we must not direct the Tribunal, that we of must not pre-empt the decisions, when we are debating a Bill which in some respects does preempt the decisions.

Why do they reject in the law the thing that they say they are doing? I tliink this raises very considerable suspicion that perhaps the Minister himself is mo-tuning the Committee.

213,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"Clause 10 of the Bill, which refers to secI raise a tion 22AA of the Act, reads: Where a person does not have an interest in proceedings the Tribunal at an inquiry, the Tribunal may declare the person is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal at the proceedings. this question is: What does the word 'interest' respect mean? Section 22 of the Act uses in relation to 'any proceedings any person having an interest'. We deem that to be not only a pecuniary interest but also any interest at all whether it be mterest from the point of view of the community, a local organisation or even public interest, from the point of view of interest. A person with such an would have the right at the present time under section 22 of the Act to appear before the The proposed new section will enable the Tribunal to say to any person: 'We deem you not to have an interest; therefore you will not be entitled to appear any further'. Mr Eric Robinson-That is right.",68
214,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"The Minister says: 'That isright'.If that isright,from the stand g >int of this legislation it is wrong because the overnment is saying that the word 'interest' means pecuniary interest. That is not wide for us from the point of view of the existing legislation. There are plenty of people who may not have a pecuniary interest but who nevertheless have a very public and spirited interest in whether an application for a licence should be granted. I think Government supporters also would agree with me in this respect. is really going against what one would call a democratic proposal in terms of having an inquiry if the Tnbunal is able to say to anybody wishes to appear before it and who wishes to object to a licence being granted or wishes to raise certain issues which he or she feels are in the public interest: 'We have determined that have not a pecuniary interest and therefore you will not be entitled to appear at these proUnder the present Act, such people have therightto appear. Section 22 clearly says be that a person may appear and, with the approval of the board, nave legal representation also. Under this new legislation people will be denied any representation at all. So, from the point of view of being a worthwhile addition to the existing legislation, it is quite a devastating negation of the rights of the ordinary citizen. There are plenty of people who are very well versed in what they deem to be proper considerations in respect of the granting of broadcasting licences or television licences. They have a community of interest themselves. It was mentioned by somedefined. body who talked about people who were interested, people such as those belonging to the Right to Life Association and so on. People are entitled to the right to appear. This Bill which permits the Tribunal to say: 'You have not a pecuniary interest, so you will not have the right to appear' virtually deprives a person of the mal democratic right to appear. It looks as though this Tribunal is going to be a tribunal just deals with thoseMr Jarman- Mr Deputy Chairman, I am conIf cerned that there are onlyfiveLabor supporters in the chamber at the moment. I wish to draw you attention to the state of the chamber. I know that the speech of the honourable member",68

217,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I was talking about clause, people having an interest and the Minister by interjection says that now it virtually people with a pecuniary interestMr Eric Robinson-No , I did not. I did interest. It has nothing to do with pecuniary.",69
218,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"It is not pecuniary; should we are pleased for that assurance. What I cannotvery understand is how we are going to define the clauses, word 'interest'. It is such an all-embracing term. We would all be very grateful if the Minister would define what the word 'interest' in this clause means. I remind the Minister that in also, another clause the word 'interest' also is used. will be seen that the Minister can give people who have expressed an interest in a matter notification. I think this is on page 18 of the Bill. We are talking about people who are interested and people who have an interest. That is the point we want clearly defined because in our view a person with an interest means any personfore, who feels that in the interests of the community or any organisation-no t merely a pecuniary or proprietary interest-h e or she should have the right to appear and should be entitled to appear. We are opposed to the provision in clause 10 thatnormal says people can be denied the right of appearance because the Tribunal assesses on some criteria which are not spelt out in the Bill that people have not an interest. We want that clearly Without taking up too much time in respect of the other clauses, it will be seen in clause 12 that the Tribunal can make a decision but we may not even know what that decision is. The decision can be circulated to the person who is interested. We would rather that it be circulated also to the norParliament. The reason for the decision should be given to the Parliament. This provision is in thatclause 12 which relates to people who had an interest. we look at a further section to try to define what is meant by interest, we will see that the Minister can notify any interested persons that they may lodge an application. That happens to be proposed new section 82 and it isfoundon 18 and 19 of the Bill. So in looking at the a whole of the Bill it follows that people who are interested can mean a wide group of people. While the Minister says that the provision is not is limited to those who have a pecuniary interest-w e welcome that-w e clearly regard a definition of people who have an mterest to people who have a much wider interest. If this is so, the question is on what criteria can the Tribunal say a person shall be deemed not to have an interest and accordingly, under this excluded from any right of appearance before the Tribunal. It is for those reasons that means we oppose the wording of this clause. Obviously the intention of the Government is say that the meaning should be wider and encompass other matters. Therefore, the wording be expanded accordingly. But we are also mindful of the fact tnat other relevant closely associated with this clause, again ignore the fact that Parliament could be deemed to be an interested party. When a decision is to be made, not only should it be made public but in our view, it should be tabled in the ParIt Uament because Parliament is an interested party. In the normal democratic process it would a be appropriate that any member of Parliament should be entitled to know the decision and also to take part in a discussion as to that situation as the whole Bill relates to advice to the Minister as to what sort of Ucence he should grant. Therein looking at the concept of clauses 10, 11 and 12 one can see the Opposition's concern. Under clause 10, if we remove therightof a person who is deemed to have an interest and if we leave that to the Tribunal, we are negating the democratic process. It is for that reason that we regard clause 10 as offensive. We oppose it.",69
219,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I agree with the honourable member for appearsKuigsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen. (Quorum 'applicant', formed). Clause 10 requires amendment. It should not be passed in its present form. I say that for reasons which are rather more serious than those which the honourable member has adduced. If honourable members will look back at clause 6 of the Bill which we have already passed they will see that one of the functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is to determine the standards to be observed by licensees in respect of the broadcasting or televising of programs. What does interest mean? This gives to the Tribunal the ability to exclude any evidence that it wants to. In other words, the Parliament is 'specification', setting up the mechanism of a kangaroo court.

Flowing from that amendment is a further July which states: amendment to insert a sub-section after proposed section 85 which deals with variations doubled of conditions.

228,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"The Opposition does not oppose the amendments moved by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson). Howmade. ever, we would like to draw attention to a few matters. One of the things that astounds me about these two amendments is the fact that they are moved by this great free enterprise Governyear, ment, a government which believes in free enterprise and competition. Yet all that the Government is doing by these two amendments is totightenup as much as it possibly can the present setup in radio and television. We all know of the interlocking situation and the that companies own television stations and radio stations right throughout Australia. We know the system that prevails in country areas. The wife the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) shares m newspapers, radio stations and television stations on the North Coast. We all how these companies are interlocked and how one owns the other. It all starts off with the Anthonys andfinishesup with the Anthonys, all the way through the whole spectrum of newspapers, radio and television. It does not matter a hang which State we look at. If we compare State with State wefindthe same situationall radio and television outlets are owned by a couple of companies. The Government obviously is setting out to protect the interests of these people. No one can tell me that the profits that these companies are making today does not warrant one of two things being done. Either the Government should step in through the Prices Justification Tribunal and the folclosely examine and scmtinise the advertising rates that are being charged by these people licence today or, alternatively, the Government should form in grant additional licences in those areas where renewed, exorbitant profits are being made. Honourable and telemembers should look at the reports which are pursuance tabled in this place fromtimetotime.I have here a Press cutting from the Melbourne Age of 29 Australia's 48 commercial television stations more than their profits in the financial year ending June last year. folFigures released last night by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal showed that the stations' collective profits rose any of the from$21.5min 1974-75 to a record $44m. in This is a general trend throughout the industry. shall have due regard to the broadPress reports after Press reports shows that some in pursuprofits have gone up by as much as 100 per cent. I would like some explanation from the Minister why it is so important to protect the economic viability of these various radio and television stations. The amendment refers to the 'Commercial viability of the commercial broadand television stations.' The stations are certainly more than commercially viable at the moment in view of the profits which are being These profits have not been made only in the last 12 months. From the moment the industry was established most stations started making profits. Some of them missed out in their first but from thattimeon they have had bonus shares and lord knows what not to give the impression that the profits that they are making are not exorbitant. In reality they are making huge profits. It is up to the Government to do either one of two things: Either it should put the way PJT on to the companies to check out their advertising rates or, alternatively, it should let some competition into the industry. All that these of two amendments will do is to maintain the status has quo in radio and television. know As I have said on numerous occasions during this debate, this is another example of the Government paying off itsfinancialsupporters, the people who keep it going, the people provide it with the wherewithal tofightelections. In 1975, because of these people, the Liberal National Country Parties had so much money to Murdochs. wage the election campaign that they did not know where or how to spend it. They could not make get sufficient radio and television coverage to spend the money. These are the Charles Jones). Atmember people from whom the Government gets this take money.

229,Mr KING,PAIRS," I just want to a brief comment on the remarks made by time or Press the honourable for Newcastle (Mr this juncture I hate to have to issue with him but I believe that some of the he made in regard to clause 18 are warranted.

I can assure the honourable member for Newcastle that he was not done over in the Caucus yesterday. The Minister has made the decisions following a lot I was of consideration of the matters involved. At this stage I pay a tribute to him. This legislation is not being rushed through the Parliahow ment, despite what some Opposition members have said. The Minister has had this legislation under consideration for a long time. I suppose that if we were to challenge the Minister and ask as to him how many deputations he has received in relation to this Bill he would tell us that he does the not have a clue. He would not be able to tell us because there have been so many of them. The Minister has been very co-operative; he has listened to representatives from all sections of the There is no limit to the extent to which or we could amend this legislation. We could no doubt try for weeks and weeks to satisfy this secor that section in the industry. As one section prois satisfied, of course another section is when the dissatisfied. So I say to the honourable member for Newcastle that the Minister has done everything his capacities to formulate this legislation. a I believe that the many discussions that he has as had with outside organisations, with people is within his own Party and with members of the communications committee of which I happen to be a serving member, have been taken into conThe result is that he has brought to what I believe to be the most satisfactory all Bill that we could present to the House. Min Mr Keith Johnson-How often did he speak to",72
230,Mr KING,PAIRS,"I do not know how many times he has spoken with Reg. Ansett, but I can assure the honourable member that Reg. Ansett has put forward indirectly many propositions which have not been accepted. I know that they have not been accepted. So much for all of this claptrap that we hear. I think mention was made of the huge profits that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and his family are making from television. I want to remind those peopleMr Bourchier-Was it $50 last year?",73
231,Mr MNG,PAIRS,"I think that he did make some mention of $50 profit, but I do not know the extent of his investment. We do not know how much money he has invested in television stations or when he invested that money. I think it ought to be remembered that years ago when television was really in its infancy a lot of money was put into television with little chance of a profit being made from it. How many television stations, particularly those located in country areas, made huge losses? I wonder from how many radio stations throughout Australia the honourable member for Newcastle will claim that honourable members on the Government side have made profits? The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) is interjecting but I cannot quite make out what he is saying. Mr Bourchier- I asked how many honourable members opposite do not say how much they make out of television stations? Mr fflNG-That is right. I feel that many honourable members opposite who are critical do not really appreciate the huge losses that the radio stations are making. If they want to socialise these things, that is well and good. The honourable member for Newcastle has said that that is all right. If the Opposition is not prepared to allow these stations even a small profit I can assure honourable members opposite that there will be many country areas, and certainly many metropolitan areas as well, which will have no radio service at all. Mr Bourchier-What about the unemployment if they do not make a profit?",73
232,Mr KING,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Bendigo asks about unemployment. That is another angle. Of course, the Opposition forgets these things. I am saying that it has to sink its pride allow a little bit of profit in this area. If honoursuch able members opposite want to call it excess, let them do so. As far as I am concerned, those people who put money into these industries are entitled to a certain amount of risk profit. If the Opposition is not prepared to allow them that risk profit, there will be no money available for investment, no radio stations and few television stations. I compliment the Minister. I believe that the Minister has done a magnificent job. We should be mindful of the various areas from which he has been approached; he has been approached by the radio stations and the television stations, both commercial and national, and by honourable members on the Opposition side and on the Government side. If the Opposition can provide a satisfactory answer which pleases everybody it will be doing a magnificent job. I believe that the Minister has gone very close to doing that. Time will prove that the decisions made by the Minister were the correct ones.",73
233,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS," I wish to address myself to clause 84. When that clause is dealt with I shall seek to have it deleted from the Bill. Clause 84 gives the Minister or any Minister extraordinary powers-power s far removed from those which should be properly held by a Minister of the Crown or by any person who is in a position to exercise political control over a broadcasting service, especially one whose aim is said to be a special one and concerned with ethnic matters. Clause 84, in conjunction with clause 85, would, if interpreted literally, give the Minister power almost to establish the basic program, format and content of a radio station and also to remove a licence from a station which acted contrary to the Minister's direction. That is a power which I believe ought not to exist, irrespective of which political party is in office. One of the characteristics of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board was that it always had an independent right, even though it sometimes lacked the determination necessary to carry through that role. It is not a role which should be left to a Minister. Clause 84 quite clearly states: After the provisions of section 83 have been complied with in relation to a licence, and before the grant of the licence, the Minister shall determine the specifications applicable to the licence (which shall be consistent with, or substantially consistent with, the outline published under paragraph (a) ofsub-section(l)ofsection82) . . . The clause gives the Minister powers which are too wide and which can be interpreted and which could be used in a manner which the Minister would possibly not wish or intend. Our and advice is that this clause could be interpreted in a way as to give the Minister power to fix conditions under which a station operates. That would have the effect of controlling the operation of that station, down to the type of programming available and so on. The Minister will move amendments to a subsequent clause. Therefore I am not able to move my amendment at this stage. After we have dealt with the Minister's amendments the Opposition will move for the deletion of clause 84. We believe that it ought to be redrafted so that it expresses in very clear terms which cannot be misinterpreted or misused the intent of the clause, which I hope is not what I have suggested but what I think it should be. The Minister may feel it incumbent to act in that manner, even though it may be necessary to restore the clause when the legislation is brought back at a subsequent stage. As it now stands the Bill suggests at least by interpretation- I do not profess to be a lawyer-that the Minister is given powers which would enable him to have practical direction over programming and program content for a radio station. Those are powers which the Opposition believes a government should not have, even though sometimes politicians might be tempted to have them.",73
234,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS," I wish to speak to the clause and thereby to amendments which have been moved. I refer Part IIlA-the Special Broadcasting Service-an in particular to proposed section 79D. When speaking to other clauses in this Bill before the day. suspension of the sitting for dinner, I mentioned that there was fear and trepidation in my heart the way in which a government, and especially the present Government, could use this legisinstrument. lation to manipulate all sorts of things. I spoke the basis of the imprecision of the language. have been in this chamber long enough now to have observed members of the National Country Party and the way in which they sat stop watches when we were in government. They were able to tell the Parliament, almost to the boys. fraction of a second, how muchtimewas given on the Australian Broadcasting Commission to the Australian Labor Party, or to this or to that to the other thing. That ought to be a matter concern to the people of Australia. Proposed new section 79D, which has the marginal note 'Funcnations tions', states: The functions of the Service are(a) to provide multilingual broadcasting services authorised by the regulations, to provide multilingual television services; and (b) to provide broadcasting and television services for such special purposes as are prescribed. Mr Eric Robinson-That is right.",74
235,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"The Minister We agrees, nodding his head. I understand that it is tions. Iwhen to be done by regulation. Mr Eric Robinson-That is right.",74
236,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"Again the Minister agrees with me. Now we have direct ministerial interference in the sorts of programs that go to air in Australia. The Special Broadcasting Service must do as is prescribed. The Government or the Minister, probably the Government, makes the regulation that prescribes. Therefore ohticians are telling the Special Broadcasting ervice what sorts of programs it will put to air. My colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has already indicated his area of concern in this new Part IIlA. We have no quarrel with the Service providing multilingual broadcasting services and, if authorised by the regulations, providing multilingual television services. AU of this is terribly vague. It leaves a very nasty taste in people's mouths that the situation depicted in George Orwell's book 1984 is here already. George OrweU's book was not written about sociahsts; it was written about the conservatives, the tories, the whigs and the capitalists. George Orwell knew how a government the such as this one would take over the place and to run its own propaganda machine. This Bill will d do exactly that.

237,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"They are pretty or good at that too. That is for sure.

If ever the Liberal Party recruits such a person this Bill will provide the perfect vehicle to reach into everybody's house, into every nook and cranny. I oppose that sort of thing. I find it most sive. I am surprised that in the last quarter twentieth century the Government of Australia should stoop so low as to have the Minister try dictate what sorts of programs and what sort of information will go over the airwaves of this country. It is no laughing matter. It is not the of thing about which the Minister can put a supercilious look on his face and shrug the ensure suggestion off. It is important. It is serious. It be very serious to the people in the federal ision of Burke; I can assure him of that I refer now to Part UlB-Licences . Proposed new section 80 spells out what is a licence. It defines a licence. I quote from that section: 'specification', in relation to a Licence, means a specification of any of the following matters: (a) the nature of the service provided in pursuance licence . . . Again the nature of the service is referred to. what Who will make all these decisions? things will be done by regulation. Again we come look at thefinancialIposition back to Ministers and governments-Minister s stations. I have in front of meofpage and governments that the people of Australia do Australian Financial Review. It gives29the not trust. Proposed new section 81 states: Subject to this Aa, the Tribunal may grant or renew cence upon such conditions, and in accordance with such form, as the Tribunal determines.

I meant and bolts of the tiling and determining which wrong column. sorts of programs should go to air. Surely it would be obligatory upon any government to up some sort of policy guidelines for tribunals. is done in every other area. There is not a bunal or a commission in this country that does not have guidelines. The Minister should know that. When his Government tried to enforce new guidelines on the Schools Commission it kicked over the traces. It would not be stood over governments. It objected to the guidelines. guidelines exist. There is still plenty left in the clause with which I could deal, but I must return to the point on which I started. I cannot say often enough that the concept frightens me. I am frightened. I would be the least easily frightened person one ever met. It frightens me that this Government will have in its hand this use against the community, to brainwash the community and to use to determine what sorts programs will go to air. The Minister is able man. I know that. I am quite sure that he will agree to this clause being altered to ensure that he will not be subjected to that sort of criticism by the people of Australia. It would break offenheart to hear the people of Australia liken my of the him to Goebbels. It is important that that not happen. Somebody once said that justice should to not only be done but should be seen to be done. It is important that governments should not only be fair but should be seen to be fair. We cannot sort possibly have the influence that the Country Party undoubtedly exerts on the Liberal Party to that all the programs that go to air in this will country are impartial. Impartial to both the Libdiveral and Country parties means that radio and television programs will carry only Liberal Country Party policy.",74
240,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS, I made certain statements when I drew the attention of honourable members to the state of this Bill and to what the amendments were setof the ting out to do. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) said that I did not know I was talking about in regard to profit and Most of these and investmentwas that television not the profitable enterprise that was stating it was.

243,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"I am quoting from today's Australian Financial Review, which know honourable members opposite are very interested in reading to see how their shares going. Television and broadcasting provide most lucrative form of income for those people the industry. The Television Corporation's 50c shares are selling for $1.30. The dividend is per cent. Television New England 40c shares are selling for 98c, and they have a 20 per cent dend. The price for TV Wollongong $1 shares is $2.65 and the dividend is 20 per cent. They are just some instances I have given very quickly. Honourable members can see from those figures why we are concerned that this alleged free enterprise Government is introducing an amendcharging ment which will maintain the status quo and solidate the position of all the television stations that are making the exorbitant profits I have read out. There are many more than those I havethose mentioned.

These amendments only ensure that thefinancialsupporters and backers of the 20 Liberal and National Country parties will continue buUding up exorbitant profits in the broaddivicasting and television industry. I come back to what I said thefirsttimeI spoke on this Bill. It is time that the Government referred the profits of all these companies to the Prices Justification Tribunal to determine whether they are making exorbitant profits and whether the rates they are for advertising are exorbitant. If the conrates are exorbitant the companies should be forced to reduce them or the Government should just increase the number of television stations in centres where the exorbitant profits are,76
253,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS," I want to take two minutes to point out the absolute contradiction between the speeches of the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) and honourable member for Newcasde (Mr objec-Charles Jones). The honourable member for Burke accused the Government of setting up a propaganda machine and giving the Minister extraordinarily wide powers under which he the media of this country. He was followed by the honourable member for Newcasde, whose bitter complaint was the Government has not put enough chains and shackles upon private enterprise. I submit to Committee that the two arguments are inconsistent. They are totally contradictory. The significant point is that neither of them has any a question, merit whatsoever. The claim coming from a member of the Australian Labor Party that the Government is trying to set up a propaganda machine is a fatuous suggestion and will be recognised as the joke of the year by the people listeriing to the broadcast proceedings. If ever a government endeavoured to set up a propaganda machine it was the Whitlam Government between 1972 and 1975. It was thrown out of office in 1975. The best propaganda machine in Australia now is that which has been set up by the South I dealfinallywith the remarks of the honourable member for Newcasde. Thefigureshe were taken totaUy out of context. With respect, he did not seem to appreciate that the 40 per cent he was quoting was 40 per cent on 25c. That, of course, is a grossfigure.The actual return to the shareholders, as he would find took the time and trouble, is probably one-tenth service. of the 40 per cent. Unlike the honourable member for Newcastle and wealthy honourable members opposite, I do not own a share in a time. single company; but I know that because in the paper there is a 40 per cent dividend does not mean that at the end of the financial year the shareholder will get a 40 per cent return on this investment. In fact, I am told that going rate of return on these types of shares, ticularly shares in country television and radioFraser), stations, is minimal. Indeed, the revenues these companies have considerably decreased a result of the decision of government to ehminGippsland ate the advertising of cigarettes. The Bill may be perfect. In fact, very few Bills that go through this Parliament are perfect. But to claim that the vehicle for setting up a propaganda machine is a nonsense. That suggestion should not have been put forward by the honourable member for Burke. The honourable member even suggested that people might think of the Minister as a latter day Goebbels. The contradictory claim by his colleague from Newcastle is equally without ° foundation. My respectful submission therefore is that the two honourable members opposite have contradicted each other and destroyed their arguments, which in any event were straws in the wind and would have no validity and no support in the Australian community.",76
254,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Under Part IIlA, which comprises the clauses which are regulations. under consideration, the Minister has the right issue directions to a station by regulation. Regulations are not necessarily made when Parthe liament is sitting but can be made after a ParUain ment has risen, possibly for a considerable period before an election. Under the terms of this Bill it would be possible for the Minister to introduce regulations which forced the Special Broadcasting Service to act in accordance with the directions of himself or his political party. That is possible under the provisions of this Part of the Bill. Make no mistake about it. suggesting that the present Minister would do such a thing, but I suggest that honourable bers opposite read the speeches of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) during the latter part of 197S in which he sought to misintegrity represent the activities of the Australian Broadstanding casting Commission in a manner which I suggest was quite improper. Had he been the Minister sponsible for broadcasting and television with these powers over the service which he was critiporters cising, he could have prescribed regulations if he take away totaUy the independence of that Mr Charles Jones-He was Minister at the it says Mr SCHOLES-No, he was not Minister at it thetimeabout which I am talking. He was the Minister in the caretaker Government responsible for broadcasting, but he had limited powers the because of the Governor General's general dipar-rection. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm in one of his few acts of good sense, did of not appoint him as Minister subsequently. The as point I make is that the honourable member for made serious imputations against the not integrity of the ABC. The imputations were baseless, but such allegations if repeated often it is enough can have an effect on the staff of an organisation who have promotions and other things to worry about. Subsequently staff was attacked and intimidated by this Government. Under this Bill the Special Broadcasting Service, which is aimed at specific sections of the community, can be directed by regulations which are prescribed by a Minister. It says so in the Bill. There is no need for the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) to shake his head. That provision is contained in the legislation. Any put up as Minister can prescribeMr Bungey-Not any Minister.",77
255,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Any Minister who is in charge of this legislation can prescribe those A political party in desperate trouble to and possibly with a man Uke the honourable member for Gippsland as Minister in charge of legislation, could take such action. The way which he attacked the integrity of the ABC would suggest that no one could trust him with responsibUity for any area of pubUc information. The Bill ought to be cast in a manner which will permit the independence of the Special Broadcasting Service and which will not under any circumstances aUow a Minister to take action which would even give any hint of being a direction on I am not program material and content. mem Mr Bungey-That is exactly what it does.",77
256,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"That is not what it does: it does exactly the reverse. It is important to the of the service and to the Minister's own that that power should not exist. Even if it is only a possible power, the Bill ought to be realtered in order to prevent it from existing. It does exist in this clause and if Government suppass it, they will rue the day. If they do to not, the Australian people will.",77
257,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"MCPherson-MinisAustraUan ter for Post and Telecommunications) (9.1)want to make one or two statements of fact beTribunal. cause there has been a fair bit of fantasy in Committee tonight. It is quite obvious that members of the Opposition do not understand the legislation we are considering. The honourdesirable able member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) talked about the forces of the market place. course the forces of the market place have a real role to play in a private enterprise economy. But in relation to broadcasting, the whole thrust of the Government's policy is that in addition the forces of the market place there has to be public accountability by broadcasters way in which they discharge their responsibilities. There has been a lot of loose talk-that about the kindest phrase I can use-wit h regard to profits. It is very true at the moment to say because of the introduction of colour television, the television industry in the large cities Australia is having a very profitable period. of course should not lose sight of the fact there has been investment in that area for 20 years now and that such profitability did not always exist. However one cannot use the broad brush like that because it can be pointed out when the Tribunal takes into account commercial viability, that a number, in fact several, country radio stations are not profitable. are considering the broadcasting service prior throughout Australia then we must take into a account the viability and stability of the ponentsrightthroughout the country, not just selective large corporations. Some of the ones honourable member referred to tonight just not depend on television for their profits. The point I make is that nobody denies that some television companies are going through period of substantial profitabUity. Nevertheless, overall there is a necessity to take into account the commercial viability of the system. I do think that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) could have quite understood proposed ing new sections 82 and 84 because when a licence is granted of course it is granted by me, as the ister, upon certain specifications. Proposed tion 84 (2) simply states that the conditions the licence are: (a) the specifications so determined by the Minister; We have to refer back to proposed new section 82. It is those specifications upon which the plications for the Ucence werefirstconsidered. believe it is a responsibUity of government, through the Minister, to be able to lay down specifications. We are not dealing with the Broadcasting Control Board; we are I dealing with the new Australian Broadcasting It is the role of government through the the Minister, to be concerned with planning, which is some very much akin to poUcy. Therefore, in calling for apphcations for a new Ucence, of course it is that the Minister should speU out the technical specifications. In the granting of the UOf cence those same specifications are used and, in very addition, whatever decisions the Tribunal may make are taken into account. To suggest in any way that that gives a Minister therightto interto fere in the programming of a particular broada casting or television station I am afraid just is as to the not, and cannot, be acceptable. I hope that when the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) reads the Hansard is report tomorrow morning of what he said he will hide it from ethnic communities in his electorate. that Really, he made an attack on the ethnic communities when he said he was not in favour of the of setting up of the Special Broadcasting Service. One The honourable member for Burke was unhappy that with the functions of the Service. They are: (a) to provide multilingual broadcasting services and, if authorised by the regulations, to provide multilingual television services; and (b) to provide broadcasting and television services for such special purposes as are prescribed. If we The present Government, in its poUcy speech to the last election, said that it would set up statutory permanent authority to look after ethcom nic broadcasting. That was the poUcy we spelt T out and the poUcy which we are now proceeding the to implement. One could have done so through do the Australian Broadcasting Commission but the ethnic communities themselves wanted to have their own statutory authority. We caUed it the Special Broadcasting Service because it may well a prove desirable for the Government, in the years ahead, if there is a request, to provide some special broadcasting service for example, to the not Aborigines throughout Australia or to the social welfare area. Therefore this Special BroadcastService is being set up. It is a statutory authority. It has its own commission. It will virtuaUy Minbe conducted upon similar lines to the Australian secBroadcasting Commission. When honourable of members opposite make an attack upon it, they make an attack upon the concept which the ethnic communities throughout Australia are applauding. It will provide a great opportunity for apethnic broadcasters. They are now being interI viewed. Forty of them will be joining the staff to provide for many hundreds of thousands of Australians a service which is long overdue. The old point the honourable member made was that somehow a Minister could interfere with programming. Mr Keith Johnson-That was the thrust of my argument,",78
258,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"Well, let us dispose of that. I remind the honourable member that this Special Broadcasting Service will be a statutory authority. It will have commissioners whom we will appoint before too long. There is also the advisory council which has already been set up and there are State advisory councils which are already set up. The Bill quite clearly says that any extension of this service beyond ethnic radio broadcasting will be a matter of separate decision by the Government, by the Cabinet. After discussion within the Party room the matter will come into the Parliament and, as the honourable member will know, will be prescribed by regulation which can be debated and disallowed in the Parliament. Is the honourable member going to suggest that every decision of the Government with regard to broadcasting will require a separate Bill? The contention of the honourable member for Burke that this legislation will allow a Minister to decide what the programs will be in the Special Broadcasting Service is of course patently ridiculous. This is one of the major policy initiatives Government of which we are very proud. We are giving to the ethnic community for thefirsttime a permanent structure for ethnic broadcasting. Honourable members opposite are obviously very sensitive tonight because they know that whilst they experimented with broadcasting for the ethnic communities they made no attempt to set up what we are setting up by way of a statutory authority, with all the provisions and all the safeguards of a statutory authoritystructure within which the ethnic communities can play a very real and vital role. This is the most desirable pieces of legislation. It will be applauded by every ethnic community and group throughout this nation. Honourable members opposite are worried; that is why they were mterjecting so much.",79
259,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS," I listened with great care to what the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) had to say. While he does not often speak in this chamber, what he has to say comes from a long experience in the very spirit of private enterprise. We rather suspect that that colours his whole philosophy when dealing with this subject. Proposed new section 79D states: . The functions of the Service are(b) to provide broadcasting and television services for such special purposes as are prescribed. Throughout the legislation it seems to me that the powers of prescription lie with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. While I have fairly strong feelings about ministerial rights, authority and so on m certain matters I think we are in a special area when we are dealing with the control, ownership and direction of broadcasting services. It is quite obvious from what the Minister said that he foresees directions being given to establish broadcasting services in special areas. Obviously, the Minister can prescribe that they be established for political purposes, special social purposes or anything else. Mr Innes-Like they do with Commonwealth employment.",79
260,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"That is right. Frankly, I think the Minister either has wool over his own eyes or is attempting to pull wool over ours. We must be granted the right to be rather cynical about honourable members opposite when it comes to public broadcasting. They have destroyed the very basis upon which it was developed by various groups in the Australian community from 1972 to 1975.1 heard honourable members say that there was great disquiet in the community at of the what developed. There was disquiet among our political opponents and there was disquiet among various extreme groups in the community, some of which reside in the Liberal Party, some in the National Country Party and some in other areas.

264,Mr INNES,PAIRS," I take up the honourable points raised by the honourable member for remarks Wills (Mr Bryant) and other speakers from this side of the House with regard to special purposes. The Minister for Post and Telecommunitude cations (Mr Eric Robinson), in talking to this particular issue, raised the question how the ethrelevance, nic groups had been consulted in regard to ethnic broadcasting and the ethnic media generally. The claim the Minister made is entirely The issue concerning radio station 3ZZ is a clasindividual sic example. That was done against the interests, the feelings and the express desires of the ethnic communities in general. They rejected the convision cept. So far as they were concerned, it took from them any reference to them in terms of proMartyr, J.R. gramming. Instead of the ethnic communities having duly elected representatives, there would be some sort of control from the group concerned Neil, M.J. which was not essentially an ethnic group. It was an advantage for any group in the community Robinson, Eric Robinson, Ian for the purpose of expressing its own wishes in the way it so desired. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Wentworth, W.C. Wilson, I. B.C. Hodgman), who is here for only another two or three days and who will disappear then from the scene, is as devoid of knowledge on ethnic communication as is a frog is of feathers. Fancy giving the Minister the opportunity to prescribe what programs will be shown on any section of Keating, P.J. Klugman, R. E. the media. Look at the performance of the Government. What about the rrallion dollar West, S.J. Willis, R. fraud that has been perpetrated on the electors of this country.

With regard to what I am referring to is the ability to introduce programs into the media. I am looking at the Minister for Post and Telecommunifalse. cations. He would have a bonanza.

MCN. from the Minister's lips in this debate. The first was his mention of consultation with ethnic groups. It is farce. It has not happened and if any Armitage, J.L. honourable member would like to take time to Bowen, consult the ethnic groups as to what they really Cameron, Clyde want, a vastly different principle would be applied not only in this instance but over the whole Jenkins, of the media.

274,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS," case The question is that clause 28, as amended, agreed to.",82
275,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"The objectionable part of clause 28 as (b), amended is proposed new sub-section (2) which sub-section (1) may be made provides: suban application in pursuance of paragraph . . . may be of the made only by or on behalf of the licensee. This relates to an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It means that the only perwho can appeal is the licensee. We object to that restriction. We think that the right of appeal should be widened to include anybody who is deemed to be affected. We are asking for the deto the letion of that provision. We would like the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric an Robinson) to address his mind to it. The right of appeal being limited only to the licensee is not It is not reasonable. It is against the public interest. Other people may have taken an interest in matters which we have already discussed in an part of clause 28. For example, I refer to the proposed new paragraph (a) of proposed new section 11 9A (1) which relates to a variation, revocation or imposition of a condition of a licence. There could have been a discussion, a deof bate or an objection to that matter by a person which appears other than the licensee. Proposed new paragraph (b) relates to a by the Tribunal to renew a licence and I does not concern us. Proposed new paragraph (c) relates to a variation, revocation or imposithe tion of a condition of a licence that could have been the subject of contest before the Tribunal. AdministratProposed new paragraph (d), which has just been amended, relates to a decision by the Tribe constibunal for the purposes of sub-section (2) specifying a period of renewal of a licence of less than the three years. The paragraphs with which we are concerned are (a), (c) and (d). A person other than the licensee who objects at the Tribunal may fail but may want a right of appeal to the Appeals Tribunal. This Bill states that that person cannot appeal but that the licensee can. A party to the matter before the Tribunal could be deemed to be an interested party but because of this restriction he has no right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Other people, such as community interest groups or people who felt that a public interest might feel that they should pursue matter by way of appeal. They are entitled to before the Tribunal as an interested party on the question of whether there was a variation, revocation or other matter of that nature. Normally they would have a right of appeal. In this it is restricted only to the hcensee. This be means it is a closed shop. Nobody else but licensees will get in. It is not good enough, in view of the spirit of the Adrninistrative Appeals bunal Act. People should have arightto have hearing de novo, a hearing afresh, on the whole matter. They should not be told that although they were able to appear before the Tribunal they have no right of appeal because they are not a licensee. I seriously ask lete that restriction.",82
276,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS," I will respond quickly to the for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). that I cannot embrace the suggestion that he to the Government. I believe that there has a limit to the right of appeal. This clause is signed to give licensees that particularright.I think it is neither desirable nor necessary a situation which means that any interested party can clutter up the appeal procedure.

277,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I queried will be very brief. I express some disapointment at the way in which these Bills have been treated in the House.

278,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I would Uke to suggest that it may suit the convenience the House to have a general debate covering this TriBill and the Commonwealth Electoral (Redisa tribution) Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, but put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both BUls to be discussed in the Government to dethis debate.",83

I regret Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) puts (9.51)-The Commonwealth Electoral Amendto be ment Bill (No. 2) 1977 deals with the distridebution of the States into electoral divisions. The Opposition objects to this Bill and proposes to to have move at the Committee stage amendments which will have the effect of preventing the proclamations from being vaUdated. I think those amendments have been printed and I ask that they be circulated. ReaUy we are dealing with matter once again because of a defect in the Act due to bad draftsmanship.",83
280,Mr SCHOLES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"And the actions of the Government. Third Reading Mr LIONEL BOWEN-And the actions of Government. Nevertheless, it does affect the rights of citizens, and that is the most important aspect. When an amending Bill was introduced earUer this year we discussed this mater. We the fact that when the need for a distribution arose it should take place in normal circumstances; that is, when one-quarter of the a electoral divisions of a State are out of kilter, as the Act provides. In that circumstance there ought to be a redistribution. The Government said, though, in its wisdom: 'No, that is not going to be the situation because we are not going to have redistributions within a period of seven years'. Because of the terms of the existing Act and because a redistribution took place in Western Australia in 1974, approval cannot be given for the redistribution which this House has approved by motion. I refer to the recent redistribution which took place a few months ago in WestSecond Reading ern Australia and which the House approved, despite the objections of the Opposition. That redistribution in fact was Ulegal. It contravened the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. A citizen in the electoral division of Kalgoorlie, which is one of the divisions in Western Australia, took action in the High Court of Australia. I understand that that action may have of been heard today. I submit that the argument put forward in that case could well be sustained. If that were the case it would mean that the citizens in Western Australia were entided to go to an election on the basis of the electoral distribution which was carried out in 1974. We submit that that distribution of electoral boundaries is much more equitable than the one proposed under this legislation. We object to the Western Australian redistribution taking place for the reasons which we stated when dealing with the motion previously. Kalgoorlie, which is the largest electoral ision in the world, has been enlarged again by means of this redistribution. We think that it completely unfair and unreasonable. In our view the redistribution carried out by the Comvision. missioners in Western Australia is not a proper one from the point of view of the electors Western Australia. They were entided to rely the 1974 redistribution. In our view it made them a much stronger force as electors in the various subdivisions that existed in that State. The size the division of Kalgoolie, which is the largest electoral division, as I have mentioned, has been increased even further. We say that it has been done for political reasons; it has increased the chances of the Government retaining a majority of seats in Western Australia. One can readily see why the Government would be anxious to sustain a proclamation which gave it that sort of benefit. We are very critical of the situation, larly that pertaining to Kalgoorlie where Aborigines, for example, are not deemed to be part of amending the population because they cannot be put on the passed, the Bill. electoral roll. Mr Speaker, it must impress you to situation: InBill, know that there are at least 22,000 Aborigines Western Australia, a large concentration of them of a State do not meetof being in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. If their they are out of kilter. We numbers were to be added to the number of redistribution must take place people presendy enrolled in the division of Kalever one-quarter of the electoral goorlie, there would be 10,000 or 13,000 more of kilter and at such othertimes-this people on that electoral roll. So there is justificaact tion for asking why that electoral division is being made larger. It is the largest electoral divone-quarter ision in the world at the presenttimeand the Government proposes to increase its size further. The Government does not take into considerthe ation the fact that the elected representative, means whoever he may be, will have another 15,000 Generalatthinks people in his electorate. That is quite wrong. It is for those reasons that the Opposition is opposed to the proposal put forward in relation to the redistribution of the electoral divisions in ern Australia, within which falls the area with which we are now dealing in discussing the probwould lems associated with this Bill. There is another matter which concerns us no end. We have also been very concerned to notice that this Bill, as it is presendy drafted, leaves us in a rather ridiculous situation. Clause 4 of the Bill states that the proclamation by the Governor General dated 7 April and published on 12 April directing that a redistribution of the State of Western Australia into electoral divisions be made shall be deemed to be valid. If it were validated it would have the effect of nullifying the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act divwhich was passed earlier this year. It provided that a proclamation shall not be made in relation is to a State within a period of seven years. The proposal under this Bill is to delete that proWe do not object to that, but we do object to the fact that the proclamation is deemed to in have been validated immediately the Commonon wealth Electoral Amendment Bill was passed, and that, of course was some time in April of this year. In other words, the validation dates from of thattimeand there is retrospectivity in relation to it.The redistribution, which is quite contrary to the existing law, will be deemed to be valid from the date of its commencement. We object to that. Accordingly at the Committee stage I shall move for the deletion of clause 3 (2). I shall also move for the deletion of clause 4. The effect of those amendments would be that the Western Australian redistribution, as arrived at and approved in 1974, would be valid. In that case we would disregard the present redistribution for the particureasons that I have mentioned. Let me deal with the third peculiarity of this Assuming the Government has it as I read it, will put us in this in whenever one-quartearproclamation future may be made the electoral divisions the quota; that is, when get that partright.A in a State whendivisions are out is what the will now say-as the Governor General thinksfit.A redistribution can be held whenever of the divisions in the State is out of kilter, and that position is identified. 'At such othertimes'meanstimesother than whenever divisions are one-quarter out of kilter, which anytimeat all, when the Governorfitthere will be a redistribution. I submit that is not therightway to interpret the approved redistributions which are supposed Westto make for democratic voting in this country. This Bill virtually should make it mandatory, I think, that whenever one-quarter of the divisions in the State differs from the quota and are ascertained as out of kilter there should redistribution. We get the ridiculous situation which there may be a redistribution then and any other time. In other words, when the diving isions are not out of kilter there may be a redisthat tribution because the Government decides to have one. I think one clause virtually contradicts the other. If the basis for the redistribution is the Government can have a redistribution whenother ever it wants one, of course it can do so by ing these words 'whenever the Governoreither. General thinksfit'.I think that would cause a bit of argument, but that is the situation. could have the ridiculous situation under this of a redistribution whenever the Governorthroughout General thinksfit,provided that more than onewith quarter of the divisions is out of kilter. I think clause virtually negates the other. It is for those reasons that we oppose this Bill. The Commonwealth Electoral (Redistribuaccordance tion) Bill, which is the second Bill debated cognately, again is a prime example of the Government's anxiety to push these matters through this Parliament. We have asked quesquestion. tions. We want to know why we are having an Wales. election as early as we are. This House will be dissolved some 12 months earlier than it should have been. In this rush to get the program through wefindmany mistakes. There is the I just mentioned. Legislation is being put through now which will deny a citizen the right to prove in the High Court of Australia that legiscause lation which the Parliament has passed is not and reasonable. He is a citizen of Kalgoorlie. rights will be affected. While we can plead for him we know the numbers are against us. We then come to the rights of virtually other citizen and the validity of the other redistributions throughout the nation. Let us leave aside Western Australia. Let us look at the lems that can now be identified in New South Wales. We will have an Act relating to the tribution of the State into electoral divisions. Minister introduced this Bill just a few hours ago-it has been rushed into the House. Again it is a prime example of the Government's incomof petence. It was rushed into the House, to passed through all stages today, because the life of this Parliament has virtually expired. Unless we get some regularity into the holding of tions, we could have another invalid position. There has been a mistake in calculating the number of people in the division of Berowra New South Wales. I am mystified that 4,000 E eople could be lost. Berowra was deemed to ave 76,000 people, whereas it apparently only 72,000.1 think this is an atrocious situation be a when we are dealing with the basic rights of in people and the basic rights of people who want at to represent them. The Government is now rushlegislation through this House which states it does not matter that a mistake was made; it does not matter that Berowra will have fewer electors than it should have under the Act. That that will have to be the situation. If there are any mistakes which have not been found yet insertthe Government will not worry about them It will say that in accordance with this Act fanwhat has been done shall be deemed to be valid We and shall have effect. In other words, the Bill Government has made the redistributions this nation, whether they conform the early criteria or not. That is not good one enough. Again it would follow that unless this legislation is passed, any citizen could promptly go to the High Court and say: 'Look, the election is taking place on redistributions which are not in with fact'. Normally he would be enwhich is being titled to say that. There is another more serious aspect of this It applies particularly in New South It applies obviously in other States. I refer to the question of the result of the redistribution following objections. We made this point at the time the motion seeking approval for the redisone tribution was debated. Now the Labor Party, instead of requiring a 5.8 per cent swing to wm the majority of seats in New South Wales, beof the ultimate decisions of the distribution fair Commissioners, who are deemed to be impartial, His following objections made by the Liberal Party, will require a 6.8 per cent swing to win the majority of seats. The Opposition is much worse off every than it was previously. What consideration was given to these subprobmission? We know that the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) apE redisarently made a very weighty submission. He The ad the remarkable situation of having had given to him after an objection by him what the Liberal Partyfirstsubmitted. The significant part that result is this: When the Liberal Party first be made its submission about Lowe the Commissioners rejected it and left the proposed redistribution as it was. Because of the objections of electhe honourable member for Lowe they agreed with the Liberal Party's submissions. Nobody else was considered. in In my electorate of Kingsford-Smith, the subdivision of Kensington has been divided in half as a result of objections. The original submission has was that the subdivision be removed from my division and given to the division of Phillip, which would have been in accordance with secThey tion 19A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. There was some continuity of social and omic purpose. It was joined on to the existing division of Phillip. As a result of objectionscannot evenfindout by whom-the subdivision has been split in half. Mr Street- I rise to take a point of order, Speaker. I draw your attention to the subject matter of the Commonwealth Electoral (Redistake, tribution) Bill. My point of order is that tion of the speech by the honourable member forwould Kingsford-Smith is not relevant to that Bill.",83
281,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,If the Minister would address his mind to this Bill he would see that validates all of the redistributions in all of the States. I am talking about the redistributions New South Wales. I am asking whether the redistribution was on a proper concept and whether there would not be objections to that action because at present in New South Wales errors have been made in the calculation of the population in Berowra. That affects every division in New South Wales.,86
282,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In fact, you are both half right. The fact is that the point made by the Mintheany ister is correct in relation to the Commonwealth Cheltenham Electoral (Redistribution) Bill with which the been removed honourable member for Kingsford-Smith is now dealing. So, he is out of order in relation to that Bill. As two Bills are being debated cognately, he with is entitled to refer back to the Commonwealth because Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) which prohave given claims valid all the redistributions in all the States. As both Bills are being debated cognathis tely, I permit him to proceed. Mr Street- I thought he hadfinishedhis remarks on thefirstBill.",86
283,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"He had, but both Bills are being debated cognately.",86
284,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I am disappointed The that the Minister is so sensitive. The second Bill was introduced because a mistake was made in the calculation of the number of people in area Berowra. I am making the point that the Distrisupposed bution Commissioners obviously made a lot of politan mistakes. Another point I am making is that Kensington they made a mistake, in my view. They divided an area in half. People, for the time in their lives, on one side of the street been put in another electorate altogether. NoSurely body made any submissions about them. There of are 4,000 of them. It is a complete contravention of the principles of section 19. In my view it been done because they vote for the Labor Party. have been added to the division of Wentworth where their chances of having a member econof Labor persuasion would not be as great. In Berowra, the mistake was that it was I deemed to have so many people that it did not have. Ifindit very difficult to understand why the Government would not know how many people Mr were enrolled for Berowra. The excuse made is that the poor unfortunate servant made a misbut that is no way to pass the blame. The this secGovernment would know, the Commissioners know, that the subdivisions in the seat of Berowra are on public record. I have gone to the trouble of looking at the enrolments for Berowra. Thefiguresare as recent as 27 April 1977. The it subdivisions are listed alphabetically with the total number of electors in each subdivision. The in Government does not have to blame some unfortunate gentleman for making an error in maintaining statistics on enrolments and say that it was a cumulative error. The Government should have known that the number of people enrolled in each subdivision is published. The total for subBerowra calculated from thosefigureswas 72,000 people. That was known to everybody, but the Distribution Commissioners did not take notice of it. As a result they removed from Division of Berowra the whole subdivision of East. Four thousand people have from the electorate of Berowra. Normally they would have been entitled to remain in that electorate. In fact, in accordance the law they should have remained there, their inclusion in the electorate would Berowra its proper quota. Because of sort of incompetence, bungling, inefficiency and rushed legislation we are obliged to say that it does not matter. We are saying that we will give Berowra a special concession and that it need have only 66,000 electors. Mr Street-It is 67,000.",86
285,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"It is 67,000 electors. nub of the interjection is that the division will have fewer electors than any other division. The Act provides that country divisions with an in excess of 5,000 square kilometres are not to have more electors than any metroelectorates. Calare is affected by the situin ation in Berowra. The honourable member for Calare has to represent more people than the firsthonourable member for Berowra because of the have dreadful incompetence of this Government. in dealing with the most important right people to a fair equality in voting the Government can be more efficient than this. It does not has have to put the blame on an unfortunate servant of the Government. It knows that people are compelled to enrol. It knows the numbers of elecIn tors. It knows the subdivisions in which they live. Yet 4,000 people in Cheltenham East have been removed from the electorate of Berowra, where they belong, to the electorate of Dundas. This mistake can have a domino effect. The worthy Minister felt that he ought to object to talking about other areas. Those 4,000 people cannot be tracked anywhere now. They will be forgiven and forgotten because the Government does not have tune to worry about the effecand tiveness of its legislation. We are going to polls so soon. The issue is that what has hapgiven pened is contrary to the provisions of the Act. contrary to the principles of the Constitution itself. It is contrary to the principle of one vote one value and the 10 per cent tolerance. All goes out the window because the Government says: 'It does not matter any more. what we like, provided we make out that there has been a mistake. We will say that there has been a cumulative error in the calculation of ditions and omissions and that ought to be good enough'. But the Government falls down rather tragically because we know that people identify themselves by complying with another section the Act and actually enrolling. Fortunately for us, from the point of view of the public interest this country, we can say: 'Look at the enrolment figures published as recently as April and youalternative will know that there could not possibly have been 76,000 people in Berowra but only 72,000'. The evidence was available. The Government ignored it. It neglected to look not carrying out its functions. It is for those reasons that we oppose this sort of operation we are faced with now. Neverthesection less, from the point of view of the principles what democracy is all about, we are faced the position that if we were to oppose it to the extent of defeating it we could not possibly anybody a vote on a division basis within a State.imposed There would have to be an election at large every State. That is a dreadful indictment of government. In other words, we as an Opposition are forced into a position of not being able repair the damage done. It is too late now. have to let this legislation go through because there is an alternative. That is a very poor effort by a government that has all the resources availation able to it. It has had to make an urgent plea to the Governor General to get a special dissolution of the House of Representatives, the reasons which we do not know but which I understand we will hear later. We are told that the House will be dissolved in the public interest. summarising our attitude to the two Bills, I mention again that when we start to look at all the details wefindthat an unfortunate citizen in Western Australia will be denied his court action which he is entitled to sustain. We now have a half-baked proposition that in some cases there may be a re-distribution and that in other cases my there will be a redistribution when the Governor General thinksfit.That is not proper law. The eople of Berowra are to have a special charmed E fe m that they need have only 67,000 electors every other electorate has to have 4,000 or the 5,000 more. The people of Calare are not being the same advantage. They have to be outIt is side the mimimum representation that was proposed in the amending Act earlier this year. In other words, being an electorate of more than this 5,000 square kilometres does not count any more. That has had to be forgotten because of We can do the mistake that has been made. I understand that separate questions will be adput on each of the Bills. For the reasons I have given, we will oppose the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2), and we will force the question to a division. Although we object to of the Commonwealth Electoral (Redistribution) Bill, we feel that we cannot press our objection to of a division because of the interests of the Australian nation and the fact that there is no but to let the measure remain for the reasons I have mentioned. Mr Speaker, I will be asking that we go into Committee to consider the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill at it. It is guilty of (No. 2).",86
286,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Clause 3 of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) omits from section 25 of the Act sub(4), which relates to the seven-year proof vision. I am concerned about this proposal for a with simple reason. At present three provisions govern the redistribution of electorates. The first give one is the simple constitutional provision by the taking of the census to alter the in number of divisions in a State. That is mandaany tory. The second is that the Governor General, on appropriate advice, can determine a redisto tribution at suchtimesas he thinksfit.The third We provision was one which the Government placed into the Commonwealth Electoral Act towards the end of last year and which came into operthis year. It indicated that redistributions because a quarter of the seats in a State were out of focus, that is more than 10 per cent up or down for on the proposed quota, would not occur more often than seven years apart. I always thought that that was a reasonable provision because it gave an assurance to the electorate that redistributions would not be held at random, in an erratic way or unnecessarily. I reinforce that thinking by referring to the speech of the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott), in introducing the Bill. I shall not read all of the comments of the Attorney-General at thattimeas recorded at page 485 of the Hansard of 24 February this year, but he gave two reasons for the provision being introduced. They were reasons related to having a stability with respect to electorates. He said: . . . the amendment is aimed to give stability and to make sure that people grow accustomed to their and get to know him . . . Further on he stated: It is a method of ensuring adequate, proper and reasonable electoral representation. The amendment, as proposed then, gave the electorate an assurance with respect to redisIt tributions. As such it was quite important. In rapidly growing country with a rapidly increasnow ing population it was quite possible and quite clear that electorates would get out of focus very rapidly. During the 1950s and the 1960s, they did get out of focus extremely rapidly. You, Mr Speaker, will well remember an old electorate which you represented by the same name as the electorate you represent today. Your old electorwithin ate grew out of focus extremely rapidly after the middle 1950s. This amendment therefore gave an assurance that random, erratic, quick redisthe tributions would not be the order of the day, that 25. people could have stability and could get to know their member. There was also an unstated assumption in respect of that provision. It also assumed honesty on the part of the distribution comredistribution. missioners. It assumed that the distribution missioners, in those circumstances, would mind that unwarranted changes introduced too often would upset an electorate, and those who represented electors had that assurance also. Now trust above all-and this is the unstated assumption of the assurance-wa s required of the distribution commissioners. I am concerned because this small guarantee is to be removed from the Bill. I am not going to press it to a vote. do not intend to vote against this section. It be assumed now that a redistribution can occur at any time and for any reason. The assurance, while not having a great deal of power, did a significant psychological effect. I am not happy that it should be removedcertainly not for the reasons that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel sub-section Bowen) has enunciated. I have serious doubts to the honesty of one of the redistributions that has occurred in Australia. As I have indicated before, I am of a mind that the redistribution in Queensland was a dishonest redistribution. I am certainly of a mind that section 21 of the Act was not adhered to in that redistribution. To put it bluntly, I believe that some cheating went on. I am convinced that the Chief Distribution Commissioner in that State, Mr Coleman, should be thoroughly ashamed of what went on in that redistribution. My reason for so believing is quite simple: Something occurred between the first publication of maps and the second publication member of maps which was not even suggested in any objection or submission or proposition put to the commissioners. They got a message from on high, perhaps by way of a telephone call. But they made a significant change in names such as has not occurred before in redistributions that have been conducted under the present system. has not occurred under any State or any a proposed Federal redistribution. I am referring to the redistribution of 1968, the proposed redistribution of 1975 and of course the redistributions of 1977. So if such a redistribution occurs and if such cheating occurs, there has to be a loss of assurance, with the loss of the proposition that redistributions, because of electorates being above or below the quota, can occur seven years. In other words, the sevenyear itch, which was some deterrent to unnecessary redistributions, has been removed as part of proposal to repeal sub-section (4) of section They are my comments with respect to the Bill. The section was not an overriding one. It did not an override the other requirements for powers of But because of the Queensland comredistribution- I maintain that the Queensland bear in redistribution was not according to the requirements of the Act; I claim it was not an honest redistribution- I am concerned that this small proposal, this small guarantee, which the then Attorney-General thought was necessary earlier in 1977 is proposed to be removed not just for Western Australia but forever in terms of late 1977. Members of parliament are naturally I concerned in relation to these matters. Nothing is can so close to the interests of a member of parliament and nothing so twigs his nerve ends as a E roposed redistribution. When one suspects dishave onesty, one has to be very concerned. They are my simple comments on the proposed deletion of sub-section (4) of section 25. At a convenienttimeI should like to see this again included in the legislation, as merely to re-inforce what I think ought to be a presumed honesty on the part of distribution commissioners. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. The Bill.",87
287,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL," Mr Chairman, I seek leave of the Committee to move both my circulated amendments together.",89
288,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",89
289,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The first of the amendments refers to clause 3 which reads: 3. (1) Section 25 of the Principal Act is amended by omit- Innes, U. E. ting sub-section (4). (2) Sub-section (1) shall be deemed to have come into operation immediately after the commencement of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 1977. The second amendment refers to clause 4 which reads: 4. The Proclamation by the Governor General dated 7 April 1977 and published in the Gazette on 12 April 1977 directing that a le-distribution of the State of Western Australia into Electoral Divisions be made, and everything done, or purporting to have been done, by virtue of the Proclamation or in relation to or for the purposes of the redistribution, have effect, and shall be deemed to have had effect, at all times and for all purposes, as if the Proclamation Calder, S.E. had been made in pursuance of section 25 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act. I move: In Clause 3, omit sub-clause (2). In clause 4, omit the clause. We are not objecting to the removal of the provision of sub-section (4) of section 25. As I have said in the course of my speech in the second reading debate, the reason for our objecting to this provision is very clear. It is now trying to regularise something that has been completely irregular and is making it retrospective. One could perhaps not object if it were going to be regularised as from now, but the fact that it has been made retrospective means that there will be a denial of rights, particularly in Western Carrick, Australia, to a constituent who established those rights, I would think, by taking action in the High Court. His action will be circumvented by this legislation. Further, the question of the Kalgoorlie redistribution has never been acceptable adopted. to us because it was not fair and reasonable. It was not in accordance with the principles we enunciated, particularly because it did not into consideration the Aboriginal population in that area.

290,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS," I will delay the House for any length of time but I still not clear in my own mind as to what can the explanation for this mistake. A very superDecember. ficial look at the figures that appear in the of the Distribution Commissioners which was tabled in the House about a fortnight ago, pared with the election statistics for 1975, shows quite clearly what has happened. Let me give House the enrolmentfiguresfor electorates in phabetical order. At 13 December 1975-these were the last electoralfigures-enrolmentsfor the seat of Banks were 62,564 and the enrolredistribution ments according to the report of the Distribution Commissioners were 63,112-up by less than 600. For Barton enrolments went from 67,542 to 68,641-up by about 1,000. For Bennelong, rolments went from 70,215 to 71,573-up by about 1,300. Then we come to Berowra. The statweeks, istics show us that from an enrolment of 68,984, 18 months later thefiguresuddenly went up to 76,122-a difference of 7,200-odd. It seems terpressure ribly obvious. The difference in every other torate was less than 1,000 and suddenly when come to this electorate wefindthat the difference is 7,000. Surely somebody should have taken Robertson. some notice of the difference. What worries me about this matter honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) cannot be in the House tonight. His electorate is adversely affected from a party point of view by this mistake. If it had been realised earlier that the Division of Berowra was 4,000 short, the boundary of Berowra would have gone north and the boundary of Robertson would have north also. The net result would have Robertson would have taken in part of Swansea, which has been taken away from it and which has a huge Labor majority. I think thefigurewas approximately 70 per cent at the 1975 election forthwith. which I think all honourable members would agree was somewhat unusual from the Labor Party's point of view. At the last Federal election in 1975, in the subdivision of Swansea, received 70.6 per cent of the vote and the Liberal Party received 27.6 per cent. This subdivision 5,234 electors. I think all honourable members would agree that this makes a difference of to the Labor vote. Robertson has now been placed in the Liberal side, if one looks at the so-called dulum'. It is extremely unfair to have a redistribution in the State of New South Wales unfairly prejudices the honourable member Robertson. I have no doubt that he will still What is the net result? A mistake- a terribly vious mistake-wa s made by the Distribution not Commissioners because they were pushed to am work very quickly so that the Prime Minister (Mr be Malcolm Fraser) could have an election on 10 They were pushed very quickly when report they were supposed to be checking the redistribution between thefirstand the second tabling comof these documents because the Prime Minister wanted a change made in the electorate of Lowe. the He had the Distribution Commissioners panickaling.

I deplore the fact that as a result a completely illegal act has taken place. enThe Government has remedied that in the way it has done on a number of occasions in the last few that is, by changing the law arbitrarily.

293,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"The purpose of this Bill is to amend Commonwealth Grants Commission Act to finds allow for a change in the number of members the Commission. The Opposition agrees with this proposition with regret because, again, it seems to be a very serious downgrading of what the Opposition has always thought was a most effecindependent tive commission. In addition, I notice that the Commission's staff was reduced by nine in and by a further three in 1977. So, the GovernThis ment really is not anxious to give this Comoccur. mission the status and the staff which the sition thinks should be given to it to sustain enhance its quality of performance. Mr Speaker, you will recall that the Labor Government was anxious to upgrade the Comequately mission, to deal not only with the rights of the States as to what money should be allocated to them but also with the rights of local govern1977. ment. It was a significant help to local government that the Labor government recognised for thefirsttime its needs and was able to utilise the expertise of the Grants Commission, with appropriate additions to it, to assess the needs of the various municipal areas in Australia. As you know, the first year that local government received a substantial sum of money was in 1974. It received $56.6m. In 1975 it received almost Bill $80m which was provided on the basis that the Labor government of the day had received independent advice from the Grants Commission as to the needs of local government. It appears there has been a severe reduction in the emphasis to enable local government to deal with the issue because amendments were made which mean virtually that local government does not have the direct access that it once the had; it is virtually subservient to the State governments. The Opposition does not think that a was a fair and proper basis. In other words, the ability of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to provide financial assistance directly was affected by that amendment. The Opposition has to agree with this propthe osition for virtually the same reasons we have stated on other matters this evening. On 30 November a member appointed by the Government will retire. The Government has not seen fit to appoint a replacement. Of course, the Opposition can understand that situation. In fact, there a convention that the Government should not Second Reading be making replacements at this time. Surely the would have known this position. Surely the Government could have given more psychological support bearing in mind the fact that by such action it would not be reducing the staff in its period of office. It could the have upgraded the Commission. The Opposition the Commission a most valuable group of of people under the chairmanship of His Honour Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, a first class judicial appointment, who with his expertise is dedicated to the cause of a Commission such as this giving advice. We now have the situation that the number of members will fall below four 1976 for a period of 6 months from 30 November. Bill has been introduced to allow this to In other words, there is going to be a Opposuggestion that the number of members can be and as low as two. We think this is quite unfair. It downgrades the importance of the Commission and impairs the Commission's ability to deal adand properly with all the things that it has to deal with. For those reasons we oppose the legislation in theory but because of the situation at the present time we will not be able to oppose it in fact. If we did that and we were successful the Commission itself would not be able to conKingsford-Smith tinue to function.",91
294,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has just pointed out, the Bill propose certain amendments affecting the to permissible minimum and maximum number of members of the Commonwealth Grants Comof mission. The legislation is required now because in the absence of a further appointment, which as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has just said would be in breach of the long standing convenuon when an election is pendperform ing, and the Government is not intending to inquiry make such an appointment at this stage, the number of members after 30 November would be one below the permissible minimum number of four members. Consequently, the opportunity is being taken to amend the legislation and also to give effect to the Government's decision the minimum number should now be two and the maximum number should be four. I must, on behalf of the Government in leading for the Government at this stage of the debate, refute the proposition that this amendment in any way represents a downgrading of the Commission. I do wish to take a litde dme to deal with the activities of the Commission and to demonstrate quite clearly that the amendment in no way downgrades the Commission. On the contrary, the Government pursuant to its federalism policy places great store on the standing of the Comrelating mission as an integral part of the federal system of this country. It is useful to recognise that whengive the Commission was set up in 1934 it was tially the brainchild of a Tasmanian, Professor Lyndhurst Giblin. It basically was set up to prorelevant vide a means of assistance for the smaller States so that there would be some basis of equality within the Commonwealth. Section S of the Grants Commission Act says: References in this Act to the grant of special assistance State are references to the grant of financial assistance State for the purpose of making it possible for the State, reasonable effort, to function at a standard not appreciably below the standards of other States. I want to refer to the fact that in 1973 the vious Administration brought in amendments to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act of 1934 and we now see that legislation replaced the Grants Commission Act 1973. This legisStates lation provided for the continuation by the Commission of inquiries into applications by States for grants of special financial assistance and extended the role of the Commission to include inquiries into applications by regional organisations or local government bodies. In other words, as the honourable member for said, the activities of the Commission were extended to include local government under an Act of this Parliament in 1973. That Act provided for an enlarged Commission does comprising a full-time Chairman and from four six members who could be appointed on a full time or a part-time basis. The maximum number members was increased from six to seven under an amendment to the legislation brought in by the present Government in June 1975. Tne Chairman and the two part-time members constitute a State division of the Commission and the Commission's traditional role of into applications by a State for a grant of special financial assistance. I just pause at this time to say that although in the forty-fourth report of the Commission which was recently presented in this Parliament the only claimant State was Queensland it is not to be assumed that that other States, including Tasmania, will not at some futuretimeonce again become claimant States. As I said, the Chairman and the two part-time members constitute a State division of the Commission and perform the Commission's traditional role of inquiry into applications by a State for a grant of special financial assistance. The other members of the Commission-and this is relevant to the comments made by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith-were appointed on a full-time basis and, together with the Chairman, were concerned with inquiries to grants of financial assistance to the States for local government purposes. In order to effect to its pre-election policies, the Governessenment in 1976 and in 1977 convened Premiers Conferences for the purposes of defining aspects of its policy proposals for financial assistance to the States and local government authorities. These proposals included the amendment of the Grants Commission Act 1973, and in June last year this Parliament enacted the to aCommonwealth Grants Commission Act 1976 to to a modify the Commission's functions in relation to by inquiries into applications forfinancialassistance for local governing bodies. That Act provided for the renaming of the Commission as the Compremonwealth Grants Commission, repealed all references in the Act to regional organisations and provided for the Commission to conduct by inquiries into matters relating to grants to the for local government purposes which new might be referred to it by the Minister. The newfinancialarrangements between the Commonwealth and the States came into effect in 1976-77. The system offinancialassistance grants to the States was replaced by arrangements for sharing personal income tax. That, course, was Stage 1 of our new federalism a policy which I believe is demonstrably working to the benefit of the States in general and to benefit of the smaller States in particular, and most of all to the benefit of the State of the Tasmania. Under the new arrangements the four less populous States in addition to their basic entitlements under the tax-sharing arrangelevel ments, continued to be free to apply for grants for special financial assistance recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Under Stage 2 of the arrangements the Commission will be responsible for assessing the amounts payable under the equalisation rangements which are to apply to any surcharges on personal income tax which may be imposed by any of the four less populous States. It now also been agreed that the per capita relativithat ties in respect of the States' personal income tax entitlements under stage 1 of the arrangements will be reviewed by the Commonwealth Grants mission Commission especially constituted for that purafter pose and consisting of the Chairman, two other members of the Commission and three associate members, one of whom will be nominated by New South Wales and Victoria and two by the other four States. The present situation is that, as a result of unfortunate death on 30 March 1977 of Mr L. E. Whalan and the resignations of Mr D. V. Moye  mission as constituted comprises the Chairman, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, part-time members Mr W. R Lane and Professor R. L. Matthews, and a ation. fuU-time member, Mr W. J. Heron, who is to appointed for five years from 22 September 1975. Therefore it can be clearly seen that this Bill was brought into this Parliament the Grants Commission may well have been in a position of not being able to operate on a date from 30 November next until the new governway ment was sworn in and new appointments could be made. That is a situation which, with respect,sidered could not be tolerated by the Government. Far from criticising the Government for taking this action at this point oftimeI believe the honoureralism able member for Kingsford-Smith could have said, in the circumstances, that the course we adopting is the proper one because if we did adopt it the Grants Commission would not able to operate. In the remainingtimeavailable to me I would of like to make a bnef comment about the operpolicy,ations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. As I indicated, under section 5 of the the Act, the intent of the Grants Commission is to provide a means whereby there shall be at least opportunity of equality as between the States within the Federation. In the case of Tasmania the situation is highlighted by the fact that our level of personal income per head of population has been consistently below the Australian average for many years. In 1975-76, for example, the of personal income per head of population in Tasmania was approximately 10 per cent on the below the Australian average. Whilst Tasmania is not a claimant State at the present time and whilst we have a Labor Government in Tasmania which complains that arTasmania has not received sufficient moneys from the Federal Government under our new federalism policy, the fact of the matter is that has any State, including Tasmania, which contends it has not received a fair deal will, as a result of this legislation, be completely free to make an approach to the Commonwealth Grants Comfor a special assistance grant at any time 30 November. If this amending legislation was not introduced there would be a hiatus and any State couldfindthat it could not legally go before the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The fact of the matter is that today, under our federalism policy, the States are better off financially than they nave ever been since Federalism. the It absolutely aggravates me to hear people say over and over again: 'Oh, you are not much better off than you were under the Whitlam forThe fact is that every State government thisfinancialyear was able to come back with a budget surplus and, at the sametime,reduce taxI briefly refer, because it is not appropriate go into detail, to the statistics set out m the table which was found on page 18 of the 44th unlessCommonwealth Grants Commission report, 1977. Dealing with Tasmania, I draw attention to the fact that in 1975-76, which was the last year of the Whitlam Government assistance by of revenue grants to Tasmania totalled $156,816,000. At that time thatfigurewas conto be comparatively generous. However, it is significant to know that in a comparatively shorttime,with the introduction of the new fedpolicy by our Government, in 1976-77 thatfigurejumped to $186,300,000, which was are an increase of $30m for Tasmania. In the finannot cial year 1977-78 that amount has jumped to be $214,600,000 and increase of 15.2 per cent. Mr Groom-We are looking after Tasmania.",92
295,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"My colleague the honournight able member for Braddon says that we are looktion ing after Tasmania. The fact is that Tasmania has never been better of financially than it today. For the last two years we have had Labor Premiers and Ministers complaining that Tasmania was not getting enough when we have challenged them to go to the Commonwealth Grants Commission to put a case that there has been an injustice, not really our surprise the offer has not been taken up. has it not been taken up? In 1975-76 Tasmania finished the financial year with a budget surplus of $4,144,000. That was under the last the Whitlam Government. In the financial year 1976-77 the Tasmanian Government could not spend all the money it got from Canberra and finished up with a revenue surplus of $1,583,000. What the papers do not show is that Tasmania finished up with a credit balance in the loans fund of $2.9m. So, in simple financial terms, the end of the financial year 1976-77 the State Labor Government in Tasmania had $4.4m not unspent. I believe this matter is relevant to the Bill because nearly three months ago",94
296,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I honourable raise a point of order. I do not able member talking about Tasmania but this vious to everybody in has nothing to do with the Commonwealth Tasmanian Liberal MHRs Grants Commission. That is the point I make.

297,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"That is right. Mr Deputy Speaker, my entire speech is taken from the report of the Commonwealth Grants ComMHR. mission. The point I am making is that if amendment does not go through the Parliament the situation is that the Grants Commission canfight not operate after 30 November. I am pointing 10 December. out that some States may wish to make cation to the Grants Commission. Indeed, it matter of history that following the June Prembeen iers Conference",94
298,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS, Denison is saying. Order! I think Tasmania is still a State of the Commonwealth.,94

300,Mr KEATING,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

The fact is",94

If he has been misrepresented he will have an opportunity after this speech to point out where he has at been misrepresented and to make a personal explanation. He knows that misrepresentation is a point of order and I ask him not to take points of order when he knows it is not correct to do so.,94
302,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"I did not evenflatterthe member by mentioning him by mind the honourname.

303,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"The point I am about to make is the fundamental one. The Labor Party Tasmania. At the moment it is running a a 'Hate Tasmania' campaign. I just want to make Lionel Bowen-What relevance has this of Mr HODGMAN-They just cannot take it. They have never forgotten Bass, they have never forgotten Franklin, Braddon, Denison or Wilnever mot, and by heavens, they will remember them for many years to come. The oflicial figures show that in the lastfinanicalyear Tasmania had money running out of its ears. It could not all the money it got from Canberra under our federalism policy. On the books, if one can lieve the books, there was a surplus of $4.4m, and thefigureof $8m has been freely mentioned. One can see the absolute rage of honourable members opposite because they have been claiming that Tasmania was not getting any more than it would have received under Whitlam formula. I want to conclude by putting the lie to that once and for all. The situation is that since Government's new federalism policy was introParliament duced Tasmania has received more each year than it would have received under the Whitlam formula. It is a downright lie to mania we had to fall back on the guarantee. It will be recalled that at the of April and June last year a ten into the federalism agreement that if under the tax sharing arrangements the amount ever came below what would have been payable under the Whitlam formula, then the Whitlam figures would be paid. In the last two years amount Tasmania has received has exceeded amount it would have received under the Whidam formula. That creates a very interesting situation. On the one hand, we have a Labor Premier and a Labor Treasurer complaining Tasmania is not receiving a fair deal. In 1975 Tasmania made two applications to the Grants Commission for reconsideration as a claimant State. By thetimethis Government's federalism able memberpolicy came into effect Tasmania was doing so well, and I quote from the Grants Commission report, 'that Tasmania actually withdrew plication for special assistance . That is est compliment that could ever to the federalism policy of this Government. lieve that when a State puts in a claim for special assistance and then realises that it has done well",94

Whitlam). We believe that he is the greatest asset we have going. beOn behalf of the people ofTasmania, let me say that I hope he makes many visits to our State between now and 10 December. As my friend, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), has said, the moretimeshe comes the larger our vote will be.

I Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (11.27)-The Opposition supports the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill. I remind the House very quickly of what this Bill is about. The Homeless Persons Assistance Bill was introduced in November 1974 by the then Minister for Social Security, Bill Hayden, on the basis of a report of a working party on homeless men and women. The report recommended, amongst other things, capital grants should be made avaUable In Committee over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local and statutory authorities for approved projects such as night shelters, reception and assistance centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accom1974, modation and to build new facilities for manently and chronically homeless men and women. In addition, the Bill provided for the monwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary social worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. Approved organisations could be paid a daily subsidy at prescribed rates each homeless person to whom both food and accommodation were provided. That subsidy amounted to 75c a day. A subsidy of 20c was provided for each meal supplied to non-resident homeless persons. Of course, many organisations such as the Salvation Army took advantage of the money available under this legislation. The working party which had recommended the they introduction of this legislation also recthe ommended that the program should be reviewed after three years and therefore that provisions of the Act relating to capital tal grants remain operative until 13 December 1977. What has happened now, in fact, is that the Government feels, because of the calling of the early election, it has not been able to come decision on the recommendation of the so-called Bailey report-the report of the Task Force Co-ordination in Health and Welfare-in which it is suggested that there be a much wider homein less persons assistance program incorporated in what is called a sheltered accommodation prohas gram and some re-organisation, with the help of the State governments. I am not impressed by that recommendation of the Bailey report. I think that it has been made basically in response to a Federal Government proposition that the cost of many or all of these schemes be handed over to the States. It is not really intended make the schemes more efficient. It is intended save money for the Federal Government. As of 30 June this year financial support has been given towards the running costs of 95 homeless people centres with a total bed capacity of 3,102, so obviously a large number of people are benefiting by it. It is an essential service. I do not want at this stage of the evening to involved in the more general question of refuges and as to whether they ought to be subsidised about under this Act or from the Community Health Centre grant or other grants which are adminislation tered by the Department of Health, as most the refuges are at this time, and as the Minister the table would know. I would urge the Governexamine ment to look at the prescribed rates that are available for approved organisations. At present the prescribed rate, which was introduced in is 75c a day for each homeless person to perwhom both food and accommodation is provided, and only 25c for each meal supplied to non-resident homeless persons. I think everyCombody in Australia would agree that these a amounts are inadequate. They probably were adequate back in 1974 when the legislation was introduced, but there should be some method of for indexation so that the Salvation Army or other appropriate organisationranningthese hostels or other accommodation and providing the food gets a larger supplement from the Government. The total sum involved is very small and it would only be fair if at Budget time, when we are looking at the proposition of indexing taxation for people who are relatively lucky, in the sense that are earning taxable income, we also look at proposition that we should index subsidies for those destitute persons who are covered the major under this legislation. and ren Mr LLOYD (Murray) (11.32)-The Bill extends the Homeless Persons Assistance Act for an additional 12 months. Originally, the legislation was to have effect for three years, after which there was to be a review. The review has to a taken place and recommendations have been made to widen in some ways the scope of the on scheme. However, the Government is still considering the Bailey task force recommendations the general health and welfare area. Therefore, it is only sensible that since the Government not yet reached a decision on these matters, including the future of the Homeless Persons Assistance Act, in relation to health and welfare generally, the existing legislation should continue for a further 12 months. This will permit the continuation of various subsidies, and the completion of some of the capital programs into volved. It is a sensible step and I commend the to Minister for Social Security for ensuring the continuation of the Act and removing any concern that voluntary organisations may have in that regard. I therefore support the Bill.",98
386,Mr BRYANT,HOMELESS PERSONS ASSISTANCE," I want to raise several new points about this matter. First, I think it is indicative of the way in which the get country has been administered over the last few months that we are arriving at this decision the life of this legislation at this late hour, just as we were two hours back considering legisto correct a redistribution. I would like to of raise with honourable members the possibility at that there are other ways in which we should this problem; that perhaps Parliament has not sufficient opportunity to examine the problem, .which in many respects is a very difficult one. What exactly is a homeless person? Although there is a definition here, it is quite vague and the application of the Act must fore be vague. We had an example of that in Canberra a couple of years back m the case of Reid House. was alleged by community groups that there were large numbers of homeless people in this city. Therefore when thetimecame to remove initiatives Reid House from the city, a ban was put upon removal and we could not get anything started, so we decided to renovate it and spend a fair of money to that end. I went there one evening after the House adjourned to see what kind of people were using it as their refuge. I suppose there were 12 or 15 people there. When we sat down we talked in a friendly way in a relaxed mosphere. Two of them were actually residence because they were homeless people. The other 10 or 13 were young students and other people from round about who were on the committee for homeless people. Scattered throughout Australia are large numbers of folk who find it difficult settled lives. Therefore there is a great need for accommodation for homeless people. Some of the need has nothing to do with people's financial situations. For instance, Hanover Welfare forthwith. Services in Melbourne runs an extensive organisBill ation including Gordon House, a very large institution with 200 or 300 beds. It has no difficulty in finding people to use that accommodation and therepay the very moderate costs involved. I hope that the House will apply itself to this matter more thoroughly. Perhaps a welfare comIt mittee of this House or an appropriate Senate committee could examine the matter so that we can provide money in such a way as to fulfil the taken three years ago. It is disappointits ing that so many of the programs which the Labor Government launched have been affected. sum They have not exactly come to a halt-som e have not even been dismantled-bu t progress has been minimal. This is a serious reflection upon the way the country is run. I should think that the last two years have been the most sterile for a atCommonwealth government in the history of in Australian federation. Question resolved in the affirmative.

387,Mr HUNT,HOMELESS PERSONS ASSISTANCE,"The answer to the honourable normal member's question is as follows: (1) On 9 February 1977, the part-time Quarantine Officer at Broome informed the Director of Health, Western Australia, that a rat had been seen on the M.V. San Pedro Bay. The Director instructed the Quarantine Inspector, North-West Ports, to investigate the report. On 10 February 1977, the Quarantine Inspector, North-West Ports, reported that the vessel was infested with rats and cockroaches and that in his opinion the vessel required fumigation. It is not departmental policy in Western Australia to order fumigation of vessels at outports. Fremantle is the only Western Australian port which can issue an International Deratization Certificate; fumigation facilities are not available at these ports, and in any event, fumigation as a rodent control NA upon notice were circulated: measure is a dangerous and costly procedure which is not recommended where adequate alternatives exist. (World Health Organisation publication 'Vector Control in Inter(Question No. 496) national Health', page 72 refers). The San Pedro Bay is a small (21 metre) vessel, has no holds and has minimal crew accommodation at deck level. Accordingly, and in the light of the report of the Quarantine Inspector, North-West Ports, he was instructed on 11 February to treat the vessel by trapand poisoning. The operauon was commenced on the The Quarantine Inspector, North-West Ports, reon 14 February 1977 that no rats were caught or far as they relate to found poisoned. (2) Under long-standing instructions which are operative in Western Australia, fumigation orders may only be issued with the specific approval of the Director or the Assistant Director (Medical). A fumigation order was not issued by the Director or the Assistant Director (Medical) in relation to the M.V. San Pedro Bay nor was the issue of an order apby either officer. In response to an inquiry on 11 February 1977 the Director advised the owner that fumigation was not being considered. On 16 February 1977, folof lowing advice for the owner that wharf workers in Broome would not service the vessel or allow it to come alongside, because they had heard that it was rat infested the Director advised the wharfinger, Broome, by telegram that there was no quarantine objection to the vessel being brought alongside provided that the vessel was tendered from the wharf (Question No. 1047) for a distance of not less that three feet; that it either anchored out at night or if alongside, her gangway was conwell lit and all ropes from the vessel to the wharf were fitted with adequate rat guards. Some days later the vessel to was fumigated by a team taken to Broome from Perth by the The Director assumed that in the light of his instructions and advice to the owner, the fumigation was being arranged at the initiative of the owner to overcome continuing union objections to working the vessel. However, in early April, the owner approached the Department seeking recovery of the fumigation costs. The Director subsequently ascertained that the master of the San Pedro Bay had been directed in writing to proceed to Fremantle to enable his vesto be fumigated. The letter had been signed by a medical practitioner acting as a locum for the Quarantine Medical in Broome. The locum was not a Quarantine Officer. the doctor who signed the written instruction, has that his signature was requested by the Quarantine Inspector, North-west Ports, who informed him that there was evidence of an excessive number of rats on If board the ship and that fumigation was mandatory under the circumstances. Dr Gilbert accepted the Quarantine Inspector's statements and directions to be representative of procedure. (3) The existence of the written direction referred to in (2) was not known to the Director of Health or the Assistant Director (Medical) until early April. The direction was not withdrawn by the doctor who signed it. In a letter dated 23 June 1977 to the Director of Health, the legal representatives for the owner of the vessel advised, in part, 'Inspector Toomer instructed those on board the San Pedro Bay to ignore the fumigation order and to proceed to Port Hedland where he would supervise the fumigation'. The firm which undertook the fumigation has advised that no rats were seen before or after the fumigation and that no rat carcasses were found. (4) See (2) above. There was no diseaseriskto wharf workers in working the vessel. Trapping, poisoning and fumigation operations on the vessel had failed to locate a single rat. (5) The San Pedro Bay was fumigated. The vessel was granted prauque on 7 February 1977 and subsequendy issued with a Derat Exemption full report on all aspects of the incident was sought from the Quarantine Inspector, North-West Ports. The Quarantine Inspector, North-West Ports, has advised that because of his suspension from duty it is impossible for him to report on the San Pedro Bay. The claim from the owner for recovery of costs of fumigating the San Pedro Bay has been referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor, Perth.

With regard to organisations Societies Act apart from the Friendly Society referred to hereunder, the position is that, in general, contributors to these funds do not per se have friendly societies' affairs including administration of health funds. Control is vested in lodge membership. Members of lodges elect their office bearers bodies which in turn elect their directorate. Contributors to such funds are not required to be members of the societies. The following sets out the position regarding those organisations which make some provision for the election of governing boards by contributors, either by way of thenrules, Memorandum and Articles of Association or such: Cheetham Hospital Benefits Fund (registered under the Friendly Societies Act)-The ation shall be governed by a committee of five members elected by contributors at the annual general meeting.

The Hospital Benefits Association Ltd-The organisation's Memorandum and Articles of Association provide to State New South Wales Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania the effect that all members of the company must have been contributors for at least three years prior to becoming a member of the association. Of the 24 association members, eight are elected by the contributors at a public meeting of contributors. From the 24 members, 11 are drawn each year to form a board of directors. The board must include four of the members elected by the contributors. Latrobe Valley Hospitals and Health Services Association-In accordance with the organisation's Constitution the Management Committee consists of a maximum of 12 members. Before a contributor is entitled to vote in or contest elections of directors of the governing body (Council) he must first be an Association member. Any person, whether or not a medical or hospital fund contributor may become an Association member by paying an annual subscription of $2.00. Mildura District Hospital and Medical Fund-The organisation's constitution provides that the control shall be vested in a Committee of not more than six contributors who shall be elected by contributors for a period of three years.

In many cases only a limited amount of information is available and to date no information has been received from Victoria. The Victorian hospital authorities have advised that the information will be furnished as soon as possible and on its receipt I will be pleased to forward it on to the honourable member. Some hospital authorities are unable to separate or have experienced difficulties in separating out from total operating costs, those costs associated with non-inpatient (outpatient) services. Accordingly, the methods used to produce the tables vary from State to State and the figures are not entirely comparable; nor is it possible to produce a meaningful figure for Australia as a whole from the information supplied. Further, there is variation between States as to their ability to segregate costs into the categories referred to in part (2) of the honourable member's question.
