2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That restoration of provisions that applied prior to the 1978-79 Budget is of vital concern to offset the rising cost of goods and services. The reason advanced by the Government for yearly payments 'that the lower level of inflation made twice-yearly payments inappropriate' is not valid. Great injury will be caused to 920,000 aged, invaUd, widows and supporting parents, who rely solely on the pension or whose income, other per week. Once-a-year payments strike a cruel blow to their expectation and make a mockery of a solemn election pledge. Accordingly, your petitioners call upon their legislators to: 1. Restore twice-yearly pension adjustments in the Autumn session. 2. Raise pensions and unemployed benefits above the poverty level to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Armitage, Dr Edwards and Mr Martin. Petitions received. Taxation: Tax Agents To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble peuuon of Bongiomo & Associates respectfuUy showeth: That current requirements of the Commissioner of Taxation for the lodgement of Income Tax Returns by Registered Tax Agents restricts the trading of such agents to a period of 8 months in anyfiscalyear. The demands by the Commissioner for lodgement ofincome Tax Returns before 28 February following the tax year is an imposition and a restriction, Umiting the trading from twelve to eight months. Your Peuuoners therefore humbly pray that the law should be amended to permit any registered tax agent to trade for a full year and lodge Income Tax returns to the close of the respective tax year. And your peuuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Aldred. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That we the undersigned, having great concern at the way in which children are now being used in the production of pornography call upon the Government to introduce immediate legislation: 1. To prevent the sexual exploitation of children by way of photography for commercial purposes; PETITIONS 2. To penalise parents/guardians who knowingly allow their children to be used in the production of such pornographic or obscene material depicting children; 3. To make specificaUy illegal the importation, publication, distribution and sale of such pornographic childabuse material in any form whatsoever such as magazines, Pensions novels, papers or films; 4. To take immediate poUce action to confiscate and destroy aU child pornography in Australia and urgent appropriate legal action against aU those involved or profiting from this sordid exploitation of children. of the Social Security Act Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable house wiU protect aU children and immediately prohibit pornographic child-abuse materials, publications or films. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Dobie. Petition received. than the pension, is $6 or less Pensioners: Home Maintenance Loans To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That it is necessaiy for the Commonwealth Government to renew for a further term of at least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1975/77, renewed for one year expiring on the 30th June 1978. The demand for dwelUngs has not slackened as the waiting list (all States) of 12,060 single and 4,120 couples as at the 30th June 1977, showeth. Your petitioners respectfully draw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to the Repon of the Committee of Inquiiy into Aged Persons' Housing 1975 under the Chairmanship of the Rev. K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to meet the demand for low-rental accommodation in the proportion of $4 for $1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and That the Act include married pensioners eligible for supplementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Repon and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements of the prospective tenants in the location and design of such dwellings. Furthermore, your petitioners desire to draw the Government's attention to the hardship of many pensioner home owners caused by the high cost of maintenance. The Social Security Annual Repon 1976-77 shows that 24.6% or 283,000 home owning pensioners, have a weekly income in excess of the pension of less than $6 per week. Your petitioners strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to establish a fund whereby loans can be made to means tested pensioners for the purpose of effecting necessaiy maintenance to their homes. Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administrative costs Child Pornography and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a single pensioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners jointly own the dwelUng. Administration to be carried out by local government bodies. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Edwards. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That in his 1977 election speech the Prime Minister supported by a majority of Members of the House of Representatives gave an undertaking that in exchange for electoral suppon he would guarantee the retention of twiceyearly adjustments of social security pensions in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index. (2) That this undertaking of the Prime Minister and a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives has been repudiated causing severe hardship to pensioners. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will take action to require those Members who have not honoured their undertaking, to resign from the Parliament in order that the people of Australia can choose Members who will represent the wishes of the electors and who wiU honour any undertakings they gave. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Holding. Petition received. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of we the undersigned fully showeth: That we oppose any expansion of the facilities of Kingsford Smith Airport which entails the building of a new runway as it would have the following detrimental effects: (1) The loss of one mile of waterfront including Lady Robinson's Beach and a huge part of Botany Bay. (2) The loss of up to 1,230 remaining neighbouring properties. (3) The creation of more noise pollution in the area. (4) The creation of more traffic congestion on streets leading to and from the airport. (5) The forced diversion age to the ecology of the area. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will not consider satisfying the airpon needs of Sydney by extending Kingsford-Smith Airpon and that any decisions related thereto are portunity for adequate consultation with any community particularly affected. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: The proposed introduction of a Retail Turnover Tax will1. Impose an intolerable burden on retailers-seriousl y inconvenience shoppers and prove difficult and expensive to administer. 2. Increase the cost to consumers of clothing, food and other goods essential to maintenance of an adequate Pensions standard of Uving. 3. Place a disproportionate tax burden on Australians least able to pay. Your petitioners humbly pray that the Members in the House assembled will not introduce indirect tax measures such as a Retail Turnover Tax or the administratively more difficult Value Added Tax as to do so would exacerbate the inequaUties in our taxing system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Seals To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of Parliament. We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully ask the Australian Government to make known to the Canadian Government our disgust and horror of the inhumane slaughter of the Harp seal pups, and equal disgust of anyone who condones such practice. And your petitioners as in duty bound will every pray, by Mr Lucock. Petition received.

Petition received. of Cook's River and further damNA BHUTTO, FORMER PRIME MINISTER NA",16
3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OF PAKISTAN," I move: not taken before there is an opThat this House notes with regret the death on 4 April 1979 of Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, formerly Prime Minister of Pakistan. Mr Bhutto ruled Pakistan from 1971 to 1977. He was executed after last minute appeals for clemency were rejected by the Pakistan authorities. A Taxation petition to review his case had been rejected by the Pakistan Supreme Court on 24 March. Honourable members wdl be aware that many countries and international organisations over the past 12 months have appealed for clemency for Mr Bhutto on humanitarian grounds. Australia made an appeal in April 1978 and again in February of this year. There are many divisions and conflicts within nadons, but we do not beheve that the execution of pohtical leaders can contribute to resolving these conflicts. Rather itrisksmaking them deeper and more enduring. Certainly Mr Bhutto was a controversial figure. He was prominent internationally because of his energetic espousal of issues concerning developing countries. I know he had warm support from many Third World nations, a number of whose leaders had spoken to me about his impending fate, asking whether there was more that could be done to avert it. Whatever views may be held about his attainments during his term as his country's leader, we regret that the appeals for clemency were not accepted and we deeply regret his execution. Mr Speaker, I ask that you convey to the members ofhis family the condolences of this House. Honourable members-Hear ! hear!",17
4,Mr HAYDEN,OF PAKISTAN,"Zulfika r Ali Bhutto was a brilliant lawyer and pohtician, a former Prime Minister of Pakistan, latterly treated as a felon, and most cently executed in what many have described as judicial murder. That is something on which I cannot deUberate and I believe that no other honourable member in this House can do so properly. We are too far removed from the scene and events, and we know too Utde about them. All one can observe is that there were some remarkable shifts by the judiciary and that some say that promotions which occurred subsequendy were not unconnected with services rendered. Dead, Mr Bhutto is a more potent political force than he was aUve. There is undoubted evidence that his charismatic appeal which too was undoubted, had been contracting in recent times. His execution, however, catapaults him to the head of domestic martyrs in the pantheistic order of local pohtical heroes in his country. Bhutto's death, the manner of his imprisonment, trial, conviction and execution leave fancause for disquiet. They are matters of the most serious concern not only for Pakistan but for the international community. Bhutto was a flawed national hero. He was arrogant, authoritarian and on all accounts a hopeless economic administrator. He could brutally brush aside those who stood in his way. After all, these are human flaws not unknown in politics in varying degrees even perhaps in this country in some ways in some places at some times, but they cannot be presented in exculpation for Bhutto's ultimate fate. Neither can the presented evidence of his being an accomplice to an alleged murder-a n unusual, and indeed I am told unique, judgment in Pakistan for a person not physicaUy involved in a murder-be accepted as sufficient justification for the ultimate judgment passed upon Bhutto. It is a matter of melancholy regret that appeals for clemency which came from throughout the international order were rejected by the Pakistan Government. The Opposition joins with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in expressing condolences to the surviving members of Zulfikar AU Bhutto's famUy.",18
5,Mr LES JOHNSON,OF PAKISTAN,"I rise simply to place on record the fact that in 19741 had the honour to lead a pariiamentary delegation to Pakistan which was received by Mr Bhutto. I think it is appropriate for me to say on behalf of the members of that delegation that we were enormously impressed with the dignified bearing of this man, his demeanour, the hospitaUty that he extended to the parhamentary delegation and the very great interest and concern he expressed about our country. I am sure those of us who spent in excess of an hour with him on that occasion must treat the event of yesterday with re- the utmost significance and importance. We mourn his passing and sincerely hope that Pakistan wiU not suffer as a consequence.",18
6,Mr HODGMAN,OF PAKISTAN,"History will probably recaU that the death in Rawalpindi yesterday of Zulfikar AU Bhutto was most notable for its tragic futility. The predetermined ending of any human Ufe is always a matter of profound regret. Mr Bhutto's death ended the distinguished though controversial career of a brilliant scholar, lawyer, politician and statesman. It is not my right to pass a detaUed judgment on his achievements or his faults. The distinguished Oxford academic, Professor H. R. Trevor-Roper unhesitatingly described Mr Bhutto as one of the most brilliant students he had ever known, and it is not without significance that the first official guest invited to Pakistan by Mr Bhutto after he was elected Prime Minister was his old mentor Professor Trevor-Roper. The controversy over Mr Bhutto's guUt or innocence, the impartiaUty or otherwise of the proceedings at his trial and subsequent appeal hearings, and the treatment of the man during his 20-month incarceration which ended so abruptly yesterday are matters which only history will resolve. The sadness of the whole affair is that the voices of countless nations and world leaders were not, in the ultimate, heard, nor was their counsel heeded. I am proud of the fact that Australia, through its distinguished Mmister for Foreign Affairs, did speak out loudly and clearly on this issue and that today, in sadness, this Parliament formally records its deep regret at the passing of Zulfikar Ah Bhutto.",18
7,Mr BARRY JONES,OF PAKISTAN,"Bhutto's execution is a black mark in history-on e more act of mindless violence. If there is one lesson that history should teach us, it is that controversial political and social issues cannot be resolved by violence-that violence begets more violence. Mr Bhutto was certainly no saint, plaster or otherwise, but he deserved a better fate than the one that he met yesterday. Also, it is not just a matter of thinking of Bhutto himself, but of aU of the hundreds of other Pakistanis who have also been executed-no t all of them well known, their trials not subject to the same kind of scrutiny of world attention that Mr Bhutto's trial and execution has had. We need to be very concerned about the situation in Pakistan, and hi many countries of the Middle East and elsewhere in which violent penalties are exacted. The circumstances of his trial and execution, and particularly the humiliations heaped on Mr Bhutto in his last months, suggest that he has been the victim of judicial murder. I conclude by reminding the House of the words that I quoted last year when the honoursubjected able member for MCMillan (Mr Simon) and I oU proposed for discussion a matter of public portance concerning political prisioners, those John Donne: And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls for the.",19

10,Mr WILSON,CANBERRA AND WODEN HOSPITALS,"I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That this House requests the Expenditure Committee to conduct an inquiry into the financial management and establishments of the Canberra and Woden hospitals report to this House on the extent to which savings could achieved without adversely affecting the provision of priate standards of care; and ies into the financial management and staff establishments the public hospitals in each of the States.

11,Mr HAYDEN,PETROL PRICES,"I ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs: Is it a fact that, since November last, the average price of petrol sold in Sydney has risen by some 7.3c a gaUon more than increases in the maximum retaU price, largely as a result of actions by the oU companies in raising the wholesale price to discounters? Do these price increases, over and above increases aUowed by the Prices Justification Tribunal, mean increases in oU company revenue of $78m on an annual basis from sales in New South Wales? Do they mean increases of up to $23 lm when appUed throughout Austraha? In view of the massive profit gains that oU companies have made in this way at motorists' expense, will the Minister refer immediately the cessation of petrol discounting to the Prices Justification Tribunal for mquiry? Finally, will he give an assurance that petrol price increases wdl remain subject to notification to the PJT?",19
12,Mr FIFE,PETROL PRICES,"The Leader of the Opposition raises a number of questions in relation to petrol pricing in Australia. I preface my reply to him by saying that no industry in Australia has been to more price inquiries than have the industries. The oU industry at present is subimject to a wide-ranging inquiry following a of notification by the Shell oU company. The inquiry has been conducted over a long period. I tolls; it anticipate that within the next week or so the Prices Justification Tribunal will make public the decisions following that inquiry. I feel sure that most of the matters which have been raised by in the Leader of the Opposition have been canvassed before the Prices Justification Tribunal in the course of the SheU mquiry. I anticipate that the will address itself to those issues in its report. Regarding the specific question raised by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to notification, I did advise the House, in response to another question a day or so ago, that the oU inNotice of Motion dustry will be subjected to continual monitoring by the PJT after the amending legislation has passed through aU stages of this Parliament and has received royal assent. I said on that occasion that I had not determined in what way the od staff industry would be subjected to monitoring by the and to PJT but that I would discuss the matter with the be State Ministers concerned with pricing. I believe approthat it is not in the best interests of the industry, then to conduct sinular inquirof nor the consuming pubUc, for the industry to be subjected to inquiry in a number of places. In other words, I beheve that if the Prices Justification Tribunal is to have this responsibiUty, the industry should not be subjected to simUar inquiry by State Ministers concerned with prices. This morning I discussed the matter briefly with the New South Wales Mmister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Einfeld, because I want to raise the matter tomorrow in Sydney at a meeting of State Ministers responsible for consumer affairs. The matter will be discussed tomorrow at the meedng of Ministers and I hope that within a short time it will be possible to indicate to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House the precise way in which in the future the oU companies will be subjected to PJT scrutiny. I also reiterate what I said on Tuesday when I answered a simUar quesuon. I said that I propose to have discussions with representauves of the oU industry, consumer groups and the retaU secdon of the industry. The meeting with oU industry representatives will take place today. NA",19
13,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Does the MinIndustry ister for Industrial Relations remember the stance of an amendment to section 22 of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act in 1972 which provided that the powers of concUiation should be executed by commissioners and that the powers of arbitration should be executed by presidential members and arbitration comthe missioners? Is he aware that one of the reasons for the change was to ensure that guideline dethat cisions of a FuU Bench should be binding on cUiation commissioners in particular cases? Is aware that the law was substantially 1973 to neutralise the effect of this change but retained the separate concUiation and arbitration functions? In the light of the damage to the economy, particularly in the areas of inflation and employment, as a result of a decision of Commean missioner Deverell who disobeyed the guideUnes determined by the Full Bench in a work value case, will the Government take action to restore the 1972 amendment to ensure that Full Bench country decisions establishing guideUnes to be applied generally are applied in particular logs of claims by concUiation commissioners and that if concUienergy ation faUs the log will be referred to the Full Bench or a member of the FuU Bench for the puposes of arbitration?",20
14,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is true that in 1972,1 think was, an amendment was made to the Conciliposition ation and Arbitration Act which divided the weeks. powers of concUiation and arbitration. I must say that whilst the principle established by that change to the Act sounded good, it was not very successful in practice. Circumstances have changed, and the point raised by the right honourable member in relation to wage decisions which generate pressures for increases outside national wage case hearings, is causing particular concern to the Government. As I understood his question, there are two elements to it. The first relates to the division of concUiation and arbitration powers which, as I said, has been tried and was not successful in practice. The second relates to the principle that once guidelines are established by a Full Bench decision, certain processes should follow. That is an interesting pomt and I would be prepared to consider it carefully. NA",20
15,Dr JENKINS,OIL PRICES,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Did the right honourable gentleman say in his address to the Australian Mining Council on Monday night that attempts subby some countries to insulate their economies from movements in international oU prices had led them to use excessive amounts of energy and made their ultimate adjustment to reality more painful? If so, does this indicate the Government's wUlingness to adjust Australian prices to full reality of the latest change in pricing by the Organisation of Petroleum Export Countries is, the general price rise plus the new quality conpremium? What does the Government envisage he wiU be the effect on petrol prices as a result of amended in these changes?",20
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OIL PRICES,"In thefirstpart of his question the honourable gendeman quoted some remarks from a speech to the Australian unMining Industry Council and those remarks just what they say, that is, that if a major country pursues policies involving the maintenance of the price of its domestic oU suppUes significantly below the world parity price, that will use more than its fair share of a finite world energy resource. If that country happens to be perhaps the world's major user of that finite resource, then its overuse of afiniteworld resource is all the more serious. It is therefore something that concerns not only the country in question but also every nation concerned about the adequacy of oU supplies. As to the other part of the honourable gentleman's question, I have it nothing to add to the statements made and the indicated by my colleague over recent NA",20
17,Mr BAUME,STATE ROAD MAINTENANCE TAXES,"I ask the Minister for Transport whether he is aware of the blockages of roads in my electorate by protesting truck owner-drivers who are suffering severe financial difficulties because of unfair State road taxes? Has the Minister seen a report that the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Cox, said that the New South Wales Government would be prepared to drop its road maintenance tax if the Federal Government agreed to reimburse the State in full? Will the Commonwealth Government be giving consideration to this proposal?",21
18,Mr NIXON,STATE ROAD MAINTENANCE TAXES,"I have, of course, become aware of the difficulties caused to the honourable member's electorate and the people in it by the action taken by the truckies on the highways going through the honourable member's electorate. This matter has a long history. It has been discussed several times by Commonwealth and State Ministers at meetings of the Austrahan Transport Advisory Council at which I put the view quite strongly to the States that this was an inequitable tax and an ineffective tax in that a great number of trucking companies were avoiding it by setting up straw companies. I pointed out that it was quite within the competence of the State governments to abolish that tax should they so desire and that with the increase in general revenue assistance grants from the Commonwealth, the net collections from the tax would be a mere drop in the ocean. The State Ministers argued quite vehemently that they could not do without the tax and that it was necessary. Some of the State Ministers fortunately took the matter on board and obviously have given better consideration to it than the New South Wales Government has done. Yesterday I received a call from the Premier of Queensland, early in the morning, quite fairly asking me what implications it would have the general relationship between States i Queensland were to abolish the road maintenan ance tax. I was able to say to him, quite fairly, that it would have no effect at all because, in fact, already Tasmama does not have that tax and national therefore, no difficulty would be created. I did say to the Premier in passing that I thought Premiers had been completely lousy and miseragriculture able in their approach to this question. I pened to mention that I thought New South ive Wales, in particular, had brought on itself everyexporting thing that has happened to it. I also said that thought it was strange that the New South Wales Premier was very quick to move in with fines against self-employed truckies and yet unionists have been playing havoc on the waterfront at the coal loaders for months and he has done nothing about it. It is a typical instance of the approach taken by the New South Wales Government. As to the financial impact, the truth is that the Queensland Premier-bein g the statesman that he is-recognise d quite quickly that Queensland's road maintenance tax ought to be abolished. I was glad that yesterday the Queensland Cabinet agreed with the Premier. After a conversation with the Prime Minister and one or two other Premiers he proceeded to abolish the tax. The sooner New South Wales faces up to its proper responsibility and abolishes the tax, the better it wdl be for everybody concerned.

19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION PLACED ON NOTICE,"Order! There is an implication against persons designated by name. The question will have to go on the Notice Paper. Mr Barry Jones- Mr Speaker, may I address you?",21
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION PLACED ON NOTICE,Order! I have already ruled. Mr Barry Jones- I wish to take a point of order. The point of order is that the question has been on the Notice Paper since 15 November 1978.1 was refreshing the Minister's memory.,21
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION PLACED ON NOTICE,Order! The honourable member wdl resume his seat or I wdl deal with him. EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY: NA NA,21
22,Mr HYDE,IMPORTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. Are the variable for levies on imports of agricultural produce f imposed by the European Economic Community unreasonable barrier to international trade? Is Austrahan orange juice an agricultural product? Are Austrahan variable levies a barrier to intertrade and, if not, what is their purpose?",21
23,Mr SINCLAIR,IMPORTS,"The system of protection some that has been constituted through the common pohcy of the European Economic hapCommunity has had a number of prime regresseffects on world trade. Certainly for primary countries such as Australia and New I Zealand the barriers have meant the closure of not only traditional markets in the European heavy Economic Community but also they have the meant-throug h the appUcation of subsidies through the variable levy system, which is quite different from the system appUcable to citrus goods in Australia- a buUd up of surpluses to the detriment of trade in Third World countries, so that the effect of CAP has been both direct in its adversity, in that markets have been closed to traditional exporters, and indirect in that through the subsidising of inefficient producers and the budding up of surpluses it has led to the prejudice of traditional and developing markets elsewhere in the world. The system introduced for citrus in Australia, first of all, has an upper hmit which is not in existence as far as variable levies appUcable through the Commonwealth agricultural policies are concerned. Secondly, it is designed so that Australian consumers wdl be protected at the time when the product is avaUable overseas at a price which is competitive with production costs in Australia. The reason for the introduction of this form of protection which, as I said, is quite distinct from the variable levy appUed in the European Economic Community, because of the presence of an upper limit on the variable levy, has been to ensure that the industry, which is so important in so many major producing areas of this country, should be able to survive against competition from particularly low-cost labour countries in which production has increased significantly. I believe that the purpose of the levy justified. It is distinct from the concept appUed in the EEC and certainly none of the consequences which have flowed from the common agricultural policy is likely to follow in the appUcation of this form of assistance to Australian citrus producers.",21
24,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,IMPORTS,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister and refer him to his answer to me yesterday, in which he said that the ParUacessions ment was the proper place in which to advise the Australian people of any industrial concessions which have been traded for agricultural cessions from the United States of America. I ask the Prime Minister: If, as reported this morning by the Australian Financial Review, he already has received comprehensive advice from the Deputy Prime Minister on jobs which will be affected in the tobacco, machinery, data processtiations, ing, textile, refrigeration, tractor, raUway chinery and other industries, why did he not advise the Parliament yesterday? I further ask: Why has the Prime Minister continued since tries May 1978 to refuse to provide to the Parliament the advice given to the Government on the imAustraUa pact on industry of the Government's 40 per cent tariff cut and tariff binding offer? Finally, why did the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister choose to make misleading or inflated claims of trade negotiation",22
25,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTS,Order! The question wdl be ruled out of order if the honourable gendeman proceeds in that manner and continues to make insinuations in his question. He may ask for information.,22
26,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,IMPORTS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Finally, I ask the Prime Minister Why is he making statements about this matter outside the Parhament and refusing to answer questions in the Parliament when jobs are affected?",22
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,IMPORTS,"Any statements which have been made about this subject have been accurate. In broad terms, the honourable gentleman in his question regarding the 40 per cent tariff offer made in our participation in the full round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade multilateral trade negotiations-ha s implied or suggested- I hope not deliberately-that a much greater movement in tariffs will take place than in fact is the case. A unUateral 25 per cent tariff cut was made by a previous Adrninistration, for which it received no credit at all in any trade negotiations. The Commonwealtii has insisted that that should be taken into account in is the total arrangement which we would consider. The Commonwealth has insisted in addition that any modification to tariffs must be on the basis of a reduction of a smaU percentage a year for five or six years on a mandatory basis. On the basis of average tariffs around the world, this would come out as something like half a percentage point tariff cut in those areas which are involved TARIFFS for five years, with the rest of the program being voluntary. That was the basis on which Australia was prepared to participate in the MTN. It was on the basis of full reciprocity-for whatever conwe gave to other countries there would have to be adequate reciprocal advantages to us. All these matters will be taken into account in conany such negotiations. There are implications for a negotiation with the United States of America, a negotiation with Japan and a negotiation with Europe. It is not particularly helpful, in the midst of such negofor detaUs to be sought of any agreemament which might have been reached. In adso dition to that, of course, there is a need for ratification through parliaments of certain counand the congress of others of the total position which might be arrived at, not only with but also with other countries. So, whilst the bUateral negotiations between Australia and a number of countries have been moving ahead on a reasonably satisfactory basis, it would not be appropriate for a full statement on the matter to be made to this Parhament until the issues to which I have referred have been concluded. It is not a matter of just one issue being concluded; it is a matter of the processes in other countries being completed and, at the same time, of the imphcadons of negodadons with one bUateral area for another being very fully taken into account. The only other thing that I would add is that, in relation to any assumption that anything that might have been written is in fact an accurate statement of events, I make no claims that it is accurate or inaccurate; I just say that for anything to be assumed to be accurate on this point is damaging to Australia's own negotiating position. Therefore, any assumptions about the accuracy or inaccuracy of the article in the Australian Financial Review at this point would be highly unwise and highly unhelpful to Australia's negotiating position. I am quite certain the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would want Australia to come out of the totaUty of these negotiations with the maximum advantage to all Australia's traders and would accept what I am saying in that light. SOVIET AND UNITED STATES NAVAL by NA",22
28,Mr CALDER,PRESENCE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to reports and to my previous remarks in this place that there has been a significant build-up of Soviet naval forces in the Indian Ocean and that this has, in turn, contributed to a corresponding sideration to increase the United States naval presence in that region. Are the reports and contentions correct? If so, is there also substance to the reports that the United States naval facUitween ties on the British Island of Diego Garcia will expanded?  States of America has increased its naval presentered ence in the Indian Ocean and is considering various options relating to its overall military ANZUS. presence in the region as a response to developments in the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere are correct. So far as United States-Soviet presrequisite ence in the Indian Ocean is concerned, it is known that in recent years the Soviet Union has had more ships, up to approximately 20 at any itical onetimeof which nearly half have been combathe tants. The United States, on the other hand, three ships permanently in the supplemented severaltimesa year by task forces, usually led by an aircraft carrier. This general pattern was broken at the beginning of 1978 when the Soviet Union, in response to its growing involvement in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Ethiopia, significandy increased its naval deployment in the region. In response the United States broke off talks with the Soviet Union which were aimed at stabilising their naval presence in the Indian Ocean. The United States maintained that the increased Soviet deployment in the Indian Ocean breached the unwritten agreement that both parties would maintain restraint for the duration of the hmitation talks. More recent developments in Afghanistan and the Yemens have raised further concern about increased Soviet involvement in the region. The recent upheaval in Iran introduces a new element, ofcourse, of turbulence to the region and opens up further possibilities for foreign interference. In the Middle East too, despite the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, the prospect of continuing tensions and conflict remains. The recent increase in the United States force levels in the Indian Ocean is naturally a direct response to these developments. In this connection honourable members will be aware of reports concerning the possible further development, referred to the honourable member for the Northern Territory in his question, of the United States naval facUity on the British Island of Diego Garcia. I have received advice that to date no firm decisions have been taken in this regard. Australia, of course, is on record as welcoming the talks on the United States-Soviet Union conArms Limitation Agreement in the Indian Ocean which, as I mentioned earlier, were suspended. my We welcomed these talks, provided of course, that any agreement reached was balanced be the two super powers and was consistent be with the security interests of ANZUS. It wdl be recaUed in the latter connection that in 1977 I received a firm and unequivocal assurance from the United States Secretary of State that nothing into between the United States and the Soviet Union would qualify the operation of FinaUy, it needs to be recognised that a prefor any agreement, such as talks bewell tween the Soviet Union and the United States that might be resumed, would be a degree of polstability in the region which is not there at moment. Recent developments in the area had make the possibUity of such an agreement someIndian Ocean, what more remote. NA NA",23
29,Mr KERIN,GUIDELINES,Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to recent reports that the Government's minerals export control guidelines wdl be withdrawn in the near future? Will the Prime Minister give an assurance that the Government's minerals export pohcy announced last October wdl be retained and that the export control guideUnes will not be abandoned or weakened?,24
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GUIDELINES,"The export control guideUnes were announced by my colleague at a dme of panicular difficulty in certain negotiations. Those negotiations have now concluded. We indicated at the outset that the guideUnes were draft guideUnes for discussion between my colleague, myself and the Premiers and the industry. We indicated also that, as a result of those discussions and as a result of our experience in relation to those guideUnes, the matter would be further reviewed by Cabinet. These processes are in train. I give an absolute commitment to this House that this Government will pursue poUcies designed to maximise the benefits for Australia from the export of its raw materials and resources. The policies that the Government has pursued have achieved that objective over the last three years and they will continue to do so in the future. Quite obviously a particular ation in recenttimescaUed for a particular remedy. The whole matter will be discussed by Cabinet in its own time scale but at an appropriate time. WOOLWORTHS LTD: WAGE INCREASE",24
31,Mr SHORT,GUIDELINES,I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations whether he is aware of reports that storemen and packers employed by Woolworths Limited in Victoria have returned to work following acceptance of an offer by Woolworths of a $10 a week wage increase. Is the Government concerned about the effects of such a decision on the consumer price index? Does the Minister share my concern about wage increases of this nature being granted outside the regular system of national wage case hearings?,24
32,Mr STREET,GUIDELINES,"I am aware of the reports referred to by the honourable member. If they are correct it does mean that Woolworths Ltd has been successful in resisting claims by the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia in respect of company contributions to that union's superannuation fund. However, like the honourable member for Ballarat, the Government is extremely concerned about wage increases conceded outside national wage case hearings. Therefore, we are extremely concerned about the reported settlement arrived at by Woolworths. The Government has already commissioned inquiries by the Prices Justification Tribunal into two items affecting the consumer price index, namely, beef marketing and processing and the price of processed foods. The Woolworths decision will be taken into account by the Government when, through my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, it is considering whether to initiate further inquiries into items affecting the consumer price index.

33,Mr HAYDEN,TAXATION,"The Treasurer will recaU an answer he gave yesterday when he said: The taxation and revenue raising laws of this country should, as far as possible, be neutral towards relative social and society attitudes to various forms of behaviour and various forms of conduct I ask: Is it a fact that since 1975-76 indirect taxes have increased by about $2,450m with half of the increase being attributed to government changes in the rates for indirect tax? Does the relative incidence of such taxes faU more heavUy on those people with lower levels of income? Further, did the February and November income tax changes of last year give a greater relative benefit to people with higher levels of income than to those with lower to middle levels of situincome? Does this mean that, far from being neutral, the revenue raising procedures adopted by this Government have generated greater inequality of income and exacerbated social tensions in the community?",24
34,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,"The Leader of the Opposition has misunderstood my answer and he continues to misunderstand the effect of the present levels of taxation on the Australian community. When I spoke yesterday about the income tax system being neutral as far as possible, I had in mind that the income tax system ought not to express a government view as to whether a particular form of behaviour was desirable or undesirable. Quite obviously the Leader of the Opposition has misunderstood that answer. As he has given me die opportunity of replying to his question, let me point out to him tiiat in suggesting thatrisesin indirect taxation have occurred in recent years it should be borne in mind that they are nominal rises only because, for example, the excise rises that were contained in the last Budget had the effect of restoring the real levels that pertained after increases introduced by one of the Budgets were brought down during the Whidam years. It is a totally false representation of the situation to talk only about the effect of indirect tax increases without acknowledging that side by side with any changes that have occurred in that area have been very significant personal taxation changes. Principal among the effects of those changes in respect of the people of whom the Leader of the Opposition speaks is the fact that under those changes 500,000 Australian people are no longer Uable to pay any income tax.

35,Dr EDWARDS,BYPASS ROAD AROUND HORNSBY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. I refer to representations to the Minister about the urgent need for a major bypass road around Hornsby, north of Sydney. The present Pacific Highway through Hornsby is absurdly inadequate to cope with aU northbound traffic from Sydney which must be funnelled through it and in the event of a heavy traffic accident it could become the scene of a major catastrophe. As an earnest ofhis interest in the problem, will the Mmister visit the area with a view to reaching a decision to extend the national highway, Brisbane to Sydney, which at present ends at Berowra about 10 kUometres north of Hornsby, to Pearce's Corner south of Homsby and thus pave the way for early Federal funding of the work?",25
36,Mr NIXON,BYPASS ROAD AROUND HORNSBY,"The honourable member has projects made representations to me over a period on this matter. Therefore, I am aware of the problems created by the lack of a bypass at Hornsby the difficulties created for the citizens of part, particularly in the shopping centre and dential areas. This matter has been the subject some correspondence between me and the State Minister for Transport, to this point without olution. I think the best thing I can do in all circumstances is to take up the invitation of the honourable member. Therefore, I will try make a visit to Hornsby at sometimein the near future.

Although their names were not used, they are clearly identifiable people. The rules of the House are that when there is an impUcation lation to any named person the question should go on the Notice Paper. Therefore, I rule that question should go on the Notice Paper.",25
38,Mr HAYDEN,QUESTION PLACED ON NOTICE,"I take a point of order. I can draw an analogy with fairly consistent conduct a simUar nature from government members when they indulge in freewheeling attacks on trade unions in this House. It is quite clear who the leaders of the unions are although they are not named. Can we conclude from your ruling that you will treat such questions in future in the same way as you have treated this question, or wdl there be a want of consistency between ruUngs?",25

40,Mr JARMAN,VICTORIA,I ask the Prime Minister Is he aware of the major new industrial and other developments that are to take place in Victoria? WUl he inform the House of the likely effect of these proposals on job opportunities for the people of Victoria?,25
41,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VICTORIA,"In recent months, there has been a number of major investment projects announced affecting the Commonwealth as a whole, including a number of specific investment projects affecting Victoria. These will add significantly to the industrial strength of Australia and the State of Victoria. Clearly, decisions for investments to take place in and that State occurred not only following the that beneficial results of Commonwealth policies resiestablishing an overaU economic cUmate which of is conducive to investment and forward looking poUcies, but also resulting from the pohcy of the resVictorian State Government, which has also conthe sistently supported and encouraged investment in the interests of all the people of Victoria. I wdl to mention some of these major projects. The ICI Austraha Limited has announced a $500m petrochemical plant at Point Wilson. From 1980-81, there will be construction jobs for an average of 600 people each year for five years. will peak at close to 1,000 jobs at the busiest of construction. When the plant is in operof ation by 1985, mere will be about 700 permanent jobs. There is the announcement of the General Motors-Holden's plant, the construction of which rests very considerably on poUcies announced by the Minister for Industry and Comin remerce on behalf of the Government. It is a $220m engine plant at Fishermen's Bend. The the construction of equipment will peak at 1,900 jobs in 1980. There will be 1,000 operating at that GMH plant. In addition there will be nearly of 500 jobs in component supplying companies. There is also the expansion at Altona which is worth $250m. It is Ukely to have a significant impact on jobs and opportunities in Victoria. Then there is the $350m alumina plant to be constructed by the ALCOA group. During the construction stage, 1,000 jobs will be avaUable. During the operational stage, there will be 600 or more jobs avaUable. Those projects indicate the importance of attracting major investments to Victoria and to other States. The attraction of these major investments over recent months is I believe a mark of the success of the Australian Government's policies and of the poUcies of the Victorian Government. It is not just a question of the mvestment; it is not just a question of increased material wealth: It is a question of the job opportunities that are open, the additions to infrastructures and other opportunities for traders who will be encouraged as a result of these very major investments and developments. Of course, during the Labor years we would not have been able to find any investment of this kind being undertaken because Labor killed investment dead. NA NA",25
42,Dr KLUGMAN,ORGANISATIONS,"Mr Speaker, you wdl be pleased to hear that I have changed the wording of my question which is directed to the Minister for Health. In view of the fact that in answer to my question on notice No. 3155, which he answered last week, when he agreed that registered health insurance organisations can invest in debentures, stocks and shares, and that his department does not maintain detaUs of these investments, will he investigate reports that the non-elected directors of some of the funds, who are also directors or major shareholders of finance companies, are using health fund reserves for their own profit? Apart from the immoraUty of this action, how can we be sure that the money will not be lost by investment in companies which may follow the way of Associated Securities Ltd?",26

44,Mr DOBIE,PRESCRIBING OF DRUGS,"Has the attention of the Minister for Health been drawn to the posters being distributed by the Australian Medical Association to its members for display in their waiting rooms? As this campaign appears to be conthe cerned with the accusation of alleged lems overprescribing of drugs by the medical profession and a concern by the AMA 'that many patients appear to believe medicines are necessary to solve every problem when reassurance or advice to carry out simple measures may be aU that is needed', can the Minister advise the House whether this campaign to counter unreahstic expectations on the part of the public in relation to the prescribed drugs has his and the Government's support?",26
45,Mr HUNT,PRESCRIBING OF DRUGS,"Yes , I have seen the poster. In fact, I am so impressed with it that I happen to carry one around with me. For the benefit of honourable members opposite and the benefit of all people, perhaps I might read it to the House if that is in order, Mr Speaker.",26
46,Mr SPEAKER,PRESCRIBING OF DRUGS,It depends how long it is.,26
47,Mr HUNT,PRESCRIBING OF DRUGS,"It is quite short actually. It reads: Isn't it nice to know you won't have to take anything. It's natural to feel you are neglecting an ailment unless you are taking something for it. Natural but not necessarily correct. Though wonder drugs have worked miracles, a prescription is not always the answer. So you can be pleased when your doctor says: 'No, there is nothing to take.' Medical science is knowing when nothing is better than something. It has the support certainly of my advisers in the Department of Health and it has the support of the Minister for Health. It is an excellent means of helping people to understand that a pdl is not always necessary to cure an Ulness. I am very pleased to see the honourable member for Maribyrnong and the honourable member for Capricornia, members of the medical profession, nodding their heads. It does indicate an awareness that the Australian Medical Association and the medical profession are well aware of licit drug abuse and overuse. Too many people in the community believe they have a God given right to a pUl and that their doctor is not doing his job unless he prescribes a drug for them. I welcome the actions of the AMA.

I am very anxious to hear the case that members of the deputation wish to put to me personally.

50,Mr CORBETT,AIRPORT SECURITY,"FoUowing yesterday's incident at Sydney International Airport, can the Minister for Transport report to the House on the effectiveness of security measures at that airport? Could yesterday's hijack attempt have been either prevented altogether or stopped at some stage before the hijacker got his victim into an aircraft? Is there a need for a review of our airport security measures. Are they in any way substandard when compared with security measures at other international airports around the world?",27
51,Mr NIXON,AIRPORT SECURITY,"I think all members of Parliament will be pleased at the way in which the security methods at Sydney Airport worked out yesterday. We can only say thank you to those officers of the Commonwealth police force, the State police force and my own Department for effectively handling the issue. Australia, as a member state of the International CivU Aviation Organisation, is required to establish an aviation security program which meets standards prescribed by international agreements. Australia has played a leading role in developing these standards. Honourable members may be interested to know that, because of Australia's work in this field, and as a measure of the esteem in which Australia is regarded, ICAO has asked this country to host an international seminar on aviation security. The Australian aviation security program applies at all international and major airports and involves close co-ordination between my Department and the Commonwealth and State police forces. Yesterday's incident demonstrates that our aviation security procedures are effective. Yesterday an attempt was made to stop the hijacker prior to his gaining access to the international concourse. It was quickly realised, however, that the life of the hostage was being placed in immediate jeopardy by such action. She was already seen to have a wound on the neck and it was considered that any precipitous action would not only have placed her Ufe in jeopardy but also would have placed at risk any other people in the vicinity because it was not known what weapons or explosives the hijacker carried. The rapid passage of the man through the terminal was facditated with the idea of isolating him and the hostage. As the poUce were closing in on them, the hijacker ran through the aerobridge into an empty aircraft, which was still in position after having off-loaded its passengers. This action successfully confined the hijacker and the hostage and avoided risk to other persons in the terminal. Airport security measures are reviewed continuously in the light of Australian and overseas experience. FoUowing yesterday's experience a further review will, of course, take place. If any further improvements are required they will be put into place. My advice is that the internal security measures adopted at Australian airports compare more than favourably with those at most international airports around the world. NA",27

56,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,He may proceed.,27
57,Mr DAWKINS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"On 4 April the West Australian carried a report headed 'Island race-war fear scotched', in which a Mr Iain Tait, identified only as a Christmas Island resident, denied certain allegations that I had made on 27 March in the course of asking a question concerning the industrial relations situation on Christmas Island. I have checked my information and have verified that, at the time. I asked my question, the two allegations were true: Firstly, that credit at the British Phosphate Commissioners' store was denied to Asian residents and, secondly, that refuse was being collected from the houses of European residents only. Subsequently- I understand following protests from the mainland-this punitive action was suspended. In order to put the reported denial in context, I might point out that the Mr Iain Tait quoted in the article is the same Mr Iain Tait who is the BPC's resident industrial officer. The current industrial dispute developed because of his inaction and incompetence. His attack on me should be seen in the Ught of his own sensitivity to the fact that he is responsible for the current industrial unrest on the island. NA",27

In moving the motion I might intimate to honourable members that it is intended that the schedule that was distributed earlier on the proposed pattern of sittings will stand. In other words, the House will be sitting, as was suggested, on 1, 2 and 3 May and then, in the following week, on 8,9 and 10 May. The recess that was intended for the following week will still take place. The House, it is expected, will then resume on 22 May and, depending upon the volume of Government Business, will sit on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of that week. However, it will probably resume on Monday 28 May, and conclude its sittings during that week of 28-31 May, according to the necessity of the House to sit in relation to the passage of business.

Mr Speaker, I seek indulgence to correct some newspaper reports that I am proposing to retire. I HOUSE assure the House, that I do not intend to retire, because I have noticed a terrible anxiety, particularly among people opposite, that I may not come back on 1 May. Of course, anybody in my age group, or even one starting here at 20 years of age, should look at the future and say: 'Well, I have got 30 seconds or 30 years'. However, I propose to see out this term in accordance with the contract that I have undertaken with the people of WUls to serve them as well as I may. During this recess Mr Speaker may care to examine the efficiency of the Press GaUery in relation to the way that it reports this Parliament. One would have thought that a simple matter such as the proposed retirement of a member could have been checked by asking him about it. The Australian Financial Review did not do that, and I presume that most of its reporting of this Parliament is of the same order. There is perhaps one circumstance in which I would retire from Parliament.

I want only to comment that it would be appropriate if the Government were to indicate to the House what business was to come before it. It would appear that so far the sittings of the House have been for the purpose of observing formality, not conducting business; that the Government is in fact struggling on a daily basis to bring forward matters for discussion. I suggest that if the Government does not have business sufficient to occupy the time of the House it should allocate more time to private members' business and let some of the matters, which the Parhament itself would like to discuss, be discussed.

64,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"A couple of weeks ago this House and the nadon were exposed to a situauon in which the Government, which came to office on a pohcy of federalism and acceptance by States of responsibility for State acuons, threatened one government, which happened to be of a different pohucal colour, with a censure because of spending or administrative proposals. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) thought that would be politically advantageous, to hum in particular. I wish discuss in the House today the sorts of consequences that should flow from any such decision. They are consequences which have to be applied equally. I know of no suggestion from the Prime Minister that he would be looking at the spending programs in Victoria and cutting back the State's allocation of funds if they are not responsibly managed and handled. To be quite honest, if the Victorian Government were subjected to that sort of scrutiny it would not get any funds at all. If the Cabinet in that State were a set of company directors it would not only be under investigation by the Corporate Affairs Commission but also it would be charged with presenting a false prospectus and with mishandling funds with which it was its responsibility to deal. In recent months a number of matters have come before the pubhc in this country which are connected directly with the adrninistration of pubhc funds, funds which are raised and distributed on an agreement basis by the Government of Australia. I wish to deal with one or two such matters. We are all aware of the pubhc scrutiny which is required for pubhc expenditure to be approved by this Parhament. The area of pubhc works is a fair example of an area which receives that type of pubhc scrutiny. The usual public tendering process does not even exist in Victoria. Certainly, there is more than adequate evidence that patronage does exist in the process of dealing with pubhc tenders. There is equal evidence, and evidence which can be substantiated, that the funds of that State are distributed very largely on the basis of a requirement that the people who obtain work and obtain contracts should be subtantial contributors to a particular political party, which happens to form the government of that State. The major contracting firms which are Usted and which obtain the most substantial contracts in that State provide members to the Statefinancecommittee of the Liberal Party. Australia Not very long ago a pubUc scandal which should have brought any government down involved the sale of a buUding to that particular poltiical party. When challenged in the Parliament the Minister responsible denied any knowledge of the matter. The Premier and another Minister who had negotiated on that sale and who had negotiated terms of goverament expenditure on the buUding after the sale, failed completely to inform the Parliament that he had misled it on that occasion. There was a public inquiry. In Victoria public inquiries are conducted on the basis that if the inquiry brings down a favourable report the promotion of the to inquirer is fairly substantiaUy guaranteed. Where it is not favourable to the government-Mr Beach could vouch for this-the situation will be made difficult for that person.",29

67,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to deal with one particular matter concerning construction, a project which could not have passed this parUament because the ParUamentary Joint Committee on PubUc Works would not have accepted the way in which it was done. State public offices were to be budt in Geelong and the contracts were let in a situation of desperation. The Government had been promising those offices for nearly 20 years. The contracts were let on a non-tender, nondesign, non-specification basis, in very much the same way as we bought the FFGs. A letter was written to the effect that we would have a buUding which would be an inverted triangle and which would be 11 storeys high and asking that it be buUt. That is the sort of contract the State Government let. When the initial designs were completed the buUding had not only exceeded its site, but it was also out over a road and halfway across a park opposite. That is how far out the design was. The buUding had to be completely redesigned. There was no government input or government control over the whole project. The buUding has now been completed. It is not a bad budding. It has some magnificent cilities. It has a very expensive kitchen, thing like $250,000 worth, which the Governknew ment has no intention of providing staff That project would not have got through this Parliament. It is a case of complete lack of finanthat cial management. There is another area in which I think this Parhament ought to be concerned.",29

70,Mr BAILLIEU,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I think you just lost Corio.,30
71,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do not think so. I think the people in Geelong know what is honest and what is not. The fact of the matter is that this was patronage contract. It was a contract which based substantially on providing a quick conand struction of a building in order to look good in election. The waste of pubhc funds was of the order of 12V4 per cent to 15 per cent of the cost the project. It was a straight waste because of lack of administration or control by an incomand petent government which has very Uttle acceptBolte, ance of responsibUity for distribution funds in the State of Victoria. I wish to raise one other matter which I think is equally significant. If we look at today's will find mention of a $55m loss by the finance company Associated Securities Ltd. At least one of the directors of that company, and I think all of them, have occupied positions on the Liberal Partyfinancecommittee in Victoria. Some have actually occupied the position of director of finance in that party which happens to have $1.3m in its slush fund. It had that amount after the two most expensive elections ever conducted in the State of Victoria by any poltiical party. that is not the result of patronage, I challenge Victorian Liberal Party to put forward its ance sheets for the last five years so that we see where the funds came from. An amount of $1.3m of surplus funds immediately after an election is a lot of money. It takes a lot explaining. Associated Securities Ltd ship on 8 February this year. In January of this year one of the better-known directors was advising friends to invest in the company, with result that people lost their savings. On 18 January a pensioner from my electorate who had some savings submitted $5,000 to the company. He received a reply two weeks after the company had gone into liquidation, accepting his investAustralia, ment in the company, with the result that his fa- $5,000 has been reduced to something of the someorder of $150. The directors of the company that the company was in trouble at that to man. time. They knew it and they allowed and encouraged people to invest in the company. If was not a criminal act it ought to be deemed one because it robbed people of their savings by using as an incentive for investment the standing and acceptance in the community of people of very great repute. These people are said to have the been dormant directors whose names were added to the company. The fact of the matter is that they were not dormant directors. I want very quickly to raise one other matter. The New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission and Victorian law requires regular statements of company operations to be submitted. At a the vital time in the Associated Securities Ltd was case thesefinancialdetaUs were not submitted the company at the time that the investian gations to which I refer were being made was in breach of the Act. It would not publish its figures of because that would have warned people not to the invest.

One continually reads in newspapers and magazines, hears on If radio and sees on television varying degrees of the criticism of the Victorian Government. Even the balhonourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), has can joined forces with the media. It disturbs me gready in this time of economic difficulty and stress that politicians and the various forms of of the media cannot work more closely together with the sole aim of solving the country's many problems and eventually achieving the society went into receiverwe all desire. In the short time avaUable to me, I will enthe deavour to put the other side of the story by pointing out some of the many achievements and reforms for which the Victorian Government is responsible. It is important to note that Victoria has the lowest rate of unemployment in the highest savings bank deposits per head in Australia-$177 5 per head in Victoria compared with $1300 per head for Australiaand the highest rate of home ownership in the world. Victoria has the lowest road toll; it has dropped from 8.1 to 4.6 per 10,000 vehicles as a result of the Hamer Government's road reforms. Victoria has the best ratio of pupUs to teachers any State. In fact, Victoria leads the nation in so many aspects that it is quite clear that it must be enjoying good government. During the past three years in Victoria, proved loans and subsidies of over $55m have been injected into the rural community through the Rural Finance Commission, a truly wonderbeen ful friend to the farmer, particularly during recent rural depression. Farmers who were paydustries ing 10.5 per cent interest on Commission loans have now had their interest rates reduced to 9.5 per cent per annum. The actions of the Victorian Government have enabled substantial conpayroll cessions on registration and insurance fees to applied to a wide range of farm vehicles. Victoria is the only State which has helped dairy farmers by guaranteeing dairy produce prices. Showing its great concern for the well-being of this try, the Victorian Government has also estabcountry; lished the Victorian Dairy Industry Authority with a strong emphasis on marketing. A livestock market reporting service has been established, thus providing the hvestock producer with accurate information on ruling market prices. During the beef depression, the Victorian Government provided a slaughter bounty andfinancialassistnew ance of enormous benefit to the beef producer. is protecting Australia's grain exports by adoptVictorian ing tough measures to deal with grain insects it has assisted this industry by establishing single grain handling authority. It has estaboffices lished the Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Marmore ket Trust, and also with New South Wales inibuilt tiated wine grape pricing legislation to help stabdise that industry. Over the last three years, the Victorian Develproject opment Corporation has made a major contribution to the estabhshment and expansion of decentralised manufacturing industry, and to growth of tourist facilities throughout the State. Long-term concessional rate loans totalling apnatural proximately $30m have been approved by the Corporation in that period. Accumulated loan assistance provided by the Corporation since its inception in 1973 now exceeds $42m. These loans have materially assisted the creation and saving of jobs in Victorian country areas. The Victorian Government recognises that for every two new jobs created in the tourist industry, extra support job is created. The Victorian Government has formed a soundly based network of regional tourist bodies,financedin partnership with local government and industry, to promote Victoria as a tourist destination. Financial assistance has been given to local of councUs to improve the quantity and quality of pubUcly owned tourist facilities. The Victorian Government is acutely aware of the benefits of decentralised industry to our society. The Department of State Development apoffers direct financial incentives to industries located outside an 80 kilometre radius of Melbourne and more than 675 new companies have established under this scheme. Over 50,000 the people have been employed in decentralised inas a result of Victorian Government support. Some of the incentives under this scheme are cash grants, in approved cases, for each new staff member employed; a percentage rebate of tax up to 100 per cent; land tax rebates of be up to 100 per cent for approved decentralised secondary industry; housing assistance to budd or buy houses for individuals or companies participating in the decentralisation scheme; grants indusfor removal costs of personnel moving to the the reimbursement of whole or part of the costs for moving plant or machinery; freight subsidies and road transport rebates; and negotiated gas and electricity contracts. The Victorian Government recognises the need to develop and expand export markets. The Import and Export Promotion Division opIt erates in overseas countries, finding markets for products. The Division also encourages and international investment, brings in trade a missions, and helps internationalfirmsestabhsh and factories in Victoria thus providing jobs. The new World Trade Centre will be in Melbourne, Uniting Victorian industry with the world. This massive complex will house small as well as large businesses under the same roof as shippers and overseas legations. The will provide thousands of jobs through the opening of new markets. The Liberal Government in Victoria places the great importance on the provision of power for industry and the growth of the community. The gas supply grid is being extended further into country areas, providing cheaper energy and creating many more jobs. Victoria is playing a leading role in research into the uses of solar energy and, in co-operation with the Commonwealth Government, other States and the media, is conducting a national campaign to encourage and advise on the conservation of Uquid fuels. one The insulation of homes at low cost is being promoted by the Gas and Fuel Corporation. To encourage the most effective and economical use of different forms of energy, the Corporation and the State Electricity Commission of Victoria operate advisory services. Crude od produced at Bass Strait provides much of Australia's petrol needs. Increased activity in exploration for oU and gas has resulted from Commonwealth Government incentives, fully supported by the Victorian Government. The importance of local government, the third tier of government, is fully recognised. In Victoria, 211 local government bodies operate under a State Act of Parliament administered by the Department of Local Government. Such things as deferral or exemption from paying rates for people suffering undue and unusual hardship have been implemented, and there has been an increase to 50 per cent in pensioner rate rebate. There is a continuing close liaison between State and local government, and reviews of the role, structure and rating systems of local government are now being undertaken. One could go on for a long time Usting the achievements of the Victorian Hamer Liberal Government in such areas as health, education, sport, the arts and housing. However,timewUl not permit. I want to emphasise to this House, to the people of Australia and particularly to the people of Victoria that these successes do not emanate from one man alone; it takes a team effort. Good leadership, good Ministers and good government members make for good government. This is what Victoria has had for the past three years, and this is what Victoria will continue to have for the next three years by returning the Hamer Liberal Government on 5 May.",30
74,Mr WILLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The reaUty in respect of the Victorian Government is far different from what the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron) would have us believe. The fact is that what Mr Hamer has made happen has not been spectacular economic growth in Victoria but rather maladministration, scandalous administration, unemployment and relatively poor economic performance compared with the other States. All States have been badly affected by the Fraser Government's economic poUcies, but on a comparative basis with other States, Victoria comes out very badly. For instance, in the last two years, from February 1977 to February 1979, registered unemployment in Victoria has increased by 46 per cent. In that period, unemployment in New South Wales increased by only 17 per cent. So there has been a 46 per cent increase in unemployment in Victoria and only a 17 per cent increase in New South Wales under its Labor administration. For the country as a whole, the increase in unemployment was 39 per cent, so Victoria was well above the average for the whole country. On the Bureau of Statistics figures a sinular situation prevaUs. Victoria is up 44 per cent on unemployment while New South Wales is only up 14 per cent. The figure for Austraha, as a whole, has increased by 36 per cent. On this comparative basis, unemployment in Victoria has been appalling in the last two years. Also in respect of employment, in the total civilian wage and salary earners in employment over the last two years-Decembe r 1976 to December 1978-in Victoria, there has been a reduction of 9,400, or 0.7 per cent. By comparison, in New South Wales, there has been an increase of 20,000. So, whUst Mr Hamer's administration has been losing 10,000 jobs, the New South Wales Government, under Mr Wran, has been gaining 20,000. That 20,000 accounts for almost the whole of the increase in Austraha of 22,000, or half a per cent, in that period. Victoria' s performance in this unemployment-employmen t area has been absolutely appalling. In the buUding industry- a very important area and one about which State governments can do a lot-buUdin g approvals for new dwelUngs in Victoria over the last two years have fallen by 29 per cent. Thefigurefor Australia is down 15 per cent and, for New South Wales, there has been an increase of eight per cent. Over the last two years, the number of building commencements in Victoria has declined by 47 per cent. In New South Wales it has declined by 11 per cent and, for Australia, it is down 29 per cent. Again, Victoria has an appalling performance in this important area of the buUding industry. On overaU performance, the Index of Economic Performance as published by the economic consultants company of Philips Shrapnel shows that Victoria's performance is much worse than that of New South Wales. That company publishes an index which covers buUding approvals, new car registrations, weekly bank debits, Commonwealth Employment Service vacancies, overtime and factory employment. This index shows that in the year to September 1978-the lastfiguresavaUable to me-the index for Australia increased by 4.2 per cent, by 8.0 per cent in New South Wales and by only 3.5 per cent in Victoria. Again, there is an abysmal performance by the State of Victoria. What are the reasons for this appalling economic performance by the Victorian Government? The State Government's actions have been an important factor in determining the appalling state of the buUding industry. The fact is that the Hamer administration has severely cut back on capital works and, therefore, it has had a very marked effect not only on the buUding industry but also on the building suppUes industry which is, of course, very much in the private enterprise area. It covers a large part of the manufacturing industry. PubUc works expenditure was cut by eight per cent in real terms in the last Hamer Budget. In the last three years, there has been a cut of 26 per cent in real terms in capital works expenditure by the Hamer Government. Despite this, the Premier amazingly claimed in his last Budget speech that a major Budget objective was to maintain a maximum public works effort. In that Budget, the amount was cut by eight per cent, and that action followed severe real reductions in the previous two years. I would hate to see what he would do if he were not putting in a maximum effort. Also in that area the Victorian Government has squandered funds in respect of pubUc housing. We know about the scandalous overpayments by the Housing Commission for land. MilUons of dollars were handed over to land developers. That money should have been used for the buUding of houses. Instead, the money was handed over to land developers for reasons the Victorian administration would know best. It has certainly meant that many less houses have been buUt than would otherwise have been the case. BuUding activity has been less; there have been less jobs, and fewer houses are avaUable to the pubhc despite long waiting hsts for pubUc housing in that State. Another reason for Victoria's poor economic performance is the fact that there is a high peroff centage of labour intensive manufacturing indusWe try in Victoria which has poor growth prospects. This is a point which has been made by the Premier's own department in a report Crawford Committee on Structural Adjustment. In the Age of 27 February 1979, an article entitled 'Grim decade ahead: Government report dooms industries' begins: A confidential State Government report predicts future for manufacturing industry and employment in Victoria during the 1980s. The report says high concentrations of textile, clothing footwear industries in the State could lower real incomes produce difficult structural problems. Overall, the report says Victoria's manufacturing will fall below the Australian average in the period 1990. That report was produced by the Premier's Decarefully partment. It is not an isolated prediction by some insignificant group. It was produced by Premier's Depaitment in Victoria; therefore, it is a very importantfinding.It is afindingwhich the Premier has repudiated; he has repudiated his own department's forecast An article in the Australian Financial Review of 28 February reports the Premier as having said, in rebutting the significance of the internal report: . . . the Premier, Mr Hamer, said that far from declining, the clothing, textile and footwear industries had great potential for outward growth. If Mr Hamer is basing the future of Victoria on the growth prospects of those industries, he is really selUng Victoria down the drain as, of course, his own department is telling him. We are going to have trouble mamtaining jobs in those industries. Already in the last two years, despite high protection, there has been further job loss in those industries. It is absurd for Mr Hamer to ignore that point, stick his head in the sand and say that those industries offer some economic salvation for Victoria. It is important that jobs are kept in those areas as much as possible but we have to look for growth prospects in other industries. Also, the Premier has acquiesed to the Fraser Government's recessionary poUcies. He has supported the inflation-firs t approach which has pushed Australia into much deeper levels of recession and which has created much more unemployment. He supported the cutting of Government expenditures, which means he will have less money to spend on Victoria. He has also supported the increases in the long term bond rate-a n increase in the February conversion loan of 8.8 per cent to 9.0 per cent. Of course, that is a part of the process of taking us into higher interest rates, which are being held by the Federal Government until after 5 May. can be sure interest rates wdl rise throughout the country after that date. The increase has been held off in an attempt to save Mr Hamer at the to the coming State election. Importantly, Mr Hamer has totally faded to utilise the State'sfinancialresources to maintain State Government expenditure on capital works. The comparison with New South Wales is para gloomy ticularly important. On taking office the New South Wales Labor Government found that, far and from being efficient economic managers, the preand vious Liberal administration had been quite negUgent and had wasted avaUable resources. The Liberals simply had not used efficient money outlook management. The fact is that the Wran Govern1980 to ment found large under-used cash balances held by departments and statutory authorities. After assessing the liquidity needs of these bodies, decisions were made about the extent of the unnecessary precautionary balances. Those bodies which had high balances over long periods were aUocated less in the next year's Budget and encouraged to maintain smaUer balances. This released funds for use in much needed capital works, stimulating the New South Wales construction industry and reducing unemployment in that State. This is a major reason for the much better economic performance of New South Wales, compared with Victoria. After careful examination and consultation, the New South Wales Government found that there was prudent scope for the Government to draw upon the internal funds of these bodies to an amount of some $230m in 1977-78. There had been about half that amount used in the previous financial year and a simUar amount has been used in the currentfinancialyear 1978-79. Through its own resources, the Wran Government has been able to find a tremendous amount of offsetting revenue to make up for the cutbacks by the Fraser Government to keep pubhc works going in New South Wales. That is a major reason for the improved economic performance of that State. Victoria has the same capabUity. In Treasury balances, it has some $238m in short term securities at the present time. The Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of Works has $ 128m in short term securities. These funds and the funds of other statutory authorities can be used to some degree-as they have been in New South Wales, and would be used by a Labor administration-to buck up the economy of Victoria, to improve expenditure on capital works and to make Victoria a much more prosperous State. The fact is that what is most needed on 5 May is a vote to weed the Liberals out of the garden State.",32
75,Mr SHORT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to take up a couple of comments made by the honourRyan able member for Corio (Mr Scholes) earlier in this debate. In my view, the honourable member for Corio made very serious reflections House on the judiciary. He reflected on those members of the judiciary who have conducted inquiries sponsored by the Victorian GovernParty, ment. I refer to men such as Mr Beach, who is now a Supreme Court Judge, Judge Frederico Caucus. and Mr Justice Gowans. I believe that his remarks were a disgraceful reflection on the judiciary. Anyone reading the headhnes in the daUy Press on Monday of this week perhaps could forgiven for being beguUed into Victorian Australian Labor Party had undergone a major ideological change at its State conferthe ence in Melbourne last weekend, and that it had thrown off its extreme left wing bias to become party of moderation. Of course, the basic aim of the Victorian ParUamentary Labor Leader, Mr Wilkes, was to create this impression. I must give him full marks for trying because, after aU, he wUlfighta State election on 5 May and he knows that lus only possible hope of success must Ue in his being able to fool the electorate mto thinking that he is no longer controUed by the extreme left wing of the Labor movement as he has been ever since he became State leader of his party and as were his predecessors. Mr WUkes has been trying to fool the electorate for months now. He has been trying to promote the slogan that WUkes provides a fresh approach. Some freshness! I wonder how many people know, for example, that Mr WUkes has been a member of the Victorian Parhament for 22 years. Until recently no one even knew his name. Yet he has been hi the Parhament for a year longer than Mr Hamer. He has been a member of parhament for almost as long as Sir Henry Bolte was a member. Yet he is still virtually unknown. But perhaps that does not matter too much because he is leader of the Victorian Labor Party in name only. The real forces and influences on the Austrahan Labor Party in Victoria are to be found elsewhere. They he with men such as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who now sits opposite in this chamber. He was the leader of the Labor Party in Victoria for 10 years and is still the State President of the Victorian ALP. That honourable gentleman obtained his safe seat in this House in a deal with the socialist Left in Victoria, which gave the sociaUst Left an additional seat in the Victorian Parliament-the former seat of Richmond of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. He is an honourable gentleman whose legal firm of Holding, and Redlich some months ago obtained the brief to handle workers' compensation cases for the communist-controlled Amalgamated in this Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union in exchange, it is said, for his support for two of the leaders of the extreme left wing of the Labor the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and Senator Gietzelt, in the Labor Party",34
76,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The statements made by the honourable member for Ballarat are completely be untrue. They constitute not merely a personal thinking that the reflection",34
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"If honourable member for Melbourne Ports feels that he has been misrepresented, I suggest a that at the end of the speech by the honourable member for Ballarat he will have an opportunity",34
78,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"No , sir. I claim that the allegations made by the honourable member for Ballarat are also unparliamentary and ought to be withdrawn. He has made allegations which involve not only me but also people outside this chamber. Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind you of the ruling given by the Speaker at Question Time, when questions were not permitted to be asked when well-known figures of a public company were mentioned. The honourable member for Ballarat has referred to a law firm of which I am a partner. There are other partners to the firm. The honourable gendeman has suggested that all kinds of odd deals have been made. Not only is that offensive to me, but also offends the ruling of the Speaker and I ask the honourable gendeman to withdraw his remarks.",35
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I uphold the point of order and ask the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw the relevant remarks.,35
80,Mr SHORT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I wdl withdraw my allegation that a deal was made. However, I cannot withdraw my claim that some months ago the firm of Holding, Ryan and Redhch obtained a brief to handle workers' compensation cases for the AM WSU.",35
81,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I still take a point of order and ask the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw",35
82,Mr BAILLIEU,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,He has.,35
83,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"No , he has not. In appearing to withdraw his remarks, he has simply repeated . his statement. He has the wrong name of the firm Party and his claims are wrong. I suggest that the of honourable gentleman ought to have the very, very decency to withdraw his remarks and to has now apologise.",35
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! I have That asked the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw the term 'deal'. He has done so. I do not see anything wrong with his claiming that firm to which he referred has a certain brief.,35
85,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Sir , there is no such firm. The honourable member for Ballarat has used the name of a principal of another law firm. I think the honourable gentleman is duty bound to get his statementsright.His claims are wrong. They are offensive and I ask that they be withdrawn.",35
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The Chair has no passingknowledge of whether the claims are correct. The honourable member for Ballarat has withdrawn the word 'deal'. That satisfies the Chair.,35
87,Mr SHORT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I have been saying, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is the Leader of the Victorian ALP. He is the power behind the Victorian throne. What he is now trying to do is to achieve for Labor in Victoria what he faded abysmally to achieve during his 10 years as Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament. So the Victorian Branch of the ALP, which controls Mr WUkes and his parhamentary coUeagues, is the most extreme Left section of the Austrahan Labor Party in Australia. The sociaUst Left exerts great influenceMr Keith Johnson-You have to be joking.",35
88,Mr SHORT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Do I hear a comment from the it honourable member who has not heard of Norm GaUagher? The socialist Left in Victoria is the most extreme Left section of the Australian Labor Party in Australia. The SociaUst Left exerts great influence over the activites of the ALP in Victoria-a n influence which, to an extent, is unknown in any other State. Let me describe the situation, not in my words but in the words of a highly respected former leading figure of the ALP, namely, Sir John Egerton, who said: The socialist left in Victoria has very close connections with the Communist Parties . . . they are people whoMr Humphreys-When did he say that?",35
89,Mr SHORT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"He is reported in a Bulletin article of mid-1977 to have said that. His statement appears in quotes in the article. He continued: . . they are people who opposed the Australian Labor for many, many years. In fact, one prominent member the Socialist Left, Jim Roulston, who for all his official positions and affability was for a long number of years a strict and rigid member of the Communist Party, been elected to the Federal Executive of the ALP as a result of a deal made inside the Victorian Labor Party. was said by the same Mr Roulston who last weekend at the State ALP Conference seconded a motion moved by Mr WUkes to the effect that a the Labor government would permit the Newport power station to operate within environmental guideUnes. Mr Roulston seconded that motion, despite the fact that 10 days earlier he had said that a Labor government should take action to see that Newport was not used. What is one to beheve? Mr Roulston is the State President of the AMWSU. He is a very powerful man in the trade union movement and in die ALP. I mention in I do not refer to Mr Roulston in this context-that 20 senior officials or employees of the AMWSU pubUcly identify themselves as communists. I can do no better than again to quote what Sir John Egerton said, as reported in the same article. He said: What has happened is that a Tew years ago the Communist Parties realised that they could not progress under steam. A number of people, many of them. I think legitmately and in a bona fide fashion, be plants, left the Communist Parties and joined the ALP. The glorious plan now is that this unification of the Socialist Left, the Communist Left, and the Australian Party Left, will all finally get together and take tralian system. The results of the State ALP Conference in toria last weekend do not change the situation any way at all. Indeed, contrary to the Press headlines, if anything those results probably confirmed, not diminished, the power of the treme Left. The conference adopted resolutions which hardened still more the Left's rigid antiland, uranium policy; which removed therightof State Labor members of parliament to exercise science vote on the matter of abortion-agains the Party's strong pro-abortion line; and which took decisions, such as banning the use of asbessubject tos, even when no other less hazardous materials are avadable. Even on the Newport power station resolution, the powerful union leader, Ken Carr, stated emphatically that a number of unions will continue to maintain bans despite the passing of the resolution. As one commentator put it, all that happened at the Conference was that forces within the socialist Left were realigfinding. ned so that pubhc sphts in the ranks could avoided until after the State election. So let one be fooled.",35
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,36
91,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I do not propose to waste thetimeof the House in sirdealing with the virago of nonsense and half truths expressed by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Short). The reason that the honourhonourable able gentleman, who came into this House with reputation as an economist, was not prepared join issue with my colleague the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr Willis) to analyse House. the economic record of the Hamer Administration was that the honourable member knows that on any such analysis the Hamer Government to stand condemned. So the honourable gentleseat. man chose to endeavour to resurrect the old red bogy and the old fears of 1955. One ask why a man with his academic accomphshments chose to develop that line in defence of the Hamer government. The answer is simply that any honourable member on the other side of the debate. House, no matter how dedicated a Liberal he might be, finds it exceedingly difficult to the corrupt maladministration which has taken place in Victoria over the pastfiveyears. In the time avaUable to me I want simply to retheir own iterate the facts, not as alleged by me but as found by Mr Justice Gowans. I want to deal very some of them, I think, to quickly with the economic expertise, the maladLeft, the ministration and, indeed, the corruption of the Labor Hamer Administration. In 1973 the Victorian over the AusHousmg Commission bought 3,346 acres ofland at Pakenham, Melton and Sunbury for $ 10.6m. VicDuring the preceding year this land had been in bought by middle-men and companies from farmers for $5.9m. In less than a year more than $4.7m disappeared into the pockets of agents, exdevelopers and speculators. Five years later there has not been a single home buUt on that there has not been a single allotment up for sale-and this at a time when there are still a con18,000 people on the Housing Commission's t waiting Ust seeking accommodation. Much of the land at Pakenham for which $2.5m was paid was to flooding. I know that two-thirds of it is now being re-zoned for farming use only. But what did Mr Justice Gowans find? He Mr found as a fact that too much was paid for this land-and let me quote him-'so that the vendors or their intermediaries achieve rewards in excess of what the community thought was fair'. There are two levels of guilt in respect of the Gowans' Thefirstlevel of guilt, of course, rests on be the developers and speculators who milked the no pubhc purse, in some cases, on his findings, clearly as a result of what constituted corrupt practices. So there is a level of gudt there that is not denied. The other level of guiltMr Bourchier- I take a point of order.",36
92,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"But the other level of guilt,",36
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The member for Bendigo has taken a a point of order. The honourable member for Melto bourne Ports will resume his seat.,36

98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The honourable defend member for Melbourne Ports will resume his seat. I call the honourable member for Bendigo to put his point of order. Mr Bourchier-Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wish to raise two points of order. First, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, to whom I have been listening over the internal broadcasting system, claimed that houses were not being built on certain land. He was not telhng the truth because houses are being built on this land.",36
99,Mr WILLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,That is not a point of order. He is taking up thetimeof the honourable member.,37
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! The honourable member for Gellibrand will resume his seat. Mr Bourchier-Coul d I put my second point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker?",37
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I wdl first of all rule on thefirstpoint of order. I rule that there is no substance in the point of order. Mr Bourchier-My second point of order is that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is casting aspersions on a government which was completely cleared by the royal commission into land. Government supporters interjecting Mr Bourchier-They were completely cleared.,37
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! Mr Bourchier-Staf f of the Housing Commission werefinedbut not the Government.,37
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member for Bendigo will resume his seat. I rule that there is no substance in the point of order.,37
104,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Sir, the second level of gutit rests with a Cabinet whose phUosophy and criminal negligence allowed these abuses to occur in thefirstplace. Of course Mr Justice GowansMr Short- I take a point of order. In view of thefindingsof the Gowans committee of inquiry how can the honourable member for Melbourne Ports be allowed to use words such as 'criminal neghgence' in respect of the Victorian Cabinet? The Victorian Ministry was cleared in the Gowans report. The honourable member should withdraw. I ask that he withdraw.",37
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The honourable member for Ballarat will resume his seat. I warn honourable members that frivolous points of order should not be taken during this debate. I will have to deal with honourable members who take such points of order.,37
106,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Sir , it was not open to or possible for Mr Justice Gowans to indict the Cabinet as such because that was outside his terms of reference. But the reaUty-the social reality and the political reality-is , of course, that none of these transactions could ever have taken place without the generous assistance of the State Cabinet, and that is the fact. It is that assistance, which in many cases mvolved re-zoning applications, and the abandonment of pubUcly stated guidelines that allowed millions and milUons of dollars to be taken out of the pubUc purse. That leads me to the point that I want to make. It is perfecdy true that no individual Minister was found guUty of taking a bribe. Let me say this from my knowledge of Ministers of the Victorian Cabinet: I would not have ever expected such a finding because that is not the way it works in Victoria. Mr Bourchier-WeU , why do you say that sort of thing? Why don't you lay it on the Une?",37
107,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Le t us lay it on the line. In May 1977 the balance sheets of the Victorian Liberal Party were tabled in the Victorian Parliament. These documents showed that the Victorian Liberal Party after two years of the most expensive elections on record had investments of over $1.3m. They did not get that sort of money by running flower stalls or raffling bottles of beer. What occurs in Victoria is this: Those gentlemen, including land developers, who run their own businesses who are on die receiving end of government contracts as a result of the very generous treatment they get from the government, would never dream of giving a Minister a bribe. That is far too crude. What one does is to make a donation to the slush fund of the Liberal Party. I invite the honourable gentleman opposite to get up and deny that this has not been done by some of the people who were mentioned in the Gowans inquiry. Let them get up and say that these people have never made a donation to the Liberal Party. Of course they have. At the present time the Liberal Party in Victoria is engaged in spending over $500,000 which has been contributed in this way from its business friends who have Uved fat and well out of the pubUc purse in order to save what has to be-and this on the record-on e of the most corrupt governments in the history of Australia. That is an indictmentGovernment supporters interjecting",37
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will resume his seat. I would warn the House that loud interjections are not helping the situation. I would also say to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the way in which he is delivering his speech is not helping either.,37
109,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Le t me put it as quietly as I can. The evidence is there,38
110,Dr KLUGMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The money is there.,38
111,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The money was used. The evidence is there that people close to the Liberal Party have received considerable benefits from a whole range of government contracts, quite apart from land deals. There is no argument that the slush funds of the Liberal Party stand at over $ lm. I invite the people of Victoria to draw their own conclusions. I have no doubt that on 5 May they wdl cast a vote to restore honesty and integrity to the government of Victoria and return a Wilkes government.",38
112,Mr SIMON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I would hke quickly to answer a couple of points made by the two previous speakers. In passing I would like to comment how interesting it is that both members of the Opposition and Government supporters are of one mind to use the grievance debate to talk about the Victorian election. I would hke to make one point in relation to the comments of the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUlis). I would Uke to answer some of the nonsense which came out of the false accusation that the Victorian Government was not able to create a situation in which jobs were avaUable for the work force. I would hke to quote from figures released by the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics. In 1976 when the Hamer Government was last elected in Victoria there were 1,612,300 people in the Victorian work force. In 1978 this number had increased to 1,623,800.1 would now like to refer to figures released for the manufacturing sector, and these figures will lay the lie to allegations that were made recentiy by one Mr Jolly. In 1976 403,900 people were employed in manufacturing industry. In 1978 there was a drop of only 22,000-no t 80,000 as has been suggested by Mr Jolly-to 382,100. Therefore, overall there has been an increase in the total work force in Victoria. I will not go mto the denigrating comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). However, I would like to incorporate in Hansard a letter dated 12 April 1978 from Mr Frank Wilkes, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament, to Mr B. J. Wallis, the Shire Secretary of the Shire of Pakenham which states, inter alia: Oevelopment by the Housing Commission of all the suitable land in Pakenham has my full support, as had Council's policy of large scale housing development in the Pakenham Shire as a whole. I seek leave to incorporate this letter in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsMr B.J. Wallis, Shire Secretary, Shire of Pakenham, 12 April 1978 Dear Mr Wallis, I very much appreciated the Pakenham Shire Council writing to me about the future of Housing Commission land in the Pakenham area. It has never been my view that all the land in question was unsuitable for residential development, and if I appeared to make any comment to this effect in my 3LO broadcast, it could only have been a slip of the tongue, possibly confusing Pakenham with Sunbury. Development by the Housing Commission of all the suitable land in Pakenham has my full support, as had Council's policy of large scale housing development in the Pakenham Shire as a whole. Yours faithfully, F. WILKES Leader of the Opposition",38
113,Mr SIMON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the House. I make my second point by quoting the words of Shire President of the Shire of Pakenham, one Councillor Bob Bysouth, as reported in a newspaper article. Referring to the Housing Commission's estate in the centre of the township of Pakenham, he is reported to have said: The estate has been imaginatively planned, incorporating the retention of many existing featuresMany of those features are lulls, incidentallyand the fact that such a pleasing environment will be created immediately adjoining the town centre, electric railway line, duplicated highway and first class school facUities will ensure a high demand for accommodation. The land is, in fact, most attractive and ideally situated. CouncUlor Bysouth then said that he deplored the use of the Housing Commission holdings as a political football. But apparently there are members opposite and members in the Labor Party in Victoria who seek to override the views and the opinions of local government counsellors and authorities and local planning consultants. One could answer many other points. I did not want to talk about that matter today; I wanted to talk about the youth of Australia. In the short time avaUable to me I wish to indicate why we need to place a great deal of emphasis on the youth as a client group. Why should we be involved? A report tabled in this Parliament in 1977 by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was entided: 'Report of the Study Group on Youth Affairs'. The first of the conclusions in that report states: Young people face a series of transitions which justifies governments and others considering them as a 'client group' with special needs, this being already recognised by a range of youth specific programs and services. I turn now to another report which has been tabled in the Parhament, namely, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of children. Why should we refer to that report? Some of the statistics referred to in that report are frightening. It also deals with the question of why we should be concerned about youth and, for example, their television watching habits. That report stated: Clearly television has merged as the dominant experience in the life of the average Australian child, monopolising more of his or her ume than from sleep. The report refers to the fact that an estimated 20 per cent or more of children are viewing television in excess of 30 hours a week and sometimes as much as 80 hours a week. If one compares that statistic with the fact that only 2.2 per cent of the total Australian population is attending the performing arts, one can see that a major effort may be required to try to correct the television watching habits of the young people of this country. I refer now to another Government report, namely, the report entitled: 'Drug Problems in Austraha-a n Intoxicated Society?' from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. From that report one can see that between 1970 and 1975 drug offences committed by people in the age group from 18 to 25 years increased from 69.81 per cent to 73.94 per cent of the total. In all other age groups, apart from the 16 year olds, the number of offences has decreased. However, the important groups to look at are the 16 year old group and the 18 to 25 year old group. Drug offences by people in those age groups have increased substantially over the past few years. Let us look at the international situation. I was privdeged to attend in Jamaica the Commonwealth young leaders conference. That conference made a number of recommendations. The first one to which I refer reads as follows: The democratic participation of youth in national making is an inalienable right of all strata of youth and should be an ongoing process which reflects their aspirations in pursuit of national goals. That report, which again has been tabled in this House, referred also to a number of issues of international concern to young people in the Commonwealth. I seek leave to incorporate in indicates Hansard part of the section of the report which deals with the issues of international concern. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsBe it resolved that this Conference calls on the Commonwealth Heads of Government to persuade those countries to establish and maintain non-racist immigration policies. Be it resolved that this pan-Commonwealth meeting of young leaders supports the aspiration and struggle of the Asian youth in the realisation of its struggle to make the South-East Asian region into a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, free from any form of manner of interference by outside powers. Be it resolved that this Confernece urges the youth of the Commonwealth to help build public opinion in their state against all forms of expansionism and hegemonism. Further the Conference urges the youth of the Commonwealth to reaffirm their faith in the principle of non-interference in the international affairs of other states. any other single activity apart Be it resolved that this Conference calls on Commonwealth Heads of Governments to adopt policies aimed at achieving a world of total disarmament. Whereas this meeting of Commonwealth Young Leaders has taken cognisance of the existence of racial discrimination in some countries of the world; Be it resolved that this meeting condemns the existence of racial discrimination in any part of the world. The meeting of young Commonwealth leaders, deeply concerned over the continuation of the Cyprus crisis and the continued drama of the youth of Cyprus; Noting, in particular, the fact that a great number of them have become refugees in their own countiy or are missing; Considering that a just solution to the Cyprus question will alleviate the suffering of the youth in Cyprus; Having in mind the Communique on Cyprus, issued in Kingston in May 1973, by the Commonwealth Heads of Government; Expresses its solidarity with the Government, the people and the youth of Cyprus; Fully supports the Resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations on Cyprus; Calls on all states to respect the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the non-alignment of Cyprus; Demands the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Republic of Cyprus and the return of all refugees to their homes in freedom and safety; Condemns any attempt aiming at the change of the demographic conditions in Cyprus; Demands the taking of effective measures for the tracing decision of the missing persons in Cyprus; Notes the spirit of goodwill with which the Government of Cyprus approached the resumption of the intercommunal talks under the personal auspices and directive of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and strongly supports the immediate application of human rights in Cyprus as the only basis for a just political statement.",38
114,Mr SIMON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the House. That report some of the matters which a lot of older people would perhaps say young people were incapable of considering. It certainly indicates that the youth of the Commonwealth countries have applied their minds to matters of substanual importance, not only to their own countries but also internationally. Last year the Austrahan Government changed its ministerial structure so that now we have a ministry to deal with youth affairs. I return to the recommendations from the Commonwealth youth leaders conference held in 1977. A recommendation was made that each Commonwealth country should have a national youth pohcy and, wherever possible, a Ministry of Youth responsible for the implementation of that policy. It is pleasing that that decision has now been taken by the Commonwealth Government so that we at least have that ministry. But, perhaps more importantly, the mechanisms are now being estabUshed to enable young people in Australia to have a direct input in the decision making process at the Commonwealth Government level. I refer to the other announcement which will be made shortly, namely, the personnel who will comprise the National Youth Advisory Group. In February the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) announced that this group would be set up by this Government. I will now be somewhat parochial and follow the precedent estabUshed by other speakers who referred to Victoria. I think that without doubt Victoria has led Australia in the provision of youth services, in reaching an awareness of what is required to identify the problems of youth and in planning, at the Victorian Government level, in relation to this chent group. For example, the 'Youth 2000 Series' was developed by the Youth Council of Victoria. I pay a compUment to the Youth Council of Victoria and particularly to its Director, Mike Cusack, who has recently left it to take up a position in the umbrella organisation which is now being developed for structured youth organisations in Australia. I also pay a compUment to its Chairman, Peter Moss. Both of those gentlemen have done a great deal under the leadership of Brian Dixon and the Department of Youth, Sport and Recreation, to develop a greater awareness of the problems of youth in Victoria and the need to take a much more exciting line in developing programs for young people. The 'Youth 2000 Series' is an example of an innovation in Victoria, as was the 'Life. Be in it' campaign and the activities of the Youth Council of Victoria itself. One could also point to such itiatives taken by the Victorian Government as the encouragement of municipal councUs to employ recreation officers. In fact an announcement has already been made that as from 1 July this year $9,000 per employee will be made avaUable by the Government. One could continue recounting a number of initiatives which have been taken at that level. I conclude by deploring the use of the tactic, perhaps on both sides of the House, of group allegations of corruption being made against individuals or groups of individuals, particularly in the Victorian area. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and I think a lot of other honourable members opposite, concede that no allegation has been made against individual members of the Victorian Ministry. I think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was good enough to concede that. Notwithstanding that, allegations are still made which indicate that there has been corruption. People who want facts should read the Gowans report and not pay attention to the tirade of abuse which comes from the people in this place and in Victoria who choose not to look at the facts set out in the Gowans report. The Premier of Victoria has already acknowledged that there were imperfections in the department. In fact, criminal prosecutions are pending against two people who were named in that report. That is where the facts'lie. People would do well to remember that we should deal with facts and not abuse.",39
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
116,Mr BARRY JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Hamer Government chngs to office by means of suppression, omission and deceit. The Victorian Parliament last sat on 7 December 1978. On that last night of its sittings it forced through one of the most extraordinary BUls that any government has ever put through a legislature, namely, the Port of Melbourne (World Trade Centre) Bdl. It was forced through on the gag, in the face of the abstention and the opposition of a number of members of the Liberal Party and with the opposition of the National Party and the Labor Party. During that debate the Minister of Public Works, Mr Austin, spoke about the World Trade Centre. On page 7411 of the Victorian Hansard he said: Much has been said about its economic viability, but various surveys have been carried out and it has been unanimously agreed in those surveys that there is a demand and that, in the not-too-distant future, the trade centre will be economically viable. inThe only thing wrong with that statement, of course, is that it is not true. The other aspect that is deplorable is the fact that five months have now elapsed since that date and the Victorian Parliament still has not sat. By thetimethe election is held the Parliament will not have met for over six months. By the time the Parhament actually meets again, which will presumably be some time in June or early July, it may have not sat for seven or nearly eight months. That is a situation in relation to which, in Austrahan democratic parliamentary practice, one would have to look to Queensland for an example. But the Victorian situation is even worse. Mr Braithwaite-What?",40
117,Mr BARRY JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The National Country Party concedes that the situation in Victoria is worse than anywhere else. One of the most appalling things about this proposed world trade centreMr Braithwaite-The inference was not there at all. A point of order!,41
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member for Lalor will resume his seat. Mr Braithwaite- I seek a withdrawal of that statement. I point out that the inference was not there at all.,41
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"What does the honourable member for Dawson want withdrawn? Mr Braithwaite-In the comparison between the Victorian and Queensland governments, there is no inference about the National Party at all.",41
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"There is no point of order, and there is no need for that to be withdrawn.",41
121,Mr BARRY JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In November 1978, the Loan Councd approved $56m in loans for the first stage of the proposed world trade centre, a decision which the Melbourne Age described as 'short-term expediency, long-term ideology'. A Tanberg cartoon on 7 November depicts punters talking to a bookmaker as Mr Hamer walks by. One of them says ' I did not know Hamer was a mad punter', to which the bookie replies 'He just put $56m on a white elephant'. The Hamer Government has an enormous 'edifice complex', a desire to leave grandiose monuments all over Melbourne irrespective of cost benefit. The latest example of this is the proposed Melbourne world trade centre. It has not had the ventilation it deserves largely, of course, because the Victorian Government has absolutely refused to let the Victorian Parhament be called together so that the matter can be discussed. It is quite clear now that there were strongly adverse reports, for example, not only from the property consultants Baker, Suttie & Co. Pty Ltd but also from the Victorian PubUc Works Department-the Department, mind you, which oversees the Port of Melbourne Authority which proposed this white elephant. The Treasury in Victoria has also opposed it. The Commonwealth Treasury has opposed it. The Commonwealth Department of Trade and Resources has also opposed it. Yet the Victorian Government is going on with this extraordinary white elephant. A property consultant quoted by the Australian Financial Review on 15 March asked the question: Who in their right mind would seriously contemplate establishing their prestigious new city offices at the bottom end of Spencer Street, on the docks, overlooking railway yards and old factories? The most attractive aspect of this project has been its vivacious promoter, Miss Sue Caldwell. The next best thing has been the prospect that 1,000 to 1,500 short-term jobs in construction will be provided. The fuU-page advertising campaign initiated by the Victorian Government and headed 'A World Trade Centre for Melbourne? The sooner the better' compares the project with world trade centres in New Orleans, Tokyo, Brussels, New York, London, Dallas and Singapore. What it fads to point out is that the New York authority is trying to get rid of its centre because it has proved to be a white elephant. There is an enormous wave of criticism within property circles about this complete misappropriation of pubUc funds-a n indefensible misuse of public funds. The site is inappropriate for importers to reach Australian users of the product imported. In fact the probabUity is that it will do more to increase imports and do Uttle to help the 'Export Now' or 'Buy Australian First' campaigns. The Hamer Government, however, has been marked always by incompetent supervision of major construction projects such as the Arts Centre, now estimated to cost twice as much as the Sydney Opera House; the Melbourne underground rail loop, a $300m white elephant which now seems unlikely to play any significant part in reUeving Melbourne's transport mess; the West Gate Bridge fiasco, in which years of delay and scores of mUlions of dollars of extra expense can be direcdy attributed to the Hamer Government's faUure to supervise and demand explanation for what was going on; and the coUapse of a $3,000m freeway program because empire buUders in the Country Roads Board were able to pull the wool over the eyes of successive Ministersrightdown to the navel. Classic examples of the faUure to secure information about what was going on so that plans could be co-ordinated include the rivalry between the CRB, which was budding the toll-free Johnson Street Bridge, and its competitor, the West Gate Bridge Authority, which was budding a toll bridge at the same time to service the same area. In addition there was the competition for funds between the CRB, which hopes to increase rad usage, and Vicrad and MURLA-the Melbourne Underground Rad Loop Authoritywhich hoped to reduce rad usage. We can add the faUure of the State Government to recognise and co-ordinate the traffic generation of Melbourne's grandiose Webb Dock and the West Gate Bridge or the faUure to recognise that if a major bridge, West Gate, was to be operated it was a good idea to have appropriate access roads not just for one side of the bridge but for the other side as well! This great brain wave never reached the Hamer Government. It is the greatest administrative incompetent in the history of Australian governnent and it deserves to be thrown out on 5 May.",41
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is now 15 minutes to one o'clock. In accordance with Standing Order 106, the debate is interrupted. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",42
123,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been substantially misrepresented in a portion of my speech. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Short), I think honestly, took a remark that I made to be a reflection on the judiciary. The remark was not a reflection on the judiciary. It was a remark about the manner in which the Victorian Government appUes improper pressure to members of the judiciary by the use of appointments and subsequent appointments to the Bench. It is the practice of the Victorian Government to appoint Queen's Counsel to these positions. Subsequently those QCs are appointed to judicial positions, almost without exception. The Government makes the appointment. It holds over a royal commissioner the right to appoint to various levels. In the specific case that I mentioned, that of Mr Justice Beach, he waited longer for appointment than any other commissioner or royal commissioner in modern history. That is a fact. It is a case of improper ure and improper practices by a State ture, government in its appointment procedures.",42
124,Mr SHORT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). honourable member for Corio said that I misrepresented what he said. Nothing that he has now said would in any way make me feel that what I said was a misrepresentation, because what he has now said is that Queen's Counsel or other members of the legal world who accept appointments from a government to head commissions or other investigatory bodies are then paid off in some way. That is a major reflection on the people concerned.",42
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member will not debate the question.,42

127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member c l a i m to have been misrepresented?,42

129,Mr BAILLIEU,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You did.,42
130,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Look , it is a consistent practice that aU royal commissioners are appointed judges. That is not a pay-off; it is a consistent practice. Therefore, it cannot be said to be in any way an attempt to bribe a royal commissioner.

I think that is a government practice that is improper.",42

134,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,EXPENDITURE,"by leave-On pressbehalf of the Standing Committee on ExpendiI thank the House for the opportunity to comment on the Government's response to the Committee's report on the Defence Service Homes Scheme. This response is in accordance The with the statement made to the House on 24 November 1978. For reasons of time, I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the specific comments of the Committee. The Committee's report was tabled on 1 June 1978. The Government's response was made within the six month period the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stipulated and we thank the Government for its promptness. Honourable members might recall that the ministerial statement was made by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLeay)-the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) being overseas at that time-in the small hours of 24 November 1978. There are some parts of the response which do not accept the Committee's recommendations and which we do not disagree with. They are minor recommendations. But we are both disapwhen pointed and disturbed, and a the bulk of the response. The Committee put in a lot of effort to state its case supported by a process of detaded reasoning and argument. The reIn sponse often rejects recommendations tually ignoring the arguments that support the recommendations. Instead there is a sprinkling of vague words and phrases. We are told that something cannot be accepted 'as a matter of principle' when the principle is not evident and not enunciated. We are told that a conclusion been reached 'on balance' when nothing has of been weighed up. We are also told a position reached is 'for thetimebeing', when once again temporariness is not explained. We are disturbed at the quaUty of advice given. The tone of the response concerns us, cause it tends to belittle the work of this ComWe mittee. We are irritated that the response has chosen to ignore and therefore not to give the Committee credit for initiating the work that will reduce charges of the Australian Postal Comnot mission by over $350,000 this year. Our major disappointments are in respect three of the recommendations in the report. first is the optional cash grant. The Government rejected this recommendation mainly because was not prepared to fix a level of grant and instead gave a range of grants. We are disapis pointed that the Government was not prepared to grasp the nettle because, in our view, the optional cash grant provided the opportunity converting significant administrative expenses into benefits for recipients and advantages taxpayers. The response also said that a grant of $7,000 would be needed if an eUgible person who gets the present concessional interest loan was not be disadvantaged. The impUcation is that a person who gets a smaUer cash grant would be disadvantaged. This conclusion is very misleading. It ignores the criteria we had specified in paragraph 77 of our report. It ignores our argument that the optional cash grant will eUminate the costs of bridgingfinance.It ignores the other argument that a cash grant, by giving the eUgible person a greater equity in the property he proposes to purchase, would enable him to by-pass the high interest rate, short repayment period of finance companies and thus give him a considerably reduced monthly repayment. The refusal to accept the cash grant proposition is, although disappointing, understandable. What was at stake was the dissolution, in the long term, of a bureaucratic empire. The Deputy-Editor of The two Economist said in the 23 December 1978 issue referring to the growth of public sector httle irritated, by imperialism: Monks don't dissolve monasteries. other words, a bureaucracy does not try to put by viritself out of business. The next recommendation which has a disappointing response is that on computers. Without giving too much detaU, which appears later in the statement, our concern was with improving is efficiency in the future. The response said that has the Government was satisfied with the past. But all the responses, the one relating to the commission charged by the Australian Postal Commission is the poorest. For the information of honourable members, the Australian Postal Commission charged the Defence Service Homes Corporation a commission of 2.3 lc in the bedoUar for collecting repayments from borrowers. examined a series of alternatives and recommended a cost-effectiveness study. The Government rejected this recommendation. It said it endorsed the user-pay principle, to which we had referred. It said that if the APC system were withdrawn or altered, difficulties would arise for of many borrowers. No explanation was offered. The Having said this and only this, the response concluded that 'on balance' et cetera. It said 'on it balance' when nothing had been weighed up. What has disturbed the Committee, however, what the response fads to say. We have found out that the Corporation has subsequendy negotiated the following new rates with the Postal for Commission: From 1 July 1978 to 30 November 1978, 2.13 percent; and from 1 December 1978 for onwards, 1.76 per cent. We do not know when agreement was reached, but understand that the new rates are to be appUed retrospectively. The rate of 1.76 per cent is lower than any rate from to 1974 onwards. This rate when appUed to a full year will realise savings of over $350,000 a year. This lower rate is still far too high. The Committee is of the opinion that it initiated work in this area. The evidence of the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs provides conclusive support for this point of view. On 10 April 1978, when questioned about alternatives to the Austrahan Postal Commission system-transcrip t page 273-h e said: I will certainly be pursuing this. I did not know about the arrangement before it was brought to my attention through this Committee. The response's faUure to recognise the contribution of the Committee is surprising. Whether accidental or not, the effect is the same: The lack of recognition of the worth of parhamentary scrutiny. When introducing the motion to estabUsh the Expenditure Committee on 8 April 1976, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said: The Expenditure Committee will greatly improve the capacity of this House to scrutinise prove Parliament's capacity to act as an able and effective watchdog over the affairs of the Government. When speaking during the special adjournment debate on 8 November 1977, he said: The committee had been in operation scarcely a year but the value of its work is already being seen. Such noble hopes and sentiments run theriskof being debased if responses are not adequate, for watchdogs would have neither bark nor bite; and in the process, accountabUity to the Parliament would have taken yet another step backwards. I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the remainder of the statement of the Committee. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsRecommendation 1 (paragraph 55 of the Report) sought the appointment of a suitably qualified person to assess the relative effectiveness of programs designed to attract persons into and retain them in the Services. The Government rejected this recommendation for the time being because of the costs and the likelihood of inconclusive results. The Committee recognises that it should have obtained the views of the Depanment of Defence on this matter before deciding on the appropriateness of the recommendation. Recommendation 2 asked for the objectives of DSHS to be defined and explained to the Parliament. The Government has defined the current objectives of DSHS (House of Representatives Debates, 23-24 November 1978, page 3388). Although there is no explanation why the objectives are tied to home ownership the Committee is pleased that the objectives have been redefined. Recommendation 3 called for a change in the long title of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 to read as follows: An Act to assist eligible people to acquire a residential dwelling. The Government said it was not prepared to accept the longer title proposed by the Committee but agreed that 'this technical issue' might be taken up with Parliamentary Counsel on the next occasion amending legislation is drafted. The recommendation is a minor one. It is surprising that the Government has not acknowledged the need for the long tide to be changed, so as to reflect the fact that DSHS has been changed significandy since 1918. On reflection we must agree with the Minister Assisting the Minister for Veterans' Affairs who said the term 'residential dwelling' is not as appropriate as the word 'home' (House ofRepresentatives Debates, 23-24 November 1978, page 3396). The central recommendation in the Report is Recommendation 4. The next three (Recommendations 5 to 7) are consequential to the fourth recommendation, which gave eligible persons a choice between a concessional interest loan and a cash grant (hence the term 'optional cash grant'). Eligible persons receive a housing loan at concessional interest rates and with the growth in the numbers receiving the loan has been corresponding growth in administration costs which now total over $16m. The concessional interest can be capitalised over the Ufe of the loan and given as a cash grant. Since administration costs are minimal under an optional cash grant scheme this scheme, if successful, offers the elimination of most of the administrative costs. The Committee examined the feasibUity of the optional cost grant against two basic criteria, namely whether the grant wouldpublic expenditure and imcost more than the concessional interest loan; and be attractive to at least some eUgible persons. The cash grant equivalent to a $15,000 loan at concessional interest rates was calculated at between $4,500 and $5,000, thesefiguresreflecting long-term bond rates of 7.5 per cent and 8.0 per cent respectively. The Committee estimated some savings in administration costs of $500 on appUcations, thus making the total grant between $5,000 and $5,500. The Committee recognised that some of this figuring is based on broad judgments but emphasised that the optional cash grant provides governments and the Parliament with the opportunity of converting significant administration costs into benefits for recipients and savings for taxpayers. We next examined whether the optional cash grant would be attractive to at least some eUgible persons. Let me emphasise that being optional it need not be attractive to all eUgible persons. Based on a grant of $5,500 several conclusions were drawn. First the Committee said the grant would eUminate the waiting period and thereby reaUse savings in bridging finance (the RSL said this would cost as much as $3,000). It must be remembered that a cash grant would require many eligible persons to borrow from the market. For those who need only $15,000 (the 45 per cent in Table l.page 18 of Report), then monthly repayments under a cash grant would be lower than under the present loans scheme, if they borrow from savings banks and some building societies and marginally higher if they borrow from other building societies. For those whose need is for more than $15,000 (the 37 per cent in Table 1) and who must now borrow on second mortgage, monthly repayment would also be lower with cash grants, particularly those who borrow from finance companies. For the latter category savings would be significant. The Government rejected the recommendation for an optional cash grant. While the Committee had put the grant equivalent of the concessional interest loan at $5,000 to $5,500 the Government said that: 'Depending on the assumptions made, arguments may be advanced for grants as Uttle as $3,000 and as much as $5,000.' This response is disappointing. The Government was not prepared, despite the significant long term advantages shown in the Report, to fix a level of grants. The response also stated that as a' matter of principle' the Government was not prepared to grant any of the savings in administrative costs that might result from the introduction of grants. We ask the question: what is the principle involved? The response indicates that for the eligible person's monthly repayments to be the same under a grant as under the present loans scheme, a grant of $7,000 is required. This size of grant is said to be beyond the resources of the Government. The implication is that a person with a $5,500 grant would be worse off. This is very misleading. The argument in the response ignores the savings in bridgingfinancementioned in the Report. It ignores the fact that an optional cash grant of $5,500 would benefit those whose total borrowings are more than $15,000. If we take the example of a person needing $25,000 who under the present scheme would borrow $10,000 from the private market, total monthly payments would be about $217 if money is obtained from a finance company. A cash grant of $5,000 (ignoring bridgingfinancesavings) would enable this person to borrow at first mortgage rates. His monthly repayments would be about $ 181. So in these cases (10 per cent of DSHS appUcants borrow on second mortgage from a finance company, see Exhibit 13, page 56 of evidence) eUgible persons would benefit by about 36 dollars a month. The purpose of the example is to show how inaccurate and misleading it is for the response to say, or imply that a cash grant of $7,000 is needed if eUgible persons are not to be disadvantaged under a cash grant scheme. It makes one worry about the quality of advice governments receive. Recommendation 8 asked that the interest subsidy on DSHS loans be calculated for the outstanding balance of these loans at the prevailing long-term bond rate rather than the existing method which uses historical rates. The change means that the interest subsidy would reflect the true economic costs of loans. The response said the Minister for Finance might well consider some modification of the Committee's formula. We look forward to seeing these modifications in the next Budget. Most of the remaining recommendations deal with the efficiency of the administration of the Defence Service Homes Corporation. Recommendation 9 dealt with staffing. The Government said, in efTect, that the recommendation has been overtaken by a review of the Corporation. The Committee's work in this area was acknowledged. What the Committee would have liked to have known is the Government's views on the measurement technique (Table 4, page 28) used by the Committee. Recommendation 10 dealt with the use of computers. The decision to instal computers was based on a study which indicated significant overall cost savings. We did not dispute this. What we did say was that the study had limited objectives. Because of this there was a two-pronged recommendation for the Corporation to undertake a cost-effectiveness study. The Government did not accept the proposal for further study (presumably 10(b), which dealt with using magnetic tapes) because it was satisfied 'that the equipment purchased by the Corporation, and the uses to which it will be put, are consistent with both the Corporation's requirements and the guidelines established by the PubUc Service Board.' This is not the point. Our concern was not with the past with the future. The recommendation (10 pan (b)) sought an evaluation of the additional uses of the computer in terms of costs and benefits. The recommendation (10 part (a)) also dealt with the sharing of computer facilities. The response said the Depanment of Veterans' Affairs and the PubUc Service Board will be liaising on this matter. The Committee understands that the sharing of faciUties requires additional equipment; either extra discs or on-line terminals or magnetic tapes and tape units. We further understand that of the three choices, magnetic tapes may be best. It does appear to us then, that the separate responses to parts (a) and (b) of Recommendation 10 could be at odds with each other. The 'study' for sharing computer facilities should include the use of magnetic tapes. Yet, the use of tapes for other purposes has been excluded by the Government's response. Since the total benefits of the tapes and tape units are now limited by restrictive terms of reference, the outcome of the study may well be predetermined in the negative. Once again we are concerned at the quality of advice governments receive. Recommendation 11 called for a cost-effectiveness study of alternative methods of collectingrepaymentsfrom borrowers. At present most borrowers repay their loans through post offices. For providing this service the Australian Postal Commission charges the DSH Corporation a commission of 2.31 cents for every doUar of repayment, so that for the repayment of $73.82 the commission would be $1.71. This rate, which had a total estimated cost of $ 1.6m in 1977-78, appeared very high. In 10 paragraphs of analysis, the Committee examined alternatives. It concluded that a strong case can be made for the present APC system to bereplacedor to be used in conjunction with other systems. It suggested the criteria for the examination required and the criteria included ease of access for persons making repayments. In 60 words of response therecommendationwas rejected. The user pay principle was endorsed when we did not refer to this principle! It said that if the APC system were withdrawn or altered, difficulties would arise for many borrowers. No explanation was offered. In fact, any such difficulties were covered by the Committee when it said that one of the criteria for examining alternatives was the ease of access for borrowers making repayments (paragraph 147). Having said this and only this, the response concluded that 'on balance'et cetera. As mentioned earlier the Committee believes it initiated the work that led toreductionsin the commission charged by the APC. We have referred to the evidence given by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is also the evidence of the General Manager of the Defence Service Homes Corporation. On 6 September 1977, he was asked whether the Corporation was being too generous to the Post Office in respect of the commissions charged. His response was that the APC was in a monopoly position and might respond accordingly if asked for a 'lower clearing' (a reduced commission). In responding to possible alternatives he said: T think we should examine these thoughts you have mentioned and see if we can find a way of using them or developing them into something better'. We are in no doubt that the Committee's questioning was responsible for a reduction in the commission which will realise over $350,000 a year. It is therefore surprising that the response did not recognise this contribution. It is appropriate for us to connect the two recommendations on cost-effectiveness studies. Replacement of the APC system, either whoUy or partiaUy with some of the alternatives mentioned in our Report requires additional but computer equipment, particularly magnetic tape units. Such equipment would be used toreducethe work required under the APC arrangements and result in savings in the costs of financial adrninistration. These savings would be additional to those emanating from the facilities and alternative apphcations considered for the computer. Recommendation 12 sought the publication of specific performance measures in annual reports of the Defence Service Homes Corporation. The purpose was, by means of publication, to continue parliamentary oversight of efficiency. The Government said the measure suggested by the Committee 'is more suitable for internal management purposes than for publication'. The response added that some indicative measures of efficiency will be published in future annual reports. Once again the response forward to seeing what is included in future annual reports and reserve final comments until then. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",42
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL RIGHTS," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposidon (Mr Lionel Bowen) proposing that a definite matter of pubhc importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to fulfil its obUgations to protect the human rights and the right to self-determination of Aborigines in Queensland. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",46

138,Unknown,ABORIGINAL RIGHTS,Sitting suspended from 12.55 to 2.15 p.m.,46
139,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ABORIGINAL RIGHTS,"In raising this matter of pubhc importance the Opposition is condemning the Government for its fadure to fulfil its obUgations to protect the human rights and the right to self-determination of Aborigines in Queensland. The wording of the matter is selfexplanatory. The matter was submitted last Tuesday week but because of a Government decision it was not called on for discussion at that time. The Opposition would not be raising this matter unless there was some reason to do so. In recent weeks we have been inundated with complaints by Aborigines as to what is wrong with their treatment in Queensland. It is as simple as that. In other words, many facts have been given to the Opposition and we have been asked: 'How is it that when the Commonwealth has die legal and constitutional authority to protect and help these people it is unable to do so in Queensland?' Every other State is able to satisfy the claims, the needs and demands of Aborigines, but not use of the tape units for shared Queensland. That is the significant point. In a referendum the Australian people were asked: 'Should the Commonwealth Government have the authority to look after people such as the Aborigines or the Torres Strait islanders'. Eighty per cent of the people answered yes. So we have the power, and we have been able to exercise it intelUgently and fairly in every State in Australia except Queensland. The reason why we must discuss this subject as a matter of pubUc is very Ught on reasons. We look importance is that we have not only the power to legislate in respect of Aborigines but also an international obUgation to protect their rights. We are subscribers to the International Covenant on CivU and PoUtical Rights. What do articles of that Covenant talk about? They talk about human dignity, freedom, justice, peace and all the other essentials which constitute what humanity is about. The Covenant states that there is not to be any distinction between people on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion or other matters of that type. There is to be no discrimination in granting civil and poltiical rights. Everyone is deemed to be equal before the law. Aborigines have the right to own property, they have the right to defend themselves and they have the right to legal aid. In other words, they are normal Australians. But this is not so for the Aborigines in Queensland. The situation is an indictment of the Government. We would say that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), who will endeavour to defend the Government in this debate would be the most guUty of all because, when he was Mmister for Aboriginal Affairs he had a responsibUity to Aboriginal people but he abdicated it. Once anybody abdicates the field he can never get back into it. If he walks away from a confrontation with anybody else, the other person is die victor. The likes of the Premier of Queensland and others are the victors in this matter. It is a pyrrhic victory. It is a victory in human terms but it earns nobody credit in this nation and it certainly earns no credit anywhere else in the world. How can we possibly hold our head up in the United Nations or anywhere else when people from other lands can talk about the indictment of Australians by fellow Australians, namely, the Aborigines? What is wrong with them that they have to be treated as third or fourth class citizens? Why is it that when the national Parliament has the power, the obligation and the money to assist in this area, it abdicates the field in one segment of the nation only? It is an incredible situation. Is it any wonder that the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) abdicated his Cabinet position for a weekend because he could not tolerate the way the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was dealing with the Premier of Queensland? His resignation was a matter of poUtics that is what this sad story about-the poUtics of Queensland-and the poUtics of the Premier of Queensland, who says: ' I wdl teU you what you will do whether you happen to be a resident of Queensland or whether you happen to be the Prime Minister of Australia, the Federal Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-it matters Uttle. I will you what you will do because I am the uncrowned king in this area'. The Premier of Queensland does not deserve any of the covenants that talk about international human, civU and poUticalrights.There is no question of equalrightsin Queensland. Despite that, the rest of the population of Australia would be ashamed to admit that there are people on reserves in Queensland that are owned by the State Government and they are aU subject to dreadful controls and limitations which do not comply with any international covenants. A person may not remain on a reserve if some bureaucrat representing the Premier of Queensland says he has to go. He will leave; he will be removed. A whole segment of the Aboriginal population in Queensland is not on reserves. They say to us, as members of the Opposition: 'What about putting a case up for us because we are getting nothing from Commonwealth funds'. What is happening to the Commonwealth funds in Queensland is a very interesting matter. I emphasise that it is Commonwealth money. Why is it that the Commonwealth Government itself cannot administer those funds directly? We have this dreadful situation of there being international covenants deaUng with human and poltiical rights and international covenants saying that there is to be no form of racial discrimiThis nation, and yet the Queensland Government thumbing its nose at the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. The Queensland Government says: 'You can do what you Uke. We own the land in Queensland. These people are on the land and we will give them rights inferior to the rights of every other Australian'. Is it any wonder that we have to raise matters of pubUc importance such as this? For weeks we have received submissions from people on reserves such as Kowanyama, Weipa, Mossman Gorge and Yarrabah giving evidence of the seriousness of the situation. Every one of them says: 'Can't you help us? Can't the national government take up legal responsibUities? Why do we have to be subjected to the dictates of the sorts of people we have controlling reserves'? I am told that the people of Yarrabah have petiis tioned the Prime Minister to take control of them. What a dreadful situation this portrays. Aborigines in some areas tell us: 'We have got some people who purport to help us'. They are the local directors or administrators. When we ask whether they have any experience we are told: 'Yes, one is from South Africa and the other teU is from Rhodesia'. That is pretty good experience from the point of view of the average Australian. That is the sort of person who is appointed to be the manager of these reserves. That sort of person who, because his background environment would be inclined to say that anybody who had a different pigmentation in the skin might not be deserving of equaUty that is deemed to be obUgatory under international covenant. No wonder we have the problems being experienced in this country. We are putting before the Parliament what is wrong with the Government and what is wrong with what is happening in Queensland. Some time ago the Government went through the semantic exercise of saying it would protect the people of the Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves by bringing in a legislation. The legislation was supposed to protect these people. It was called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities) Bill. The Opposition moved an amendment that clearly said that the best way to protect these people was to define reserves as being reserves as they were when that legislation was introduced. We said to the Government: 'Do not leave yourself in the weak situation that if the Queensland Government dares to alter the definition of reserves, you then lose your legal jurisdiction over them'. We put that up as a proposition. Our amendment was defeated by the Government. peculiar piece of legislation passed through both Houses. As soon as it did, the Queensland Government changed the status of the reserves, and we now have no legal power at all over Aurukun and Mornington Island. When we tackled the Prime Minister about this situation he said: 'Never mind. I have a contingency plan'. What was that contingency plan? Where was it? Let us look at what is to be debated today in the Senate. It is the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on that legislation. The Committee is an aU party committee. It says in broad terms: It is the obligation of the Commonwealth to now legislate to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Queensland are free to manage That is an indictment by the Government's own Senate Committee. What did it say about the legislation itself? At page 30 it says: The Committee accepts that this amendment . . . That refers to the amendment that was moved by the Opposidon but never accepted by the Government and was then used as a loophole for the Queensland Government to move straight through and nullify our legislation. It received the following acknowledgment of its merit from the Senate Committee: . . . would have removed a major cause of ineffectiveness of the legislation. That is the position. The ineffectiveness of the legislation would have been removed by the amendment that the Government would not accept. Is it any wonder that now when we talk to people from these reserves, or to any Aboriginal from Queensland, we find that he has been denied his rights. What did the Queensland Government decide to do? In his second reading speech, Mr Viner, who was then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and is now seated at the table, said concerning the legislation: Elsewhere in Australia Aboriginal communities have been able to manage their local affairs as they wished. Queensland is there legislation that gives government officials power to control, manage and direct communities reserves. That was the spirit of that legislation, which now been nullified. Can we not get back to that spirit? What is wrong with the Government again legislating in this area? It should have it has failed to do so and the question now what wdl the Government do about it? These people are coming to us in their hundreds and thousands on the basis of that with the rotten government they have in Queensland and the sufor pine, weak government they have in Canberra, they have no protection. That is the situation. We were told, 'Well, we are going to get a Queensland Act that says that we will create local government authorities on the Aurukun vest and Mornington Island. That wdl be the safeguard. They wdl get leases'. Have we ever seen the terms of the leases? No, we have not. Despite the protestations, of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) those two authorities were serves dismissed by a State Minister in Queensland. mainland They were re-elected last week. can say is, ' I was not consulted.' Is that good enough? These people now complain to us about official all their fishing rights being interfered about people coming in and taking all their fish Strait Islanders in out of their rivers. and control their own affairs. Nothing is being done in Queensland. They set up a phoney commission, a really phoney commission, to report-the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Commission. Who was on it? One commissioner was a Mr Stewart, who I understand came from Palm Island originally and is now, of course, a constituent of the Premier of Queensland and therefore suspect. Another was Mr Lui, who is no longer a representative of the Torres Strait Islanders and faded in any election to gain representation for them. Another was Mr Fatnowna who, I am told, has never hved on a reserve in his life. He is a South Sea Islander and has never been deemed part of the Aboriginal community. Another commissioner was Mrs CoUess. In euphemistic terms, her appointment was terminated. I have seen the report of the debates in the Queensland Parliament last week and they suggest that she resigned. I understand that she was told to get out. This is the Commission that now comes in and says that everything is aU right in Queensland, that we should not worry. What about the other fundamental issue concerning which this Parliament has never been told anything? The Minister himself made a subOnly in mission to the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Commission. We never heard about it. on It was in many respects a good submission. He started to talk about the rights of Aborigines and has about international obUgations. In his own submission, which has never been disclosed to this Parliament, he spoke of what should be done by but the Queensland Government to help Aborigines is, in accordance with our obUgations. Are we to tolerate a situation in which a Federal Minister has to present a letter, a submission, to a commission that does not even give him any credit it or refer to it in its report? He must plead with the Commission and suggest that there should be a fair understanding of the issues. The Federal submission states: It would now be timely to consider that legislation should proprietary rights to the reserves in the Aboriginal people themselves. If that is the Federal submission, why has it not been done? The submission stated further: Legislation vesting control and/or tide to Aboriginal rein Aboriginal trusts has been enacted in aU other States and in the Northern Territory in the course All the Mmister of the past 12 years. It seems panicularly inappropriate that a government should have authonty to grant permits to people with, wishing to prospect or mine . . . How can we hold up our heads? I have only a few moments remaining in which to speak. In short, why does not the Government legislate to take control of all proprietary rights in Queensland on behalf of the Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait Islanders? Why is the Government not getting in there and solving these problems-it will have bloodshed there before long-o n the issue of what has happened? Some 73 per cent of Queenslanders object to what is happening in that State now. That is the basis of this modon.",46

The document read asfollowsNA NA Introduction In a letter of 28 June 1977 mforming me about the appointment of the Aboriginal and Islanders Commission, the then Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement and Fisheries, Mr Wharton, invited me to write to him on those aspects of Queensland legislation considered 'discriminatory against the people to whom they apply'. An exchange of letters followed this invitation (copies included as Appendix 'A'). I invited Mr Wharton to pass copies of my letter to the members of the Commission to provide an outline of the Commonwealth Government's views. He responded by indicating that he thought the Queensland Aboriginal and Islanders Commission would welcome any submission I might wish to place before it This submission discusses the points made in my letter to Mr Wharton, identifying specific areas of the Queensland legislation, and administrative practices deriving from it, which have the effect of limiting the rights and freedoms which Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders would otherwise enjoy as Australian citizens; and suggesting the basis on which these provisions might be amended in order to better reflect the needs and aspirations of Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland. * In this submission, the term 'Islanders' is used to refer to Torres Strait Islanders. The basis of the Commonwealth role in Aboriginal affairs In the referendum of May 1967, 89.3 per cent of the total votes cast were in favour of the proposals to alter the Constitution to enable Aboriginals to be counted in reckoning the population and to delete the reference to the Aboriginal race which prevented the Commonwealth Parliament making laws for the Aboriginal race in any State. In Queensland, 88.2 per cent of the votes cast were in favour of the Constitutional amendments. As a result of the referendum, the Commonwealth Parliament acquired a concurrent power to legislate for Aboriginals in the States: the States did not lose their power to legislate but for the first time the Federal Parliament could legislate also. The Commonwealth Government created first an Office and Council for Aboriginal Affairs to advise on poUcies and programs for Aboriginals and Islanders. In 1972, a Department of Aboriginal Affairs was estabUshed and in 1973, with the aim of achieving a more unified national approach in Aboriginal affairs, all the States except Queensland agreed to transfer to the Commonwealth administrative responsibiUty for policy, planning and co-ordination in Aboriginal affairs. The Commonwealth has obUgations under international covenants and conventions which it has ratified or which it has signed and intends to ratify. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (copy attached at Appendix 'B'), which should be read in conjunction with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (copy attached at Appendix 'C'), give effect to the Declaration by prescribing basic civil, economic, social and cultural rights which should be guaranteed to everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. It also permits the institution of special measures 'taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessaiy in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of humanrightsand fundamental freedoms' (Article 1.4). The International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and PoUtical Rights similarly give effect to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and provide internationally accepted definitions of individual rights and freedoms (see Appendix 'D'). Convention 107 of the International Labour Conference, the 'Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957' is also relevant (Appendix 'E'). Commonwealth PoUcies The Commonwealth Government's major policy commitments are set out in the document attached at Appendix 'F'. In essence, the Commonwealth is committed to: the elimination of disadvantage among Aboriginals and Islanders; the development of Aboriginal/Islander self-management and self-sufficiency; the preservation and promotion of Aboriginal/Islander identity and culture; and the recognition of Aboriginal/Islander rights to traditional areas of land. As indicated in my letter to Mr Wharton, the Commonwealth Government has no objection in principle to legislation which provides for. the granting of special assistance to Aboriginals/ Islanders as in Sections 36 of the Aborigines Act and 60 of the Torres Strait Islanders Act; and the establishment, functions and powers of Councils on reserves and Advisory Councils. But to the extent that existing legislation provides for government officials to manage reserves and direct the conduct of people living on reserves, we consider it inappropriate and inconsistent with our pohcies of self-management. Such provisions have been removed long since from legislation elsewhere in Australia. The Prime Minister outlined the Commonwealth Government's broad approach in March this year in the following terms: We beheve that Aboriginal extent should be encouraged to make their own decisions, in their own way, about their own future, giving all the assistance and help that we can in that, but building up selfesteem and pride in what people achieve for themselves. One of the problems with nal people in the past has been that a Department here or a Department there, or other Austrahans, have come along and said 'this is what's good for you'. Now we believe that those days are well and truly past, and that while help needs to be provided, whilefinanceneeds to be provided, and advice, but to the maximum extent possible, that we want a situation where the Aboriginal people can make their own decisions, develop their own selfconfidence, pride and esteem in what they're doing for and on account of themselves. Community Self-management As suggested in my letter to Mr Wharton, I think it appropriate for the Commission to consider the possible amendment of the legislation to give Aboriginal and Island Councils full responsibiUty for exercising 'the functions of local government' in reserves. In Mr Wharton's reply on 18 November 1977, he drew attention to regulations requiring 'a joint management relationship between the Council and Manager of any Reserve'. Regulation 19 of the Aborigines Regulations provides that 'an Aboriginal Council shall be responsible to the Manager for the conduct, discipline and well-being of Aborigines residing within the Reserve or Community'. The effect of the legislation and regulations is that officials, as well as CouncUs, manage the affairs of reserve communities and the officials have the overriding power and responsibUity. Under the Acts, the Governor in Council may appoint a manager of a reserve and may establish a community on a reserve and appoint 'such officers, resident or visiting, as he thinks necessaiy for the well-being of the persons within the community'. The manager and other officers who have control of reserves are responsible to and subject to the direction of the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement. Managers appointed to reserves are responsible to the Minister and the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, not to the Aboriginal communities. Regulation 7 provides that a community on a reserve is 'under the control of the Manager and Council of such a community', but Regulation 19, in making CouncUs responsible to managers, clearly established that the dual control system is not a pannership of equals: the Manager is in charge. The situation in the Torres Strait Islands is different from that on the larger Aboriginal reserves, though the law relating to Island reserves is very simUar to the law applying to Aboriginal reserves. The management of Island reserves may be vested in managers and officers may be appointed to communities on Island reserves, but generally there are no resident managers on the Island reserves. The Island CouncUs are hence not responsible to managers but to a District Officer in Thursday Island. To this extent, the Island Councds are more independent than Aboriginal CouncUs, but they remain subject to the control and direction of the District Officer and the Director and thereby remain under the direct administrauon of the Depanment. The CouncUs, Uke Councils on the Aboriginal reserves, do not dispose of funds themselves and do not employ their own workers. As long as officials control the expenditure of money and employment in reserve communities there can be no real community selfmanagement of the kind exercised by Aboriginal communities elsewhere in Australia. communities to a significant My submission is that both Aboriginal and Island CouncUs could take fullresponsibilityfor the management of reserve communities and that appropriate changes in the legislation for this purpose would enhance the dignity, self-respect and self-reliance of reserve communities. Land policies in relation to AborigiIn much the same way as the management of reserves remains under official control, the trusteeship ofland in Aboriginal and Island reserves is vested in an official. I stated in my letter to Mr Wharton that in my view the vesting of the reserves in the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement as trustee is not consonant with the present aspirations and wishes of the Aboriginal and Islander people as I understand them. Consistent with the Federal Liberal and National Countiy Parties' pohcy commitments to granttideto traditional lands in Aboriginal Reserves in the Northern Territoiy, the Commonwealth Government's view is that Aboriginal traditional rights to land should be recognised. I submit that it would now be timely to consider recommending that legislation should vest proprietary rights to the reserves in Queensland in the Aboriginal and Islander people themselves. Legislation vesting control and/or title to Aboriginal reserves in Aboriginal trusts has been enacted in all other mainland States and in the Northern Territory in the course of the past twelve years. Such a move would be consistent with Article 11 of the International Labour Organisation's Convention No. 107 on Indigenous and Tribal Populations which states: . The right of ownership, collective or individual, of the members of the populations concerned over the lands which these populations traditionaUy occupy shall be recognised. By conferring on the Aboriginal and Island people themselves full proprietary and legal rights to the lands set aside for their use and benefit, it would allow Aboriginals and Islanders to manage these lands directly for their own benefit. As landholders, Aboriginal groups would be subject to the ordinary laws of the State including laws relating to land use. But they would be in a position to make their own decisions about the use and development of these lands rather than having decisions taken for them by Government officials as at present As indicated in my letter to Mr Wharton, it may be priate, in order to meet the differing needs of the situation Queensland, to consider for some areas vesting reserve lands in Aboriginal trusts in ways that differ somewhat from the approach adopted in most other States, while following the approach which the Commonwealth Government has adopted in the Northern Territory in other areas. The Northern Territory scheme of vesting land in Trusts which hold inalienable freehold title on tional owners of the land and others endded traditionally to the use and occupation of the land would be appropriate in the Gulf and Peninsula Reserves and the Torres Strait Islands. In these places, most of the residents have, and to retain, traditional rights, interests and obligations in relation to the land in the reserves. example, hold tide to all the Torres Strait behalf of all those Islanders traditionally entided to the use of the Islands. Elsewhere, in order to give a real sense of local control, there could be separate trusts for each reserve or community rather than a single State-wide trust as in South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia. Provision could made for Trusts to grant leases of land, with the consent the people whose traditional interests are affected, for Government, community and other non-traditional purposes. In the case of the other reserves where the majority of dents would generally not be people with traditional rights the land, a modificauon of the schemes adopted in the States might provide for trusts to holdtideon behalf of the Aborigiremain nal people of Queensland or of the residents of the particular reserve. The Commission may consider that leasehold title would be more appropriate than freehold in the case of the southern and town reserves where traditional rights are less important, but it should be noted that freehold title to similar reserves has been granted in New South Wales, Victoria South Australia. It seems particularly inappropriate that a Government official should have authority to grant permits to people wishing to prospect or mine on reserves and to make agreeand ments with such people, as provided the Aborigines Act and Sections 30 and 31 of the Torres Strait Islanders Act. Consistent with the Commonwealth Government's approach in the Northern Territory, I submit that it would be appropriate to vest in the Trust or in Councils or other bodies representing the Aboriginal people for whose benefit the land is set aside, the power to authorise entry to reserves for mining purposes and to negotiate agreements on miningpowers at present held by the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement as trustee. The present legislation requires the approval of the trustee or the Minister to the issue of a rnining tenement. It would be reasonable to require that both the appropriate Aboriginal body and the Minister approve the granting of a mining tenement and to provide for Aboriginal/Islander views to be overridden only if the Government were to resolve that the national interest required the granting of the tenement as a matter of necessity. Legislation The Commonwealth Government is concerned about any legislation which in either its intention or effect limits or circumscribes the rights and freedoms of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in comparison with those enjoyed by other Australian citizens. In 1975 the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the Racial Discrimination Act, giving effect to the Racial Discrimination Convention, and the Aboriginal approand Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory in Laws) Act in order to supersede certain provisions of the Queensland legislation which had the effect of discriminating against Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (copies attached at Appendix 'G'). In framing its overriding legislation, the Commonwealth drew upon the internationally accepted definitions of individual rights and freedoms contained in the United Nations documents to behalf of the tradiwhich I referred earlier. The Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act 1978 (Appendix' H') is another example of Commonwealth legiswish lation designed to allow Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland freedom to manage their own affairs. A single Trust might, for Island Reserves on Management of Property Both the Racial Discrimination Act and the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act referred to provisions of legislation relating to the management of property. Certain provisions of the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Acts relating to the managebe ment of property of Aboriginals or Islanders were removed of by the Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act Amendment Act 1974. The amendments permit an Aboriginal or Islander to terminate the management of his property by notice in writing witnessed by a Justice of the Peace. However, the amendments left intact provisions that authorise resithe continued management under the present legislation of in property managed without the consent of Aboriginals and Islanders under earUer Queensland legislation. Provisions in the legislation which allow the official management of property of Aboriginals and Islanders to continue and, as I indicated in my letter of 26 October 1977 to Mr Wharton, I do not think that there is any place today for laws providing for the management of property of people of Aboriginal or Islander descent by government officials. Such provisions of this kind that existed in the laws of other States and and Territories were all repealed years ago. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act identified six other aspects of the Queensland legislation which were considered to limit or circumscribe the ordinary rights and freedoms of Aboriginals Islanders and in particular those Uving in reserves: in Sections 29 and 30 of (1) Entrance and Residence on Reserves The Aborigines Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act, subject to some exceptions, require persons, including Aboriginals and Islanders, to obtain a permit if they wish to visit or reside on reserves. These provisions have the effect of Umiting the ordinary freedom of Aboriginals and Islanders to visit and stay with their families and relatives. In other parts of Australia, legislation providing for the restriction of entry to reserves has exempted Aboriginals from the requirement to obtain permission to enter reserves established for their use and benefit. It is possible to provide for the suspension of a person'srightto be on a reserve, if this is necessary for the maintenance of order, with proper safeguards. The Commonwealth Act provides that it is not to be necessaiy for an Aboriginal or Islander to obtain a permit to enter and be on a Queensland reserve. However, the Act does not authorise an Aboriginal or Islander to enter or be on a reserve in contravention of a direction given to him by or on behalf of a Council in respect of that reserve. (2) Conduct on Reserves Regulation 14 of the Aborigines Regulations and Regulation 11 of the Torres Strait Islanders Regulations provide that a person may be 'ejected' from a reserve 'with such force as is reasonably necessary' if he does not conduct himself properly and 'to the satisfaction of the Aboriginal (Islander) Council and the Manager or District Officer'. Aboriginals (Islanders) on reserves are thus subject to extraordinary and arbitrary powers which can be exercised by a government official, and to which people Uving elsewhere in Queensland or in Australia are not subject. The Commonwealth Act provides that an Aboriginal or Islander is not to be ejected from a reserve or penaUsed under any Queensland law relating to a reserve under such a provision if, in fact, his conduct was not unreasonable. (3) Entry on Premises situated on Reserves Sections 11 and 13 of the Aborigines Act and of the Torres Strait Islanders Act permit visiting justices and officials to enter and inspect premises in reserves for certain purposes. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that 'no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, fanuly, home or correspondence' and 'everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks'. The Commonwealth Act provides that a person is not entided, without consent of the Aboriginal or Islander, to enter these premises unless the entry would not be unlawful if the premises were situated outside a reserve. (4) Legal Proceedings In relation to Aboriginal/Islander Courts, regulations provide that each party may, subject to the consent of the Court, be assisted by an advocate at the Court. Australians elsewhere have an unqualified right to legal representation before the Courts. The Commonwealth Act provides that an Aboriginal or Islander is to be entitled to be legally represented in proceedings for an offence before an Aboriginal or Islander Court. The Commonwealth Act also has the effect of preventing an Aboriginal or Islander from being convicted by such a Court of an offence against Regulations or By-laws made under the Queensland legislation unless a right of appeal exists in the matter to a superior Court The Queensland legislation provides merely for an appeal to a District Officer and to a visiting Justice. (5) Compulsory Labour By-laws in force on Queensland reserves have provided that all able-bodied persons over the age of 1S ing on a reserve shall, unless otherwise determined by the Manager of the reserve, perform such work as is directed by the Manager or person authorised by the Manager. The Commonwealth Act provides that an Aboriginal or Islander on a reserve is not to be required to comply with any direction to perform work unless the direction is given in relation to the performance of reasonable community obUgations or unless the work is in relation to an obUgation that the Aboriginal would be obliged to perform if the direction were given outside the reserve. (6) Payment of Wages The Queensland legislation contains provisions relating to the employment of Aboriginals and Islanders in accordance with the provision of awards, but these provisions apply only outside reserves. There is also a provision that provides that an Aboriginal who is an aged, infirm or slow worker may be paid less than the basic wage or minimum wage prescribed by an award. This provision only applies to Aboriginals and does not apply generally to persons in the workforce. Article 23 (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that 'everyone, without any discrimination, has therightto equal pay for equal work'. The Commonwealth Act provides that Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland are not to be employed on terms and conditions of employment that are less favourable than those appUcable to other employees. An Aboriginal or Islander is to be entitled to be paid wages at a rate not less than the rate at which wages would be payable to him if he were not an Aboriginal or Islander. These specific points illustrate the way in which the legislation curtails the ordinary rights and freedoms enjoyed by Aboriginals and Islanders as Australian citizens. I do not suggest, however, that the Commission should focus its attention narrowly on the particular provisions referred to, but rather that it should consider the broad framework of Administration of thereservesand the communities established on them. Summary In summaiy, I submit that all special legislative and administrative measures affecting Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders should be based on respect for individual dignity and human rights and should be designed to develop selfrespect, independence, self-management and self-sufficiency of Aboriginals and Islanders. Specifically, I submit that the Commission consider recommending that: Aboriginal and Island Councils should have full responsibility and authority for managing reserve communities; official powers of management and control of reserves andreservecommunities and persons on them should be terminated; title toreservesshould be vested in appropriate Aboriginal and Island trusts; the trusts or councUs or other representative Aboriginal bodies should be empowered to authorise entry to reserves for exploration and mining purposes and to negotiate agreements on mining.",49
149,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,"That will show the earnestness of the Commonwealth in its approach to the attainment of human rights for all people in Australia, particularly with regard to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. One would think, from listening to the honourable gendeman, that the Commonwealth had never legislated for Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland. The situauon is quite to the contrary. The years resid- honourable gentleman's own government in 1975, when it was in office, passed the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975. When the honourable member, in debate, says that State officials can order individuals to leave a reserve, or can preclude them for entering it, he really is not giving enough credit to the legislation of his own government. That Act seeks to entrench certain basic human rights, in favour of Aboriginal and Islanders in Queensland.",52
150,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,They are not enforced.,52
151,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,"That legislation is avadable to every individual who wants to use it to support his personal rights or defend himself against any administrative or legal action brought against them contrary thereto. The honourable gendeman interjects and says that the Commonwealth has not done anything to support or enforce that legislation. Let me give him one simple but graphic illustration of what the Commonwealth Government has done. Recendy, a number of Aboriginals claimed that they were underpaid as a result of a discriminatory low wage, paid to them because they were Aboriginals, for work done for the Queensland Department through the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander advancement. Their case was taken up by the Austrahan Workers Union and was prosecuted before the appropriate industrial tribunal in Queensland. The Commonwealth declared its intention to intervene on the side of those Aboriginals, to plead this particular Federal Act. The case was adjourned and then the parties, the particular Aboriginal who was the plaintiff representing all of them, the Queensland Government and the Queensland director of Aboriginal and Islander advancement settled the case out of court",52
152,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,They were underpaid.,53
153,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,"I would judge that the reason it was settled out of court was so that a court would not rule on this particular legislation. It shows the force of this particular law, which can be used to support the personalrightsof individuals. The honourable gentleman has also referred to Aurukun and Mornington Island and has sought to throw cold water on what has been achieved there. I will always stand in this House, and in any pubhc forum, and uphold what was done by this Government when I was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island. Their reserve had been abolished by an Act of the Queensland Government. We had passed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978. We sought to obtain from the Queensland Government assurances that it would provide for the Aboriginal residents real self-management and real security of tenure for the two reserves. The result was the passage through the Queensland Parliament of Act No. 6 of 1978 for the creation of a local authority area at Aurukun and Mornington Island and to authorise the granting of long term leases to secure the traditionalrightsof the Aboriginal residents. I am pleased to advise that the leases for both those communities were granted on 18 January this year.",53
154,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,Wd l you tender them?,53
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,Mr M ill a rOrder! I require the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to remain suent He addressed the House in silence and I ask .him to accord the same privilege to the Minister.,53
156,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,"Recendy , local authority elections were held at both Aurukun and Mornington Island and new councds were elected. I am informed that almost all of the former councdlors in both places were re-elected, including both former chairmen. At Mornington Island this Saturday and at Aurukun this Sunday, the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Mr Hinze, accompanied by the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney, wdl inaugurate the new councUs pursuant to those elections under the authority of the Queensland legislation to which I have referred. As from the time of that inauguration, the administrators will cease their functions and the councUs will be fully self-governing authorities in their ownrights.Therefore, the twin goals of the Commonwealth when we embarked upon consultation with the Queensland Government leading to the Queensland legislation No. 6 of 1978 have been achieved. Self-management has been achieved in a real way which no other Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island community in Queensland has achieved. The residents of Aurukun and Mornington Island have security of tenure for their land and have been granted their traditionalrightsin a way which no other Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community in Queensland has achieved. We are at the threshold of a continuing movement in Queensland to achieve these twin goals for aU Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I have been advised that Mr Hinze and the Queensland Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, on 4 July and 11 August, assured the people at Aurukun that their leases would be for the initial period of 50 years and for a further period of 50 years. So in effect they have a lease and security of tenure for their land for 100 years. I have also been advised that detaUs of the lease to which I have referred have been incorporated in recent amendments to the Queensland Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act, which is the legislation to which I have referred. I would have thought that the honourable gentleman could have looked that up for himself and obtained all the necessary detaUs. This progress has been achieved as a result of co-operation with the Queensland Government by standing firm in a spirit of co-operation and not one of confrontation, as the Opposition would have us do. I will refer to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on Queensland Reserves. I refer to page 43 of the report. As I understand the gravamen of the Committee's recommendations, it thought that, because there was no prospect of co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communides Self-management) Act of this Parhament was not likely to be effective. The report states in paragraph 73: Such legislation may well have its greatest impact riding provisions of State legislation which diminish of self-management and control. That is exacdy what the legislation passed by Parliament does. The report continues: Furthermore, such legislation has the capacity entirely effective when enacted as part of a co-operative rangement with the relevant State.",53
157,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,Yes .,54
158,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,"I am glad to hear the honourable gentleman affirm those observations. More ticularly, I am pleased to inform him and House that at this very moment discussions going on in a spirit of co-operation between Queensland and Commonwealth governments with regard to the implementation of that selfhave management legislation. These discussions result from a request made to the Commonwealth by the community at Yarrabah to be granted selfdo management under the Commonwealth Act and also from a request of the Commonwealth Minisexpect ter for Aboriginal Affairs to Queensland Government for land tenure sinular to the tenure that has been obtained in the Northern Territory. The Minister commenced negotiations with his counterpart in Queensland following communications between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the chased, Queensland Premier. As a result, communibeen cations have been taking place between officials as a prelude to further Ministerial discussions. Talks were held yesterday and are going on today in Brisbane in response to the request of future. the Yarrabah people. Is is not only for them that these discussions are proceeding but for all Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders Uving on reserves in Queensland. The object of these discussions is to see whether, in a spirit of co-operation, a legal and administrative framework might be worked out covering all reserves so that there will be a continuing ward movement on the basis of the Commonthis wealth legislation and of any amendments to Queensland legislation or further legislation which the Queensland Government might wish to pass to give effect to these twin goals of management and security of tenure. So, it cannot be said that the Commonwealth is not alert in responding to the aspirations of the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders of Queensland. It can, in fact, be said that through the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney, these aspirations are being pursued actively and in their interests. As I have shown by the incorporation of my submission to the Queensland inquiry into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Acts, we in overhave a clear charter which guides us in the purpowers suit of our efforts for the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland. The advice that I have this received from my colleague is that the discussions that are under way are proceeding very to be well and we would expect that they will be fruitarful in the end and to the advantage of the Aboriginal and Islander people. What has happened, Mr Speaker, is that the Commonwealth selfmanagement legislation has been a catalyst for parthe advance of humanrightsfor the Aboriginal the and Islander people of Queensland. The Local are Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act 1978 might the very well be regarded as the flag flying at the masthead of human rights in Queensland. As I said, those two communities, as a result of Commonwealth action, now enjoy rights which other Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland not enjoy. But because of the lead given by these two communities the others may well that sometimein the future they too will negotiate with the enjoy them. I refer also to the fact that the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission is active in Queensland in acquiring property on behalf of the Aboriginals. For example, at Murray Upper a freehold farm area and some forest leases have been purand at Daintree a freehold farm has purchased. I am advised that The Minister for Aborigmal Affairs (Senator Chaney) wdl be presenting the title to the freehold property to the people in that community in the very near",54
159,Mr SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,54
160,Dr EVERINGHAM,ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDERS COMMISSION,"Capricornia) (2.46)The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) has put to the House a modest proposal which seeks to convince us that the forGovernment really has done something about flag of freedom flying at the masthead for the Queenslanders. That flag of freedom is not recognised by the Aborigmal people. They have not been involved in the negotiations which selfproduced the lease and they have not been involved in the negotiations that the Minister speaks of as gomg on now. They have never been mvolved in any of the negotiations which the Mmister described as being carried out in a spirit of co-operation as distinct from confrontation. What is happening is that the Federal Government is appeasing or fading over backwards to please the Queensland Government. It is not implementing its legislation or the legislation of the Labor Government to remove discrimination. There are still people at Aurukun, Mornington Island and all the other State settlements in Queensland who are suffering under the heel ofan apartheid-type rule and dictatorship which was imposed on them without consultation with them or their democratically chosen leaders or representatives. This has resulted in such things as a manager appointed by bureaucrats in Brisbane having the right to keep people off their traditional homeland, the land on which they were born and the land which traditionally belongs to their tribal ancestors. This prevents Aboriginal people visiting each other and sending messages to each other by telephone, telegram or post. It affects their right to travel to town, to call ambulances or to seek medical care. All these rights can be vetoed by a white manager who has nothing in common with the Aboriginal people, who is not chosen or employed by them, and cannot be sacked by them. He is a civil servant in the service of Mr Killoran, the Director of the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement in Queensland, a man whose name is not one that Aboriginals respect, and that is putting it mildly. Not only is there a lack of self-determination in the matter of where Aboriginals are entided to live or with whom they can communicate, but also there are many other humanrightsdenied Aboriginals in Queensland.

NA REPRESENTATIVES: ANNUAL REPORT",54
161,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSE OF,"For the information of honourable members. I present the annual report 67 of the Department of the House of Representa32 tives for the year 1978. This is thefirstannual report of the Department, which is the secretariat 35 of the House. Among other matters, the report describes the activities and business of the House in 1978 and records the several developments and reforms of House procedures and practices which occurred last year. The Government's decision to proceed with a new and permanent parliament house made 1978 a year of great historical significance. It was also an important year in the procedural development of the House. I refer in particular to the introduction of legislation committees which will open up great potential Martyr, J.R. Millar, P. C. for improvements in the way this House examines proposed legislation. I pay tribute to the Government's support for this and other parliamentary initiatives taken in 1978. But 1978 was also significant because of the growth of interest in parhamentary reform, both inside the House and elsewhere. There is much debate on how this Parliament can become more effective and how the practices and procedures of the two Houses, and of this House in particular, might be made more responsive to the demands made upon a modern legislature. I have been aware of the deepening interest of members in these matters and their belief that reform must ultimately come from the House itself. The past was a history of neglect of reform of the House's practices and procedures. Rarely had reform been an important issue for government or for the majority of members. For 49 years the House operated under provisional Standing Orders based on those of the State Houses of Parliament whose own standing orders were in turn substantially based upon those of the House of Commons at Westminster in the 19th century. Apart from increasing controls over thetimeaUowed to members to speak, the only wide-ranging and fundamental reforms which had taken place in this House in the previous 77 years were the reforms adopted in 1963 to modernise and streamlinefinancialprocedures. Accordingly, a large backlog of issues has buUt up at the heart of the parliamentary institution and for which reform is now overdue. My own Ust includes the role of committees, research and administrative support for members, the organisation and functions of the parhamentary departments, a parhamentary budget, thefinancialprocedures of the House, especially in relation to the Budget, programming of business, debating time for the Opposition and private members, parhamentary privUege, televising of Parliament and the independence, authority and powers of the Speakership. Each of these items is complex. Some could not be resolved quickly or easily. ParUamentary reform must not ignore the proper relationship between the three arms of government in the Westminster system. I wish to see a patient and careful review with full, deUberate and informed debate leading towards the adoption of a range of reforms. To do that the debate needs to be more structured and tofinddirection. The Clerk of the House has great knowledge and expertise in the ways of this House its traditions, its procedures, its strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, it is the Clerk's report which I have tabled. Therefore it is appropriate that the Clerk should prepare, for the consideration of the House, comprehensive discussion papers on parhamentary reform. The papers should provide a focus for debate in the House after consideration by the Executive and parties. After the debate, concentrated attention could be given to determination of a reform agenda and the priorities within it, identification of reforms which warrant immediate implementation and the establishment of an appropriate method to undertake long term reviews and to bring forward proposals to the House.",55
162,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSE OF,"Mr Speaker, will there be an opportunity to debate this excellent report?",56
163,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSE OF,I have deUvered the report to the House; I made an accompanying statement. It will be a matter of the programing of the House and its procedures as to whether there will be a debate.,56
164,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSE OF,On behalf of the Opposition I take the opportunity of making a request of the Government that there be time aUocated in the near future to enable a significant debate to take place in view of the very saUent points that have been made affecting the well-being of parUamentarians and the effective operation of the Parliament. Could I have an assurance that the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) might consider making available such a debating opportunity?,56
165,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSE OF,The request of the Opposition Whip will be brought to the attention of the Leader of the House. Motion (by Mr Clyde Cameron)-by leave-proposed : That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA,56

168,Mr COHEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes . It has just been drawn to my attention that in the discussion on the matter of public importance yesterday I am reported at page 1489 of the Hansard record as stating: . . . I shall ask my old friend Ralph Nader, with whom I travelled around Australia in 1971 when the former member for Lalor, Dr Jim Caims and I brought him here on road safety issues . . . If the tapes are Ustened to I think it will be found that I did not mention Dr Jim Cairns. I was referring to the present member for Lalor, Mr Barry Jones. There was one other error. It was my fault. I mentioned 1971 instead of 1972.I ask that that be corrected in Hansard.",56

170,Mr LYNCH,SELECT COMMITTEE ON TOURISM,"by leave-Touris m is a very significant Austrahan industry. It is already considerable economic and social consequence. Even more important, however, are its prospects for growth. This industry has the potential bring major benefits in improving the balance payments, generating employment opportunities in both country and city areas, and improving cultural contact between Australia and overseas societies. Until recently the concept of travel tourism as representing an integrated and recogsolve nisable industry-a n industry in the traditional Australian sense-ha s not been accepted by the Australian people. It is not going too far to say that the increasing acceptance of this concept of tourism is a measure of the developing maturity of Austraha as a nation. The gathering recognition of economic and social benefits flowing from tourCouncd ism and the persistence and drive of people in tourist industry have been factors to which changing concept of tourism can be attributed. The tourist industry has assumed particular significance in the Austrahan economy in recent years and this importance can be expected crease. It is significant from the point of view the industry's long term growth prospects and abUity to contribute to employment opportunisubmissions ties and foreign exchange earnings. According calculations made by the Bureau of Industry Economics in the Bureau's preliminary working paper on the economic significance of tourism, the industry's contribution to gross domestic product amounted to 2.7 per cent in 1973-74, latest year for which data are avadable. The dustry's contribution to total employment estimated at 2.5 per cent and usage of Austraha's capital stock at 2.9 per cent. The BIE has also estimated that a 5 per cent increase in foreign visitor expenditure would lead to the employing ment of 1,340 persons throughout the Australian economy. Foreign exchange earnings from ism are currently around $325m a year. In recognition of the importance attached this industry and in order to be better informed as to its potential and the problems it faced, on December 1976 the Government announced the appointment of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism to inquire into and report on a number of issues concerning tourism in Austraha. These issues included an examination of the significance and potential of tourism, its economic considerations, its special features and problems facing the industry. The Committee was requested to recommend courses of action to overcome those problems. With the prorogation of the Parliament on 28 February 1977, the Select Committee ceased to exist. A of second committee was subsequently appointed in March 1977. It presented an interim report just prior to the dissolution of the House on 10 to November 1977. At this point I might mention of that one of the major recommendations contained in the interim report was that the Export Market Development Grants scheme should be amended to cover the travel and tourist industry. or This served to reinforce the Government's reto assist the industry in this regard and, as the House is aware, the enabling legislation was enacted during the last sitting of Parliament. Since the interim report was tabled, I have also established the Travel and Tourist Industry Advisory Councd, which comprises representatives of a broad cross-section of industry, consumers, the trade unions and two partiamentarians. The has had four meetings and has provided the me and the Government with significant advice the regarding the various recommendations of the Select Committee. The interim report of the Select Committee confirmed the importance of the inquiry into the tourist industry and the Comto inmittee was subsequendy reconstituted on 2 of March 1978. After a detailed and searching inits quiry, including the examination of some 190 and a total of 206 witnesses, the to final report of the Committee was tabled in the House on 26 October 1978. Following its tabUng in Parliament, the Committee's report has been subject to a detaUed examination by my Department and comment and advice has been sought the from other Commonwealth Government departinments and authorities, State and Territory was governments and the tourist industry. Perhaps at thistimeI should briefly outline the Government's general policy on tourism, bearin mind that it has been agreed by Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for tourtourism that the promotion and development of tourism within Austraha is the prime responsibUity of the States, the territories and the industo try. The Commonwealth's main role lies in the creation of a stable economic climate in which 1 the travel and tourist industry, along with other industries, can achieve its full potenual. The Commonwealth, however, has a more specific responsibility and that is to encourage overseas visitors to travel to and within Austraha. It is against this background that the Government has accorded top priority to restoring economic stabdity, with the main emphasis being on reducing inflauon. Success in these endeavours is necessary in order to provide a sound basis for growth. A considerable degree of success has been achieved. Australia's annual rate of inflauon has been reduced significantly. The competitive position of Australian industries has been improved and increased interest is being shown in new investment. There is a resurgence of consumer and business confidence. We are at the sametimeconcerned to increase employment opportunities in Australia and to crease our foreign exchange earnings. This connificant cern has been reflected in the Government's rethe cent initiatives to encourage greater export activity. In recognising the economic significance of tourism, the Select Committee acknowledges the difficulty in quantifying die extent of economic significance. It therefore recomgrants mended in recommendation No. 2 that a study the economic significance of tourism be underAustralia taken as a matter of urgency. It is pleasing record that the Bureau of Industry Economics well on the way with its study of the economic significance of tourism. A working paper on first stage of the study has been completed and being circulated to interested parties comment. In addition to creating a sound economic base from which the tourist industry can grow and prosper, the Government has undertaken a a number of initiatives aimed at encouraging the advancement of the industry. A record 37 per cent increase in funds was provided to the Ausother traUan Tourist Commission in 1978-79, which Additionally, has enabled the Commission to double its marrendy keting activities overseas. To support these activities, new pubUcations have been printed and others are in the process of production. These are in foreign languages as well as in English. The ATC's new pubUcations are being well received overseas. Twofilmsare now being produced. One is a major destination film which will replace the current ATC standard film, which 1,000 prints have been distributed around the world. The other is being developed specifically for the United States market. As well, audio visual presentations have been developed for use in marketing promotions. The 'Make Friends for Australia' campaign is in progress. Every Australian leaving the country is being shortly. asked to encourage people overseas to visit Australia. The response has been very good. Early in May the ATC will take some 30 leading Australian tourist industry executives to the United Kingdom and Europe on a mission to sell Australian travel products to the outbound travel industry in Great Britain and continental Europe. In the markets, the Commission is now undertaking promotions to the travel trade, coordinating Australian supplements in overseas pubUcations, stepping up media pubUcity on Austraha and undertaking its most comprehensive consumer advertising campaigns for more than five years. The travel and tourist industry has also been encouraged to extend its overseas promotional effort following the enactment of legislation to extend coverage of the Export Marinket Development Grants scheme to this very sigindustry. In the first year of operation of extended scheme, it is estimated that accrued grants payable to the travel and tourist industry could be as high as $3.25m. The Commission is presendy adapting its programs to enable the in this dustry to derive maximum benefit from the scheme. One of the impediments to of increasing the number of overseas visitors to has been the high cost of international to air fares between Australia and our major maris kets, such as Europe, North America and Japan. In addition to being relatively isolated geothe graphicaUy, the vastness of our country has is meant the cost of travel within Australia has for been an inhibiting factor. The Government has given particular attention to these problems and has undertaken comprehensive reviews of its civU aviation poUcy. As result, significant reductions in air fares between Australia and several of our major tourist markets have been announced and lower fares to countries are currently under negotiation. the domestic airUne industry is curexamining the possibUity of introducing a more innovative fare structure, which it is hoped will make domestic air travel within Australia more attractive. The airUnes have also been asked to explore a wider range of fare types, principaUy by the addition of low fares, coupled with reduced certainty of seat access. Although discussions are continuing, the airlines have of already responded by the extension of advance purchase excursion fares to Darwin, Alice Springs, Mount Isa and Canbena. A further initiative has been the introduction of stand-by fares, which provide for a 30 per cent discount on the normal economy fare. I am hopeful that further concessional fares will be announced The lower fares are broadening the profile of tourists to Austraha and the Austrahan Tourist Commission has been active in motivating these tourists to move more widely in Austraha. These new air fares are undoubtedly contributing to increased travel to Austraha by tourists from overseas. However, the fares alone wdl of course not achieve the substantial increases envisaged. They make us more competitive in the markets, but increased promotion is necessary if one is to capitalise on them. As a consequence of these initiatives, the Austrahan tourist industry can look forward with confidence to accelerated growth over the next five years. The Austrahan Tourist Commission has advised me that, in 1979 alone, overseas visitors are expected to increase by some 10 per cent-a n increase of 60,000 over the previous year-and that the annual growth rate could be as high as 15 per cent by 1981. This would lead to over one million tourists coming to Australia annually by 1983. These forecasts of growth for the travel and tourist industry are most encouraging. I am concerned, however, that the industry provides additional capacity to handle the increased numbers of overseas visitors. Clearly, any deficiencies that do exist will need to be overcome quickly and I will be discussing this matter in some considerable detad with my tourist ministerial colleagues at the next meeting of the tourist ministers' councU in June. I might say in passing that I have already made contact with aU of the state Ministers and that action in terms of reporting to me is taking place at the present time. There is clearly a compeUing need for new hotels of international standard in several State capital cities. I am aware of a number of disprovided cussions which are taking place on this subject. hope that decisions to proceed will be announced in the near future, as of course urgent. The Select Committee's report highUghted other problems which also must be overcome if Australia is to attain the maximum benefits this industry has to offer in terms of contribution to employment, foreign exchange earnings and economic growth generally. The high cost of labour is a major factor inhibiting the growth potential of tourism in Australia this problem is exacerbated problem. The Select Committee concluded that: The present wages conditions in the tourist industry vide a positive competitive disadvantage to the Australian tourist industry vis-a-vis other countries, and the present penalty rate structure prejudices employment opportunities in the industry. WhUst the potential benefits from tourism are great, Australia must face the reaUty that it is a very competitive industry in which high standards are demanded around the clock, seven days a week, not just on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. basis Monday to Friday. To achieve this standard of service and to match our international competitors ways must be found to rationalise the present wage structure. The Select Committee recognised the difficulty in resolving this problem and has recommended that a tripartite working group be estabUshed'. . . to inquire into and report on the ""normal"" hours of work, penalty rates and related working conditions'. This recommendation has been taken up by the Government and a tripartite committee was recendy established under the chairmanship of Mr Charles Trethowan, Chairman of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, to examine the effects on employment, particularly of young people, of a variety of factors including penalty rates. There were 30 recommendations and 15 conclusions without recommendations in the Committee's report. WhUst the conclusions of the Committee did not call for specific action, I have brought them to the attention of my colleagues who have specific responsibUities in respect of particular aspects raised. In regard to the Committee's recommendations, most of which required specific action by the Commonwealth Government, I am pleased to report that a number have already been implemented or are being implemented at the presenttime.Among these are the study of the economic significance of tourism and the tripartite committee to inquire into and report on penalty rates and related issues, both of which I mentioned earlier. On the question of adequate data, sufficient funds were to the Australian Tourist Commission I to enable it to re-introduce the survey of international visitors to Australia. The survey will the need is very commence in April. The Government agrees with the Committee's conclusions that the tourist industry would its benefit from increased competition by rent-a-car operators at airports. Honourable members will be aware that tenders were recendy called for the operation of rent-a-car facUities at airports on and terms which will provide for increased by a wage structure competition. As might be expected, many of the recommendations for Commonwealth action have expendiproture implications-for example, recommendation No. 18 concerning depreciation aUowances for income producing buUdings and investment allowances; recommendation No. 22 dealing with funding for the Austrahan Tourist Commission; and recommendation No. 12 dealing with the in new tourist vUlage to service visitors at Rock. These matters are to be considered by the Government in the context of the 1979-80 Budget. Recommendation No. 24 dealt with the parture tax which was announced in the 1978-79 Budget. My colleague, the Minister for Immiproduced gration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), is sponsible for administering the legislation ing the departure tax and he will be reviewing the operation of that legislation. With regard the suggestion that the proceeds of the tax should be used for the promotion and development Australian tourism, I remind honourable members that this tax was introduced as a eral revenue measure and not as a means of financing a particular area of government expenof diture such as tourism promotion. As a general principle, the Government is not in favour of marking or 'hypothecation' of particular of revenue to particular areas of expenditure. In recommendation No. 32, the Select Committee recommended that the Government expedite legislation to register travel agents. Honourable members will be aware that, on 26 January 1979,1 announced that the Government had decided not to proceed with such legislation. This announcement followed by the Government to the need for Commonwealth legislation in respect of travel agents. The Government concluded that the very heavy admal ministrative burden which would result, inherent additional costs to the industry, and ultimately the travelling public, could not be be justified. Decisions in respect of a number of the Committee's recommendations have not yet been finalised for several reasons. I have already mentioned that some of them will be considered in the context of the next Budget. Four of the recommendations are to be discussed at the next meeting of the Tourist Ministers' Council which has wdl be held in June of this year. For example, the recommendation No. 27 called for the Tourist completed. Ministers' Council to consider ways to the methods of funding regional ations. The remaining recommendations are currently the subject of further discussion and it is expected they will be resolved in the near future. I have prepared a statement which hsts each of the Select Committee's recommendations and the current position concerning those recommendations. I would like to present that statement for incorporation in Hansard so that honourable members may have the opportunity to examine it detaU. In conclusion, I pay tribute to the work Ayers of the members of the Select Committee involved in this comprehensive inquiry and report into the tourist industry. Honourable members wiU recall that the initial Committee was chaired by the former honourable member for Herbert. deThe honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) was the Chairman of the Committee which the final report for consideration by rethe Government. I pay a particular tribute to his coverchairmanship under which the work of the Committee was brought to fruition. I congratulate to members of the Committee on the contribution that they have made to the further development of of the tourist industry, and particularly the former honourable member for Herbert and the genhonourable member for Bowman, for the work that they have undertaken. For die information honourable members, I present detaUs of the Government's responses to each of the Comearmittee's recommendations. I seek leave to have forms those responses incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA NA NA Current position concerning recommendations careful attention Recommendation The Committee recommends that tourists be defined as persons who travel more than 40 kilometres from their norplace of residence for any reason other than to comand the mute to a normal place of work. I consider that the Committee's recommendation should accepted in principle although pracucai difficulties are likely to restrict its general adoption in research studies. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) The study of the economic significance of tourism be undertaken as a matter of urgency, and (b) Sufficient resources be provided to enable it to be completed without delay. This recommendation is being implemented. The study been accorded a high priority and a working paper on first stage which outlines tourism's contribution to GDP and total employment in Australia has already been This paper is currendy being circulated to improve interested parties for comment. tourist associRecommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) The staff ceiling of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority be lifted to a level where zoning procedures for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park can be completed within twenty-five years, and Commonwealth responsibility for the great barrier reef rests with my colleague, the Minister for Science and the Environment. I have been advised that the quesuon of staffing arrangements must await the outcome of discussions between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government concerning jurisdiction over the territorial seas. (b) sufficient funds be made available to allow the Authority to provide interpretative facilities for tourists at the major destination The provision of interpretative facUities is the responsibUity of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Funds for this purpose wiU need to be considered in the context of the 1979-80 Budget Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) The Government in consultation with the Northern Territory Administration take urgent steps to overcome the existing delays in the development of the Uluru National Park, and (b) The proposed tourist with as a matter of urgency and that adequate funds be provided for the development of the village. Financing of the proposed active considerauon with the Northern Territory Government with a view to proceeding with the project as soon as possible. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in association with the Minister for Transport and the respective State and a list of those tourist roads deserving priority funding for tourist purposes, and (b) Additional funds be made available by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to upgrade those roads. This recommendation will be considered by the Tourist Ministers' Council at its next meeting in June this year. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Minister for Transport invite the Chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission to accept membership of the Aviation Industry Advisory Council This recommendation is being considered in the broader context of co-ordination of Government transport and tourism poUcies. I am pursuing this matter with my colleague the Mmister for Transport. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) The Commonwealth Government establish an interdepartmental standing committee on air transport, (b) The inter-departmental standing committee be responsible for reviewing the reports of committees on domestic and international aviation and (c) The inter-departmental standing committee be comthe posed of those departments and instrumentalities with a direct interest in air transport, Departments of Industry and Commerce and Transport and the Australian Tourist Commission. This recommendation is also being considered in the broader context of co-ordination of Government transport and tourism poUcies. I am pursuing this matter with my colleague the Minister for Transport. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) A depreciation allowance for income-producing buildings be introduced as soon as possible, areas adjacent to the reef. (b) the present investment allowance be amended to allow multiples of the same item to be claimed as a single investment where the items are used solely in Australia for producing assessable income, and (c) any future investment allowances allow for multiples of the same item to be claimed as a single investment where the items are for use solely in Australia for producing assessable income. The Government will be considering these matters in the context of the 1979-80 Budget. Recommendation village be proceeded with forthThe Committee recommends that the Tourist Ministers' Council establish a working group to co-ordinate caravan park standards. Yulara Tourist Village is under The recommendation will be considered by the Tourist Ministers' Council at its next meeting in June this year. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) The Minister for Industry and Commerce direct the Australian Tourist Commission to involve itself in domestic promotion, Territory governments, compile (b) the Australian Tourist Commission undertake unbrella promotion campaigns in consultation with the State and Territory governments aimed at persuading Australians to holiday in Australia, and (c) the Australian Tourist Commission be provided with sufficient funds to enable it to undertake such campaigns. The Government will be considering these matters in the context of the 1979-80 Budget. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) future appropriations to the Australian Tourist Commission allow for increased overseas promotional activity, and (b) staffing be kept at a level appropriate to the level of funding. The Government wiU be considering these matters in the context of the 1979-80 Budget. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Government make available to the Australian Tourist Commission sufficient additional funds to allow the reintroduction of the survey of the steering international visitors to Australia. The increased allocation of funds to the ATC in the 1978-79 Budget has enabled the Commission to reintroduce survey of international visitors to Australia which will be conducted from April 1979 to March 1980 at a cost of apincluding the proximately $200,000. This recommendation has been implemented. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) Funds raised by the departure tax announced in the 1978-79 Budget be used for the promotion and development of Australian tourism, and Pan (a) of the Committee's recommendation is not supponed as it raises the question of the hypothecation (or earmarking) of general revenue taxes which has been traditionally resisted by successive Governments. (b) The responsibility for collecting the tax rest with the carrier. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is responsible for administering the departure tax legislation. He will shortly be conducting a review of the operation of the legislation. This review mil include the quesuon of responsibility for collecting the tax. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) The Department of Industry and Commerce be retitled the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, and (b) the Government urgently consider an appropriate restructuring of that increasing significance of tourism is recognised. These matters are receiving active consideration. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Government in making grants under both the National Estate program and the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974 take into full account the importance of tourism when considering the preservation of both the National Estate and the natural environment The administration of the National Estate program is the responsibUity of my colleague the Minister for Home Affairs. The administration of the State Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974 is the responsibiUty of my colleague the Minister for Science and the Environment I am pursuing these matters with the Ministers concerned. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Tourist Ministers' Council urgently consider ways to improve the methods of funding regional tourist associations by all interested parties. This recommendation will be considered by the Tourist Ministers' Council at its next meeting in June this year. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the tourist industry through the Australian Travel Research Conference establish the statistical and research needs of the industry and inform each State Tourism Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce of these needs. This is a matter for industry in the first instance. Although I do not have any firm proposals before me at the moment my Department will shortly be publishing a booklet containing a range of statistics relevant States and industry will then be asked to comment on areas where additional information is required. As I previously indicated the Bureau of Industry Economics is also undertaking a nificance of tourism. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Government expedite the introduction into the Parliament of legislation to register travel agents. This recommendation has not been accepted by the Government. On 26 Januaiy this year I announced that the Government had decided not to proceed with legislation to regulate the activities of travel agents. The Government's decision took into account objections raised by the States and industry and advice from the Travel and Tourist Industry Advisory Council that the legislation should not proceed. The matter was also subject to exhaustive examination by five Departments which unanimously supported the conclusion reached by the Advisory Council. In deciding not to proceed with the travel agents legislation the Government has had regard to the degree of protection for the travelling pubUc which already exists, including Commonwealth and State laws relating to protection of the consumer, the regulation of corporate bodies, and crimes matters generally. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Minister for Industry and Commerce recommend to the Tourist Ministers' Council that the Australian Standing Committee on Tourism: Department to ensure that the (a) consider and assess the adequacy of convention facilities presently available in Australia, and (b) determine what action should be taken to improve convention facilities. This recommendation will be considered by the Tourist Ministers' Council at its next meeting in June this year. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) the ceiling for loans assistance from the Commonwealth Development Bank for any one borrower be increased to Sim, and I am pursuing this matter with the Treasurer. (b) any tourism project be eligible for Commonwealth Development loans. This recommendation has been implemented. An amendment to the Commonwealth Banks Act in June last year empowered the Commonwealth Development Bank to providefinancefor the estabUshment or development of all kinds of business undertakings, particularly smaU undertakings. Since that amendment the Bank has accepted that tourism projects in all localities qualify for consideration. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) the Government establish a tripartite working group to inquire into and report on the 'normal' hours of work, penalty rates and related working conditions, (b) the report of that working group be made a public document and transmitted to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and to the tourist industry. The (c) the question of penalty rates, casual and part-time work be included in the terms of reference of any committee established to consider the effects of technological change on employment in Australia. major study on the economic sigOn 1 December 1978 the Prime Minister announced that a tripartite committee under the chairmanship of Mr B. Trethowan had been estabUshed through the National Labour Consultative Council to examine, inter alia: (a) the effect of particular aspects of labour costs on employment such as penalty rates, rates of pay for juniors and other labour costs affecting the employment of young people; (b) the effect of working patterns on employment factors such as weekend work, part-time work and possible new arrangements such as job sharing; (c) the labour relations aspects of technological change. The Select Committee's recommendations will be brought to the attention of the NLCC be given to penalty rates issues within the entertainment, accommodation and hospitality sectors. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) the tender for car rental concessions at each of the fifty-nine listed airports should be let to two national operators, and (b) at those airports where there are adequate terminal facilities additional tenders should be let to a third operator on an airport by airport basis. This recommendation has been implemented. On 23 Januaiy 1979 my colleague the Minister for Transport announced that the Government had decided that tenders will be caUed for two national operators, service all Commonwealth-owned airports, as Avis does now, and a third operator on an airport by airport basis. Recommendation The Committee recommends continuing study of noise certification of aircraft with a view to the lifting of curfews as aircraft noise dimishes. My colleague the Minister for Transport has advised that his Department is studying ways and means by which the curfew can be varied. The Government considers that the lifting of the curfew at Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney airports would affect the scheduling of intemauonal flights, would allow more efficient utilisation of aircraft and would undoubtedly assist the tourist industry. However, the Government is concerned that operations in the early morning hours with existing aircraft would create severe community disturbance problems. A total lifting of the curfew stage. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the major domestic airlines make available to licensed travel agents and the general public innovative fare structures including reduced fares for use in the construction of all-inclusive tours. This matter is being considered in the context of the Domestic Air Transport Review and will be discussed with airlines when negotiations on a new Airlines Agreement have been finalised. I am pursuing this matter with my colleague the Minister for Transport. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Income Tax Act 1972 to allow for the costs of leasehold improvements at Commonwealth owned aerodromes to be tax deductible. This recommendation is being examined in conjunction with the Committee's recommendation regarding a depreciation allowance for income-producing buildings. The Government will be considering these matters in the context of the 1979-80 Budget. Recommendation The Committee recommends that a study be undertaken of the desirability of the designation of a Tasmanian airport as an international airport. The quesuon of designating a Tasmanian airport as an intemauonal airport is really a quesdon of assessing potenual traffic that would be available and the cost involved. These matters will be studied in the context of the appUcation by the domestic caniers to operate a service between Hoban and Christchuich. asking that particular attention This recommendation has been accepted. Recommendation The Committee recommends that: (a) an international airport be designated at Townsville, and (b) the developmental work required be authorised as soon as possible. The Bureau of Transpon Economics has found that the provision of an international airpon at Townsville could be justified by 1983. A decision on this matter will not be required until 1980. I am pursuing this matter with my colleague the Minister for Transpon. who will be required to Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Minister for Transport announce as soon as possible a specific timetable for the upgrading of Brisbane Airport. On 6 June 1978 my colleague the Minister for Transport announced that the redevelopment of Brisbane International Airpon will comprise a new runway, domestic terminal complex and operational faciUties and will be ready for use by early 1986. The Government has approved in principle a program that would achieve the redevelopment of the airpon in the shonest practical time. This recommendation has been accepted. Recommendation The Committee recommends the introduction of a standard set of road information signs for use within Australia. is, therefore, not foreseen at this This recommendation will be considered by the Tourist Ministers' Council at its meeting in June this year. Recommendation The Committee recommends that the problem of intrastate pick-up and set-down rights for long-distance coaches be resolved by the Australian Transport Advisory Council. This matter is essentially a State responsibUity. It is proposed that the question of deregulation ofland transpon be discussed at the next meeting of the Australian Transpon Advisory Council. I have asked my Department to follow up the outcome of these discussions with the Depanment of Transport.",57
171,Mr LYNCH,TOURISM,"I present the following papers: Tourism-Selec t Committee-Report-Governmen t reponse-Ministeria l Statement, 3 April 1979. Recommendations of Committee and responses. Motion (by Mr Groom) proposed: That the House take note of the papers. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Groom)-by leave-agree d to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Robertson speaking for a period not exceeding 20 minutes.",63
172,Mr COHEN,TOURISM,"Tourism is now receiving the attention that it deserves. The media, and I would say the Parliament, are at long last giving this industry the close scrutiny that it should have had for many years in this country. I point out to honourable members that when I first entered this place the standard of debate on the tourist industry was appalling. I take some credit for the fact that the Labor Party's platform during the 1972 elecuon campaign contained a very strong tourist pohcy. That pohcy was implemented by the Labor Government's Minister for Tourism and Recreation, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Stewart). I think that was a major breakthrough on the part of the Minister. However, I beheve that even he had problems in getting the industry the recognition it deserved by the Cabinet of the day. I think this Government made a very bad mistake when it first came to office by slashing severely expenditure on the tourist industry. Now we are seeing what might be called a comeback. There are some signs that the Government is now taking tourism a Uttle more seriously than it has in the past. My complaint about the present approach of the Government is that it is an ad hoc approach. There is no national strategy. I make the point that I know it is traditional for the Opposition to criticise and that therefore the general attitude is that 'he is just getting up here and saying these things because he has to attack the Liberal Government'. Let me assure honourable members that that is not my purpose. I would be just as critical if the Opposition in government adopted the same approach. It is my view, and I think it is the view of many members of this House, that we are in a critical situation, not only in Austraha but aU over the world, in regard to exactly who and what should be encouraged. At the moment we know that the agricultural sector in Australia is booming. That is good. The mining industry isfluctuatingthis way and that way. Manufacturing industry is in trouble. But we also know that if there was a massive boom in the agricultural and mining industries there would not be a commensurate pickup in employment in those areas. As we all know, the manufacturing industry is becoming more highly mechanised with the greater use of computer technology. It is unlikely that the manufacturing sector wtil have large scope for employment in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we turn to the service sector. It is unquestionable that the travel industry is growing and will continue to grow. Leisure travel around the world will be one of the major expansion industries in our society. At thetimewhen my mother and father, who are not aUve today, twice traveUed around the world, it was considered that they were doing very well to have had two world trips in their lifetimes. Today I talk to young working people-to clerks, to typists and to stenographers-wh o now annually go overseas for their hoUdays. This is all a phenomenon of the lastfiveto 10 years. With the increase in wages, jet travel is one area in the travel industry in which costs have come down. This is a phenomenon and we ought, if you like, to jump on the bandwagon of tourism. In my view what we require is a total national strategy. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch) in his speech made some points about the report of the Bureau of Industry Economics. He said: According to calculations made by the Bureau of Industry Economics in the Bureau's preUminary working paper on the economic significance of tourism, the industry's contribution to gross domestic product amounted to 2.7 per cent in 1973-74, the latest year for which data are available. The industry's contribution to total employment was estimated at 2.S per cent and usage of Australia's capital stock at 2.9percent. As the Minister pointed out in answer to a question which was raised in the House, I think yesterday or the day before, this puts the tourist industry in much the same category as the motor vehicle industry. It puts it not far behind the mining industry. I say to honourable members that I doubt whether this industry has ever received the sort of assistance that the vehicle industry has received or that the rnining industry has received. We trunk nothing of spending hundreds of mUUorts of doUars to provide railway Unes, wharves or ports; one could go on and on. The mining industry is not that far ahead of the tourist industry in the contribution that it makes towards employment and the gross domestic product. I beheve that we need a strategy which would assess the market and Australia's potential to capture a share of that market if we are to determine what infrastructure changes are required in regard to airUnes, airports, roads and so on. We need to provide the incentives to ensure that Australia can accommodate the increased population that will be coming to this country. We need to provide incentives or funds for the attractions that will be required if we are to hold people in this country. I believe that one fundamental mistake is made in the tourist industry, namely, assuming that because we have lovely beaches, beautiful harbours and nice forests people wUlflockhere in their hundreds of thousands. I ask honourable members to examine their hearts and souls as to what prompts them to choose a place for a holiday. Is it the beauty of a country? Is it the beauty of an area? That is a great advantage but I would suggest, with due respect, that, whdst Paris is a beautiful city, I doubt that that is why most people flock to Paris. New York is a concrete jungle but it attracts people. Mr Lynch-It would be the birds.",63
173,Mr COHEN,TOURISM,"The Minister said that it would be the birds. I am sure he meant the ladies. But what is it that attracts people to New York? It is certainly not the beauty of that city. I would never accuse the Gold Coast in our own country of being beautiful scenically. But it does have an elegance, a sophistication, a throbbing night life and an excitement that attracts people to it and makes it probably the premier tourist attraction in Australia. I do not think anyone would suggest that it was one of the most beautiful areas of Australia. I say that in all honesty. It certainly would not compare with the beauty of, say, Tasmania or even places Uke north Queensland or my own area. It is these other attractions that I have mentioned that take people on their holidays. One could go on and on. Jerusalem is a magnificent, exciting and pulsating city. Anyone who has been there would agree that it is one of the great tourist attractions of the world. It is not a beautiful country scenicaUy. I suggest that we need to examine the attractions that we have in this country-this does not necessarily have to be done by the national Government alone but by the whole nation-to make sure that when people come to Australia we can provide them with plenty of things to do. I wish to discuss the statement in detaU. I mend the Government and the Minister for what it is doing with regard to the Export Market Development Grants scheme-that is good-and for the setting up of the Travel and Tourist Advisory Council. The Mmister has appointed me to that Council. I have been able to attend only one meeting so far but I find that an interesting body. I am sure it can do some good work. The Minister has also mentioned in his statement that it is important that the economic climate be appropriate to set the right atmosphere for the industry. I would not disagree with that. But with regard to the Commonwealth's role, I see it playing a greater one than that which he spells out. I think the Bureau of Industry Economics study has a lot to offer. I think that even the interim report has provided us with some very important basic facts and figures which will enable us to nad Treasury, which has been such an enemy of the tourist industry.

174,Mr COHEN,TOURISM,"I think the honourable member for Bowman is right. Interestingly enough, I notice in the Bureau's report a statement to the effect that it would appear, from the figures already put together, that speculation that the tourist industry is labour intensive and not capital intensive is not correct. However, we need to look at that much more closely before we make that assessment. It would be quite accurate to say that the aircraft industry and the accommodation sector are probably fairly labour intensive. I do not have the report with me, but I think the Bureau has made the point that so far it is examming only that section of the tourist industry which can be described as being directly applicable to tourism. It has been said over and over until it has become a cUche that the tourist industry is fragmented and that it is difficult to pin down exactly what is tourism and what is not tourism. I suspect that once die level of tourism reaches a certain point and we start to get a large number of tourists, the service sector that is set up to support the tourist industry wdl show it to be far more labour intensive than we imagined. I will look forward to further studies by the Bureau to see whether the assessment that the tourist industry is capital intensive rather than labour intensive is correct. I support the 'Make Friends with Australia' campaign which the Minister launched a few months ago. We do not know whether it wdl work, but it is not an expensive program and it is worth giving a try. There would be no disagreement from us on the marketing of Australia overcom- seas. We applaud those measures. Of course, we are deUghted that finally the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has been dragged reluctandy into the era of cheap fares. HefinaUysaw the Ught, and I suppose it is better to make peace with the Lord on these matters ultimately than to stay and fight on forever. One question that I would like to ask the Minister for Transport, who is in the House at the moment, is: When are we going to be able to win the fight with the Japanese Government? I do not blame the Minister for this situation because the Japanese Government has been quite obstructionist with regard to cheap air fares. We have an enormous market in Japan where there are 130 million people. They have a lot of money. Their wages are very high. Three and a half mUUon Japanese first are travelling around the world-to South East Asia, to Europe and to the United States-bu t we are receiving only 31,000 of them. I do not know what can be done, but I hope that we can put greater pressure on the Japanese Government to lower the air fares. The figures that I got today show that the cost of a first class fare to Tokyo $1,988 and that the cost of an economy seat $ 1,400. That is absolutely absurd. It is only about a 10-hour flight, which makes it about the same distance as the distance from here to the Umted States. Yet the air fares are double the air for that journey and, of course, almost treble cheaper air fare. One matter on which I want to pick up the Minister is his statement that the biggest increase had been in the contribution to the Australian Tourist Commission. That is correct, but what did not say, of course, was that there were substantial cutbacks when this Government came to office. I have taken out some figures which show that in 1973 $3.014m was provided for the ATC. If we use that as a basefigureand use the implicit price deflator ment and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) are so fond of using, for 1978-79 the figure would be $2.335m. So in fact in real terms there has been a drop in the amount of funds avaUable to the ATC. Unfortunately when talking of all these issues one runs out oftime.One could go on for hours about them. I must say that I am concerned at this campaign about penalty rates. When this matter was raised before the Select Committee on Tourism I approached it- I tell the House honestly-wit h an open mind. Many witnesses not provided evidence about this matter and I-a did, I believe, most members of the Committeeclear found them quite unable to provide any evidence to prove the case against penalty rates. I draw the attention of the House to a statement by Roger Kirby, the General Manager of the Travelodge company, the largest chain of motels in formation Australia. He said that the aboUtion of penalty rates in Australia would reduce the bed cost by 50c a night. Recendy I took the trouble to go major motel and ask the manager whether I could look at his wages book. It was a normal sort of motel with 50 rooms. I do not intend name it. I studied thefigures.I know what to look for. His total wages bUl was about $1,400. The costs. total amount of money attributable to penalty rates was $120. The gross takings were, I think, about $40,000 a month. To suggest that that sort NA Rate of City exchange Tokyo Yen 370.625 Paris Fr.8.4675 Dubai UAEDirham7.55 Brussels B.Fr.58.05 Abu Dhabi UAEDirham7.55 of ratio of costs is gomg to make the difference is between a prosperous tourist attraction and one is which is not prosperous is absolutely absurd. As the Minister knows, I get around the industry a lot and talk to many people. In the last few weeks I have heard from two separate sources, fares which are highly reUable, something that has the caused me a great deal of concern. I have been told that hundreds of thousands of dollars are going to be poured into a campaign against penalty rates and that the campaign is to start in the latter part of next year. It is to be done for poUtihe cal purposes by companies and people who inquite tend to wage a campaign against the trade unions on the question of penalty rates. It is gomg to be done by way of television, film and radio programs to carry the message to the people in the last six months before the election which the Governin June 1980. The campaign has two purposes. One purpose is to help the Liberal Party to be returned to office, but the primary purpose is to abolish penalty rates. I would suggest, with due respect to those people who are planning to spend this sort of money to take on the trade union movement on this issue- I believe that they have not been able to prove their case-that they are absolutely insane because they wtil not achieve their aim. Penalty rates are a hard won condition which the trade unions have achieved and which they are going to give up Ughtly. The only result that Is could see would be industrial chaos, without any result. I would like to conclude my remarks on the penalty rate issue by asking leave to Mr Lynch-That idea is news to me.",65

176,Mr COHEN,TABLE OF HOW PRICES COMPARE IN STERLING,"Honourable members will notice that, out of a total of 70 or 80 cities, Tokyo is at the top of the list and that Sydney ranks thirtieth on the list. It has been said by a number of people that we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist market. I have travelled to a number of countries in the last couple of years and I know that suggestion is absolute nonsense. I am not suggesting that Sydney is cheap, but this table proves that we are by no means expensive. We are about the middle. Let us look at the countries that are above us because it is claimed that they are there because of wages. Some of these citiesincluding Tokyo, Paris and Brussels-hav e high wage levels, but No. 11 on the list is London. English wages are nowhere near as high as ours, but costs in London are much higher. Lagos is No. 18 on the list-wel l above Sydney. Taipei also is well above Sydney, and we know the sorts of wage levels that exist in Taipei. Number 26 on the list is Khartoum. It is much more expensive there than in Sydney. It is more expensive in Amman. Just below is Hong Kong, Athens and New Delhi. What are these people in the tourist industry asking for? Do they want people working in the tourist industry in Australia to have wage levels the same as in the countries I have just mentioned, so that operators in the industry can make a profit? I think there are some good points in this statement by the Minister, but I am disappointed that we have not yet reached the stage where we have a national strategy for tourism in Australia. Debate (on motion by Mr Jull) adjourned. NA Ministerial Statement",68
177,Mr NIXON,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"by leave-Passenge r vehicle emission controls have already been debated in Parliament as a matter of public importance. The purpose of this statement is to inform Parliament in clear terms of the Commonwealth Government's views on this matter. In addition to transport portfolio considerations, the statement reflects the responsibUities of, and advice from, my colleagues the Minister for Science and Environment (Senator Webster), the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) and the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman). Over the last), and method, the consistency of the informadon is shown by of the top IS last year are to be found there this time and the emerged as the most expensive business centre, slighdy ahead of the chief drain on the company business travel bdl. cities where the businessman can expect to pay more for a simithe Financial Times on 14 November 1978. past decade, the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories have had a continumg involvement in the development and implementation of vehicle emission controls. The first Australian Design Rules on passenger car emission controls-AD R 26 and ADR 27-were agreed by the Australian Transport Advisory Council in 1971 with the objective of helping to arrest the deterioration of air quaUty experienced in major urban areas in Australia in the late 1960's. These rules came into effect in 1972 and 1974 respectively. A more stringent rule, ADR 27A, covering exhaust emissions of oxides of nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and evaporative fuel emissions, was subsequently agreed by ATAC for introduction in 1976. Although it was recognised at the time that the immediate response to ADR 27A would be engine modifications which would increase fuel consumption, this factor was outweighed by environmental considerations and the expectation of further technological development. However, with the deterioration in the world energy situation, fuel consumption has assumed far greater significance. I will comment on this most important issue later. ATAC discussed ADR 27A in July 1977 and February 1978. It was agreed to defer introduction of the third stage of ADR 27A untU January 1981 to permit a more detaUed examination of the issues involved. Implementation of the third stage was again discussed by ATAC in July 1978 and in February this year. At their February meeting, ATAC Ministers had before them a number of studies dealing CONTROLS with the problem of vehicle emission controls. These studies included the interim report by the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences, a report on photochemical smog in the Sydney region which had been prepared by the New South Wales State Pollution Control Commission and a report on emission levels and fuel consumption prepared by the Commonwealth Department of Transport. At the February meeting, the Commonwealth proposed that ATAC abandon the third stage of ADR 27A, in particular because of the fuel penalty involved, and take urgent action on other more effective measures to control vehicle emissions. This latter proposal was based on the view that significant improvements with regard to hydrocarbon emissions seemed to be achievable at lower cost and with advantage from both the fuel conservation and emission control viewpoints. The Commonwealth also indicated that it was not opposed to adequate, properly justified controls on vehicle emissions and was not backtracking in respect of improvements secured to date. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth considered that ATAC should review the strategy and approach followed up till now and should examine the lessons to be learned from the wide range of problems encountered with ADR 27A. ATAC Ministers agreed to resume discussions at a special ATAC meeting in Sydney this month following a more detaUed examination of the reports referred to. There are a number of issues which must be considered in relation to emission controls in general and ADR 27A in particular. At the outset, however, I must emphasise that the Commonwealth Government is committed to protect the health and the environment of the Austrahan people. State Governments obviously have a particular responsibiUty and concern because air quality in major urban areas requires special attention. However, all governmentsState, Territory and Commonwealth-mus t also, in the national interest, have regard to the effects of proposed measures, not only on health and the environment but also on impacts on the consumer, industry, resources and the economy. At this point, some general background would be appropriate on the origins of the problem, its extent and its effect on health. Photochemical pollution-ozone-in general terms, the result of the reaction of sunlight with hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. In urban areas, about 40 per cent of these hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen come from passenger cars. The problems we are trying to deal with are locahsed and appear to be exacerbated by geographical features and weather conditions. Among various atmospheric pollutants of potential health concern, ozone has been widely considered and its levels can be taken as being representative of oxidant levels as a whole. It is also recognised that ozone does have certain health effects depending on the level of concentration. Attempts to relate the onset of specific health effects to varying levels of ozone in the atmosphere have been made but the difficulty of associating a particular health effect to a specific poUutant is immense. The Commonwealth is concerned that any association between health incidents and photochemical poUution should be adequately researched and established before a casual relationship is assumed. It is important that long term air quaUty goals should not be seen as levels capable of immediate achievement since these goals are generally much more stringent than the prescribed levels which have been adopted by some countries as a basis for legislation. The World Health Organisation level of 0.06 parts per million for ozone must be seen in this context. At present, Sydney seems to be the city in Australia with a photochemical problem of significance. It should be pointed out that Sydney's experience with photochemical poUution does not parallel that of Los Angeles, which experiences higher levels. Tokyo does have a photochemical problem simUar to that of Sydney but is also subject to a higher level of air poUution from other sources. As far as Sydney is concerned, the trend towards increased photochemical pollution experienced in earlier years may have been largely arrested. The situation appears to have improved marginaUy between 1976 and 1977. The best assessment we can make at this stage is that, even if no additional controls are placed on cars or other sources of hydrocarbons, photochemical poUution in Sydney should remain more or less at current levels until about 1985. After 1985, the situation could be expected to deteriorate unless additional controls are implemented. The trends for other urban areas appear to generally foUow this assessment, albeit at a lower level. I tbink it will be evident from the foregoing that we are aU facing considerable difficulties because of inadequate data on air quaUty and trends. I will return to this aspect later. However, the general shape of prospects facing urban areas with regard to air quaUty is particularly important when the national costs of passenger vehicle emission controls are considered. A variety of estimates have been made, with the magnitude depending on the assumptions used. One recent estimate has put the additional costs of the system currendy in force in 1978 at between $80m and $100m per year rising to $150m. These are costs that are met by aU motorists in Australia to meet localised problems. Controls must therefore be cost effective and, in the Commonwealth view, a strategy to control photochemical poUution through limitations on hydrocarbon emissions is the preferred approach. IncidentaUy, this is also the view endorsed by the air Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the course proposed by the New South Wales SPCC. If it does prove impossible to agree on realistic uniform motor vehicle controls, the Commonwealth does not beheve that costs of unique control measures which States might wish to implement for particular areas with higher pollution should be imposed nation-wide. This latter consideration also raises the question of developing different emission controls for vehicles used in urban and non-urban areas. The Commonwealth, on behalf of ATAC, has requested information from the motor vehicle industry on the costs of what is called a two-car approach. The industry's response wdl be made available to the States and Territories as soon as it comes to hand. Obviously the two-car concept, including the possibUity of additional in-service regulation in areas with higher levels of pollution, has to be closely examined. I now propose to comment on some detaUed aspects of the third stage of ADR 27A. I think it is important that this Parliament have the basic facts. I turnfirstof all to the matter of in-service durabUity of emission control systems. In-service durabiUty is of fundamental importance in controlling photochemical poUution. There is no doubt, on the basis of recent studies, that a significant number of present ADR 27A vehicles are not meeting prescribed standards because of the in-service problems with emission control systems. Overseas and Austrahan studies have indicated a number of factors which contribute to in-service deterioration. These include the ease with which control systems can be maladjusted, the low incentive to both the service industry and owners to maintain these control systems in accordance with manufacturers' specifications as well as the deterioration of the engines themselves through time. The facUities and skills avaUable to the service industry also need to be looked at. In-service durabUity must be improved if air quaUty levels are to be adequately controlled. A critical issue here, which appUes to present and future controls, is whether levels should be initially more stringent or whether relatively lower levels can be achieved more effectively over the service Ufe of the vehicle. The Commonwealth considers that the latter approach is more cost effective and should be addressed as a matter of priority. The Commonwealth reiterates its view that levels of control currently achieved should not be reduced or abandoned. However, efforts must be made to overcome problems associated with the present Rule. ADR 27A was developed from a rule adopted by the United States of America. Although Australian studies have confirmed that ADR 27A has significantly reduced emissions from motor vehicles, experience has highlighted many problems not apparent at the time of introduction. The basis of ADR 27A, which requires every vehicle to meet prescribed standards and has the butit-in difficulty of relating test performance to everyday use, is now being seriously questioned. With respect to operations and procedures, the rule is cumbersome and has Utde practical relevance in assessing vehicle performance inservice. Vehicle certification under the rule is complex, costly and time consuming and this is important when we consider the need for a properly balanced aUocation of avaUable resources for the administration of the Australian Design Rule system. Most of the rules relate, of course, to the road safety field. Following its implementation, ADR 27A did increase fuel consumption of vehicles on a comparable weight basis. The Commonwealth does, however, agree that more than sufficient time has been expended on the fuel consumption debate associated with controls in force as of today in Austraha. What is important now is to consider fuel consumption in the context of future emission controls. Recent events have highlighted the uncertainties surrounding future od suppUes and the essentiality of energy conservation. Australia cannot afford to waste Uquid fuel and every opportunity must be taken to reduce consumption. Transport is recognised as an area where significant savings can be achieved and increased vehicle energy efficiency is criticaUy important. Although there is a trend towards smaUer, more fuel efficient vehicles, fuel consumption of vehicles generally has to continue to improve. The Commonwealth considers that, given sufficient leadtime,manufacturers will be able to increase their efforts to produce vehicles with both improved emission performance and better fuel economy. Fuel consumption of present vehicles has improved with technological development of emission controls, but implementation of the third stage would seriously interrupt this improvement. Technically, the third stage of ADR 27A can be met but at an estimated fuel consumption penalty of 3 to 5 per cent. This could cost the nation an additional 200,000 to over 300,000 tonnes of crude oU a year by 1985. Moves that were judged to be in the community's interest when oU was $2 a barrel must be reconsidered with oU at $14 a barrel and future suppUes uncertain. Estimates indicate that potential improvements in air quaUty as a result of the third stage would be marginal. Vehicle exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons could be reduced by up to about 14 tonnes a day in Sydney by 1985. This would represent less than 2 per cent of the total projected emissions in the Sydney area in 1985. In any event, such improvements may well not be realised because the design solution which manufacturers generally indicate they will adopt to meet the third stage is susceptible to maladjustment in service. Even if hydrocarbon exhaust emission requirements were made more stringent relative to other emissions under the third stage, indications are that the fuel penalty would remain. Implementation of the third stage will have little effect on in-service difficulties there is no doubt that the more stringent initial test required by the third stage has httle relevance to durability and in-service deterioration. To proceed further with an unsatisfactory rule simply compounds these difficulties. Although aware of the view that every additional control assists in pollution abatement, the Commonwealth cannot support the approach when, on a national basis, the costs far outweight any potential benefits of the third stage of ADR 27A. The Commonwealth therefore believes that all these considerations clearly indicate that there is no need or sufficient justification to proceed with the third stage of ADR 27A. However, this cannot be considered in isolation from more practicable immediate and future arrangements to which I now refer. In the foregoing, principal issues and problems associated with air pollution controls have been identified. In developing a framework for future action, it is clear that a number of steps must be taken to improve the implementation, administration and durabUity of emission control systems in the context of realistic health, environment, transport and energy objectives. The third stage of ADR 27A is of no significance in this broader context. Practical and effective solutions must be found to meet the problems I have described. A program for immediate action and a future strategy are both necessary. Steps can be taken now towards assisting air quaUty through means more effective than the third stage of ADR 27A in Une with the preferred hydrocarbon control strategy. We would propose that, in addition to the further development of controls on other sources, urgent work should commence to investigate more stringent, cost effective evaporative controls associated with the passenger vehicle. New South Wales SPCC estimates, based on a 6 gram SHED test for evaporative hydrocarbon emissions from motor vehicles, indicated a reduction of 30 tonnes of hydrocarbons a day in Sydney by 1985. Latest advice indicates that some of these savings may already be accruing with some current model vehicles. Such controls will, of course, also conserve energy. Evaporative controls which reduce vehicle hydrocarbon emissions by 30 tonnes a day in Sydney could, on a national basis, save up to 40,000 tonnes of crude oU each year. Much has been said about durabUity and inservice problems. The Commonwealth proposes that urgent attention be given to improving, as far as practically possible, the durabUity and inand service performance of ADR 27A vehicles. Although a sufficient period for design maturation of present controls should help, consideration should also be given to in-service retuning programs, to the development of systems less susceptible to maladjustment, to industry and technical training courses and to publicity to increase community awareness. I give one example of the effectiveness of such measures. Overseas experience suggests that a properly organised inservice retuning program could lower hydrocarbon taUpipe emissions in Sydney by up to 26 tonnes a day by 1985. Consideration must also be given to simplifying the administration of the present Rule. It is essential to begin the long term task of developing adequate, co-ordinated air quaUty monitoring as a basis for all measures proposed for implementation. This has been highlighted by many bodies including the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution, the Australian Environment Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council, as well as ATAC. The Commonwealth has been developing cooperative programs with the States, including the establishment of a national air quality data centre, and we wdl be considering further cooperative arrangements to get the facilities required to develop an adequate data base on air quality. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is also involved in meteorological and associated photochemical work. The Commonwealth, in co-operation with the New South Wales SPCC, is also implementing an emissions study of Sydney peak hour traffic to provide baseline information for future assessment and action. There is a need to upgrade vehicle emission testing faciUties and the Commonwealth wtil give this priority attention, again in co-operation with the States. The Commonwealth beUeves that, at the national level, assessment of air quality data must be examined in the context of agreed air quaUty guidelines. At present, the Commonwealth and the States face particular difficulties, without guideUnes, in the assessment of pollution abatement measures. The Commonwealth sees a need to define air quaUty guideUnes for Australia with respect to health. In addition, the Commonwealth sees value in the definition of practicable and realistic air quaUty objectives for Australian cities which would be based on broader environmental considerations. City air quaUty objectives which might be defined should be practicable of achievement, take into account all sources of air pollution and be developed in such a way as to rninimise differences between States. The basis for an improvement in air quaUty is better air quality information and the establishment of air quality guidelines and objectives. The Commonwealth is of the view that adequate data is essential to facUitate a proper assessment of national emission control measures. The Commonwealth beUeves that present air quality data, although scant, indicates that action would be required on a number of points to prevent any increase in photochemical pollution levels in our major cities after 1985. The Commonwealth is therefore prepared to give a firm undertaking to examine the upgrading of passenger vehicle emission controls for implementation in 1985. Such controls would, of course, need to take into account projected pollution levels as well as other controls implemented in the meantime. Several ideas have been advanced for a 1985 Rule and the Commonwealth proposes that these be examined in detaU. ATAC and Australian Environment Council should be in a position, at their early 1981 meetings, to consider requirements for 1985 standards and the development of a new vehicle emission rule to implement such standards. I should make it clear at this point that the Australian Minerals and Energy Council must be consulted in the development of future emission controls in so far as energy impUcations are concerned. Any such measures must be adequately justified and be cost effective. They must be assessed for energy implications. There must also be equitable attention to all sources of hydrocarbon emissions. There is also a need to consider actively alternative or complementary approaches to vehicle emission controls. These would include traffic management and use of public transport to ease traffic densities in areas prone to photochemical pollution. Alternative fuels such as LPG should also be given earUer examination. Finally, it will be noted that this statement has not covered lead emissions. Work is proceeding in Commonwealth and State Councils on various speech. ^ lead questions and the Commonwealth beUeves that this work should be expedited. Although not direcdy relevant to the special ATAC meeting in April, lead issues will form an important and integral part of future motor vehicle emissions strategies in terms of protection of health and the environment and vehicle and energy costs and efficiency. In conclusion, the Commonwealth reiterates its desire for continuing co-operation between the Commonwealth, States and Territories in a proper and balanced assessment of air quaUty data, air quaUty guidelines and objectives and emissions standards and controls. I present the following paper: Passenger Vehicle Emission Controls-Ministerial Statement, 5 April 1979. Motion (by Mr Groom) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Groom)-by leave-agree d to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Shonland speaking for a period not exceeding 23 minutes.",68
178,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"The statement of the Mmister for Transport (Mr Nixon) on die Government's proposed deferment of the third stage of Australian Design Rule 27A should be noted primarily for its inaccuracies, its broad generalisations and its almost complete lack of supporting evidence. Mr Fisher-You are generous.",72
179,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,Generous but factual. The Fraser Government's decision to press for the deferral of the third stage of Australian Design Rule 27A amounts in short to a sell-out to financial interests of the shareholders of foreign-based motor vehicle manufacturers at the expense of the health of millions of Australian urban dwellers and urban employees. Mr MCVeigh-Where is the Labor Party? There is no one here to listen to you. Why don't you get a few of your mates to listen to you?,72
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will cease interjecting or he will not be here either.,72
181,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,May I have the time lost through that interjection added to my speaking time?,72
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,I suggest that the honourable member for Shortland continue his,72
183,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"The disguise for the Government's decision is a claim that nonimplementation of the third stage of ADR 27A will reduce Australia's consumpuon of crude od by some 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes per annum by 1985. That is a totally unsubstantiated assertion that is not supported by evidence, calculations or information; it is just a bland assertion. Clearly, the Government's decision is linked to the new motor vehicle complementation plan and the result, if the decision is to be adopted nationally, wdl be to save large motor vehicle manufacturers expenditure that they would otherwise incur on improving the quaUty of emissions from engines before 1985. It is worth noting that the motor vehicle try in the United States of America, the country of origin of the major companies concerned in this move by the Government, have an estabwill lished history of opposition to improved emission control standards. I wish to quote from an interview with a Mr Bradford Snell, which was recorded on 23 September 1975. He was tal speaking from his experiences as Assistant sel to the United States Senate Anti-Trust and Monopoly Sub-Committee on Ground Australian Transport Industries. Mr Snell had been asked: Has there been any active suppression of information which could lead to better environmental changes as far as the motor car is concerned? Has General Motors conciously gone out and suppressed innovative change? Mr Snell's response was: Well, let's take the whole question of pollution control equipment. Now the Department of Justice, the United States Depanment of Justice, sued General Motors all the other automobile makers in the late sixties spiracy existing since 1953 velopment of any pollution control equipment for automobiles. I note that the case was finally setded by sent decree which, in effect, admitted the factual allegations brought by the Department of Jusits tice. Mr Snell said further: What that means is that from 1953 until nearly automobile companiesThe same companies that are operating in this country and supporting the same kind of moves were, to quote Mr Snell: . . actively suppressing the development of equipment which when added to an automobile wouild decrease the incidence of pollution, of petrochemical smog and of all the health effects which have been attributed to that phenomena. Once again the conservatives in this Government are kowtowing to the dictates of foreign interests, in preference to showing concern for the health and well-being of over half of the Australian population, who Uve, work and move in our urban areas. If we follow through the logic of the Minister's statement and of the Government's decisionthat improved emission standards should be deferred because they involve, it is claimed, a three to five per cent difference in fuel consumptionthe Government can be expected to move soon in the following directions: First, to ban power steering on motor cars, because it incurs a fuel consumption penalty of 14 per cent-fou r times the loss occasioned by imposing emission standards; secondly, to ban air conditioning, which incurs a penalty of 17 per cent, which is more than four times that which results from emission induscontrols; and, thirdly, to ban automatic transmission, which incur a fuel penalty, in operation, of 20 to 30 per cent. If we look at those items, as I a Uttle later, we will see in more detaU the kind of fuel penalties that would be involved if the Government were to adhere to any conscious and responsible policy in respect of environmenprotection. The Opposition rejects the stateCounment and the Government's decision as unsupported and not in the best interests of the mass of citizens and workers. It should be noted that the emission control standards are no higher than those presendy operative in the United States and no higher than those already actually being achieved by some motor vehicle manufacturers. But, according to this Government, they are too high for Australians. Further, the Government's proposal discriminates quite markedly against those responsible as well as and progressive motor vehicle manufacturers for a conwhich have already achieved or are planning to to preclude and prevent the deachieve the third stage of ADR27A standards and those which have entered into capital commitments to achieve those standards by 1981? a conWhat of their mvestment? What of their expense? What is photochemical smog and what is effect? I quote, for the benefit of the Parliament, from the statement made by the Victorian 1970, the Environment Protection Authority: Photochemical smog has been recorded frequently in Melbourne notably on sunny, calm days from October to June. That is a fairly long period. The report continued: If photochemical smog is unchecked it will become more serious. It can cause irritation to the eyes and throat, aggravate attacks in asthmatics and increase animals' susceptability to infectious aerosols. This smog can damage plants, paintwork and rubber products and its brown haze reduces visibility and aesthetically degrades the environment That is the Victorian Government's definition of what ozone and photochemical smog does to the air quaUty above Melbourne. But the Minister says that it affects only localised areas. I very quickly to quote from an address I the House on 8 March last when this matter was raised previously. I said: the problem of air pollution exists across the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne and particularly in Sydney across the central, southern and western sectors. In all, Sydney and Melbourne constitute almost one half of Australia's population . . . Turning to Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra, one finds that they are already exceeding World Health Organisation air quality goals and have climatic conditions which lend those cities to photochemical smog. In Sydney, elevated concentrations of pollution usually cover a quaner or more of the central, southern and western regions for one to eight hours a day. That is what this Government and the Minister for Transport, who is at the table, define as a localised problem. But the emphasis should not be only on the people who live in those areas. The emphasis has to be on the people who work in those areas-o n the shoppers who move about in the metropolitan areas and on the people who travel through those areas. This is one of the fallacies of the Government's argument. The indication is given that air pollution affects only those people who sleep in the areas, who reside there. It affects everybody who spends anytimeat all in the area. The Minister has played down the problem by saying that it is a locahsed problem. In saying it is a localised problem he means it affects local people. Let us emphasise that it means all people who traverse the area. The Minister stated: The Commonwealth is concerned that any association between health incidents and photochemical pollution should be adequately researched and established before a causal relationship is assumed. What he is really saying is that this Government is not particularly concerned about it. Mr Nixon-Casual .",73
184,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"The speech reads 'causal'. Mr Nixon-You have the wrong copy, I am sorry. It reads 'casual' in my copy.",74
185,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,I am sorry that there are so many copies. I hope that they are all correct. In this copy it reads 'causal'. It makes more sense. Mr Nixon-It is casual. A casual relationship.,74
186,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"I suggest that the proper meaning is 'causal'. We wdl discuss it later. What I am saying is that this Minister and this Government are putting to the Austrahan people that we should not be concerned about ozone and photochemical smog until a very serious inroad is made into the health of the Australian community. What in effect they are saying is: 'Unless it is a thalidomide let us not worry about it. It wdl want be right. We will just go along as we are'. The made to Minister made the following statement: As far as Sydney is concerned, . . . photochemical pollution experienced in earUer years may have been largely arrested. I put it simply that that statement is false. There is no evidence to support it. The smog level in Sydney already exceeds World Health Organisation ozone levels regularly. The Minister referred to the hydrocarbon fallout. The fart is that in 1976 there was a fallout of 661 tonnes on a summertime week day. If nothing is done, as this Government and this Minister are suggesting, and the status quo remains, the estimation for 198S is a fall-out of hydrocarbons of 729 tonnes. The Minister referred also to the cost of ADR 27A third stage measures. He said that there is one estimate. The fact is that there are several estimates. He would have helped the Parhament if he had been able to identify the estimate. The range of estimates vary considerably and to simply say that one estimate is $80m-$100m a year means nothing. It is a meaningless statement. Whatever the figure is, it ought to be related to the cost of model changes in motor vehicles. What is at issue in this question is the standard of pubhc health and the standard of protection provided by the government to the people of this country. If we are to determine only on the basis of cost, as the Government has suggested, we ought to relate the cost to the cost of model changes in motor vehicles. We ought to relate it to the multiplicity and the cost of those model changes. We can think immediately of a total figure around $300m for the two latest model changes to the major selUng cars. If money is to be the only factor we ought to be taking that kind of approach into consideration. I turn to the question of in-servicing to which the Minister referred. He said that in-service problems had arisen. In other words antipollution equipment has been fitted to motor vehicles at the point of sale and at some later stage the equipment has not been serviced or has been removed or adjusted in some way. Basically, the problem is one of servicing. It is not good enough for the Government this afternoon, after several years of being the prime mover in the introduction of emission control standards, to say: 'Well, in-servicing arrangements are not working out'. We ought to have a look at the arrangements. Surely something should be done about them. It is this Government's responsibUity to give a lead to the rest of the nation. It has known for some time that the problem exists. Let us link that problem to its real base; that is, the general question of servicing motor vehicles. Here we get into the area of fuel consumption and fuel efficiency. If they are the primary considerations then it is the incorrect tuning of motor vehicles-no t simply the air pollution control equipment-that ensures that those vehicles give the best performance and are most efficient. I turn now to the contradiction that the Minister has made in his statement. He said on the one hand: In-service durability must be improved if air quality are to be adequately controlled. About 12 Unes further on he said: . . Australian studies have confirmed that ADR27A has significantlyI emphasise that word. . . . reduced emissions from motor vehicles. What he said on the one hand was that we have the problems because the system does not work perfectly. Immediately following that statement, he said, on the other hand that the system definitely been successful. What the Minister the Government ought to do is to sit down and get the two speech writers together. Obviously, this speech has been thrown together. I do not blame the Department of Transport because it which, has not written it. The material is foreign to Department of Transport. It has been thrown together by somebody who did not actually see the whole of the speech. Mr Nixon-You cannot even read it.",74
187,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"We will test that later when we find out about the word 'casual'. We must take the opportunity to reduce the consumption fuels in a responsible and effective way and not to tinker around the edges of the problem in obeisance to foreign motor vehicle manufaceconomy turers, as this Government is doing. The primary consideration has to be the health of Austrahan citizens. Three weeks ago the that the impact of ADR27A would be an 8 per cent to 10 per cent increase in fuel consumption. The industry generally has been saying that it would mean afiveper cent increase in consumphicle tion. Today the Minister has dropped that further still to a three per cent to five per cent fuel consumption. Let us look at the facts. The facts show that when there has been an examination straufied-charged of vehicles, comparing their new their run-in condition, and where the engines have been designed with the object of meeting emission standards, fuel efficiency improves. does not deteriorate, and where it has January deteriorated it is because of the use of patch-up and tack-on equipment on the cheap. That good enough for Austraha, the major manufacturers beheve; it will do the colonials. Those vehicles on which expenditure and research have not been done have caused the increase in fuel consumption. The ADR27A vehicles manufactured under the first stage, that is, vehicles manufactured between June 1976 and June 1977, returned a 17.7 per cent increase in fuel consumption when new. Once they had been run in, the increase dropped to 5.9 per cent. New vehicles manufactured after June 1978 under the levels second stage showed an overall increase in fuel consumption of 10.3 per cent, but once the vehicles were run in and tuned, fuel efficiency increased so much that there was in fact a decrease in consumption of 0.71 per cent. The point to be made is that the ADR27A vehicles when run in show Uttle difference in fuel economy from earlier manufactured motor vehicles. ",75
188,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"I have quoted the facts based has on established tests. The honourable member and may say what he likes when he has an opportunity to speak later. If the Government is serious about lessening fuel consumption and promoting energy conservation, it must take that next step as I indicated earlier, it is considering. I the refer to the banning of automatic transmission, power steering and air-conditioners. If the Government is serious about what it is putting to this Parliament it will have to do that Let me read again from the article by the Victorian Environment Protection Authority. These are the Authority's words, not my words, from its pubUcation entitled Fuel Economy and the Car. of The article in part states: (b) The transmissionfittedto a motor vehicle affects its fuel economy. There can be a 20 to 30 per cent loss in fuel with vehiclesfittedwith automatic transmission. The article then refers to power steering in the Government said following way: (c) The inclusion of power steering on a motor vehicle can produce a fuel penalty of 14 per cent. (d) Thefittingofan air conditioning unit to a motor vecan produce a fuel penalty of 17 per cent figure On another tack, the article continues: (i) The improved design of motor vehicle engines would also result in improved fuel economy as shown by the engine which would provide savings in the condition and range of 1--2S per cent To be added to that observation is the information provided by this Government's own It body, the Australian Environment Council, in last year. It is significant that in the Minister's statement there was no input by the Ausis tralian Environment Council. Under this Government, environment has received very low priority and that is what today's statement is all about. The ministry of environment has been tacked on to the ministry of odds and sods over in the Senate. It has been removed from the main chamber-ou t of sight, out of mind. Quite clearly, because environment is directly linked with responsible energy conservation, there is no account taken of it. I want to remind the House of the conclusion arrived at by the Austrahan Environment Council in January last year. In conclusion 2.1 in its report, the Councd stated that vehicle fuel consumption in the period over which emission controls have been implemented is linked with vehicle weight arising from model changes and the inclusion of opdons such as air conditioning, automatic transmission and power steering. Let us look at another source of information, the independent experts from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. If this Government is responsible and really facing up to energy conservation and community health priorities, it must take notice of this information and advice. I refer to the letter written to the National Roads and Motorists Association by Messrs Johnston, Trayford, and Van Der Touw of the CSIRO and published in the December 1978 edition of Open Road, in which they made this point very clearly: We found that over 80 per cent of the variation in sumpuon between cars could be attributed to car size whether measured by kerb weight, engine capacity or cylinder number. After we took into account tion attributable to the above three measures of car size we found that the average car's fuel consumption increased by 3.5 per cent after emission controls were introduced. That is quite different to the conclusions which were drawn in the statements issued at that time. It is important that the Minister provide some kind of statistical evidence for his statement that there will be a 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes increase in crude od consumption by the year 1985. If this statement had been a proper approach to the problem, there would have been some details about that included in the Minister's statement, but there is nothing. There is not one word other than that bland assertion. I turn now to page 9 of the Minister's statement where he refers to the potential improvements, and states: . . . that potential improvements in air quality as a result of the third stage would be marginal. I draw the Minister's attention to the point I made earlier about the fall-out of hydro-carbons, that is, that by the year 1985, if the status quo is preserved, the fall-out of hydro-carbons wdl be 729 tonnes per annum. At page 11 of his statement the Minister refers to tailpipe emissions and to his calculations that there could be a lowering of such emissions by 26 tonnes a day in Sydney by 1985.1 will return to that matter later. I made the point earlier that a properly organised inservice retuning program could achieve that end. The simple question I ask is: What is the point in raising that matter when the Government is not concerned with implementing ADR 27A or with seeing that in-service is carried out? The Government has had many years to do something about it but it has done nothing. What the Government is mouthing are platitudes. Mr Nixon-You are now starting to get near it. You might even get there.",75

190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,The honourable member for Barker is reminded that all interjections are disorderly and that he is not yet a member of the front bench and should occupy his proper seat in the House.,76
191,Mr MORRIS,PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSION,"The matter on which I want to conclude in rejecting the Government's decision fuel conis the central paragraph on page 12 of the Minister's statement-agai n a platitude, again an undefined statement, and again a broad generality. He states: the variations in fuel consumpIn addition, the Commonwealth sees value in the definition of practicable and realistic air quality objectives for Australian cities which would be based on broader environmental considerations. Nowhere does the Minister define what realistic air quality objectives are. In fact, governments around this nation are arguing every day over that matter. We are discussing it here this afternoon, but there is no definition and there is no statement by this Government on what qualities of air pollution are satisfactory to it. What is practicable and what is realistic? What are die broader environmental considerations? Should the Government be kowtowing again to the motor vehicle manufacturers in America, or giving incentive and encouragement to those motor vehicle manufacturers in Australia who have met the standards, who have planned to meet the standards, and have acted in a proper and responsible way? The Opposition rejects the statement. We beheve that there is no substantiation or support for the claims made by the Minister in his statement. Debate (on motion by Mr Roger Johnston) adjourned.

192,Mr NEWMAN,ENERGY POLICY,"by leave-The recent disruption of oil supplies from Iran has brought energy policy into sharp focus. It is timely to review the action taken by this Government in formulating and implementing its energy pohcy. In addition to this review, the Government will shortly be presenting an energy pohcy discussion paper which will canvass future energy needs and options. A secure and ready avaUabihty of energy is an essential pre-requisite for the well-being of the Australian community. It is essential to underpin our standard of hving, our transport industries, our industrial development, our agricultural and mineral industries, and a wide range of commercial and trading activities. This Government has an active, well integrated and well co-ordinated energy policy. It is a successful policy. Our policy has the immediate aims of ensuring secure and stable supplies of energy and reducing Australia's dependence on imported oil, and a longer-term aim of developing a diversified energy base which minimises dependence on liquid fuels. The Government's energy policy statement of November 1977 outlined six main objectives signed to achieve these broad goals: Firstly, move crude od prices in the direction of interseen national levels; secondly, to restrain the average rate of growth of energy consumption, particuing larly in liquid fuels; thirdly, to achieve the highest degree of self-sufficiency in liquid fuels consistent with the broadly economic utilisation of our energy resources; fourthly, economic od and gas reserves; fifthly, to encourage individual major energy projects to meet overseas demand for energy minerals which will provide an adequate return to Austraha; and, finally, to increase energy research and developthe ment substantially. We have pursued these objectives actively through hard but effective decisions on pricing and tax policy, encouragement of exploitation and development, support for major energy velopment projects, stimulation of energy reto search and development, pursuit of energy conbarrels servation and interfuel substitution, and active international co-operation. This Government sees itself in a leadership role in energy policy. is carrying out that role positively and energetically. Austraha is a federation and many of the powers concerning energy rest with the States. A recognition of this fact does not imply a division of approach on energy pohcy; rather, it highlights the role of the Commonwealth in providing leadership and ensuring close co-operation and liaison with the States. Let me spell out the initiatives we have taken. I will do this in some detad because it is important to bring together the many initiatives we have taken and to indicate the integrated and coordinated approach we have to energy pohcy. The pricing framework Fundamental to the achievement of the Government's energy pohcy goals has been the use of the market framework. Australia is an energy rich country, with major reserves of coal and uranium and substantial reserves of natural gas. However, our reserves of petroleum are Umited and it is of the highest importance that the price of petroleum products to which both producers and consumers react reflects a realistic value for those products. ReaUstic pricing has a number of desirable consequences. Firstly, it encourages conservation of scarce resources and helps correct unsatisfactory usage patterns which result from the maintenance of artificially low prices for petroleum products; secondly, it promotes the usage of competitive energy sources, mainly natural gas and coalbased electricity; thirdly, the relative economics deof alternative energy projects such as coal to liquefaction, shale oil, and solar power can be in an accurate perspective which allows more realistic decisions to be made about financtheir development; and fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, reaUstic pricing acts as a major incentive to increase oU exploration activity and to maximise the exploitation of existto develop our ing fields. In accordance with this approach, the Government's 1977 Budget provided for the price of indigenous crude oU from knownfieldsto move in direction of import parity, and provided for the return to producers to reach at least SO per cent of import parity by 1980-81. The Government has announced that it will review the position before June 1981 to decide upon the further progression to import parity for known fields. deThe poUcy was immediately successful, leading an increase in recoverable oU of 115 million from developedfieldsorfieldsunder development in Bass Strait. In addition, about 300 rnillion barrels of recoverable oil, which probIt ably would not have been economic at former prices, can now be recovered. Other discoveries now under evaluation in Bass Strait may contain in excess of a further 300 mUlion barrels. In short, our pricing poUcy has already led to an increase in reserves of some 600-700 million barrels, equivalent to about 3 years' consumption. In the 1978 Budget the Government further developed pricing poUcy for indigenous crude oti. This did not affect the scale of prices to ducers as laid down in August 1977 but, through an effective increase in the crude oU levy, increased the price of indigenous crude oU to refiners and consumers to the import parity level, as determined by the Government every six months. As well as the energy policy advantages I have already mentioned, the crude oU pricing policy brings a substantial return to the community in the form of revenue to the Commonwealth. The levy alone wdl bring close to $ 1,300m in thefinancialyear 1978-79. The levy brings about a reaUstic climate for energy conservation, substitution and research. This money is used to pay for social services, education, defence, health and all the other expenditures incurred by the Commonwealth in its Budget. It undoubtedly reduces tax incidence-revenu e would have to be raised anyway if not through the oU levy-whUs t improving conservation of petroleum. Petroleum Exploration Our policies have resulted in petroleum exploranging ration being pursued actively to ensure that petregarded roleum supplies are increased. The 1960s and early 1970s were optimistic years for Australian petroleum exploration, especially as a result early successes in Bass Strait and the indications of favourable prospects on the North West Shelf. Under Labor this momentum was lost and exfirst ploration came to a standstill. This Governworld's ment's fundamental objective has been to store the confidence of the petroleum industry, to get exploration moving again. (Quorum formed). We are succeeding. The Government's initiatives include important taxation concessions for the industry, such making petroleum exploration and development expenditure deductible against income from any source, faster write-off provisions for petroleum development expenditure and a shareholder repredicted bate scheme for off-shore petroleum exploration and development. The recovery in exploration confidence under this Government is reflected in the number of ploration wells drilled in 1978 and proposed for 1979. In 1978, 52 wells were drUled, more than double the number drtiled in each of the previous 3 years. This compares with the decline from 100 weUs in 1972 to only 19 weUs in 1976, when the loss of confidence and cessation of exploration planning during the Labor period became fully and starkly apparent. As a result of this Government's initiatives, Australia is now seen as a stable and attractive area for investment of risk capital in petroleum exploration and pro- over the next 5 years a minimum of $500m is committed for petroleum exploration, both onshore and off shore. This year, industry sources predict that between 83 and 143 exploration wells will be drilled; on-shore 60-97, off-shore 23-46. Even if only the lower estimate is reached, this wiU be the highest level for 7 years. Offshore, a total of 62 exploration permits are currently in force, 28 of which have been granted in the last two years, including 8 since August 1978. This compares with only 2 off-shore permits granted during the Labor period. Consideration is presently being given to the aUocation of a further 20 off-shore permit areas around Australia. On-shore, there are approximately 70 current exploration permits. The improved outlook for petroleum exploration is especially demonstrated by the fact that companies are prepared to face the difficulties and enormous costs of exploring the Exmouth Plateau. The plateau, lying up to 600 kUometres off north western Australia, at water depths from 600 to 3,000 metres, is generally as offering our best chance for a further major oU discovery. This exploration effort is one of the most intensive deep-water undertakings of anywhere in the world, with companies operating on the frontiers of current technology. A single well will cost around $ 10m. Drilling of the well there commenced last month. Of the 10 deep-water drilling rigs, up to three rewUl be operating on the plateau this year. Australia currently has a self-sufficiency in crude oU of about 70 per cent. A few years ago it was expected that by the 1980s our selfsufficiency would drop to as low as 25 per cent. as However, as a result of the Government's encouragement of exploration and development, and our pricing policy, our self-sufficiency outlook has improved dramatically. It is now that by 1985 we will be producing 50 per cent of our crude od requirements, a figure far higher than anyone would have ventured to suggest till recently. Of course, self-sufficiency will be even further enhanced if, as we hope, adexditional major oil discoveries are made. Despite some limits to oU prospectivity and highriskswe have succeeded in creating the cUmate necessary to attract scarce capital and resources into major and accelerated exploration programs. Under $ Labor exploration ground to a halt. Energy development projects Active encouragement is being given to major energy projects to ensure security of energy supplies for future domestic use and for export. sound pohcy framework is essential if there is be a flow of necessary projects in the future. have provided that framework. It is working sucperiod, cessfully. Investment in mining and manufacturwas ing, including energy, has grown strongly under this Government. We have reversed the serious downward trend in real capital expenditure which was occurring in the mid-1970s. We have done this through the establishment of a sound economic climate, the restoration of sensible economic management, the application of specific policies such as the investment allowand ance, a reasonable approach to foreign investation ment and the encouragement given to the petinvestment roleum and mining industries through the of taxation system. Based onfigurespublished by the Melbourne Institute of AppUed Economic and Social search, the average annual rate of growth in real private investment in mining and manufacturon ing, which includes important parts of the energy industries, will be 12.5 per cent between 1976 and 1980. The growth in the previous four years, 1972 to 1976, was negative and averaged minus 8.5 per cent per annum. Let me outline the major energy projects underway. Development expenditure for Bass Strait totalhng $780m has been announced and further development now under consideration is expected to raise this total to over $ 1 billion. addition, development programs are in progress or planned for Barrow Island and Dongara, with expenditure totalling $18m this year, for the Cooper Basin, with expenditure totalUng $53m for 1978 and 1979, and for other localities. Of the Bass Strait developments so far announced, development of the Snapper gas and condensate field is in progress and production is due to mence in 1981. The total cost for a platform and pipeline will be $160m. The platforms for Tuna and Mackerel oil fields have been completed: Production from Mackerel has special commenced and development drilling from the related Tuna platform is under way. The total cost for these twofieldswUl be $180m. Australia's first sub-sea completion has been installed for Cobia oU field, with further development, volving a platform, estimated at a cost of $200m. Development of the West Kingfish oU field has commenced and the cost is estimated at 190m. In addition, a third gas treatment plant is proposed for construction at Longford, at an estimated cost of about $50m. Another major energy development is the North West Shelf natural gas project. This project is currendy the subject of detaUed study by A the companies concerned, at a cost of $50m, and to their decision on the project's future is expected We towards the end of this year. During the Labor progress on the North West Shelf project delayed by at least two to three years. However, this Government recognised the national significance of the project and has provided the framework which wdl enable development to take off. Measures introduced include foreign investment approval, approval for the export of liquid natural gas derived from 53 per cent of known reserves from the North Rankin, Angel Goodwynfieldsand several important taxconcessions, namely, the extension of the aUowance by two years; the inclusion gas liquefaction plant as an allowable capital expenditure under the petroleum mining provisions; and the introduction of the shareholder Rerebate scheme for off-shore petroleum. The petroleum refining industry has embarked or announced important refinery expansions in Brisbane, Sydney, Geelong and Perth. Refining investment increased by $80m in 1977 and an estimated $75m in 1978. A proposal for a $130m refinery at MatravUle in Sydney is being actively investigated. One encouraging feature of refining expansion has been moves by several companies to increase catalytic cracking capacity, which will lift production of transport fuels vis-a-vis fuel oU production. The level of In capital investment being made clearly reflects the confidence of the Australian refining industry in the Government's policies. Not only has the Government stimulated development of our energy resources through sound economic and assistance poUcies, but also we have supported the sourcing of loans overseas for major energy projects of national importance. This is particularly comimportant in regard to the construction of major electricity schemes which are basic to the future the industrial development of our country. Five of the 12 major projects approved for borrowing by the Loan Council last year to the provision of electricity. They were: the Loy Yang power station in Victoria-$343m ; Eraring electricity project in New South the Wales-$200m ; power station projects in inQueensland- $ 130m; hydro-electric power deover velopment in Tasmania-$75m ; and power supply integration in the PUbara area of W«»»-n Australia-$1 1 lm. All of these projects received Commonwealth support. These projects for power generation are of major significance from the viewpoint of energy pohcy. Austraha has abundant sources of solid fuels in the eastern States suitable for power generadon. Soundly planned and dmely installation of new power generating capacity is essendal to facilitate the transfer of demand for energy from liquid fuels to electricity derived from sohd fuels or hydroelectric resources. A ready avadabdity of electricity generating capacity will also facilitate estabhshment of new industrial development projects of a nature consistent with the Government's objectives towards mineral processing and industry policy generally. As an overall energy-rich nation, Australia the opportunity to attract those industries which have a relatively high demand for energy. For stance, the continued provision of electricity based on our abundant coal suppUes is portant comparative advantage to Australia when major international industry investment decisions are taken. The major expansion now underway of aluminium smelting capacity in Austraha would not be possible without supplies of relatively cheap electricity. The value support for major electricity projects can be from recent industry announcements. Yesterday Alcoa of Australia Ltd announced plans to ceed with a $350m aluminium smelter project Australia. This means that, with the $85m expansion of Alcoa's Point Henry plant and the $500m smelter project at Gladstone, almost billion is committed to the expansion minium smelting in Australia. We recognise that the possession of substantial energy and mineral resources gives us great opportunities for the future development of dustries based on the processing of our mineral resources. This Government has commenced activity. major studies, in collaboration with the State governments and with Japan, to investigate pursue opportunities for increased raw materials processing in Australia. The energy aspects these studies are of basic importance. Moreover, energy processing projects themselves represent significant investment opportunities. Oil from shale, oU from coal and methanol from gas, are all reaUstic and attractive prospects made posssearch ible by our policies. Through our management the economy, we have established the economic climate for major investments such proceed. Through our support of energy research, development and demonstration, we are establishing the technological basis on which major new investment projects will be based the 1980s and beyond. The long and impressive list of major projects to which I have referred is ample proof of the success of our poUcies. That success wtil continue in the future with major new energy projects based on the reaUsation of new technological possibUities. Energy Research and Development One of the major objectives announced by the Government in its energy poUcy statement of November 1977 was that 'energy research and the development would be substantially increased'. This Government recognised that we must move to develop the energy technologies suited to Australia's needs in the remaining years of this century and beyond. Energy research and develhas opment is the foundation on which investment in alternative fuels for the future will rest. We are indetermined to encourage that investment. In may 1978, we estabUshed the National Energy an imResearch, Development and Demonstration Council-NERDDC . Its role is the development and co-ordination of energy research, development and demonstration in Australia. Its primary task is to recommend to me those projects which should be assisted under the National Energy of our Research, Development and Demonstration seen Program. This program is a completely new initiative. Its aim is to provide Commonwealth proGovernment financial support to stimulate in increased energy research, development and demonstration in this country. No similar program, or anything even remotely resembling $ 1 it, was seen to be necessary by the Labor of aluGovernment when it was in power. At the time of the 1978-79 Budget, the Government announced that funds totalling around $15m would be made avaUable for this inprogram to encourage a major expansion of energy research, development and demonstration There is also a separate commitment to a total of about $3.8m for the joint Australiaand Federal Republic of Germany feasibUity study on converting coal to oU. These commitments of represent almost a doubting of previous Commonwealth expenditure on energy research. A total of $ 16.6m was spent by Commonwealth authorities on energy research and development in 1976-77. A doubling of support for energy rein one year is a very real achievement of which has given tremendous stimulation to our energy technologists, who are eager to pursue the as those to challenges of the future. Based on the recommendations of NERDDC, I have approved 177 grants for 1978-79 totalUng in almost SlOm. Since November 1978, I have issued, in all, six statements giving detaUs of proved grants. A summary showing major areas supported in 1978-79 is given below: Coal Conversion-$2.6m ; Coal Mine Site Technology-$2.6m ; Technology of Coal Utilisation-$1.5m; Solar Energy-$0.9m ; Power Alcohol from Biomass-$0.6m ; Fossil Fuel Resource Assessment-$0.5m ; Electric Vehicles, Batteries and Improved Motor Vehicle Performance-$0.3m ; Wind Energy-$0.2m ; Nuclear Waste Management and Fusion Research-$0.2m ; Other Projects-$0.5m. When other energy research expenditures by private enterprise and universities are taken into account, more than $40m will be committed to energy research in 1978-79. NERDDC has already invited appUcations for the 1979-80 program. In assessing applications NERDDC is guided by government priorities. Our highest priority clearly is to ensure a satisfactory avaUabUity of liquid fuels. The Government's priorities for energy research are set out in a document which I will table later today. These priorities aim primarily at meeting the objectives of: More effective use of existing oU and gas sources by enhanced conservation, including the development of systems of higher thermal efficiency; increased avaUabUity of indigenous tiquid and gaseous fuels, particularly oU, by improved techniques of discovery, exploration, assessment and recovery; production and use of synthetic Uquid fuels, particularly those derived from a non-petroleum feedstock; and substitution of more abundant energy sources for liquid fuels in fixed installations. We intend to make the best use we can of energy research resources avaUable within government authorities and I have set in train a major review of the research and development programs of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission research establishment at Lucas Heights. The research establishment is significant by world standards and represents an important asset to the nation in terms of facUities and skUled manpower. Although the establishment will continue to be the main centre for research and development into nuclear energy in Australia, we are evaluating the scope for broadening its research activities against the background of the co-ordinated national energy research and development program now being developed through NERDDC. In some overseas research laboratories, such as Harwell in the ap- United Kingdom, scientific facUities and expertise originaUy set up for nuclear research are being utilised to the benefit of energy research and development activities in other fields. That prospect is being examined here. The review is being conducted by a sub-committee of NERDDC. Its report will be completed by the middle of this year. In developing new technology in the energy research, development and demonstration field it is important that regard is given to the mutual benefits of co-operating with other countries. I will outline later important steps that we have taken to ensure that Australia takes full advantage of the benefits avaUable in this way. However, I will comment now on the arrangement this Government has entered into with the Federal RepubUc of Germany to study coal conversion possibUities in Australia. The Commonwealth and the State governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria are participating in a joint oU-from-coal feasibUity study with the Federal Minister of Research and Technology and a group of German companies. The study will examine die conversion potential of Australian coals to Uquid fuels and report on rethe feasibUity of establishing commercial plants at sites in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. On the basis of the agreed schedule of work, the study is expected to be completed by June 1981. The joint study will cost about $3.8m. The study is based on the concept of a plant using the combined hydrogenation gasification and Fischer-Tropsch technologies and having production capacity of 2.9 mUlion tonnes per annum of Uquid fuels, notionally comprising a production stream of 45 per cent gasoline, 45 per cent distillate and 10 per cent LPG. The study is a practical one. It is well planned and it is being carried out in close co-operation with the State governments concerned. It wdl estabUsh a basis for investment decisions running into bUUons of dollars. A single major coal conversion plant is estimated to cost $2 billion to $3 btition. The joint study is complementary to the $2.6m domestic program of coal liquefaction research currently funded by the Commonwealth. The two major elements of this program concern hydrogenation studies with emphasis on continuous reactor work, catalyst investigations, solvent regeneration and product evaluation being undertaken primarily by the Australian Coal Industry Research Laboratory and the Broken HU1 Proprietary Co. Ltd, andflashpyrolysis studies, including product tar hydrogenation and char utilisation being undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Finally on energy research development and demonstration, let me lay to rest once and for all the thought that we need to match the per capita expenditure levels of other countries. It is quite unrealistic to suggest that all countries should achieve the same average level of research expenditure. In any country energy research must be related to the energy resource endowment and outlook. Australia is an energy rich country. We do not have to match the research expenditure levels of energy deficient countries. If other countries spend enormous amounts on research into nuclear power generadon, should we feel required to do the same just to reach some arbitraryfigure?That would be nonsense. The only comparison of any value is performance within Australia. Let me repeat that our initiative on energy research development and demonstration in last year's Budget has almost doubled the previous level of Commonwealth Government support. That is an achievement which speaks for itself. It is laying a foundation for the future which will prove of immense value to the Austrahan community in assuring secure energy supplies. Energy Conservation Another major objective stated in the November 1977 energy policy paper was 'to reon strain the average rate of"" growth of energy conthe sumption, particularly in liquid fuels'. If Australia is to achieve and sustain a satisfactory level of self-sufficiency in oti supplies in the 1980s and 1990s we must take effective steps now to restrain the rate of growth of oil sumption in the medium to long-term. Realistic pricing of petroleum is fundamental to conservation. There are promising signs of success already as recent statistics for 1978 showtotal consumption of petroleum products 1978 was 0.75 per cent less than in 1977. average annual growth in consumption bespecifically tween 1972 and 1977 was 3.8 percent; consumption of fuel oil and diesel fuel for industrial use reduced by 2 per cent and 20 per cent respectively against 1977 levels; motor spirit consumption increased by only 2.7 per cent during 1978 compared with 5 cent in 1977. We intend, however, to reinforce our pricing policies by informing and educating the commarket munity, particularly motorists, of ways in which our scarce Uquid fuels can be used more effectively. We must change deeply ingrained community attitudes to make progress. We are pursuing this objective actively in conjunction with the States. After consultation with the States the Government provided $50,000 in its 1978-79 Budget for a preUminary study to establish a plan for a national pubUcity campaign to save oil. I received the consultant's study report on 28 February 1979. The report recommends that a publicity campaign should run over five years. The total cost proposed by the consultants over thatfive-yearperiod is $17m. The $17m figure, which has been widely commented on in the media, is the consultant's estimate. No decision has been made on the proposal. None of the governments concerned has any commitment to that figure. I believe a worthwhUe program can be achieved for much less. On this question of costs, the potential benefits of conservation must be understood. If a pubUcity campaign results in reducing our oU consumption by only two per cent, that annual saving would be equivalent to discovering a field the size of the Tuna field soon to begin production in Bass Strait. The exploration and development of the Tuna field has cost in the order of $100m. The consultant's report was discussed in the Austrahan Minerals and Energy Council 9 March. The States are generaUy receptive to concept of a jointly funded campaign to save oU but agree that consideration should be given at this stage only to the first year of the program. I am hopeful that a co-operative program will be launched in October 1979-whic h coincides with conthe proposed 'Energy Conservation Month' of the International Energy Agency. I have also set in train a major review of ways in which we can take action within the Commonwealth Government to show a lead in conservation of Uquid fuels. One of the prime possibUiin ties for reducing our dependence on liquid fuels The is to encourage interfuel substitutionthe greater use of readUy available indigenous resources in place of petroleum products derived from crude oil. Our pricing poUcies and specific initiatives have encouraged very significant fuel switching. Natural gas is replacing usage of fuel oU, particuper larly in the Sydney market; LPG is replacing usage of motor spirit, particularly in the Melbourne market. In past years cheap fuel od had a virtual strangehold on the Sydney industrial and without an industrial base load, commercial and domestic sales of gas could not be priced cheaply enough to gain significant penetration. Again, the 1978 oU pricing decision reversed this anomalous situation. Most fuel od reached its appropriate market price almost immediately and industrial gas sales in the Sydney area will now be 80 per cent higher in 1979 than they were in 1978. By the end of this year natural gas wtil have displaced 600,000 tonnes of fuel od in the Sydney area. That represents a saving of about one half of the previous demand for 'inland ' fuel oil in New South Wales. Let me now outline what we have done on LPG-w e are well past the stage of thinking about proposals. On 29 November 1978 I announced that the Government had decided to guarantee that five years' notice would be given of any change to the present relationship between LPG road tax and motor spirit excise, whereby any increase in the rate for LPG is only half that for motor spirit. This gave an important assurance that the LPG road tax differential would not be reduced after motorists had converted. The Government also decided that 100 Commonwealth vehicles in Victoria would be converted as a demonstration program and that an LPG task force, comprising representatives of the State and Commonwealth governments and the transport industries, would be established. The measures I announced have been successful. They have been acted on widely and welcomed byfleetowners and private motorists alike. They have also been shamelessly plagiarised by the Opposition spokesman on energy. Let me briefly give you some indication of consumers' response so far. One Melbourne plier of LPG conversion equipment has reported a 30 per cent growth in demand for equipment over last year. Victoria now has 127 outlets new sites are planned for Brisbane and Sydney. Many towns outside of the large seaboard cities are also getting LPG oudets and growth in LPG demand is occurring there. For example, many Canberra taxis are converting to LPG. Finally, new automotive gas engine for buses and trucks has now been put on the market by Rolls Royce. We place a high priority on conservation of scarce petroleum supplies. Our pricing policy for crude petroleum is fundamental to this-it is bringing results. It is also bringing good results fuel switching away from petroleum to other inThese digenous energy sources. It wdl be more prothe ductive and less costly in the future to conserve scarce petroleum and use what we have wisely than it will be to find and develop new od fields. This fact needs to be recognised much more clearly by the Australian community. Co-ordination of Energy Policy The Government has set up appropriate institutions for the implementation and co-ordination of its energy policies. The National Development portfolio was established in December 1977 and given explicit responsibility for 'national energy policy, including planning and research into coal, od and gas, uranium, solar energy and other forms of energy'. Co-ordination of these responsibilities occurs through the National Energy Office within the Department of National Development. The Government has two major advisory bodies to assist in the formulation and implementation of energy policy. The first of these is the National Energy Advisory CommitteeNEAC. The second is the more specialised National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council-NERDDC . In addition, there is close co-ordination with the States through the Australian Minerals and Energy Councd-AMEC . I indicated earlier that this Government recognises the role and importance of the State governments in energy matters. Through AMEC, we have close and effective liaison. We pursue liaison on energy matters in a whole-hearted way. Under Labor consultation with the States became moribund. It was this Government which established proper consultation with the States on energy matters. International Energy Co-operation National energy pohcies do not function in a the vacuum; they inevitably affect, and are affected supby international energy situations and movements. The Government is well aware of these interactions and has actively sought to foster inand ternational consultation and co-operation over the widest possible range of energy matters. Of outstanding importance in this regard has been the Government's decision to join the International Energy Agency. The International Ena ergy Agency is without doubt the most important forum for international consultation and cooperation on energy matters between the major industrialised nations. I outlined in detail, during my statement to the House on 8 March, the advantages that Australia in would derive from its membership of the IEA. advantages, including our participation in emergency od sharing system, our involvement in the full range of long-term energy cooperation activities and our enhanced opportunities to promote the export of energy resources, amply justify the Government's decision to join the IEA. We do not, however, see the IEA as the only forum for international co-operation in the energy field. The Government has also been active in multilateral organisations in our region. Austraha was prominent in estabhshing the Commonwealth Regional Consultative Group on Energy at the Commonwealth Heads of Government regional meeting last year. The group has India as its convenor and at the inaugural meeting of the group in New Delhi in October 1978, it was agreed to undertake two activities: Firstly, the establishment of a regional data bank on alternative energy technologies. Australia agreed that an existing CSIRO facility would be developed for this purpose. Secondly, it undertook the organisation of a workshop on the apphcations of renewable energy resources at the village level. This workshop will take place in India in June. Australia has also been active in the energy work of the Natural Resources Committee of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific-ESCAP . The Government has negotiated agreements to facilitate bilateral cooperation in energy research and development. These agreements provide opportunities for us to tap into major research projects overseas, to spread the value of our research dollar and to avoid duplication of research. In the field of coal there is an information exchange agreement with the United Kingdom and we have also secured two agreements with the United States Department of Energy and the United States Bureau of Mines, covering a wide range of coal mining and utilisation matters. Under our memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom National Coal Board, coal research co-operation is already underway in two areas. Since June 1978 Australia has participated in work at the NCB Coal Research Establishment at Stoke Orchard on a joint program of production and utilisation of coal extracts. An Australian coal mining research program at Collinsville in Queensland is being supported by the NCB through the supply of hardware for gas monitoring which must be carried out as part of the mining exercise. A Victorian Government proposal for joint development of technology for the conversion of brown coal to liquid fuel is being discussed with the United States Department of Energy. An official Australian solar energy delegation has just returned from the United States of America. The delegation dealt with the prospects for implementation of co-operative projects on solar collector development, solar systems for industrial-process heat and systems for heating and cooling of buildings. As a result of this visit there are good prospects of increased cooperation with the United States on solar energy research. We have also established an understanding with Japan for co-operation between our countries on energy research and development, including co-operation on utilisation and liquefaction of coal, utilisation of solar energy, including heating and cooling, and energy conservation. We have reached agreement with New Zealand on exchanging information on energy policies and activities, particularly those related to research and development and conservation. On the research and development side, co-operation will be concentrated on New Zealand's research into methanol as a petrol blending material and our research into brown coal technology. A similar arrangement with Papua New Guinea is under consideration. All of these activities show our strong interest in pursuing international co-operation, in gaining access to the best international technology and in sharing our knowledge and skills with other countries, particularly developing countries. Our initiatives for substantial international co-operation on energy matters have been developed and implemented in httle more than 12 months. The Opposition when in government made no progress at all in this field over three years. Short-term Oil Supplies This statement is essentially about this Government's approach to longer-term energy policy but in view of current community interest in oil supplies in the wake of the disruption in Iran, I would like to make some comments on this aspect. Firstly, let me repeat what I have been saying since mid-February: There are no grounds for concern about the immediate outlook for supply of petroleum products to the Australian market. This outlook extends to at least May-June on current information. The IEA concluded at its Governing Board meeting in Paris last week that the outlook for the balance of 1979 has not altered because there is still considerable uncertainty as to future production levels in major Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Political stability in Iran remains fragile and there may well be compensatory drops in oil production in other countries. The position is being watched closely. We have reactivated the Government-Industry Oil Supplies Advisory Committee and it is meeting regularly to keep the situation under review. Commonwealth and State officials are also meeting regularly to monitor the position. I will take this opportunity to comment on the IEA's decision recentiy to pursue a reduction in world od demand in the order of two ntillion barrels a day, corresponding to about S per cent of IEA consumption. Australia has endorsed the IEA objective and I believe we can achieve our contribution to it without major difficulty. IEA members agreed that contributions to the achievement of the objective could be made in a number of ways. It is not simply a matter of cutting back on petroleum or energy consumption. There is flexibility in contributing to the objective. In Australia, an accelerating trend to petroleum conservation associated with our pricing pohcies, short term increased indigenous od production and interfuel substitution appear adequate to meet fully our commitment. The increase in production from Bass Strait recently announced by the producers is equivalent to an increase of 3.8 per cent in total oil availability. The increase in datiy production is equivalent to about 10 per cent of our daily import requirements. This improvement, together with the accelerated switch from oti to natural gas in the Sydney area, and the more widespread use of liquid petroleum gas infleetvehicles referred to previously, will meet our obhgations to the IEA objective. Moreover we are considering, in a prudent way, what other steps might be appropriate if in fact the world oil supply situation should worsen and higher short-term conservation objectives should become necessary. A range of short-term measures is under examination with the States and oti companies. They fall into two categories: Technical measures designed to increase fuel supply and measures which would reduce demand. I emphasise that implementation of these measures is not intended at this stage, but prudence warrants careful advance investigation of their relevance and value. The measures under study include a possible decrease in octane ratings, which could result in a saving of approximately 1 per cent to 1 \A per cent of crude oil supplies, and a temporary increase in the lead content of petrol in Victoria, Tasmania and metropolitan New South Wales which could increase the supply of petrol by about 3 per cent. We have weathered the problem well because we had sound long-term pohcies in place. For instance, without the encouragement we have given Bass Strait production through our pricing policy, there would have been litde chance of increasing domestic oil production. Without our pricing policy there would have been little chance of bringing about the sharp change from fuel oil to natural gas which is occurring in the Sydney market. Conclusions Let me sum up. We have a co-ordinated and integrated approach to energy policy. We have assessed our energy resources and identified the supply and use of liquid fuels as the prime area for concentration of policy effort. As a short-term objective we have acted effectively to increase supplies of petroleum by realistic oil pricing policy and by encouraging petroleum exploration and development. The net result to date is that we have the highest self-sufficiency in oil supplies we have ever had and we have coped with the Iranian problem better than most other countries. As a longer-term basis for policy to ensure security of supplies in the necessarytimeframethat is, towards the 1990s-w e have expanded research and development into alternative fuels. This research will establish the basis for secure energy supplies over the longer-term. Our overall energy resource endowment is strong and our responses to the energy problems, both short and long-term, have been energetic and sound. Our pohcies, through their effectiveness in the shortterm, have won the time needed to pursue transition from our current oil dependence to a more diversified and balanced use of other energy sources, without disruption of our way of hfe. For the information of honourable members, I present the following papers: Development and Implementation of National Energy Policy-Ministeria l Statement, 5 April 1979.

193,Mr KEATING,ENERGY POLICY,"The statement by the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) was read as quickly as it was written. That became obvious on a reading of the document because on page 14 it states: Yesterday Alcoa of Australia Ltd announced plans ceed with a $350m aluminium smelter project . . . That means that at least every page from 14 to 36 was written today. So much for the thought, time and consistency which has gone into the Minister's statement. This is not the promised Green Paper that we have heard so much about. This is an embarrassed response to Labor's Green Paper which was released last Monday week. The statement is the work of a lazy Minister. Any reading of the statement indicates clearly that the whole endeavour is a cut and paste job, a stringing together of all the Press statements and speeches that the Minister has made in the past year. The statement should be dubbed '101 unreported Press statements' because that is about all it is; it is just a sham. Let us contrast it with the paper of the Labor Opposidon which was released a week ago and for which there have been 200 individual requests. Can honourable members imagine 200 individual requests from departments, universities, business and interested academics for this piece of political jargon? There is no way in this world. Even the sentences in it are identical to those in the Press statements. Pages of it are straight lifts from previous speeches. We all saw the little notation in the Clancy column in the National Times on the weekend which stated that the Minister had the whips on his departmental officers to get something out to save the Government's face because it had been creamed on energy policy. It has been in office for three years and done nothing about it. The Minister has been in this office for 12 months and we have seen not a line of sensible, integrated or coordinated policy; just a mish-mash of individual statements. It takes the Labor Opposition, without the bureaucracy and without a great staff of people, to produce a closely argued and rational energy paper for Australia which looks at the options, solutions and all the other subject matters involved. The Minister's statement is just a motherhood statement in many places. He talks about such things as the need to increase our energy independence-thing s which are just trite pressions and come very easily. Let us look at the policy? contrast in the Labor paper. The world oil situation in the context of Australia; Australia's broad energy position; the changing usage terns in Australian energy; the liquid fuel probAustralia lem; exploration; the distinctions between old oil and new oil; windfall gains and tax treatments existing low cost fields; fuel substitution; conserthe vation; direct pohcy initiatives for conservation; what other countries are doing; natural gas; to prowe have and what we will need; gas prices and pricing; gas usage; gas exports; pipelines; liquid petroleum gas and all the issues surrounding it; exports; domestic; transport substitution; methanol from gas; gas to petrol; ethanol-al l these subjects were in the Labor paper. What do we get from the Government? We get a tired apologia for an inactive Minister, a man who just does not know what he is doing. That just becomes clear. There is no conservation policy; no mention of direct standards. The Government now has motor vehicle plans up for grabs. There is a new motor vehicle plant coming along. New cars are being produced. But there are no requirements, in legislative form, on these companies to meet certain fuel requirements. The United States vehicle fleet will average 27& miles per gallon by 1985, having come from 13V4 ntiles per gallon in the early 1970s. Yet we have heard none of these direct standards. All we get is the dubious conservation effect of higher and higher petrol prices. The whole policy is just slug the hell out of the motorist who is continuing to be ripped off for tax purposes. This is supposed to be a low tax government, yet the Minister admits in his statement that by way of the crude oil levy the Government takes $ 1,300m from the Australian motorist in one year and transfers it to Commonwealth revenue. Then he said 'If we do not get the $ 1,300m there would be higher taxes'. What does he think a tax on oil or a tax on petrol is, if it is not a tax? Of course, then we get this grubby pohtical argument about how bad the situation was under Labor and how our policies did nothing. Who introduced parity pricing for new discoveries? In the Labor Party policy deUvered by Prime Minister Whitlam in September 1975 the description of new oil is oU coming from fields found after September 1975-no t when the honourable member for Bass was the Minister or when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) came to power. It is no wonder that when Labor was unceremoniously dumped from office in November 1975 the policy had not had a chance to work-it was only a month old. How can this exGovernment reasonably claim that it was its The Minister said nothing about the 50 per cent parity for old oil and the fact that the perpatcentage of import parity for producers in wtil go from 10 per cent to 20 per cent to 35 per cent to 50 per cent by 1980. The Minisof ter said in his statement that from 1980 onwards Government wtil review the policy. We want to know now what the Government is going to what give the oil companies after 1980 and whether we are going to have a resource tax to give the pubhc a fair share of the massive transfer of wealth to the companies. But again the statement contains no news. This statement is characterised by the fact that there is not an item of news in it. The Minister claims to have found an additional 600 million to 700 million barrels. He is quite plain about this in the statementunashamed in fact. I will just read the direct quotation to put him straight on the record. He said: In short, our pricing policy has already led to an in reserves of some 600-700 million barrels . . . I know the oil industry as well as anyone in House and I have never heard from anywhere 600 million or 700 million barrels; and neither has the Minister. It is another piece of fantasy. He went on to waffle about self-sufficiency. about this for a gem of a statement? On page 9 he said: Of course, self-sufficiency will be even further if, as we hope, additional major oil discoveries are made. WeU, what a statement-self-sufficienc y be enhanced if they find more oti! What a great statement! What news there is in that! This is a great little paper! Then we get the sleight of hand on energy search and development. The Minister said $ 15m is to be spent on energy research and velopment and he listed all the projects. But the way the statement is put together it looks though that $15m is for this year. In fact it $ 15m over three years-$5 m a year. It is $5m out of $ 1,300m. The Government is putting $5m a year back into energy research and development out of the $ 1,300m it rips from the motorist's pocket every year. That is a disgrace; it is a scanless dal. Then he had the hide to say: 'We do not have to match the per capita expenditure levels of other countries'. What an outrageous propachieved osition this is. Of course, we are self-sufficient coal. We are in a very parlous position with oti. At the moment we have 10 years supply at but this Minister is on the record as having said 'we do not have to match the per capital expenthe diture levels on research and development of ergy in other countries'. He said that because conscience was pricked by the per capita expoAustralia sition on energy in the Labor Green Paper of last Monday. Let me just read to the House what other counsovereignty tries are spending. We are spending $US2.30 per head on energy research and development. Gerdollars many is spending $US9.70; the United States tralian SUS9.20; Belgium $US8.90; the Netherlands position SUS7.10 and Sweden SUS7.10. Our spending down to SUS2.30, a quarter to a third of coming out of these other countries. Yet the Minister said that we can afford to sit back and relax in terms of energy policy. This country is a large continent with cities spaced at great intervals and relying on motor vehicles. The design of our cities reUes on motor vehicles. Our cities have been butit around the quarter acre blocks and distant suburbs. People need motor vehicles. They need fuel for motor vehicles. They need liquid fuels. We heard nothing about substitutes. The Minister put in some more grubby arguments about increase Uquid petroleum gas and what he has done for it and then said that I unashamedly plagiarised his this statements on LPG. The statement on LPG was of in the Labor Federal poticy four years ago in 1975.1 rewrote it into the Perth policy two years ago. That is a matter of public record. These are How in printed documents. The Government has done nothing about reenhanced, search and development. It is doing nothmg about substitution. In fact, its whole poticy is a will disgraceful apologia for laziness and demonstrates the Minister's inattention to his portfolio. Let me nail another lie. I refer to the often told lie that oU exploration under Labor came to a halt. It is often heard, but what is the record? I have rehere the Minister's answer to questions placed on that notice by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr deHayden). I will put them on the record again. In from 1973 under Labor 69 exploration weUs were as drilled in Australia. Last year, under the present is Government 52 wells were drUled. In 1974, 54 wells were drilled. In 1975 23 wells were drilled. In the first year of the Liberal-National Country Party Government in 1976,21 wells were drUled. In 1977, there were 21 wells drilled. That is two than the last year of Labor and 40 less than the first year of Labor. In 1978 52 wells were drilled, which is not even up to the 1974 figure by Labor. Yet the Minister has the hide into say that exploration died under Labor. Admittedly, there was a downturn, but why was there a best, downturn under Labor? It was because the Liberal-Country Party obstructed the passage of seas and submerged lands legislation in the enSenate for nine months. The then Opposition's his party colleagues, the State Premier of Western and the Premier of Victoria, then took it to the High Court of Australia where they were defeated. That two year delay in determining the question meant that no successful exploration company would want to put millions of into holes in the seabed off the West Ausor Victorian coasts while they were in the of not being sure whether the States or is the Commonwealth had sovereignty. That was what is the reason for the downturn in 1975. Yet we find Government members boasting about their miserable 52 wells. Last year in Canada 3,000 exploration wells were drillednot 52 but 3,000. Government members are sitting back, smug and content, with their 52 wells. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. Government members have made the trivial and weak poliucal point that there are 62 exploration permits now in force. Of course there are 62 exploration permits now in force, but what the Minister did not say was that permits for 34 of them were issued by the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. Only the balance-22have been issued by the present Government. How many have been issued in the last two years? I will tell the House-22 ! We are told that this is the great, renewed exploration effort. It is a poor exploration effort-5 2 wells-and what are we paying for it? I will tell honourable members what we are paying for it-$300 m extra to producers this year, $700m extra to the producers next year and, when we get to 50 per cent of import parity, which in reality will be 56 per cent, the revenue of the producers will be disgracefully high. What is the public paying? The consumer must pay for the crude oil levy, the company taxes and excise on refined product which the companies include in the price of petrol and petroleum products. So, the consuming public of Austraha is paying the Fraser Government a total of $2,400m in one financial year on one commodity-petro l and petroleum products. What have we received for that payment? We have had 52 wells. What have we received for research and development? We have received only $500m. The Minister talks about substitutes. YesterVenture, day the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) and I went to the Australian from National University to look at Professor Kaneff's solar energy unit. We found that it probably embodies the most advanced solar technology the Western World. What is the level of funding from the Government for that project? It is $100,000. The Government will not even back Australians in. It will not do anything for people in its own country. The Government talks about being involved in research and developWest ment projects with the United States. Professor Kaneff told us that when GHH-th man consortium and United States consortiumwas at the university, the representatives wanted exports to find out only the rudiments of the Australian system. There was no exchange of information. It with is all one-way traffic. There is going to be no ing more of that stupidity because the University had the sense to gain patents to therightsto their own exclusive process in the countries I have referred to. The Government has done nothing about research and development. On the off-shore question, the Government is still mucking around with Charlie Court and Premier Hamer. The Government is not game to take them on when the High Court of Australia has said that the Commonwealth has sovereignty over the off-shore seas from the low water mark to the edge of the continental shelf. The Government is still persisting with the fiction that the States should have some role in the issuing of exploration permits off-shore, when that role ought to reside exclusively here in the national capital under the Federal Government. Yet the Government is to bring in some weak piece of legislation to do with some designated authority. The legislation would not stand up tofiveminutes of testing in the High Court. When the Labor Party comes to power-let me make this quite plain-it will repeal the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and dismantle the designated authority. It will administer the off-shore seas of Australia in the name of the Commonwealth of Australia. There will be no more mucking around with State Premiers or their crooked Ministers for Mines or plagiarising companies who have greased the paw of and looked after those people. There will be no more of that hanky-panky. The Labor Party will get down to some honest government when it comes to oil exploration. The Minister spoke about the North West Shelf. I have brought into the House the publication produced by the North West Shelf Joint a consortium of Australian and international companies, which is entitled Energy Australia. It was produced for the benefit of the banking institutions seeking to obtain the finance for a $3,000m project. There are statein ments made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), Sir Charles Court, Mr Ron Davies and myself. Where is the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman)? He has not rated a the mention. I present to the House this glossy publication-the corporate structure of the North Shelf. Let me read directly from the document what the North West Shelf consortium e West Gerprinted from my statement: In July 1977 the Labor Party approved the principle of gas and this is now a clear plank in the National Platform. When the Government finally announced its policy respect to the North West Shelf Venture in August, I responded on behalf of the Opposition by positively supportthe project in a manner that I hoped would be conducive has to its ongoing development and completion. I have backed the North West Shelf Venture and the gas export commitment that goes with it because of my firm belief that there is more undiscovered cause the progress of the venture would be the circuit breaker, the catalyst for a renewed, ambitious oil exploration effort throughout Australia. This approach is already paying dividends. That statement shows how irrelevant the North West Shelf consortium sees the policy of the Opposition in this matter! How dare the Government suggest that it is the brains behind this project. The Minister could not spell 'hydrocarbon' twelve months ago. Now he says that he knows all about it. That is a joke. I now deal with the quesuon of natural gas. At page 25 of his statement-this outrageous piece of duplicity-the Minister says that the Government has increased gas supplies to Sydney and that 80,000 tonnes of fuel oil has been displaced. Let me quote his exact words: By the end of this year natural gas will have displaced 600,000 tonnes of fuel oil in a saving of about one half of the previous demand for 'inland fuel' . . . Earlier he said that the natural gas penetration: . . . in the Sydney area will now be 80 per cent higher in 1979 than . . . in 1978. The Minister has claimed credit for this developgas ment. Whom does the Minister think budt the pipeline to get the gas to Sydney? Who belted hell out of Connor for building the Moomba Sydney pipeline? The Government now has the temerity to claim the credit for that. The Minister is saying that gas is now being delivered. There no wonder natural gas is displacing fuel Government has regulated gas prices and od prices are at import parity. Is it any wonder that fuel od is dear and gas is cheap. It is no wonder that gas penetration has increased by 80 per cent in 12 months. In his statement the Minister not tell the House where all the fuel od is. companies cannot sell all the displaced fuel that is lying around. It is now being sold off-shore at bargain basement prices. We in Austraha through the nose for it from the Middle East sell it for a song off-shore. Where is the Government's refining policy for the catalytic cracking of the residual fuel oils back to light end products. When we look at fifth report of the Royal Commission on Petlations roleum on the refining policy we see that the Commonwealth Government has said that a rerepresentation, fining policy is not a matter for the wealth; it is a matter for the States. So, all the fuel oil being displaced by natural gas, which was once being discounted to keep gas out of the Sydney market, is in tanks and containment veswhatsoever. sels all around Sydney and Melbourne. So for what the Government has done in regard to a natural gas policy. It has done absolutely gas in Australia and benothing! It is letting some of these authoriues sell gas at prices which are soridiculouslyfoolish and profligate that it is a national disgrace. The Minister said that the Austrahan Labor Party had done nothing about liquid petroleum gas. Our pohcy on LPG has been in our platform for four years and it is not a fact that the Labor Green Paper isolated LPG as the avaUable fuel which with known technology could take the place of petrol. The heat or the British thermal unit value of half the remaining recoverable reserves in Bass Strait will be exported as LPG. One mUlion tonnes a year is to go to Japan. Instead it ought to be sold in Australia to fuel the cars of our cities and the bus fleets which pump all their diesel residue into the concrete and steel canyons of Melbourne and Sydney. The municipal busfleetsshould all be powered on LPG. the Sydney area. That represents What has the Commonwealth done? It is convening a hundred Commonwealth vehicles out ofthefleetof about 20,000. That is its LPG policy. Yet it has the hide to talk about what BHP Autogas is doing in conversions in the Melbourne suburbs. It would be doing a lot more if prices were sensibly adjusted to encourage domestic sales of naturally occurring LPG. Instead LPG is being sold to Japan and we are payto ing through the nose for crude oil from the Middle East. We are not only paying dearly for it; we are worrying about even getting it. The is Minister has not come clean and told us how we oil. The really stand on energy supplies. The Minister made a further misrepresentation in the statement when he said that the Labor Government had never entered into interdid national agreements on energy co-operation. The Now, of course, he is talking about the Interod national Energy Agreement which the Government fooUshly entered into a couple of weeks pay ago. He never mentions the Union of Soviet and Socialist Republics science agreement, the Indian science agreement, the Australia-Japan enrichment study, the Australian-Japan oU from coal investigation, or the Australia-United States oti from coal investigation, aU entered mto by the the Labor Government, the Nippon-Austratia ReAgreement or any of the other scientific and cultural exchanges. This was another misanother sleight of hand, as it Commonwere, from this disgraceful Minister. The statement is an absolute farce. It could not be considered an energy statement in any way It is not a Green Paper. It is a thing much which has been hurriedly produced by the officers of the Minister's Department working under difficult circumstances and instructions from the Minister to get this statement out save the Government's face. President Carter and Dr Schlesinger had an energy statement in the market six months after the Carter Adrninisadministrative tration took office. The Fraser Government been in office for three and a half years and still have not yet been given a copy of a Green Paper, a discussion paper, on energy, much less White Paper on clear policy decisions. The Fraser Government has no co-ordinated, ning integrated energy policy. The Minister for National Development is just a gigolo for the companies. He is the Prime Minister's puppet.",85
194,Mr SPEAKER,ENERGY POLICY,Order! The honourable gentleman will withdraw that statement.,90
195,Mr KEATING,ENERGY POLICY,"I withdraw. He is just a Echo for the Department. He is just crawling the learning curve of energy policy. He is not position to make any reasonable statements himthe self. His paper is a poor rejoinder, a cut and job, which I said at the beginning of my speech should be part of a volume dubbed 'A Hundred and One Unreported Press Statements'. That all it is; it is just an identical carbon copy ments released earlier. It is a farrago of fact, fiction and misrepresentation and ought to re have ceive the condemnation of the House. Mr Falconer-In order to stem the flow natural gas from honourable members opposite, I move: That the debate be now adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",90
196,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CONSTRUCTION,"I have received the following message from the Senate: The Senate transmits to the House of Representatives the following resolution which was agreed to by the Senate this day: 'That in accordance with the provisions of section the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979, the Senate(a) declares the conducting of a design competition to be a declared stage in the design of Parliament House, and (b) authorises the announcement of work on that stage.' AUSTRALIAN 1988 BICENTENARY Ministerial Statement",90
197,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CONSTRUCTION,"by leave-The year 1988 will be the bicentenary of the first European settlement in Australia. In June 1978 the Premiers Conference agreed that there should be a major commemoration of Australia's bicentenary. Following this to decision there has been consultation between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory to devise and agree on a framework of arrangements by which an Aushas traUan Bicentennial Authority can be estabwe Ushed. It is only in the course of today that I received agreement from the States for the proa posals that I am now relating to the Parliament. The Authority wiU be responsible for the planand staging of this historic commemoration. As befits a national endeavour of this kind, the oil commitment to it will be completely bipartisan. There have also been discussions with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on the matter. The Authority, therefore, wtil be a joint organisation of 17 members-seve n appointed Sir by the Commonwealth, seven appointed by the up States and the Northern Territory, two members in a drawn respectively from the Government and Opposition in Federal Parliament, and with a paste chairman appointed by the Commonwealth. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that Mr John Reid has agreed to serve as the Chairis man. His work and reputation will be known to of statemany members. He is a businessman and administrator of outstanding caUbre. We are lucky to his services. I am in no doubt that under his experienced and forceful guidance the Authority of will be established on a sound, business-like footing and that he will handle the task he has been given with high distinction. The Authority will be established administratively as a company incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory. There wtil be companion legislation of a general kind to identify AUTHORITY the status and role of the Authority and guarantee its autonomy and continuity. Such an arrangement will confer an appropriate degree of independence and flexibUity so that the Authority can cope with changing requirements during the next decade. The structure envisaged will 8 of enable the Authority to operate expeditiously in a business-like way and will facUitate such operations as licensing, franchising and normal commerical agreements. At the same time, the Authority will be accountable to the Parliament through the Mmister for Administrative Services, who wtil consult, as necessary, with the appropriate Mmister in each of the States and in the Northern Territory. The Authority's accounts will be subject to audit by the Auditor-General. Any appropriation by the Parliament for the purposes of the Authority wtil be subject to the normal parliamentary scrutiny. The Authority wtil also be required to submit an annual report to the Parliament. The memorandum and ardcles of association of the Authority and, as appropriate, the companion legislation will give effect to the Government's wishes in this regard. The Authority will have both advising and operational roles. In its advising role it will be required at an early date to make recommendations in relation to a 'theme' and a 'focus' for the celebrations and on the matter of international participation. Generally it will be empowered to do all things necessary for the successful prosecution of the role given to it by governments and the objectives specified in its charter. The charter will be expressed in an appropriately drawn memorandum and articles of association designed to provide the desired wide ambit of activity and authority within the administrative framework I have indicated-subject , of course, to the decisions of Governments in relation to pohcy. The bicentenary will be a most important event for Australia. Deep in any human community is consciousness of its origins and identity and its hopes and resolutions for the future- a consciousness to which it wiU want to return and dwell upon at particular moments in its history. The marking of a bicentenary is one suchtime.It wtil be a time for calling to mind the achievements throughout this country and by its people over two centuries. It wtil be a time to reflect upon our developing and changing national identity, as a united community transformed in a remarkable way by the migration programs of the years since World War II. It will be atimefor weighing the opportunities and the challenges that Ue ahead as Australia approaches the year 2000 and beyond, and for considering our place in the wider world community. It wtil, as I have said, be a matter for the Authority to propose for the consideration of governments a theme and a focus for the celebrations and, in doing this, it will need to draw upon the ideas of highly imaginative and creative people within the Australian community. It will be for the Authority to recommend the concrete programs by which the commemoration will find expression. In the drawing of these programs and for their discharge the Authority will, as far as practicable, be seeking to devolve responsibUity and initiative to State, municipal and local governments. As well, the Authority will be seeking to involve all sections and members of the community individually and collectively. It will look to encourage initiatives at the grass roots of Australian society. Within these programs there will no doubt be a strong emphasis on history. This must under-pin any such commemoration. We are now embarking on an exciting and challenging project for this nation, and I commend it to honourable members for their support. I present the following paper Australian 1988 Bicentenary-Ministeria l Statement, S April 1979. Motion (by Mr Staley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",90
198,Mr HAYDEN,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CONSTRUCTION," Mr Speaker, this is a unique venture, as befits an occasion of this kind. The Opposition supports these plans and looks forward to playing an active and constructive role in the planning for our bicentenary. There are far more things to unite the people of this nation than there are to divide them. The bicentenary is a fitting occasion on which to emphasise those factors-the positive and unifying elements of our community. There is a distinctive Australian character. I believe it developed from the need of our pioneers to come to terms with an environment totally unlike any they had ever known. This land has moulded the national character into a style and a resUience which all of us recognise, though few are able to express it satisfactorily. If our bicentenary commemoration can capture a litde of this spirit it will be a signal achievement. Our search for a national identity is not quite so self-conscious as it was in earher, quite recent years. I believe that is to the good. Whatever we mean by an expression Uke 'national identity', it is not something to be dictated. Occasions like the bicentenary are, however, ideally suited to efforts to define and identify ourselves. One thing that we can say with certainty-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has referred to it-is that the great influx of immigrants to Australia in the post-war years has broadened and enriched this nation immensely. The process has added new dimensions to the Australian character without, I beheve, changing the fundamental qualities which sprang from the pioneers' response to life on this continent, a world away from Europe. Australia has come a long way and will go much further. It is good that we should establish significant mUestones at which we can pause and pay particular attention to the achievements behind us and the challenges ahead. And it is as well to stress that occasions like our bicentenary are not merely inward-looking. Our role in a world community has changed very greatly in our own lifetime. It will continue to change and, I believe, to grow steadily in importance-to ourselves, and to that wider world community as well. From all of this, it is obvious that the Austrahan Bicentennial Authority faces a great challenge. I hope that its work proceeds harmoniously, that the results genuinely reflect the diversity of our society, so that the commemoration can be an occasion for pride and satisfaction for every Australian. The Opposition welcomes this statement of commitment as a fitting one for a most important occasion, coming from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1978-79 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Eric Robinson, and read a first time.",91
199,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CONSTRUCTION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. I present Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1978-79 which, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 1978-79, which I shall introduce prises the additional Estimates for 1978-79. In these Bills, Parhament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1978-79. The additional appropriations total $289.565m. Of this, $223.205m is sought in propriation Bill (No. 3) and $66.36m in Approaddition priation Bill (No. 4). The additional appropriations Bills are offset to some extent by savings in other appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2), resulting partly from the GovernDepartment ment's determined efforts to achieve savings expenditure wherever possible. These savings, amounting to $ 107.1m, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in a document which has been distributed to honourable members. Notwithstanding the additional appropriations now sought, current expectadons are that total outlays for 1978-79, including those finantation; ced from special appropriations, will exceed the Budget esdmate by only a relatively small margin. This reflects the Government's continued adherence to its pohcies of restraint in public sector spending. I now outline some of the main areas where the Government has found it necessary to seek additional appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1978-79. Honourable members will recall that the Budget contained an allowance of $50m for prospective wage and salary rate increases in the Public Service but that that amount was not then appropriated. Parliament is now being asked to appropriate $43.5m in respect of such increases since the Budget, and a further $ 12.4m is needed, mainly for essential staff increases, particularly in the Department of Social Security and as a consequence of the rearrangement of departmental functions which took effect on 5 December 1978. The appropriations for the latter purpose are offset by savings in the appropriations of the abolished departments. Included under Administrative Expenses votes is $2.9m for the Department of Transport due to increased activity, particularly in the air transport area, and to cost increases; $4.7m is Second Reading required by the Attorney-General's Department aid payments to private legal practitioners, although a substantial portion is offset by savings in amounts appropriated for payments to State legal aid commissions, which will 4) not now be spent due to delays in the commenceshortly, comment of some commissions. Under the 'Other Services', heading, $ 16.5m is sought for the Department of Defence for replacement equipment and stores and a further $48.2m for new equipment and stores. Of the latter amount, $ 10.2m has been included for the purchase of two Boeing 707 aircraft for special Aptransport purposes. This amount represents an to that which otherwise would have been decided upon by the Government for desought in the fence purposes. An additional $3.3m has been included for the of Employment and Youth Affairs in for the extension of the Community Youth Support Scheme and $3m for the Department of Foreign Affairs for increased contributions under the United Nations High Commission for refugees program of assistance for Indo-Chinese refugees. Other provisions include: $2.5m for the Australian National University for cost supplemen$2.8m for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, mainly to meet the cost of national wage and other awards; and $3.8m for the Australian Nauonal RaUways to meet interest charges on interest-bearing advances. I commend the Bdl to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1978-79 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Eric Robinson, and read afirsttime.",92
200,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CONSTRUCTION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I present Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1978-79 in which appropriations totalling $66.36madditional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1978-79-are sought for Capital Works and Services, Payments To or For The States, and Other Services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1978-79. I now mention some of the major items in respect of which additional appropriations are sought in the Bill. An amount of $4.14m is being provided as additional working capital for the Government Printer Trust Account to enable repayments to Consolidated Revenue of operational charges and other balances which have had to be withheld due to operational losses and working capital requirements; $3m will be provided as additional working capital for the Government Aircraft Factory tofinanceadditional stocks of Nomad aircraft; $4.78m is being provided to accelerate the Tarcoola-Alice Springs Railway with a view to achieving completion by November 1980; $ 12m is needed to meet the Commonwealth's contribution towards natural disaster relief and restoration; $llm is being provided for payment to Medibank Private to assist in building up reserves and to ensure that the fund will continue to operate in the market place without further Commonwealth backing. Other additional appropriations include $5.6m for payment to the Housing and Construction Services Trust Account, representing the value of assets transferred to the Northern Terrievent, tory under the self-government arrangements; $2.25m for the Department of Productivity for the funding of public interest projects under the industrial research and development scheme; and $7.7m for the Australian National Railways to meet accrued interest charges on borrowings from the Budget. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned.",93
201,Unknown,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CONSTRUCTION,"Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. NA (REDEPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT) BILL 1979 Bill presented by Mr Viner, and read a first time. Second Reading Second Reading",93
202,Mr VINER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Stirling-Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and Minister assisting the Prime Minister) (8.0)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill is to rationalise and co-ordinate provisions relating to the redeployment and retirement of staff in Commonwealth employment. It might be regarded as a codification of those provisions. It emphasises the efficient and economical use of staffing resources by way of redeployment of staff who can be used more effectively elsewhere; retirement of staff both voluntarily and by initiative of management; and greater mobility of staff. It specifies minimum and maximum ages for retirement. The Bill's coverage will include departments and authorities staffed under the Public Service Act and such other authorities prescribed in regulations with their agreement. The arrangements envisaged by the Bill will enable better management of personnel across Commonwealth employment, provide greater scope for permanent heads and other chief executives to utilise and manage their staff more effectively and overall further improve the efficiency of Commonwealth bodies. In addition to these advantages the arrangements will create opportunities for promotion and transfer for existing staff, and new employment opportunities in the Commonwealth sector. The Government placed before the House similar legislation in 1976 on the basis that it would not proceed past the introduction stage until there had been an adequate opportunity for debate and for consultation between the Public Service Board and staff organisations. In the the Bill lapsed on the prorogation of Parliament in 1977. The Bill before the House today has been prepared in the light of the views expressed on the 1976 Bill and following a number of discussions between the Public Service Board and peak employee councils, particularly over recent months. The Bill includes a number of changes to which I will return later. The Government's policy that maximum superannuation age retirement benefits should only be payable on retirement at age 65 remains unchanged. The Superannuation Act that was passed by the Parhament in 1976 provides for reduced rates of pension to be payable to staff who retire other than on invalidity grounds at an earUer age in accordance with their conditions of service. This Bill provides as a condition of service that staff who no longer wish to work in Government service may voluntarily retire after reaching age 55 with the appropriately reduced pension. The Bill does not change in any way the benefit structure of the Superannuation Act 1976. Staff who choose to retire voluntarily would receive a reduced annual superannuation benefit as compared with those retiring at age 65. For example, pursuant to the Superannuation 1976, an officer retiring at age 65 with 30 years' contributory service receives a standard pension equivalent to 50 per cent offinalsalary whtie officer with 30 years' service retiring voluntarily at age 55 would receive standard pension excess equivalent to 36 per cent of final salary. officer with 20 years' service retiring at age would receive 40 per cent offinalsalary and 28.8 per cent on retirement at age 55. The Public Service Act presendy includes in sections 20, 67 and 85 provisions enabling agement, that is, the PubUc Service Board in conjunction with the relevant permanent head, to redeploy or retire excess officers, inefficient or incapacitated officers, and officers who have attained age 60. The administration of these protion visions has not been fully effective because they do not provide an adequate legal framework, do they contain protection of the rights of staff against arbitrary action. The approach to management-initiated redeployment and retirewhich ment contained in this Bill is based on a revised legal framework directed towards ensuring the most efficient and economical use of staff in Commonwealth employment. By emphasising be redeployment as a primary step the Bill nises that there is considerable scope within the Commonwealth sector for improved utilisation of staff by factiitating the movement of staff within and between departments and authorities to jobs that are more appropriate to the talents the individuals. Where there are staff in the Public Service or in prescribed authorities whose services cannot be used efficiently by the department or authority in which they are employed, whether on grounds of excess numbers, UI health or 'for any other prescribed reason', for example relating to efficiency, the department or authority is required to declare such staff to the Public Service Board for redeployment. The Board wtil be required to ensure consistent and co-ordinated action across departments and prescribed authorities and to seek to redeploy staff across those areas of Commonwealth employment covered by the Act. If redeployment cannot be achieved the Board wtil issue a certificate to that effect and the employing department or authority wtil take retirement action. We have decided that staff between the ages of 55 and 60 years who are retired at the initiative of management 'for any other prescribed reason' wtil, in addition to the existing superannuation benefit, receive a special benefit of two months' salary for each year of service foregone to age 60-that is 10 months' salary on retirement at Act age 55 reducing on a graduated basis to 2 months' salary on retirement at age 59. Where an officer is paid a superannuation pension this an benefit may be converted into a pension. This special benefit does not apply to staff who are to requirements or who are retired on ill An health grounds for whom separate provisions 65 already exist. For superannuation contributors in these circumstances provision is made under the Superannuation Act. Furthermore, in the case of excess staff the Public Service Arbitrator's Demancision No. 509 of 1977 applies. To assist in implementing the provisions of the legislation the Bill requires the Board to issue administrative procedures concerning indentificaof staff to be redeployed and principles for redeploying staff. Such procedures and principles nor wtil be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. These procedures and principles together with the appeal provisions to I wtil refer shortly wtil offer the protection to therightsof individual officers which does not exist under the Public Service Act. This will ensure that arbitrary or capricious action cannot taken against officers; they will receive fair recogtreatment under the legislation. I mentioned earlier that the current Bill contains changes in a number of aspects from the 1976 Btil. I also mentioned discussions undertaken with the peak employee councils since of 1976. The first two of the changes which I will now outline have arisen from these discussions. The former Btil provided for staff to be indentified for redeployment and retirement 'for any other reasons' in addition to the specified reasons of excess numbers and ill health. The Bdl now requires 'any other reasons' to be prescribed in regulations. Before such regulations are made the Pubhc Service Board is required to consult with staff organisations on the proposed regulation and to report to the Governor General on these consultations. There will be continuing discussions with the staff organisations on the operation of the legislation. The Government has agreed to include in legislation the establishment of an appeal triand bunal to review declarations for redeployment and consequent actions of re-deployment or cerestablished tification for retirement. In addition, the tribunal will be empowered to report on the appropriatebenefit ness of the procedures determined by the Board. The tribunal is bound to have regard to the same factors in considering an appeal inal decision-maker. Under this Bill the tribunal wtil have a power to review management deto cisions and either confirm them or reconsidered by management. Unlike the 1976 Bill the tribunal will only have power to vary original decisions in cases where it has been requested to join together staff in a particular briefly. category who are excess to requirements. This could occur where for example 10 out of 20 staff in a particular category are no longer required. Where an appeal or a number of appeals is staff lodged the Tribunal may review on request whole of the particular category against the procedures laid down in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. The process in these particular honourable circumstances will ensure all involved have a fair hearing and will avoid unnecessary delay in either finalising any appeals. I would emphasise that this provision can only operate where staff is identified for excess numbers reasons. Consistent with the responsibilities the Board by this legislation for redeployment of staff arising from excess numbers current Bill empowers the Board where reasonable and practicable to place such excess staff, after consultation, in departments and prescribed authorities. It has been necessary for the continuing efficient operation of departments to transfer officers of the Service to the untime. attached list pending retirement for health reasons. This allows consequential staffing action to proceed. To give this practice a sound legislative basis appropriate provision has been included in this Bill. I mentioned earlier that the Bill can be applied to areas of Government emThe ployment outside the Public Service by reguto lation with its agreement. However, in this text I should mention that it is the Government's policy that both voluntary retirement and management-initiated retirement are inextricably linked. This is reflected by the inclusion of both measures in this Bill. The Government would not accept the apphcation of age 55 voluntary retirement to the staff of a particular authority without it taking up the other measure. By way of summary, the legislation confers on staff an option to retire voluntarily from age 55. The legislation also provides a more effective this basis for management-initiated redeployment retirement in the interests of more efficient and economical staffing. An appeal Tribunal is to ensure staff receive fair treatment. Finally, it enables the payment of a special to those who are retired between the ages of 55 and 60 for reasons other than excess to requirements or ill health. I , therefore, commend as was the origthe Bill to the House. Mr Innes- I seek the indulgence of the Chair be permitted to ask the Minister a question behave them fore I move the adjournment.",93
203,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The honourable member has the indulgence of the Chair to ask a question Mr Innes- I ask the Minister whether he will advise the House whether there is a minimum age for the actions proposed in the Bill and, if under the age of 55 are compulsorily retired, the will any benefits be paid under the Bill?",95
204,Mr VINER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The procedure adopted by the member for Melbourne is rather unusual. I think it better that he raise these matters in his consideration of the response to the second reading speech or in Committee after he has been in a position to study the Bill. I think it would be inappropriate for me to embark upon a debate as to the various measures in the Bill at given to this stage. Mr Innes-B y his reluctance the Minister has situations, the answered the question. Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. BOUNTY (PAPER) BILL 1979 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first Second Reading",95
205,Mr FIFE,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. purpose of the Bill now before the House is give effect to the Government's decision to conprovide assistance to the manufacture in Australia of certain types of paper. Following advice and recommendadon from the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 183 of 17 October 1978 entitled 'Certain Paper and Paperboard', it has been decided to accord assistance by way of a scheme providing for the payment of bounty to eUgible Austrahan manufacturers. Bounty is to be payable at the rate of $90 per tonne on specified coated paper and $70 per tonne on specified uncoated paper which, during the period to which the Act applies, is produced and sold for use in Australia in the manufacture of certain printed matter excluding newspapers and telephone directories. The scheme wtil operate from 6 February 1979 until 5 February 1987. It is considered by the Government that the proposed bounty assistance to be provided to this valuable and important local industry will lead to improved capacity utilisation, increased employment and maintenance of stable prices to paper-using industries. I commend the Btil to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. BOUNTY (ROTARY CULTIVATORS) Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",95
206,Mr FIFE,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill now before the House to give effect to the Government's decision provide assistance to the manufacture in Australia of self-propelled pedestrian operated rotary cultivators, hoes and tillers. Following advice and recommendation from the Industries Assistance Commission in its interim report No. 190 of 6 December 1978 entitled 'Certain engines not exceeding 7.46 kW; rotary cultiCommittee vators; and tractors, having a power of less IS kW, it has been decided to accord assistance by way of a scheme providing for the payment bounty to eligible Australian manufacturers. Bounty is to be payable at the rate of $40 per kilowatt of power output of the engine incorporated in the prime mover of a rotary cultivator, hoe or tUler which has an Australian content of not less than 60 per cent and which, during the period to which the Act applies, is manufactured and sold for use in Australia. The scheme will operate from 5 February 1979 until implementation by the Government of its decision on the Industries Assistance Commission's final report which is expected early in October this year. The assistance provided by the scheme wtil have the effect of maintaining employment in the industry while at the same time enabling manufacturers of rotary cultivators, hoes and tillers to keep the prices of their products at levels competitive with those at which imported products are marketed. For these reasons, I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. NA NA",96
207,Mr ELLICOTT,HOUSE,"Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory) (8.18)- I move: (1) That, in accordance with the provisions of secuon 8 of the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979, the House of Representatives (a) declares the conducting of a design Competition to be a declared stage in the design of Parliament House and (b) authorises commencement of work on that stage. (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of the resolution agreed to by the House ofRepresentatives. BILL 1979 Section 8 of the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979 provides that the Parliament may, by resolutions of each of the Houses of Parliament, authorise the commencement or carrying out of work on declared stages of the design Second Reading and construction of Parliament House. The stages through which the project must pass in a very short time indeed to its programmed completion in January 1988 include the architectural competition to select the designer. The purpose is of the motion which I have moved is to provide to the necessary authorisation for the Parliament House Construction Authority to proceed with the competition. The Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House considered various options for selecting a designer for the project. After consultation with the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the recommended a two-stage compethan tition process. That recommendation has been adopted and a competition document has been of prepared by the Parliament House Construction Authority to establish the conditions and design considerations to be observed by competitors. The two-stage competition will provide ample opportunity to ensure that the final design will meet the functional requirements of the Parhament. A panel of assessors has been appointed to determine the winner of the competition. That panel will be advised by a competition steering committee, representing the Parliament and the Authority. That committee will be responsible for detailed functional checking of the designs, thus ensuring that the Parliament is directly and closely involved in the development of the design for the project. The competition entaUs an openfirststage, in which all architects registered to practise in Australia may participate. From the entries received in stage one, ten designs be selected by the assessors and awarded prizes. From those ten designs, up to five and no fewer than three designs will be selected to proceed to the second stage of the competition, when the designs will be developed into detailed proposals. One winner will then be selected by the assessors. The proposed program for the competition will commence with the announcement of the competition on 7 April 1979 and registrations will close on 31 May 1979. Documents will then be distributed to competitors, who will have up to 16 weeks to prepare their stage one entries. That will be followed by an assessment period of approximately four weeks in September and October 1979 to select competitors to proceed to the second stage of the competition. The preparation of the second stage designs will commence in mid-November 1979 and registrations will close at the end of May 1980. The final assessment of the competition will take place in June and July 1980. Thefirststage of the project will conclude with the announcement of the competition winner in July 1980. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have much pleasure in moving the motion.",96
208,Mr BRYANT,HOUSE,"This is rather historic occasion. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott) has announced the launching of what I hope will be the most sigThe nificant architectural exercise that has been undertaken in Australia. I hope that the tects who enter designs in the competition will have the vision necessary to produce the kind building we want. I hope that in the final assessHouse ment of designs consideration will be given to changing nature of the parliament and that we will manage to avoid all the difficulties and takes which have been suffered by everyone else, throughout history and throughout the who has designed houses of parliament. I hope that the building will represent something of the Australian spirit, as have some of the more nificant works of art in Australia, both pictorial and written in verse and prose. This represents one of the greatest opportunities that the archiment's tects of Australia have ever been offered. There has been a keenly fought battle over where the new parliament house should be built. I recall that at the beginning of the debate on issue some opposition to Capital Hill as a prospective site was expressed because it posed architectural difficulties. This was so despite the fact that some of the greatest buildings in history-whethe r they be the structures on the Acropolis in Athens or others in various places in will the world-hav e been built on similar sites. I think we are offering the architectural profession of Australia an opportunity to use one of the best sites possible for a pubhc building. It is one of the most spacious sites possible, with possibly one of the best outlooks available anywhere for a public building of this nature. I hope that the ultimate design takes into account the needs of a representative government, being as important a part of society as it is, determining how society should operate. I say this tonight in the hope that architects who propose to submit a design will read the Hansard record of this debate and will take note of the fact that the building of the new parUament house is not just an architectural exercise. It is a very significant political and social exercise and is not something to be executed merely on the drawing boards. I hope that the architects wtil come and look around this place and talk to members of parliament about their thoughts on the matter. I hope that the buUding which wtil result wtil be worthy of the enterprise upon which we have embarked.",97
209,Mr SCHOLES,HOUSE,"The Opposition does not oppose the motion moved by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Elhcott), an which provides for the commencement of the first stage of a long process which we hope will not become elongated with the passage of time. motion is an historic motion in that it represents the first proposal on the construction of a archinew and permanent parUament house to come before this House, if my arithmetic is correct, in of about 56 years. On a previous occasion the rejected the design proposed. Since then, the we have had a temporary building, which has survived therigoursof time, despite the assaults mison it by all manner of people, elements and some serious assaults on the parliamentary institution world, by designers of its extensions. The Opposition is a little disappointed that the sigGovernment's construction authorities apparently will be excluded from the design competition. It might well be that within the Governexpertise there exists people who are more competent to deal with the construction design for the new parUament house than there are available outside the Government. We hope that the competition, which is to choose an architect, the brings forward a person who not only is capable of designing a major national building but also has a capacity to design a building which will function as a parhament. Around the world there are a number of examples of very beautiful houses of parhament which are architectural monuments but which bear no relationship whatsoever to the functional aspects of parliaments. In fact, they really have no capacity to facilitate the conduct of a parliamentary institution. The first priniciple to be considered is that the building is to be a parliament house. The person chosen to. design the building must understand the intricacies and the idiosyncracies of the operations of a parliament. The Opposition does not oppose the passage of this motion. It is a machinery motion which will enable the process of at least getting to first base on the construction of a new parliament house. However, it is to be hoped that we do not go through the sorts of processes which we could go through over a period of years whereby, with changing governments, in order to meet day-today pohtical needs, we destroy what could be and what I am sure will be a building which is of major benefit to the nation on a long-term basis- a building which very few of us will actually use.",97
210,Mr LES JOHNSON,HOUSE," I support the motion moved by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott), because I believe that this is a very historical occasion in that the motion involves a declaration by this House concerning the next stage towards accomplishing the erection of a replacement for this building. The design competition is to get an imprimatur from the Parliament tonight. The second part of the motion is to the effect that a message is to be sent to the Senate. I suppose that that means that in fact there is to be acquiescence of the Senate. I am doubtful about that point. I know the Minister has a ready answer. It is my understanding that there is a need for acquiescence in all such matters. The motion does not make the issue quite clear. I suppose that declaration by the House of Representatives represents one part of the journey towards commencement of the selection of a design for the building and that, subsequent to that, is the need for the Senate to adopt the same attitude as the House of Representatives towards the issue. I wtil be interested to hear from the Minister whether that is the case. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who preceded me in this debate, made some points about the importance of this issue. I know that over many years the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) has been critical of the pussyfooting attitude of governments concerning this issue and, indeed, of people who contended that the Parliament would be wrong to proceed to edify itself and the institution of Parhament generally by proceeding with this very large-scale expenditure which will follow the design competition which is the subject of the motion before us. Every generation has the opportunity to do great things. I cannot help but feel that the inclination to do great things in Austraha is less apparent and less in evidence today than it was maybe 100 years ago intimespreceding our generation. The Sydney Opera House might be a very bad comparison in this context because we are not talking about the kind of process that could involve us in an accelerating budgetary situation. I know that there will be a different approach to the new and permanent Parliament House. It is marvellous to think that in bygone days our country accomplished enormous undertakings such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the trans-continental railway. But little of great significance has been undertaken since the Snowy Mountains scheme. Here we have the opportunity of building a great new parliamentary building with all its conceptual considerations which wtil call for the application of the best architectural brains of this country and possibly- I am doubtful on this point as wellthe best architectural brains of other countries. Parliament has taken on a new role. We cannot emulate any parhament in the world when we try to set up a parhamentary institution. We are taking this decision tonight at a time when there is a great tendency to demean parliament, where there is often mockery through the media and a disparagement of democratic processes. People who run other processes-medi a processes especially-ar e inclined to glorify their own role and to diminish the role of the Parhament. It just seems to me that it is in the interests of the great mass of ordinary Austrahans to ensure that enshrined in this new building is the principle that Parliament is supreme in our nation-no t the people who manipulate the purse strings. There should be a realisation that this country has great fundamental natural resources and human resources and that the elected representatives of the people, rather the people who get into the act of manipulating those resources, ought to be paramount. So this is a vital matter for the future. The new parliament house which will be opened to celebrate our 200th anniversary ought to be a great edifice of which all future Australians can be proud. I have been a member of this place for quite a time now and I do not think this occasion ought to be allowed to go unrecognised or to be treated insignificantly. I commend the Minister for the motion that he has put before the Parliament. I hope that the architectural profession will be sensitised and that there will be great pulsating inspirational factors which will cause a great manisfestation of all the ideals that we as practitioners have-no t just about a building for ourselves as partiamentarians; heaven knows, some of us here today will not be here in 1988-so that the people can come into the new parliament house and regard it as their own. Even dissenters should be able to do this. I have regard for the excellence of the Committee's report. Members of the Committee who visited parliaments around the world have had regard for new trends and suggested that we might make facilities available for dissenters demonstrators so that these people can come the Parhament and the voice of the people in this place can ring out and be paramount so that pilot Austraha might benefit as a consequence.",98
211,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,"I have the temerity torisein this debate because, looking at the membership of the New and Peras manent Parliament House Committee I believe in all humility that I am probably the longest serving member of that Committee. I have served as a member of the Committee since it was first instituted in 1975. I agree with the comSpeaker ments of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). I am surprised that there are people in a country such as ours who would dismatter parage and find reasons to say there is no need for a new and permanent parliament house.",99
212,Mr HUNT,HOUSE,They don't like pohticians.,99
213,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,"I think many people great do not hke politicians. I would like to make point that the new and permanent parliament house is not for politicians; rather it is for who serve politicians. The new House of Repmost resentatives chamber will not be very much larger than the present chamber. The people Austraha rejected a referendum on a proposal to break the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives. As a result the Comtered mittee felt clearly that an almost 50 crease in the number of Federal parliamentarians would be required to justify an increase in the size of the House of Representatives chamber. Frankly, to use the vernacular, that is considered to be just not on. Honourable members will know from the Committee's report that the new House of Representatives chamber will accommodate only 130 members. At the moment there are 124 members of this chamber. So lavish provisions are not being made for partiamentarians. Thefigureof 130 might be wrong; I do not have the report with me. MrEllicott-It is 170.",99
214,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,The Minister corrects me; it is 170. So the report does not make any lavish provision for parliamentarians in that sense. It makes no greater provision for partiamentarians than is provided now insomuch as each parliamentarian will have an office of his own. Certainly those offices will be a little larger. I would have no quarrel with that arrangement in the case of my own office.,99
215,Mr BRYANT,HOUSE,How big is it?,99
216,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,It is twice as big as a broom cupboard. When Ifirstcame to this place and the brooms were taken out of my room to let me to in. I do not know whether that is good or bad. Some one suggested that I might have been a test on one of those brooms. I reject that suggestion; it is not true.,99
217,Mr CALDER,HOUSE,It obviously didn't sweep clean.,99
218,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,"My God; it is nearly bad as the slogan 'Turn on the Lights', and in any event, neither thing has happened. I support the proposition and I commend the Government. I would like to pay tribute to the of the House of Representatives and to the President of the Senate both of whom have been dynamic in their endeavours to carry this forward. I would like to raise just one point. If the community wants to be critical of this new building it ought to bear in mind that in terms of 1978 dollars we are looking at an expenditure of about $150m and this expenditure wtil be contained. If I may digress, I would like to pay tribute to officers of the National Capital the Development Commission who have sat with and advised the Committee. They have been those trail blazers into an area that was unknown to of us. None of us has been in this position before. We have never had to blaze the trail, to of start from nothing and to come forward with a brief from which architects from within Australia and outside Australia, provided they are regisin this country, are able to design our new 9 per cent inand permanent parhament house. I know that before I came to this place the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant), with other people, carried out a great deal of work on the proposed new and permanent parliament house. The committee of which I am a member used the report of his committee as a starting point. So I guess the honourable member for WUls blazed the trail through and brought us to the position where we were able to start really to look at something and really come to taws with the problem that confronted us. Mr Ellicott-Burke and Wills.",99
219,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,"I do not think one could have a better combination. The honourable member for Wills started the concept of a new and permanent parliament house and the honourable member for Burke, if I could be forgiven for saying so, put the House where it ought to be, and that is on Capital Hill. It was my Bill which came before this chamber. Tonight I will not say kind words about the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) who is sitting at the table. The last time. I did that I was very kind to him. I had him elevated almost to the bench of the High Court of Australia. He got pretty dirty about that. So I want to use this opportunity to withdraw those kind remarks. Rather than his sitting on the bench of the High Court, I think, frankly, he would have some trouble sitting in a magistrates court. But that is by the by. Tonight we are debating a motion which has been moved by the Minister for Home Affairs. I compliment the Government on its action. I say that in all sincerity. But I have been side-tracked. I want to return to the criticism that may arise in relation to the expenditure of $ 150m over a long period.",100
220,Mr BRYANT,HOUSE,That is chicken feed.,100
221,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,"The honourable member for WUls says that that is chicken feed. I tilustrate the point that it will be 10 years from now that that place will be ready for its first occupation. I am not suggesting that it will be completed, but it wdl be ready for occupation on 26 January 1988 when we commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the invasion of Australian by Europeans. However, a buUding has been completed at Newport in Melbourne, the cost of which was $ 160m. We talk about expending $ 150m on our national Parliament, but there is a buUding in Victoria which cost $160m. It is a power house- a place where electricity is generated. That buUding cost $160m. So when we talk about $ 150m",100
222,Mr LES JOHNSON,HOUSE,What is wrong with $ 150m for a gasworks?,100
223,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,"There is a need for alternative power sources in Australia, and the honourable member for Hughes has suggested an alternative source. He thinks that the outlay of $150m for a gasworks is better than the expenditure of $ 160m for a power station. I suggest that the amount of money that is being expended on this buUding is not out of proportion. In fact, it is probably a meagre amount of money. Everybody knows about the generosity of the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his Scottish ancestry.",100
224,Mr HUNT,HOUSE,Fai r go. Don't be racist.,100
225,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSE,"I am not being racist, not really. I will probably Uve to regret having made that comment. But this is not an outrageous sum of money. It is a sum of money that is in keeping with the status of the national Parliament. I commend the motion to the House.",100
226,Mr ELLICOTT,HOUSE,"Wentworth-Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory) (8.43)-in reply- I thank honourable members opposite for their creative and constructive contributions to this debate. The motion before the House is an historic one. In fact, when we pass it in a few moments it will mean that the Parliament House Construction Authority will be able to get on with the job. Already the Senate has passed a motion in simUar. terms.. Each House has to approve stages of the construction of the new parliament house and the Senate has already passed its motion. We will undoubtedly pass this motion in a moment. It will be an historic moment when that occurs. Because it is of such significance, I will not delay that moment from coming. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA Reference to Public Works Committee",100
227,Mr GROOM,LABORATORIES," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: Royal Australian Navy Research LAboratories (RANRL)-Relocatio n to Pyrmont, NSW. This proposal concerns the relocation of the Royal Australian Navy Research Laboratory from unsatisfactory accommodation at Rushcutter's Bay to the Royal Edward Victualhng Yard premises at Pyrmont. The works proposed include alteration and renovation of the existing eight storey building to provide office space, research laboratories and workshop space with necessary amenities areas. The work will be done in a way to preserve the historical status of the buUding. Construction of a perimeter security fence, gate control, official government vehicle garage, drivers' room and flammable Uquids store are also included in the proposal. The estimated cost of the works at February 1979 prices is $2.54m. I now table plans of the proposed works. Question resolved in the affirmative. NORFOLK ISLAND BILL 1979 Debate resumed from 4 April, on motion by Mr Ellicott: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Innes had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to achieve the following purposes: (1) that the powers of the Administrator as proposed in the Bill be reduced by(a) transferring to the Legislative Assembly the executive government of Norfolk Island, and abolishing the Executive Council; (b) enabling the Legislative Assembly to make Ordinances providing for matters specified in Schedule 2 to the Ordinances to be assented to; (c) transferring to the President of the Legislative Assembly the power tofixthe dates of elections; (d) transferring to the Legislative Assembly and the President of the to convene meetings of the Assembly; (e) transferring to the Legislative Assembly the power to accept resignations of Presidents and Deputy Presidents of the Assembly; (f) placing a limit of 60 days upon the period within which the Administrator may consider proposed Ordinances; (g) enabling the Legislative Assembly to appeal to the Minister, and thence to the Parliament, against any action, opinion or decision ministrator; and (h) changing the tide of the Administrator to one more suitable to the changed status of Norfolk Island; (2) that the powers of the Governor General as proposed in the Bill be reduced by(a) placing a limit which the Governor General may consider proposed Ordinances; and (b) removing the power to disallow, or recommend amendments to, Ordinances made by the Legislative Assembly as proposed in paragraph (l ) (b ) above or assented to by the Administrator; (3) that the powers of the Legislative Assembly as proposed in the Bill be expanded by vesting in the Legislative Assembly the sole power of appointing members of the Executive Council and terminating their appointment, in the event of there being an Executive Council; (4) that matters specified referendums, electoral law, the recruitment and management of the Norfolk Island Public Service and education; (5) that matters specified in Schedule 3 to the Bill land use and zoning, vation and national parks, law enforcement and management of historical sites; (6) that a Bill of Rights for Norfolk Islanders be included in the Bill, ensuring, in particular, the recognition of the island as the historical homeland of the Pitcairners and the protection of their remaining rights; (7) that the recommendation by the Administrator in respect of a money Bill be required before the Bill is passed by the Legislative Assembly; (8) that moneys shall not be lent to Norfolk Island by the Second Reading Commonwealth except with the agreement of Norfolk Island; (9) that members of the Legislative Assembly be elected by a method of proportional representation, the whole of Norfolk Island constituting a single electoral division; (10) that the taxation and social security legislation of the Commonwealth be extended to Norfolk Island in full; and (11) that Norfolk Island be incorporated into an appropriate electoral division of the Commonwealth of Australia, and that Australian citizens resident on the island be enrolled in that electoral division'.",100
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LABORATORIES,"Mr M ill a r ) Before the debate is resumed on this Bdl and on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general deBill without the need for those bate wdl be allowed covering this Bdl, the Remuneration Tribunals Amendment Bill and the motion to take note of the paper on government policy regarding Norfolk Island. Legislative Assembly the power",101
229,Mr JAMES,LABORATORIES," I am honoured to participate in this cognate debate in connection with Norfolk Island. I am grateful that so many honourable members of the House have shown such an interest in the progress of Norfolk Island. It is some years now since I was on Norfolk Island. I visited the island onfiveoccasions of the Adfrom 1960 to early 1970.1I have great respect for the indigenous people of the island. I have less respect for some of the business people whose only concern, in my view, is to increase their wealth. They are as rugged in doing that as the local people will permit them to be. I had many of 90 days upon the period within friends on the island. One of my great friends was a former councillor who used to keep me informed of what was happening on Norfolk Island. He was the late councillor Albert Bathie. I visited his home and he visited my home in Newcasde. He had been on the island for many years. He married an island girl, one of the Christian family. Her name is Amy. She is still alive and she is a lovely woman. When I first went to the island in the early 1960s there was one plane flight a fortnight. We know that the number of these flights has now in Schedule 2 to the Bill include increased with great intensity and tourism has reached greater proportions than ever before. The number of hotels has increased. In one reinclude port I read that one hotel was to be closed and a mining, public hospitals, consernew one to be built. The land on which that hotel stood is to be taken over by the Administration, with the agreement and at the wish of the hotel authorities. When I hear of arrangements such as that I wonder whether some agreement has been made with one of the other hotel proprietors or whether the hotel proprietor who has an interest in the hotel does not want opposition set up at that hotel. As I said a moment ago, it is stated in that report that it was the wish of the hotel owners that the council resume the property. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) in this debate. I believe that in the main it is beneficial to the island people. When Ifirstwent to Norfolk Island I inquired about whether the island people were paid pensions or the unemployment benefit, which is better known as the dole. We call it a social service benefit now but people in my age group in my electorate of Hunter still refer to it as the dole. I was amazed to find that on Norfolk Island the people were paid only what was called a sustenance allowance which approximated, in the days before decimal currency, 30 shdlings a week. I told some of the Norfolk Island people with whom I was friendly that they should fight for increased social service payments. They appreciated that they were not a taxed people and sometimes, in their innocence or because of their lack of knowledge, they thought it would be better if they did not fight for increased social service payments as they would have imposed upon them taxation similar to that on the mainland. But I am firmly of the opinion, I am afraid, that whenever the indigenous people of the island oppose proposals contained in government legislation or advanced by the Labor Party, the professional business people from the mainland use skill, oratory, influence and inducements to sway the Norfolk Islanders to opinions which are not in their best interests. I say that with great sincerity. I do not wish it to be interpreted as an insult to the Norfolk Island people. I wish it to be interpreted to mean that the innocence of the indigenous Norfolk Island people is being imposed upon by their not being given sincere opinions by the better-off classes of business people who in the main are on Norfolk expressly to enrich themselves. We know that, probably for many years before the situation received any publicity in Australia, Norfolk Island was a haven for tax dodgers. If it was a haven for tax dodgers, the statement. I have just made is justified because a tax dodger'sfirstand primary goal in life is to enrich himself by any means, even to the point of breaking the law. At thistimeI think I should repeat the words of a very prominent former member of this House, Dr JF CAIRNS, a former member for Lalor, who at a private dinner said to me that any person with great riches has not obtained thoserichesby legal means. With some knowledge of human nature, having been involved in many investigations of serious criminal matters before I was elected to Parhament, I believe that to be true. We are all aware that the present legislature on the island, the Norfolk Island Council, is elected by a simple and seemingly fair method whereby all voters must cast eight preference votes for eight candidates and for no others. This eliminates confusion. The eight candidates with the highest number of votes form the new Council. However, minority power groupings have received a considerable number of votes but no representation, despite this very fair method. The majority power groups, usually conservatives and business people, may form a ticket for the eight vacancies and swamp the Council. Consequently, a system of proportional representation for the election of the nine members of the proposed Legislative Assembly is recommended by my Party with a quota of 10 per cent having to be gained to ensure election. This is considered fair to all concerned. Most honourable members who have made even a minor study of Norfolk Island are concerned about its being a tax haven. I know that a former member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Crean, tried to take determined steps to close loopholes that made Norfolk Island a haven for tax dodging. But loopholes still exist and they allow the avoidance of Federal and State taxes and duties. When I was on the island, a considerable number of years ago the indigenous people were not greatly concerned about this. Specifically, it appears that Australian estate and gift duties and State death and stamp duties are avoidable. Companies are using the island to avoid stamp duties. An indicator of this is the growing number of company registrations on the island. I must say that in the main it is the legal profession, of which the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott), who is at the table, is a member, which advises people how legally to avoid paying taxes. I do not suggest that the Minister has ever been a party to this himself, but with his worldhness within the legal profession he would undoubtedly be aware that what I am saying is true. From 1 January 1972 to 30 June 1978, 818 companies were registered on the island.",101
230,Mr LES JOHNSON,LABORATORIES,How big is the island?,102
231,Mr JAMES,LABORATORIES,"It is about five miles by three miles. I believe that one of the members of the Norfolk Island Council is present in the House tonight. I would hope that, after listening to debate, he would try to arouse the indignadon of members of this Parliament, which expresses the opinions of many sectors of the Australian people, towards this tax dodging that occurs on his island. I should imagine that he would do everything to voice his opinion and to get the Norfolk Island people to protest at this situation, although it does not actually affect the indigenous people who, particularly when I first went to the island in 1961-62, have lived by the principle of 'give me neither poverty nor riches' because they want to live in contentment with nature. I repeat the fact that 818 companies were registered on the island. Despite the 1973 amendments to taxation legislation which were implemented by the Labor Government and by Mr Frank Crean in particular in an endeavour to try to close the loopholes, over 360 of these companies have been registered in the last two years. In an editorial last March, the Norfolk Island News stated that chartered executive jets were bringing Melbourne businessmen to the island to investigate a new loophole which had been discovered in the tax laws. The local banks had kept staff back after closing hours to handle the transactions at that time.",102
232,Mr LES JOHNSON,LABORATORIES,They are sharks.,103
233,Mr JAMES,LABORATORIES,"Yes , land sharks. They are more dangerous than the ones in the water over there, and there are plenty in the water there. The torial in the Norfolk Island News stated further that the island rumour had it that hundreds of mUlions of dollars were involved. have since had more recent circulation on the island. Whdst real knowledge of the extent to which the bourgeoisie are avoiding taxes on their estates is not forthcoming, it is felt that there little doubt that many of them are doing exactly that. Needless to say, a major priority is to inate the remaining avenues by which Auscaught tralians are using Norfolk Island to side-step their taxation responsibUities. I believe that the obligation of the indigenous people of NorNorfolk folk Island not to allow their island to get the reputation that it is getting of being a tax haven and then a host to these professional business he did. spivs who are using this beautiful island. If one were to use the words of the founder of Little Cuba, one would say that it is an island that could become 'the paradise of man'. It has temperature that hardly exceeds 80 degrees the summer and rarely falls below 60 degrees in the winter. I believe that, if Labor's amendment were acthis cepted, all the money recouped from taxation on the island would be spent on the island. I know that when I was there the islanders were apprehensive about the introduction of taxation laws. They had pumped into their minds the opinions of the semi-spivs and the business people-no t all of them; I emphasise that-wh o in the main went there for the express purpose of growing rich quickly. They have passed on the message: 'We do not want taxation here. We do not want that here'. Occasionally one could hear the voice of the European businessmen being echoed through the innocent tongue of the lovely Norfolk Island people. I remember one of my great friends, Jack Buffet",103
234,Mr LES JOHNSON,LABORATORIES,What about Bathie?,103
235,Mr JAMES,LABORATORIES,"Yes, Bathie and Jack Buffet. Jack Buffet was called 'Boony'. He was a lovely old fellow. His opinions on many things, apart from government and the law, were sought on many things. He never took a great interest in those things, but his opinions were always sought. His opinion was sought as to whether the unloading of ships should be discontinued, because ofhis knowledge of the sea. He was a great seaman. Some of the last words he said to me before he died were: 'We do not want your laws here. We do not want too many laws here. We want to remain free. You complicate the place with laws. We do not want them'. I can see what he meant. There is no doubt that if I had had more time with Jack he could have pointed out to edime how the island was being used by the business spivs of the mainland to make themselves rich, with little concern for the well-being of the These rumours Norfolk Island people. Norfolk Island is a fisherman's paradise. Fishermen are accused of stretching the truth to is bursting point attimes,but I wentfishingat Norfolk Island onetimeand Bathie was in the boat. elimNone of the fish we caught was under 3 lb. We seven fish on six hooks. I brought some back for the honourable member for Hughes it is (Mr Les Johnson). The Minister has been to Island and has shown great interest in the island. It would be a pity if he did not have an opportunity to gofishing.I do not know whether I return to the business angle. A tragic thing happened at Norfolk Island: There was a profession which the indigenous people were ready a to take up and eager to pursue, but not being in fools they did not. After they came back from fishing they found that they had to give their fish away. The boarding house and hotel proprietors in the early days would not pay for the fish. So, fishing was discontinued by the indigenous people. There was a snap freezer for fish; there was a place to keep thefish.The boarding house and hotel people wanted the fish for nothing. It had been the custom. They wanted to continue the practice. When I was there we filled nine corn sacks with fish and kept two sacks for ourselves. It is a fantastic place. The islanders are a lovely people. I noticed recently a newspaper article referring to the fellow who was arrested in the Northern Territory. It was Mr Bela Csidei. He landed on Norfolk Island with a suitcase full of notes. He was finally picked up in the Northern Territory and got a lousy three years' gaol for farming marihuana. I am glad that the Norfolk Island people detected him. They did the mainland a good turn. They sent him back. I have been told that the police and authorities' hands were tired from counting the notes for some hours at night. They were counting some ofhis ill-gotten gains. The only regret I have when the subject of Norfolk Island arises is in regard to one of the harshest governors that Norfolk Island ever had-Majo r Morisset. There is a place named Morisset in my electorate. It does not reflect the attitude of this man. Major Morisset was one of the early governors of Norfolk Island. He was very harsh and cruel.",103
236,Mr BRYANT,LABORATORIES,He was worse than this Minister.,104
237,Mr JAMES,LABORATORIES,I would not say he was worse than this Minister. I think there is a lot of good in this Minister. I place on record the fact that the elected Norfolk Island Council is firmly against the introduction,104
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LABORATORIES,"Mr Drummond) Regrettably, the honourable member's time has expired.",104
239,Mr ELLICOTT,LABORATORIES,"I can assure the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) that fishing is just as good on Norfolk Island now as it was when he went fishing there-only, I caught a shark. I let it go as it got to the boat, I can assure him. We are very anxious to wind up the debate tonight, so I had better get on with it. When the Norfolk Island Council approached me with a view to amending the Bill, one of the things I was asked to do was to insert in the Bill a Schedule which showed the Acts of this Parliament that applied to Norfolk Island. I was loath to do that, but I did indicate that I would table in the House for inclusion in Hansard, if that were agreed to, a list of those Acts. I table that statement. I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. Leave granted.

240,Mr ELLICOTT,NORFOLK ISLAND,"It was very interesting to listen to the honourable members opposite reading the amendments that the Opposition proposes to this Bill. One would have thought that complete self-government would be given to Norfolk Island. When one came to the end, with bitter disappointment, one realised that the taxation and the social security legislation of the Commonwealth would be extended to Norfolk Island in full. Of course, once one came to that proposition, which was No. 10 out of 11, one realised that what the Opposition was proposing was nothing like self-government. It was quite the opposite. The fact was that what the Opposition was proposing to give was very minor compared with what it was proposing to take away. The very essence of self-government in the long run-that is what this Bill is about-is therightto raise taxes and the capacity to provide services one wants to give to the people one represents. That is the essence of self-government. It is the basis ofit. One of the things we have to realise when we are talking about self-government for Norfolk Island is simply this: The basis of it hes in the economic capacity of the island or otherwise to sustain its own government. That is why, in the statement. I put out last year on behalf of the Government, I said that we would conduct an economic feasibility study. We realise that self government will not work on Norfolk Island- I believe the Norfolk Island Council accepts thisunless the island is economically feasible. I hope that within a few weeks' time we will have a report which will indicate that it is economically feasible. To some degree it will be based on the . 5. tourist industry. That always has some problems, wherever it is. We have it in Canberra. Norfolk Island is dependent on the tourist industry. Given the continuing success of the tourist industry it is quite hkely that the report that comes out will show that Norfolk Island can look after itself and provide to all the people on the island those services that they require for their ordinary way of life. I wdl come back to taxation and I will come back to social services. It has never been the view of the Government that social services should be provided simply by grace and favour. On the other hand, it is the view of the Government that there is nothing magical about the social services system of this country. Some of us might well ask why we ever undertook so much and what can we do to cut it back. But that is another question which we will not have time to go into tonight. What we wtil have time to go into tonight is the position of Norfolk Island regarding social services. As to that I just want to make it quite clear that the Government recognises the need for a social security system as a right and a need to provide proper services and proper benefits so that people can have a reasonable standard of living on the island. There has been a fear by some residents on Norfolk Island. Basically they are the people who are of Pitcairn descent. They feel-and I beheve to some degree they have been whipped up by others-that Australia is taking away Norfolk Island. They fear that the Austrahan Government, this Parliament, is taking away Norfolk Island from them. I want to say-and I believe I am saying it on behalf of all honourable members-that that is not the intention of this Bill. This Bill recognises the relationship between the Pitcairn people and Norfolk Island. When we say that Norfolk Island is an Australian territory, that is a statement of law. There is a deep and abiding relationship between the Pitcairn people and the island itself, and that is not at risk. It is not under threat and the laws of Norfolk Island, I hope, will continue to protect the rights of those people who live there to enjoy their culture and to ensure that they can contain the number of people who go there to share the island with them. Of course there is a limit to the number of people who can live on Norfolk Island. Some people think it is about 2,000. Others have different views, but it certainly has a limit. The people of Norfolk Island should have therightto limit the numbers of people who live there. Indeed those people of Pitcairn descent, who have left Norfolk Island, should have therightto go back there provided it is consistent with the overriding question of numbers and the capacity of the island to take those numbers. It may not be widely known, but there are many more people of Pitcairn descent living off Norfolk Island than there are living on Norfolk Island. If they all went back at once it might create a problem. Everything that the honourable member for Hunter said about the island and the place that it represents, the fishing, the nature of the people there and their customs, is absolutely correct. I am sure his contribution to the debate is appreciated not only by myself but also by the people of Norfolk Island, who hopefully may be listening at this very moment. I emphasise that the Bill provides a framework within which self-government can be achieved. Self-government is something which in a sense emerges. It is not necessarily a good thing just to say to a place like Norfolk Island: 'Take the lot and get on with it'. Some honourable members have said, and it is true, that there is a dependence to some degree by Norfolk Island on Australia. I do not think the Norfolk Island people deny this nor do they want to make their association with the mainland. Therefore, there wtil always be dependence to some degree. For instance, goods are exported to Norfolk Island without sales tax. That is a concession which is made and one which the Australian Governments have consistently made because they understand the need to provide goods at that sort of level to the people of Norfolk Island. That is only a small instance of what I am talking about. The important thing is to recognise-and it is not really in dispute-that there will always be some sort of dependence on the economy of the mainland. The Government does not want to use that in any way to override the people of Norfolk Island, but it means that in the emergence of self government there is a need to be realistic about it and realises that in the end that dependence will remain, and it is a good thing for Norfolk Island that it does remain. Within that context one must recognise the need to see self-government as something that emerges. There are people on the island, I have to say, who believe that Norfolk Island is a nonself-governing territory within the meaning of Article 73 of the United Nations Charter. No government in Australia has ever recognised that as a fact. If it were, Norfolk would be like Cocos (Keeling) Islands; that is to say, it would be entitled to an act of self-determination. An act of self-determination embodies three things: The right to decide to be independent; the right to have a free association with the country with which it has been associated; or the right to be integrated. That is how Article 73 is appUed. That is not the case with Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island has, by the High Court and by governments successively in Australia, been regarded as a place which is in a real sense Austrahan territory, just as the Northern Territory I emphasise that this is not to say that Norfolk Island is being taken away from the Norfolk Island people. It is not to say that the historical relationship and the substantial relationship that exists between the people of Norfolk Island and the island is not real and wdl not continue to be recognised by this Parliament. That is why I felt it was appropriate, when the Norfolk Island Council spoke with me after this Bill was introduced, to recommend that certain amendments be made in a preamble. They wtil be put to the Parhament later. The preamble will recognise the history of Norfolk Island. It will record that on 8 June 1856 people from Pitcairn came to setde on Norfolk Island. It will record that under the Order-in-Council of 1855 Norfolk Island was set aside as a separate and distinct settlement by the British Crown. It wtil recognise that in 1914, by Order-in-Council, Norfolk Island was transferred to Australia as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth and that it has been so since. It wtil recognise in a very important way the other provisions contained in the amendments, namely, that people who are descendants of the original Pitcairners form part of the present residents of Norfolk Island. Let us understand that of the present residents 40 per cent are of Pitcairn descent. cent represents people who have gone there from Australian States, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and some from other parts of the significance, world. I think the other 20 per cent represents people who are itinerant, in the sense that they go there to work, stay for a period and leave. fact is that the proportion of the population Pitcairn descent is now 40 per cent. It is not jority. Therefore, there is a real need to look the position of the Pitcairn people and make sure that there is no exploitation and to make sure that they are in a position where they can propacknowledgement erly recognise and develop their culture. I hope, and the Government hopes, that this Bill will provide a framework people of Norfolk Island, including those residents who are of Pitcairn descent, can stand on their own feet, with their own economy and run their own affairs. We, as a government, hope that this will take place within as short a period as practicable. The Norfolk Island Council accepts the proposition that there will be a need to form, not in a schoolmasterly sense of putting them through a test but in the sense that those us who have had experience in legislative and have. executive functions know that it does not come easily. That is to say, it is an exercise that has be learnt. Let us face it: Those of us who tbink is. that we are good at legislating and performing executive functions are not always showered with great plaudits by members of the community. No matter how one approaches the task, it is not easy. Therefore, when self-government is accepted by a community it must be approached gradually. To acknowledge that is not an act of paternaUsm but an acceptance of reality. The reaUty is that the Australian Government and this Parliament want to help Norfolk Island get on its feet so that it can conduct its own affairs and manage its own economy. Therefore the Bill must be seen as providing such a framework. Over the next period-let us hope that it will be no longer than five years-the people of Norfolk Island, through their elected representatives, will be able to control most of the things that affect their daUy Uves. There wtil always be some matters on which, to some degree, their interests will be interconnected with those of the mainland. For instance, in relation to immigration Norfolk Island must not become a back door to Australia. In relation to Customs, Norfolk Island must not become a back door for the entry of Ulegal drugs and the like. These are matters that are recognised. Therefore, the poticy on the island must to some degreefitin with that of Australia generSome 40 per ally on these matters. Again, fishing off Norfolk Island is of some but its pursuit does entail international obligations which, as honourable members wtil recall, are negotiated under the The Law of the Sea Conventions. They are matters of that must be negotiated by the Australian a maGovernment but, basicaUy, the fishing around to Norfolk Island wiU be conducted, one hopes, for the benefit of the people of the island. I repeat, there must always be, as a matter of pohcy, some of the fact that the conducting of thatfishingmustfitin with the overall policy upon which the Australian Government, as the international representative, has agreed with within which the other countries. The Bill provides a framework for the emergence of self-government. The first step in that process, which I hope we will see commenced by is August of this year, wtil be a very significant one indeed. I believe that the elected representatives perof Norfolk Island will have the capacity to run their own affairs. Otherwise I should not have of pressed it upon the Government as fully as I It is to a very large degree an act of faith. I have great faith in the abUity of the elected repto resentatives, present or future, to undertake the running of the affairs of the island. We must wait and see. At the moment the Australian Government is preparing premises in some of the old buildings for a new Legislative Assembly and court. They will be new institutional buildings. They will be ready soon and, to some degree, will represent a contribution by the Australian Government to Norfolk Island in the establishment of its basic institutions. I hope that, when the Legislative Assembly is opened, this Parliament will recognise the fact that we have a new Parliament on Australian soil-that of Norfolk Island. A number of amendments have been proposed by the Opposition. I do not want to take up too much time in going through them; we do not have much time available. The Bill must proceed through its Committee stage tonight. I do not want to treat them with anything less than the respect that is their due. However, except here and there, they do not find much favour with the Government. For instance, the first relates to transferring to the Legislative Assembly the executive government of Norfolk Island and abolishing the Executive Council. The whole Bill is constructed on a basis that will ensure that the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island will follow the Westminster system, one that is well known in this country. It is well known to British descendants and well known to the people of Norfolk Island. It is the framework within which they have operated. Mr Innes-That is simply not true.",105
241,Mr ELLICOTT,NORFOLK ISLAND,And it is the framework within which my honourable friend opposite has operated in this Parliament. It is well understood. There must be an Executive. There must be people who can undertake the various responsibilities involved. Once we reach a situation in which responsibilities must be borne right across the board-and are not merely those of local government-w e must have people who are responsible for the various areas.,108

243,Mr INNES,AYES,"The Opposition is somewhat disturbed by the way in which the amendments to this Bill have been submitted. During the second reading debate last night I made reference to this matter and it must be stressed again that this procedure must be looked at. I accept that a number of the 117 amendments which were given to me the night before last may have been inconsequential but they have caused a lot of problems. There are better ways than this in which to handle amendments. It may well be that the drafting of a new Bill would have been a better proposition. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) has made reference to the Opposition's amendments, but our amendments were made well known to him. However, surely 117 amendments is a lot different from the number of Opposition amendments. I am sure that the Clerks of the House are perturbed about it. As I said last night, although Macphee, 1. M. Martyr, J.R. they have tried to find ways and means of dealing with the very difficult and compUcated task of handling all the amendments, it could never be said that the Opposition has not been cooperative in the attempt to avoid having the business of the Parliament held up to ridicule by the presentation of so many amendments. I ask the Minister: How did the members of Shack, P.D. Shipton, R. F. the Executive Council, who were no doubt privy to the discussions on the amendments, know about them is such detaU that the Norfolk Island Press was able to carry detaUs of the proposed amendments last weekend before the Clerks of the House or the Opposition had had access to the amendments? The Oppostion does not find objectionable the amendments to the clauses with which we are dealing. Very few of them are substantive amendments. They do not change the powers of the Legislative Assembly or of the Governor General although the Administrator's powers have been trimmed in very smaU fashion. The Opposition is pleased to see that the laws to be made by the Legislative Assembly are to be enactments rather than ordinances. This is more in keeping with the idea of self-government for Norfolk Island. The sUght changes in the definition of the 'Territory of Norfolk Island' are also welcome. Amendment No. 10 is important. The Oppostion has objected previously to the powers given to the Administrator under this Bill and has argued for a curtatiment of those powers. One of the most blatant examples of such excessive administrative power was the provision in clause 11 In Committee that meetings of the Executive Council could be called only by the Administrator. The Opposition is opposed to an executive councU, but if there is to be one",109
244,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Order! Before the honourable member proceeds I should acquaint him of the fact that there are no amendments before the Committee yet. The Minister has not moved them.

247,Mr INNES,AYES,"I hope that my time has not been curtailed because of this interruption. I had been saying that clause 11, which deals with meetings of the Executive Council, was an important clause and that the Opposition acknowledged the change to that clause effected by the amendments moved by the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott). We opposed that change in the first instance, but we see it now as at least a step in the right direction. The Opposition does not see the need for the Executive Council but it commends this amendment. 24, omit 'Ordinances', substitute One of the benefits of adjourning the debate on this Bill until this evening is that people 1,000 miles away are able to listen to some of the debate on this Bill which will affect their future. There is a misconception on the other side of the House that the Opposition would have Norfolk Island integrated into the structure of the mainland society. When one rationally compares Labor's proposals for Norfolk Island with those of the Government, there is no basis whatsoever for this misconception. It is not the Opposition but the Government which would clutch Norfolk Island closer to its bosom. This can be seen when the ledger of proposals is examined, and I propose to do that in speaking to the clauses of this Bill. The clauses with which we are now deahng refer to the structure of the island's administration and it cannot be read into any aspect of the Opposition's attitude to this matter that it has a pro-integration stance. It must be acknowledged by all that Sir John Nimmo's proposition that all Australian legislation should apply on Norfolk Island is a pro-integration stance. The Opposition does not adopt that position and it does not support that recommendation. The Opposition is calling only for general Australian legislation to apply-this was probably the major point made by the Minister-in the areas of taxation, social security, and conciliation and arbitration. The main body of Australian law would not apply. Norfolk Island would be free to make its own laws in a far more democratic way under the Opposition 's proposal. Under the Government's proposals, there would be far more overseeing and control by Austrahan Government and its representative. No law passed on Norfolk Island would be free of Australian veto and many of the laws would be subject to a second veto. The Administrator, an Australian Government official, would have far more arbitrary and unnecessary power under a Liberal Government than he would have under a Labor administration. It is the Liberal that refuses to loosen the ties sufficiently which bind Norfolk Island to Australia, except that this Bill it will allow the Council under certain circumstances to conduct meetings when only quorum is present. The Chairman dering what relevance my remarks have to the clauses we are considering, but I think that I ought to be allowed some leniency because of the complicated nature of the amendments and the way in which they were presented. The alternademocracy tive is for me to hold up the House for some concircles. siderable time by moving amendments which I had not proposed to move. Under a Labor government, Norfolk Island would have a Bill of Rights and the Adminstrafederal tor's powers would be curbed. Some might that a plan for Australian social security, taxation and industrial laws to apply on the island would mean the integration of Norfolk Island into Australia. I strongly deny this. Therightof Norfolk Island to be free and yet for its people to have an entitlement to Australian social security benefits is a rather clouded issue. To understand that issue requires the question relating to fundamental freedoms to be resolved. That is the situation on Norfolk Island. To argue that employers on Norfolk Island should have freedom to hire or fire their workers free from normal industrial laws and practice is something with which I will deal later. It abrogates therightsof workers to decent standards of industrial life. I have nothing further to say in regard to the clauses concerned. I have made reference to a few of them. Perhaps it will minimise the participation in the debate on further clauses. The Opposition does not oppose the clauses.",110
248,Mr BRYANT,AYES," I would like to attend briefly to the actual form of government as it is demonstrated in clauses 1 to 22.1 take it they are the clauses with which we are concerned at the moment. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott), in his earlier remarks, implied that the Executive Council was an essential feature of such a form of government. I suppose Australia has seven executive councils, counting our own. On the other hand, there are over 900 local government authorities-som e of them very big. The metropolitan cities of Australia are huge the compared with many States of the world. The municipalities of country areas and some of the provincial cities have very large populations. Some of the country municipalities are very extensive in both population and area. They administer great sums of money and large areas of country. They do not operate this way. In fact, when one joins a municipaUty one becomes an Party executive member. This applies to most municipalities in Victoria. So councUs have nine, in 12 or 15 members. I think there is the odd council with a few more than that. They operate in the a same way as a board of directors, a cabinet or may be wonanything of the sort. I think the Executive Council is an unecessary aberration in this situation. I am sure that is not served by the creation of inner I regard it as an optional extra which, if I were given the option, I would discard. That is the first point I wish to make. The other point is in regard to the general question of self government. I think it is a phoney term inside a system. What part of Australia has selfsay government? Some time ago honourable members talked very glibly about self government for the Northern Territory. Earlier, the Minister imphed that if people paid taxes and received social security payments then they were not in thefieldof self-government; they were not looking after themselves. Again, that is nonsense. There is nobody inside the whole of Austraha who has self-government if we mean total, absolute, unqualified autonomy or independence. I make passing reference to the powers of veto of the Governor General. That means that there is no self-government. The right to withhold assent for six months removes all vestige of self government. Therefore, it is a term which ought not be used in this context. What this Parliament is attempting tofindfor Norfolk Island is an area of government in which the people of Norfolk Island are able to adminisCabinet. ter the greatest possible areas of their own affairs to the advantage of the people of Norfolk Island, to the preservation of their standard of Uving the quality of hfe as they see it, and add to it the advantages of being a part of the Australian scene. There has been some play on the use the social security system. I understand that present there are 36 people on Norfolk Island who are drawing social security pensions and there are 117 people drawing repatriation or erans' affairs pensions of some type. That is a fair number of people in such a small community. suspect that as time goes by more Norfolk merry Islanders wtil spend their working Uves on mainland-as they must because is not big enough to contain the population-and then return to Norfolk Island and, of course, draw Austrahan social security pensions. The last thing one would want to do is damage the social security of the island. I refer to security not in the monetary sense but in the social sense. We have to find a formula which supplies to the people of Norfolk Island the security, standard of living and advantages the rest of the people on this continent and its outlying islands receive and still preserves rights as the islanders have had them and as hope to see them developed. That ought not be beyond the wit of man. Of course, the British have had some odd solutions to these problems in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. I not see any great difficulty. Perhaps this is a of legislation that should have been tossed to of the legislation committees so the members that committee could have brought a multitude of minds to bear on the problem. After all, what is the difference between the views of myself the Minister on this matter? We both say our objectives are the same. I would say his solution is unduly conservative and rather authoritarian. What is the Governor General? In this general context, the Governor General is the Minister. I wish he would give away this comparison about self-government and try to examine it more thoroughly in view of what it is aU about. I suppose we can conunue to give the people of Norfolk Island the assurance that we are aU seeking the same objective. I think the introduction of an Executive Council into a small body such as this for the government of a small area is a disbelief in the abUity of groups of people to come together for the solution of executive problems, which is not held out by our own experience. There are 12 or 13 members of the current Cabinet; there were 27 in the Labor Cabinet. I think there are about 20 in the New South Wales They sit around and make executive decisions. There is no reason why the Executive Council should not be able to make executive deand cisions or form some sub-committees or anything of that sort. I think the Executive Council, as it is interpreted here, is not reaUy a part of the Westof minster system or anything else. The executive at councds-the Privy CouncUs as they were called and the committees of the Privy CouncUs as they were instituted during the reign of Charles IIvetwere a way in which he was able to avoid responsibUity and pass it off to his friends while he I got on with the serious business of enjoying the Ufe. Many of these are historical solutions the to other problems which have no relevance to Norfolk Island Norfolk Island.",111
249,Mr DAWKINS,AYES,"The clauses we are debating at the moment are those which relate to the basic relationship between the mainland of Australia-the Commonwealth its of Australia-and Norfolk Island. I take the opportunity to clear up a couple of misconceptions which apparently were gained at least by the same honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) from as the remarks I made last night. The honourable member for Sturt indicated that he was confused the by what I had to say. I want briefly to try to we clarify the situation from my point of view. It seems to me that in the first instance we cannot deny-as far as I can gather, nobody seeks to deny-that Norfolk Island is a part of Australia. do If we take that as a basic assumption then it piece seems to me that in relation to Norfolk Island one Australia has a number of international obUof gations. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Elhcott) indicated a few moments ago the fact that in respect of the control of fishing off and Norfolk Island Australia does have international obligations. Therefore, the Minister is saying he cannot simply allow the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island to have unfettered power in that regard. He is saying that in reladon to fisheries, because there are intemauonal obhgadons, it is up to the Commonwealth of Australia to regulate fishing off Norfolk Island in exactly the same way as it regulates fishing off other parts of Australia. That is one instance where the Minister and I are on common ground. What I do assert is that there are several other areas in which Australia does have international obligations. For instance, if we take the question of welfare, which the Minister seems to beheve is an area which can develop over a number of years, it seems to me that the welfare of the people of Norfolk Island at this time is of major concern to the people of Australia. We do have international obligations to see that the people of Norfolk Island, whatever their circumstances, are able to live with a fair measure of dignity. Therefore, we do have obligations to ensure that the income security measures at Norfolk Island are at least as good as they are in other parts of Australia. That is another area in which I think we have to assert that Australia as a whole must insist that at a minimum standard of welfare should apply on Norfolk Island. We have international obligations as far as wages and other industrial relations matters are concerned. Therefore, it seems to me that the amendments which the Opposition will move later this evening are perfectly consistent with that attitude. What we are trying to do is to make appropriate arrangements for the regulation of industrial relations and other aspects of employment on Norfolk Island. That is because we do have international obligations as far as those matters are concerned. What I think we can conclude from this is that here are a number of areas in which, through international obligations, Australia as a whole must ensure that certain minimum standards obtain on Norfolk Island in exactly the same way as they obtain in the rest of Australia. Therefore, it goes without saying, I guess, that these are areas in which we cannot allow completely unfettered self-government. Having said that, what we can say is that is an enormous number of other areas in which we can provide very much more self-government than has been provided in the Government's Bill. I suppose the point is that, in relation to those areas in which we do have international obligations, we must have legislative and overriding safeguards to ensure that the conditions on Norfolk Island are no less than they are in Australia as a whole. But, apart from those areas, we should be saying to the people of Norfolk Island that they can do exactly as they please as long as they do not transgress basic conditions in Australia or embarrass Australia internationally. Therefore, what we are saying is that, having taken out those areas-the Minister for Home Affairs has already said thatfisheriesis one area which should be taken out; we are just saying that there are a couple of others which should be taken out also-w e ought to provide a very much larger measure of self-government than the Government is prepared to give the people of Norfolk Island in this respect. Perhaps one of my oversights last night was made with respect to the Northern Territory. What I should have gone on to explain was that, inadequate though arrangements in the Northern Territory are, at least in a number of respects the people of the Northern Territory have a larger measure of self-government than is proposed for Norfolk Island. I refer honourable members to the list of functions which was given to the Northern Territory as at 1 July 1978. When it is compared with the list of functions which it is proposed to give to the Norfolk Island least Legislative Assembly under Schedule 2 of the Bill, we find that a number of important areas which are included in the Northern Territory list are excluded from the Norfolk Island Ust. For instance, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has powers and duties in respect of the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice. Those powers do not appear in Schedule 2 of the Bill. A simUar situation exists in relation to the police, corporate affairs, prices and rent control, industrial safety, mining and minerals, public and private land, environmental protection, chtid, fantily and social welfare. In a number of areas the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has powers over and above those which are proposed for the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. So I think in that regard we can say that the Government has gone further in providing self-government in the Northern Territory tban it has gone with Norfolk Island. That is the simple point I was trying to make. But I do not there want any honourable member to think that, in my view, ifwe went as far with Norfolk Island as we have gone with the Northern Territory with self-government that would be far enough. We have not gone far enough in the Northern Territory. Even if we did extend those other functions to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, in my view that would not go far enough. It seems to me that we can go a lot further. We should be giving more functions to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and we should be doing away, in a whole range of areas, with the veto from Canberra which so circumscribes the theoretical self-government which the Government purports to be giving to Norfolk Island.",112
250,Mr ELLICOTT,AYES,"Listenin g to honourable members opposite, one would have thought that they had suddenly seen the light and had come to believe that places such as the Northern Territory should be given complete self-government; that all power should be given to the Northern Territory and that no power should be exercised from Canberra. If they ever return to the Treasury bench, I wonder what they wdl do. I imagine that they wdl start on the old process of centralisation and all power being held in Canberra. However, I remind the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) that the Northern Territory did have a deal of involvement in executive functions before it moved towards what is practically full self-government. Consistent with the Commonwealth's obligations to the Aboriginal people and consistent with the powers which they wish to exercise with respect to uranium, the Northern Territory has complete self-government. Any comparison between the States and Norfolk Island in relation to taxation is quite wrong because the States have the power to impose taxes and not be part of the uniform taxation system. The fact is that no State has yet been prepared to withdraw from the uniform taxation system. But the States have self-government within their area of power under the Constitution and they can impose taxes. That is the essence of self-government. In other words, the States could, if they wanted, not be as dependent on the Commonwealth as they are at the moment. But they have chosen their present situation. What we are wanting to do in respect of Norfolk Island is to enable the Norfolk Island people to raise their own taxes, to provide for their own services and to make their own decisions. That is what this Bill will ultimately do. A lot has been said about taxation. I remind honourable members that, from recollection, during their term of office amendments were made to the Income Tax Assessment Act. I believe that the drafting of legislation to make those amendments was commenced at the time of the previous coalition Government but, from recollection, that legislation was enacted during the Opposition's term of office. Those amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act had the result of removing the possibility of income tax evasion being carried out on Norfolk Island. The registration of companies is a source of revenue to Norfolk Island. But the fact is that if we look at the fees involved we find that the fees for last year totalled something like $250,000 and that the estimated fees for this year total about $140,000. That indicates that the use of the island for the purposes of company registration is falling away. That is partly because of the fact that gift duty and estate duty have been removed in the States and death duty has been removed in a number of States. Consequently, the relevance of Norfolk Island in a tax sense is disappearing; therefore, the use of Norfolk Island for those purposes is Ukely to diminish. In any event, what honourable members opposite are saying to Norfolk Island when they say 'do not let Norfolk Island be used as a tax haven' is that Norfolk Island should impose stamp duty. If the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, when it is set up, decides to impose a stamp duty, no doubt that will provide a source of revenue for the Island. But it will be up to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to decide whether to impose stamp duty. Of course, it will not be the duty of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to impose stamp duty, any more than it is the duty of the New South Wales Government or Queensland Government to impose stamp duty, or to raise or lower the rate of stamp duty. It will be a matter for the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to decide. It is true that, as the Bill is drafted, until full self-government is achieved, part of the function of raising taxes will rest with the Commonwealth Government. But part of that function will rest also with the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. Other matters have been raised. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) claimed that certain proposed amendments appeared in the Norfolk Island News or whatever he said the newspaper was called. They did not appear in such a paper. There was a summary of some discussion that the councillors had with me. In no sense did these amendments appear, on my information, in the Norfolk Island News. The amendments are designed to meet certain objections. They wtil enable the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to call its laws Acts if it wishes to. The amendments seek to delete the phrase 'Territory of the Commonwealth' which was considered offensive and substitute the phrase 'Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth'. This was something that I was quite happy to do. I and the Government agreed to this change. We agreed to give the Legislative Assembly powers to appoint a member to preside at the Executive Council if the Administrator is not present and to convene the Executive Council. Quite a large number of the amendments arise from the simple fact that we have given the Legislative Assembly the power to call its laws Acts. Therefore we seek to remove the word 'ordinance'. So, Mr Chairman, I have moved circulated amendments Nos. 2 to 41 in these terms: Clause 4, page 2, line 14, omit 'section 8', substitute 'this Act'. Clause 4, page 2, after the definition of 'Deputy President', insert the following definition: ' ""enactment"" means(a) a law (however described or endded) passed by the Legislative Assembly and assented to under this Act; (b) an Ordinance made by the Governor General under section 27 or in pursuance of section 68; or (c) an Ordinance continued in force by this Act;'.

Clause 5, page 3, lines 2 and 3, omit 'Territory of the Commonwealth', subsdtute 'Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth'. Clause 7, page 3, line 38, omit', whether before or after the giving of that advice', substitute 'in accordance with subsection (3)'. Clause 7, pages 3 and 4, following sub-clause: '(3) For the purposes may give the Administrator instructions in respect of advice tendered to the paragraph (l ) (b ) , and may give the Administrator instructions in respect of the referral to the Minister of any such advice.'. Clause 11, page S, after sub-clause (3), insert the following sub-clause: '(3A) If the Administrator is not present at a meeting of the Executive Council, the members of the Executive Council present shall elect one of their number to preside.'. Clause 11, page 5, after sub-clause (S), insert the following sub-clause: '(5A) The Administrator may convene a meeting of the Executive Council at any time, and shall convene a meeting whenever requested to do so by 3 or more members of the Executive Council.'.

251,Mr INNES,AYES," I did not propose to take up the time of the Committee any further; however, I am prompted to enter the debate because of the erroneous proposition that the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) put to the Committee. The fact is that business registrations increased over the last two years. It is wrong to say that the number is diminishing. 14, omit 'Ordinances', substitute Mr Ellicott-The fees have diminished.",115
252,Mr INNES,AYES,We are not talking about fees. We are talking about the fact that company registrations have in fact increased. I raised this matter last night. It is all right to talk about taxation evasion and to be pedantic about words. But that is not what we are talking about. The fact is that lurks and perks are available to individuals who want to exploit them. The Minister has not satisfied the Opposition that tax evasion is not still taking place. In 1978 I drew the attention of honourable members to the fact that $30m went in and out of Norfolk Island during one day. Mr Ellicott-You have made that point.,116
253,Mr INNES,AYES,I have made the point. I want to put to the CommitteeMr Ellicott-It doesn't improve itself by repetition.,116
254,Mr INNES,AYES,The point obviously has not sunk in as far as the Minister is concerned. The arrogance that you display in some areas,116
255,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Order ! The honourable member for Melbourne will address the Chair.,116
256,Mr INNES,AYES,"Well, Mr Chairman, would you kindly protect me from interjections made by the Minister?",116
257,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,The honourable member is entitled to address the Committee in silence. I ask honourable members to be silent.,116
258,Mr INNES,AYES,"We have heard the proposition that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly will be free and unfettered to make decisions. But that is not the case. Let us consider the relevance of the Minister's position at the present moment. Under clause 7 of the Bill the Minister has very much the same authority as he has now. He sits there like God and in the final analysis makes all the decisions about the place. He allows some procedure by which people may offer opinions. But whether these opinions are accepted or listened to is a horse of a different colour. If the people of Norfolk Island want an indication of the sorts of powers that are to be given to them they should look at what has happened in the Australian Capital Territory. Despite the fact that 63 per cent of the people of Canberra voted in favour of not changing the way in which Canberra is governed, the Minister has taken away from the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly the Territory's only major source of revenue, namely, almost $2m in poker machine revenue. The Minister has taken this money away from the Legislative Assembly and literally from the people of Canberra and he will determine the way in which it will be used. I do not think that anybody on Norfolk Island would get much confidence from that action. We also believe there is some degree of exercise of authority-the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) can look at the clock, but I have plenty of timeMr Haslem-Ge t on with it.",116
259,Mr INNES,AYES,"Well, we will be here all night if that is what the honourable member wants. But the fact is that the Minister used his authority even to the point of laying down the type of poker machines that would be bought in the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Ellicott- I take a point of order. I think the honourable member is not being relevant. My administration of the Australian Capital Territory surely is not under debate. The honourable member has not asked me a question about this subject. Let him ask me nexttimethe Parliament meets about the Austrahan Capital Territory poker machines.",116
260,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Order ! The Minister will resume his seat. The Chair accepts that the honourable member for Melbourne was drawing a comparison. There is no substance in the point of order. I ask the honourable member to address the Chair.,116
261,Mr INNES,AYES,"I am sorry that the Minister is so sensitive about this matter. I will ask him a question which I hope that he can answer without any embarrassment. Reference has been made to our friends from Norfolk Island. The chairman of the Council of Norfolk Island might take on board what I have said. He might compare the propositions that have been put by the Opposition and the Government. Also he might examine what I have said about the Minister's authority and how far it can go. Amendments agreed to. Clauses, as amended, agreed to. Clause 23-Disallowanc e of Ordinances by Governor General.",116

263,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"The question now is that clause 23, as amended, be agreed to.",117
264,Mr INNES,AYES,"This clause provides the Australian Government with a retrospective veto over any ordinance previously assented to by the Island's Administrator. It is an amazing clause. It invades and negates any supposed power devolution contained in the Bill. It provides an Australian veto over any ordinance passed by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. It is the sting in the tail of this legislation. The Norfolk Islanders and their representatives were assured by the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) on 8 May last that: The Government proposes that the Assembly have complete legislative power and executive control over (the matters listed in the schedules), Administrator in respect of education, immigration, customs services and fishing. There is no argument about that. That statement cannot be reconciled with the Bill. Clause 23 contradicts that statement. Either the Minister deUberately misled the people of Norfolk Island or the Bill is not as he required. Either the Bill is wrong or the Minister is wrong. Clause 23 specifically allows the Governor General to disallow or recommend amendments to any ordinance assented to by the Administrator during the previous six months. It does not allow the Governor General to disallow or to amend ordinances to which the Governor General has previously assented. This means that only ordinances concerned with Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 matters are subject to this retrospective veto. These are specifically the ordinances over which the Minister assured the islanders of 'complete legislative power and executive control'. In relation to Schedule 3 matters, where the Administrator already possesses what the Opposition beUeves to be a necessary veto, clause 23 is not so important. This is because the Administrator may only exercise his or her veto under ministerial instruction. It is unlikely that a Minister would allow assent to an ordinance, only to later decide that a mistake had been made and demand of the Governor General a disallowance or amendment. However, Clause 23 provides the only veto to ordinances concerning the list of matters that comprises Schedule 2. This veto is retrospective and therefore open to criticism. It is unnecessary. It appUes mainly to matters of only municipal concern. I has not been made clear because the Minister gave the people of Norfolk Island to understand that no such veto would exist. The Opposition caUs for the exclusion of clause 23 from the Bill. Labor believes that there is no need for a vice-regal veto of municipal matters, particularly when the only likely circumstance in which the Governor General would act in this way is under the advice of his Executive Council, that is, under Cabinet direction. The Minister might argue that this clause is merely the expression of the Regal prerogative to disallow BUls. That it is a formalism, and expected never to be used. Labor finds this justification empty. Australia and its territories are hamstrung by such vice-regal prerogatives. They are reUcs of a bygone age. The tide of history is surely with us in arguing for a more rational approach to democracy. The Labor Partyfindsthat the Minister has misled the people of Norfolk Island. We do not agree with his actions. We think that what he has done is wrong. I call on subject to a right of veto by the the Minister to explain to the Parliament, to Australia and to Norfolk Island why he did this. The Minister cannot sidestep this issue. It is printed in black and white in his speech delivered to the people of Norfolk Island on 8 May. We find that speech in the Hansard of 11 May. He promised complete legislative powers and Executive control. Yet the provisions of clause 23 do not conform with that statement.",117
265,Mr ELLICOTT,AYES,"The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) has tried to put me in the dock and convict me on words that came out of my own mouth. Of course, as the honourable member well knows and as honourable members opposite well know, a clause similar to this was inserted in the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act. A simUar provision is in the laws relating to the Capital Territory. In other words, it emphasises the fact that this Parliament has always reserved the power of the government of the day in the interests of the people. This Parhament has ultimate responsibility for the people of Norfolk Island. Let us not forget that point. This clause is merely an expression of that. It is very much a reserve power. It is most unlikely that it wdl ever be used. That is the basis upon which it is inserted in this Bdl. I can understand the Opposidon trying to curry favour with the people on Norfolk Island by creating this sort of mirage of giving them self-government in the one breath and hitting them with taxation, social service benefits and all the rest of it in the other breath. I can understand the Opposition saying that sort of thing, but the fact is that this provision is designed to give expression to an ordinary constitutional practice. My memory may be faulty, but I think that to some degree we have a similar provision in our own Constitution.",117
266,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AYES,Sectio n 64.,118
267,Mr ELLICOTT,AYES,"No , it is not in section 64. Section 59 of our own Constitution expresses the same idea. Needless to say, because we have become a Commonwealth in terms of the Statute of Westminster, section 59 of the Constitution has fallen into disuse. But that is not the relationship between this Parliament and the new Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. This Parhament will still have responsibility for the people of Norfolk Island.

Clause 27, page 11, lines 1-3, omit sub-clause (7), substitute the following sub-clause: 'Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the Governor General shall not make an Ordinance providing for the raising of revenues or for the expenditure of moneys out of the Public Account of Norfolk Island.'. 21 and 22, omit 'or disallows an Together these amendments have the effect of the disalremoving from the Governor General the power to make ordinances concerning the raising of revenues and the expenditure of public moneys. As the Bill currently stands, the Governormay introduce ordinances into the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. Provided that ordinance does not concern matters listed in arthe schedules, the Governor General may make the ordinance, notwithstanding any objections or dissent by the Legislative Assembly. For reasons of urgency and for any other special reasonthis whatever that might mean-the Governor the General may make an ordinance without conthe Legislative Assembly in any way. This power applies only to ordinances not concerning matters contained in Schedule 2 or Schedule 3. These powers to make ordinances without reference to the Legislative Assembly or in spite of the Assembly's objections allow the Governor General to make laws concerning the raising and expenditure of public moneys. In other words, despite the protestations of the Assembly, the Australian Government, acting through the Governor General, may raise a new tax on Norfolk Island. That is ironic in the face of the opposition. The Australian Government may even spend the public moneys of Norfolk Island. It is not good but nonetheless necessary that the Australian Government should have the power to make ordinances on the Island in spite of the wishes of the local elected representatives of the people. I repeat that that is not good but it is necessary. However, it is a wholly objectionable situation that these ordinances provide for the raising or spending of public moneys. It is completely unacceptable to the Opposition and, once again, it points to the hypocrisy of the Government because the Minister assured Norfolk Island that Australian taxation would not be extended to the island as is enshrined in the Bill. The Labor Party does not agree with that policy. But that is what the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr ElUcott) told Norfolk. He said that there would be no Austrahan taxation. On close inspection of the Bill we find that it contains all the power necessary for the Australian Government to raise taxes on the island. Has the Minister been caught out in another misconstruction? Perhaps he can explain that. It is abominable that the non-elected official, the Governor General, should have that power to raise taxes and to authorise expenditure on the island. It is all the more objectionable to many citizens of this country, considering the circumstances in which related powers were last used by the previous occupant of the vice-regal top hat. In November 1975 an historical anachronism dressed in morning suit interfered in a dispute over a money Bill between the two Houses of this Parliament. He interfered without the authority of the Government or ofhis advisers. Many eminent constitutional analysts have argued that that action was outside his prerogative. The erupting controversy ensured with almost complete certainty that such a course of action would never again be taken by the monarchy or its representatives. I do not want to take up thetimeof the Committee. I think I have made my point. I am saying that the Governor General must not be allowed to raise taxes in spite of the Legislative Assembly's opinions or to disburse public moneys against the Assembly's wishes. For the benefit of honourable members. I point out that the Opposition's amendments still allow the Governor General to introduce an ordinance deaUng with the raising and the expenditure of revenues.

The Governor General having introduced such an ordinance, the Legislative Assembly may see fit to pass it. But the prerogative should rest with the Legislative Assembly.",119
275,Mr ELLICOTT,ADJOURNMENT," I trust that it is understood by honourable members that what this Bill does is to provide for two legislative authorities, that is to say, the Legislative Assembly, through which most Bills will pass, and the Australian Government with which wtil rest the ultimate authority in relation to matters that do not stand within Schedules 2 and 3. The whole exercise of self-government, as I have already pointed out, is an exercise whereby all the funds necessary to provide the services will be raised within Norfolk Island. Therefore, the purpose of this measure has to be seen against that background. At the moment the Government has power to, and does, levy charges on the people of Norfolk Island; and it will continue to have that power. It is not imposing Australian taxation or extending it to Norfolk Island. That power is already there. The result of the Bill, of course, will diminish the power somewhat because the Government can raise levies only for those areas of responsibility which will fall outside Schedules 2 and 3. These provisions are designed quite simply to deal with an emergency situauon. An emergency situauon is simply where there are no funds to meet the pubhc services of the island. That is part of the ultimate responsibility of the Government because it will be one of the governing authorities of the island for the time being until there is a fuller measure of self-government. Those provisions are there to meet that purpose. Therefore, these amendments are opposed. Amendments negatived.",119

As I said earlier, most of these amendments relate to the fact that we have agreed that the Legislative Assembly should have the power to call its laws Acts. Therefore, the word 'ordinance', wherever it appears, has had to be removed. There are some other amendments. They are basically formal, except for one in particular, which states in part: Before tendering advice to the Governor General purposes of sub-section (1), the Minister shall give Executive Council the opportunity of furnishing to him and shall consider any comments so furnished. I recollect that clause 53 relates to the ment of a judge to Norfolk Island. That clause simply gives the Executive Council the right of consultauon before any judge is appointed.",120
278,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT,"The Oppostage. sition does not oppose the amendments. We agree that the amendment which has just been mentioned is a worthy amendment. We support it. Further to that, we do not object to any of the other amendments. Amendments agreed to. Clauses, as amended, agreed to. Proposed new clause 6 IA.",121
279,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT," I move: That the following new clause be inserted in the Bill: Page 19, after clause 61 insert the following new clause: '61A. (1) There shall be a Conciliation and Arbitration Commission of Norfolk Island, constituted by a member of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission designated by the President of the last-mentioned Commission. '(2) There shall be an Industrial Coun of Norfolk constituted by a Judge of the Australian Industrial Coun designated by the Chief Judge of the last-mentioned Coun. '(3) The Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, subject such exceptions, modifications and adaptations prescribed, applies in the Territory (a) in relation to(i) disputes (including threatened, impending able disputes) as to industrial matters relating dustries carried on in the Territory; and (ii) situations likely to give rise to such disputes; and (b) in relation to the registration of organisations Territory.'. The Opposition proposes to move that a further clause-claus e 61A-be added to the Bill. The clause is to establish a conciliation tration system for the island. It is absolutely necessary that such a system be established. It is imperative because the present lack of scrutiny over industrial relations allows the island's employers to rip off the employees to a shocking extent. At present companies and employers on silent. the island operate free from any controls in respect of sick leave, annual leave, long service leave and pay, superannuation, margins for overtime or unclean work, and termination of service. There is no workers' compensation. I understand that some proposition in relation to it has been canvassed, but whether or not that has reached fruition it seems to me from an examinfor the ation of some of the material I have at my the disposal that the situation is certainly not satiscomments factory. There is no unemployment benefit. There is no necessity for women to be paid the appointsame amount as men doing the same work. The administration on the island-that is, the Australian Public Service on the island-ha s progressed beyond this pre-industrial revolution It offers superannuation, workers' compensation and equal pay. Administration salaries are more than 90 per cent of those earned in any equivalent positions in Australia, with the bonus of being tax free. These discrepancies, which are a result of the actions of those people on the island who manage, own and control the business interests there, have led to considerable friction on the island between pubhc servants and their brothers and sisters in private employment. People on the island in private employment labour under more than just the burden of the absence of controls over their conditions. They also work for little more than a pittance. During my address at the second reading stage last night I said that there have been cases of workers receiving as little as $70 a week for 48 hours work. If one had listened last night to the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) one Island, would have thought that people were swimming across from Australia to grab hold of the jobs. A similar situation exists on Norfolk Island as perto tains in many areas of Australia. The fact is that as are unemployment, whether it be exported from by force of this sectionNorfolk Island to the mainland or from Victoria to Western Australia, has a hidden component. or probSocial disruption takes place because the young to inpeople either have to leave the island to go to the mainland to get unemployment benefit or endeavour to place themselves in the dole queue to in the get whatever might be available to them from this Government. It might be funny for the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) but it is not very funny for the young people who come and arbifrom the island.",121
280,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,I do not think that personal reflection is really necessary.,121
281,The CHAIRMAN,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Holt will resume his seat and remain,121
282,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Chairman,122
283,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT,I am prepared to stay here all night.,122
284,The CHAIRMAN,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Melbourne will address the clause.,122
285,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT,Perhaps I might be protected from interjections like that. I wdl proceed when honourable members opposite are ready.,122
286,The CHAIRMAN,ADJOURNMENT,The Chair has dealt with the honourable member for Holt. The honourable member for Melbourne wdl proceed.,122
287,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT,"They are asked to work for a mere pittance which, on the basis of a 48-hour week, works out at about $ 1.60 an hour. It is litde more than sweated labour. To add insult to injury, if they lose their job they are off the island. If they transfer from one job to another or if they leave the job, they have to pay the fare from there back to the mainland and then back to Norfolk Island. An honourable member opposite shakes his head, but I have evidence to show that that is the case. There is nothing an individual worker can do about it. He or she cannot go to a union because there are no unions on the island. Of course, the employers are not encouraging the unions to set up there and neither is the island council. Four of the councd members are in business and two of them are primary producers. It might well be that the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions could have a look at the situadon on the island and see what could be done, or at least see how that exploitadon might be brought to a halt. The worker does not have residency status, as I pointed out. He or she cannot object directly to the employer, for the reasons I have put to the Committee. The permit to enter or remain is issued only to visitors who can obtain employment. Honourable members on the other side of the Committee say blithely that people are there for a working holiday, but some of the people on the island who have spoken to me were not there for a working holiday; they were there because they could not get employment or they were trying to compete with others for employment. It seems to me that that is an anomaly that should not exist. There is no minimum wage. There are no leave provisions. There is no equal pay for women. There are no anti-discrimination provisions. As I have said, there is no workers' compensation. They ought to have some protection. Members of the Arbitradon Commission with whom I have spoken say that they would see it as a very positive step. Arising out of the Treadgold and Gates inquiry, who is going to set a minimum wage or determine whatever benefits do apply? Is it going to be sttil by grace and favour? Who is going to determine that? Is it gomg to be at the whim of the employer? UntU a few years ago the councU paid a $10 a week pension. It seems to me that something has to be done. The Minister is looking very anxious, but I have an obligation to the people who are exploited in that sense to ensure that the Opposition takes whatever steps it can to bring the present state of affairs to a halt. Our amendment goes to the point of establishing the appUcation of the system to apply to individuals, and to provide that people from the Arbitration Commission will visit the island for the purpose of conctiiating or arbitrating, if necessary, on the industrial issues of the island.",122
288,Mr ELLICOTT,ADJOURNMENT," The Government does not agree to this proposal. It again underlines what the Opposition wants to do with the island. It provided these sops in its amendments during the second reading debate, but then it offers Austrahan taxation and Australian social security benefits and now it wants to involve the Australian arbitration system. The Norfolk Island people have been running the island in accordance with their own customs in association with successive Australian governments since 1914 and, before that, more or less on their own with a governor since 1856. They know nothing of an arbitration system, let alone the Commonwealth ConcUiation and Arbitration Act 1904. They know nothing of the formation of unions. They know nothing of any of these things that go with an arbitration system. The fact is that the question of industrial relations on the island has yet to be worked out. The so-called oppression that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) talks about is not something that has been very evident to me on my visits to the island. The fact is that there is little unemployment on the island and those who are unemployed appear to get some assistance. But when the social welfare system is being worked out no doubt the question of those who might temporarily be in need because of unemployment will be considered in the context of that sort of system. No doubt, too, one of the things that needs to be looked at carefully over the period ahead is for any sign of exploitation of people who work on the island. Responsibility for this area, of course, will remain with the Government. No doubt it will be one of the functions of the Administrator in the future to keep a watchful eye on it. At this stage the Government could not contemplate extending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to Norfolk Island. We oppose the amendment.",122
289,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT, I do not want to take up the time of the Committee any further. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) continually misrepresents the Opposition's position on this matter. The taxation aspect to which he referred would not apply to the individuals who would need to be protected. A basic wage at least is needed. I can see somebody shaking his head but I intend to say this. A minimum wage needs to be determined by independent people and it ought to apply. This should not happen at the whim of the Minister or of the employers but it should be determined by somebody who is competent to take an independent position in relation to this matter. He should take into account the information that flowed from the Treadgold-Gate s inquiry. The Minister talked about the customs of the Pitcairners. The point has been made once again that they are assisted by their own people. The fact is that that no longer applies to the same extent. It may reach the point where the Government might wake up one day and commend the people who assist. People should have thenindependence so that they can go and shop or do what they want to do. That ought to be right. It should not be offered in a patronising way by the Government or by the Assembly on the Island. That ought to be the right of the people. I refer now to the formation of unions. The Minister raised the question of unemployment. Unemployment is exported to Australia. That is undeniably true. People come to Austraha because jobs are not available on the Island. The formation of unions seems to be the only way the Government can allow a system to prevail where those people who want to be organised can be organised to protect their own positions. They will not have to accept once again what is handed out to them by grace and favour. Proposed new clause negatived. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a whole.,123

This clause somewhat mystifies me. It implies that the Government httle faith in the judicial system which it is setting up on Norfolk. It implies that the Government has Utde faith in its current judicial arrangements for the island. It is normal practice that the head of government has the power to aUow pardons and remissions and, in this case, the head of Norfolk's government is the Australian Governor General. Normally that head of government would receive advice from the lower echelons of government. It does not seem to be provided in this case. Amendment 106 is also worthy of comment. It has the effect that an item may be deleted Schedule 2 and inserted into Schedule 3, but with the approval of the Legislative Assembly. This is acceptable to the Opposition.

Mr CLYDE CAMERON (10.57)-Within the last few days I have come into possession of certain documents which reveal a serious criminal offence against the Companies Act by certain union officials. In a letter that I have received from the President of the Austrahan Workers Union, Mr Charles Oliver, it is alleged that Squizzy Williams and Frank Mitchell have been guilty of harassing officers of the New South Wales Branch of the Union over their balance sheet, while at the same time being themselves party to what Mr Oliver describes as a form of corporate sharp practice involving the colossal sum of $317,000 of members' money. I ask leave to incorporate Mr Oliver's letter in Hansard. Leave granted. The letter read asfollowsTHE AUSTRALIAN WORKERS' UNION President: C.T.

Membership, and I believe the youngest official of the Union at that time, possibly at any ume-That you have played an active role in the and Parliamentarian is in evidence and beyond any question whatsoever. Like myself you have seen many changes in the Australian Workers' Union, some good, some bad, but with due regard to your experience and judgment I venture the view that never in your experience has the Union been so poorly served as it is today by its leading officials, which is my reason for writing this letter to you. You would be aware that The Australian Workers 'Union, State Registered, and the Austrahan Workers' Union, New South Wales branch has been under constant harrassment from our Fearless Leader and General Secretary, MitcheU, aided by President Williams and elements on the Executive Council. WhUe there are no unsurmountable hurdles to overcome, sample of the time wasting petty fogging rubbish indulged in by MitcheU is contained in the enclosed copy of a letter written by Branch Secretary Reg Mawbey to MitcheU in reply. A further sample of the administrative practices of the Notice leadership is found in the 1978 Balance Sheet presented to the 1979 Convention, pan of which I enclose. You would be aware that Rule 19 of the Constitution and General Rules refers to a Special Purposes Fund- I quote the (Hindmarsh) relevant pan of the Rule: Each Branch shall pay to the General Secretary one dollar from each contribution which shall be placed in The Special Purposes Fund which shall be used in the interest of the members as and when directed by the Executive Council. This Fund has been used to finance 'The Australian Workers' Union Finance Services Management Pty Limited'. Whatever can be said in favour of this venture, it has involved the Special Purpose Fund in a direct loss of $317,172.00. The most damaging feature of this transaction is the deficiency of Share Capital and Reserves amounting to $121,208.00. I am reliably informed that when this calamitous transaction was discussed by the Directors and Trustees, which is in effect the Executive Council, a suggestion was made by the Management that the total $317,172.00 could be written off-This proposal found no weight in favour. It was then proposed by the Management to transfer the Uability to share capital, thereby converting the liability into an asset in the accounts-This appears to me to border on a form of corporate sharp practice-Of one thing we can be certain the members who provide the funds will get no benefits.

As soon as possible informadon as to whether or not membership tickets described as AWU NSW General Branch are intended to be issued during the Union's ticket year I August 1979 to 31 July 1980. In reply to question one which reads: 1.

There were 158 Youths Tickets issued and there were 54 Complimentary Tickets (Federal) issued against Youths Tickets sold at $20. If you add the amounts appearing on the first line in each district you get a total of $ 188,660 for tickets issued. In addition 6,403 tickets were issued at $40. If you multiply 6,403 x $30 you get afigureof $ 192,090 plus $810 for 54 Youthstickets,total $ 192,900. If you add $188,660 and $192,900 you get a total of $381,560. There is an error of $440 because there were 22 Womens the tickets shown to be sold at $40 instead of $20. If you deduct $440 the grossfigurewUl total at $381,120. I am setting out a schedule hereunder for your of NSW Branch Memberinformation: Total tickets sold: Mens-12,577 = $377,3 10; Youths-158 = $2,370; Womens-72 = $ 1,440; Total-$381,120. Complimentary tickets issued: Mens-6,403 = $192,090; Y o u t h s - 54 = $8 10; Total-$ 192,900. Money received $188,660 plus complimentary tickets property issued $ 192,900 equals $381,560. This amount does not equal by $440. Because there were 22 Womensticketsshown to be sold in nomithe North West District at $40 instead of at $20. In respect to question 2 which reads: 2. DetaUs of the surplus of funds shown as being received on the sale of General Branch membership tickets which is approximately $326,000 and for which the Ticket Statement reveals no membership tickets having been issued. In answer to this question I set out hereunder a schedule of all amounts received: the short fall of approxiNSW Branch Membership Central District77-78 Ticket sales $165,500.00 Part payments $183,305.97 $348,805.97 Southern District77-78 Ticket sales $33,140.00 Part payments $52,564.97 $85,704.97 South Western District77-78 Ticket sales $39,360.00 Part payments $48,653.55 $88,013.55 Northern District77-78 Ticket sales $100,400.00 Pan payments $25,660.30 $126,060.30 North Western District77-78 Ticket sales $24,260.00 Pan payments $18,347.30 If you take the figures on the first line of each district you get a total of $362,660.00 which equals the sale of 9,014 Adults at $40.00 and 105 Youths at $20.00. The remainder of money $328,532.09 was received as part payments. I recollect when you were ried by the Executive Council you refened to the complexities of the New South Wales Branch Balance Sheet and the conglomeration of monies appearing in the Balance Sheet. The Balance Sheet is an honest submission on all the transactions of the State Union and Branch of the Federal Union in the State of New South Wales. The Conciliation and Arbitration information. The New South Wales Balance Sheet is not the only Balance Sheet that includes money for sale of State Union Tickets- a good example being the following Balance Sheet: AUSTRALIAN WORKERS' UNION QUEENSLAND Registered under the 'Industrial ConcUiation and Arbitration Act 1961-1976' as THE AUSTRALIAN WORKERS' UNION OF EMPLOYEES, QUEENSLAND There is no such Branch of The Australian Workers' Union appearing in Rule 37 of the Constitution and General Rules. If you peruse this Balance Sheet you will see where monies are included for sale of Tickets come within the Eligibility Rule of The Australian Workers' Union. These persons cannot vote in an Election conducted for Officers in the Organisation-the Steuart versus Oliver Case reported in 17 FLR 99 and AILR 21; 26IIBI clearly indicates this. In a test of Law this Balance Sheet may not conform to the requirements of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act 1904-1978. In reply to question 3, which reads: 3. DetaUs of the amount spent on the Canberra property which can be properly described as capital expenditure. The expenditure on the Canberra BuUding which includes a Loan of $ 193,100.00 from the Commonwealth Savings Bank and an amount of $6,900.00 paid from the Property Account totalling the amount of $200,000.00 was Capital expended on Air Conditioning equipment, Carpets, Sunscreen, Alterations, etc., to enhance the value of the propeny and make it more attractive. The best example I have seen of turning a Liability into an asset was the decision of a meeting of Directors of The Austrahan Workers' Union Finance Services Management Pty Limited, held on Thursday, 8th February 1979. This meeting after hearing a report from Mr TheU decided to invest an irrecoverable debt owed by this Company to the Special Purposes Fund of The Australian Workers' Union, in one dollar shares up to the value of $250,000.00 in Share Capital, which will show as an asset in the next Balance Sheet of this Company. In fact the Shares will be worthless, creating a fabricated imaginary asset for the purpose of deceiving people who are una ware of the true situation. Members of the Union who have part of the Union Contributions allocated to The Special Purposes Fund which in turn are used in subsidising a Company that they will never receive a dividend from. There is not one iota of Tangible material in this pur$42,607.30 ported asset. In fact what was done with this transaction would be equal to endeavouring to turn all wages paid by the Union which is a UabUity into an asset to falsify a balance sheet. This method was not used in increasing the asset of the Canberra Building. speaking to the resolution carIn answer to question four, which reads: '4. The names of Officers of the NSW Branch elected during or since the 1977 General Elections who nomiated for paid positions who are not now being paid from funds belonging to The Australian Workers' Union NSW Branch.'

As soon as possible information as to whether or not membership tickets described as AWU NSW General Branch are intended to be year 1st August 1979 to the 31st July, 1980.'

G. Mawbey, that the membership ticket in the NSW Branch have the words inserted thereon as follows'Australian Workers' Union NSW Branch Registered under the Trade Union Act 1881-1970 and the Industrial Arbitration Act 1940-1976.' similar in principle to the wording of the AWU Queensland Branch Membership Ticket and the West Australian Branch Membership Ticket, be accepted by this Executive Council.'

My understanding is that his comments must be restricted to what has been discussed during the course of the adjournment debate. by D. F. Austin, PublishMr Street-That is right.",131
299,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAYMENTS,"The honourable member is quite correct. I uphold the point of order. Mr Street- Mr Deputy Speaker, I require that the debate be extended so that I may reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh.",132
300,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAYMENTS,I call the Minister for Industrial Relations.,132
301,Mr STREET,PAYMENTS,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) has a very long experience in industrial relations and, indeed, union affairs generally. Tonight he has made very grave allegations, which, obviously, have serious implications. So far as my own Ministerial responsibility is concerned, I will ensure that those parts ofhis allegations that are within my area of responsibility are brought before the relevant authorities. I also noted that some of his comments could involve authorities in jurisdictions beyond my ministerial responsibility. I will examine Hansard carefully tomorrow to see whether I should refer those aspects of what he raised to people in other jurisdictions. I repeat that the honourable member has made allegations of the gravest kind. He also referred to the fact that some time ago, this Parhament legislated to require annual accounting of unions to their members, and the auditing of those accounts. For the information of the honourable member, for many months now a tripartite committee of the National Labour Consultative Council has been working on recommendations which wdl lead to the drafting of the regulations required by that legislation. Since the requisite regulations have not been completed, the legislation has not yet been proclaimed. The National Labour Consultative Tripartite Council has almost completed its work in this field. As soon as it has, and the necessary procedures have been followed, the regulations will be promulgated and the Act proclaimed-this on a date that will enable unions and industrial organisations generally, of both employers and employees, to comply with the new requirements of the Act. I realise that in this matter there has been stantial delay, but it is one that is extremely plex. It involves, in a very immediate way, the reporting of many organisations. The Government has been very conscious of the need to ensure that these complex regulations are drafted in the best way that will enable the legislation to operate in the way in which it was designed to operate. As I have said before, the legislation wdl be brought into operation as soon as possible, bearing in mind the complexities of the issues involved. In the meantime, as I have already indicated to the House, I will look most carefully at the remarks of the honourable member and see that they are brought to the attention of the people concerned.",132
302,Mr HOLDING,PAYMENTS,"I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am wondering whether you could take up a matter with Mr Speaker concerning the procedures of this House. This morning at Question Time Mr Speaker disallowed a question from this side of the House which was directed towards the operations of Associated Securities Ltd. On that occasion none of the directors was named, but because Mr Speaker felt that they were well-known public figures he disallowed the question. The point I am making",132
303,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAYMENTS,Mr M ill a r ) Order! I heard the honourable member for Melbourne Ports put this point earlier in the day. I think that he has overlooked the fact that Mr Speaker's ruling related to the naming of individuals in a question without notice. It was in that context that Mr Speaker's ruling applied. y,132
304,Mr HOLDING,PAYMENTS,"Wit h respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, it seemed to me- I want you to take up this matter with Mr Speaker for the guidance of all honourable members-that Mr Speaker would not allow such a question without notice even when directors were not mentioned by name. In the adjournment debate it was permissible, presumably, for the honourable member for Hindmarsh to name specifically, and raise serious allegations against trade union officials. If the Chair is saying that an issue relating to personal honesty cannot be raised in a question without notice but can be raised either in general debate or in the adjournment debate it is important, as a matter of general principle for the conduct of the House, that that aspect be clarified.",132
305,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAYMENTS,"The understanding of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, as he has just described it, is correct. That is consistent with the practice and procedures as set out , in the Standing Orders. The debate having subconcluded, the House stands adjourned until com- Tuesday, 1 May next at 2.15 p.m., unless Mr Speaker, or, in the absence from Australia of Mr Speaker, the Chairman of Committees, shall, by telegram or letter addressed to each member of the House, fix an alternative day or hour of meeting. House adjourned at 11.8 p.m. The following answers to questions South Africa: Nuclear Capability Mr Uren asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 21 February 1979: (1) Is he able to state what facilities associated with the production of nuclear energy and the production and processing of nuclear materials exist in South Africa. (2) If so, which of these facilities are subject to international safeguards and in each case what is the nature of the safeguards arrangements. (3) Is he also able to state which countries have supplied nuclear materials or technology to South Africa, and in each case what is the nature of the materials and technology supplied and what safeguards apply to their supply. (4) Whatresolutionsof the General Assembly or Security Council of the United Nations apply to the transfer of nuclear materials or technology between South Africa and member countries. (3) Has the Government made any assessment, or is it aware of any assessment of any other government, of the nuclear weapons capability of South Africa; if so, what are the results of any assessment. (6) What attitude has the Australian Government adopted regarding the transfer of nuclear material or technology between (a) South Africa and Australia and (b) South Africa and any other country.  member's question is as follows: (1) The following facilities associated with the production of nuclear energy and the production and processing of nuclear materials are known to exist in South Africa: Fourteen uranium mills One uranium enrichment pilot plant at Valindaba A nuclear research establishment at Pelindaba, which includes the Safari I research reactor Two nuclear power reactors under construction at Koeberg. (2) International safeguards are applied to the Safari I research reactor and to the two power reactors under construction at Koeberg. Uranium mills do not attract international safeguards. The safeguards for Safari I are provided for in the Safewhich guards Transfer Agreement among the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), South Africa and the United States of 26 July 1967 as amended on 20 June 1974 (IAEA document INFCIRC/98/Mod.I). This however agreement requires that all nuclear materials, equipment and facilities supplied to South Africa whenever they may be located in South Africa should not be used for any military purpose. The two Koeberg nuclear reactors are also subject ternational safeguards against military of explosive use under the terms of an agreement among the IAEA, France and South Africa of 5 January 1977 (IAEA document INFCIRC/244). This agreement also covers nuclear fuel supplied by France, any other facility based on FrenchGovernment supplied technology and all special fissionable and other nuclear material, including any subsequent generations thereof, produced in or by the use of the Koeberg facility or any other facility based on French-supplied technology. NA upon notice were circulated: (3) The countries on which I am able to supply information are the United States and France. The United States (Question No. 3212) supplied the Safari Iresearchreactor and its nuclear fuel. For details of the safeguards applying, see the answer to (2) above. France is supplying the Koebergreactors.The fuel for these will be South African and it is planned that it should be enriched in the United States and fabricated in France. For details of the safeguards applying, see answer to (2) above. Nuclear materials and technology supplied between states are normally the subject of agreements for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. (4) The following are references to recent resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly: Resolution 3324E(XXIX) of 1974 requested all Governments 'to cease all cooperation with South Africa in nuclear and other modern technological research, particularly research with military applicauons'. Resolution 3411G (XXX) of 1975 requests'that the Security Council call upon the Governments concerned to prohibit any of their institutions, agencies or companies, within their national jurisdiction, from deUvering to South Africa or placing at its disposal any equipment or fissionable material or technology that will enable the racist regime of South Africa to acquire nuclear-weapon capabUity'. Resolution 31/6D of 1976 contains simUar wording. Resolution 31/61 of 1976 demanded 'the cessation of any form of military and nuclear cooperation with the racist regime of South Africa'. Resolution 32/105F of 1977 requested the Security Council to call upon all States 'to end all transfer of nuclear equipment orfissionablematerial or technology to South Africa'; and 'to prohibit companies, institutions or agencies within their jurisdiction from any cooperation with South Africa, directly or through participation in companies registered in South Africa, in its mUitary build-up or nuclear development'. ' Resolution 33/183G of 1978 called upon 'all States which have not yet done so-in particular France, Federal Republic of Germany, Israel and the United States of America-to cease forthwith all collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa in the nuclear field and to take measures to prevent such collaboration by corporations, institutions and other bodies and individuals within their jurisdiction*. Noresolutionsof the Security Council have been adopted specifically apply to the quesuon of the transfer of nuclear materials or technology between South Africa and member countries. Security Council resolution 418 of 4 November 1977, which was adopted unanimously decided that 'all states will refrain from any cooperation with South Africa in the manufacture and development of by the United States nuclear weapons'. (5) Yes. I do not propose however to reveal the results of such assessments or of confidential exchanges which we have to inhad with other governments on this question. (6) The Government is opposed to the transfer of nuclear material or technology between Australia and South Africa. The Communique of the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Meeting, in which Australia participated, urged, that inter alia any Government which collaborates with South Africa in the development of its nuclear industry should desist from doing so. Australia has also supported United Nations resolutions along these Unes. Australian Passports Mr Jull asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1979: (1) How many types of passports are issued in Australia. (2) For what purpose is each category used. (3) With the exception of the standard passport, how many passpons in each other category are currently valid. (4) Do any Australian passpons allow the holder exemption from normal Immigration and Customs procedures on re-entry into Australia. (5) Do any foreign passports allow the holder similar exemption on entry to Australia.  member's question is as follows: (1) There are three types ordinary, diplomatic and official. (2) The purpose of all three passpons is to identify the bearer and to request other countries to provide free passage, protection and assistance. Additionally, diplomatic and official passports define the status of the bearer. (3) Unlike ordinary passports which have a set period of validity, diplomatic and official passpons are issued to enable the bearer to carry out a particular mission. They are therefore issued for varying periods of validity. For this reason, it would be difficult to determine the number currently valid. I can say, however, that 730 diplomatic and 3,700 official passports were issued during 1978 (4) No. (3) No foreign passpon of itself gives exemption from Australian Immigration and Customs procedures.
