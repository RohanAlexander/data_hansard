1,Mr SALMON,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"On behalf of a number of members of the Chew ton Rifle Club, who are anxious to take part in the annual competitions under the auspices of the Victorian Rifle Association, I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether a supply of up-to-date rifles, or new barrels, will be to hand in sufficient time to enable them, to be used upon the occasion in question?",14
2,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"Earlier in the day, the honourable member was good enough to intimate to me his intention to ask this question. In reply, I may inform him that 19,000 Martini-Enfield rifles have been ordered. These would have been to hand in sufficient time to enable them to be used at the approaching Victorian Rifle Association Competitions, but, consequent upon some alterations which it was found necessary to make, their delivery has been delayed, so that I do not think that their arrival can be expected earlier than November. With regard to the supply of new rifle barrels, I may say that when the shortage was discovered an unsuccessful effort was made to obtain a stock from India. There are only 100 new barrels in this State, and 1,000 have been applied for. Sixteen hundred have been ordered. The first 200 of these will be delivered in England during the current month, and' the residue in October. They should begin to arrive in Australia in'' October. SECRET DRUGS, CURES,-AND FOODS: MR. BEALE'S REPORT.",14
3,Mr LIDDELL,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, in pursuance of his promise of 29th August last, and in view of the danger to be apprehended from the circulation of the report of Mr. Beale upon secret drugs, he has yet procured the opinion of a medical man upon that report?",14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"I have obtained the opinion of the Crown Law officers as to what course of action should be taken in regard to the distribution of Mr Beale's report, but I do not think it would be wise to lay that opinion upon the table of the House just now, because it relates to a matter which affects not only the public generally, but also members of Parliament. That is - the reason why I do not wish to give the information which, the honourable member desires. I have not yet obtained the opinion of a medical officer upon the effect which the circulation of the document might have upon the public, from the stand-point from which the honourable member regards the matter.",14
5,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,Is the Acting Prime Minister withholding its circulation in the meantime ?,15
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"I am withholding its circulation for a time. I do not know why honourable members opposite are so anxious for the report to be withheld from the public, but, in view of .certain facts, I am withholding it. TARIFF. CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES-ALLEGE D ANOMALIES.",15
7,Mr ATKINSON,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister is it a fact, as stated in the Argus this morning, that the congratulatory message received by the honourable the Acting Prime Minister from Moojebing was a "" fake,"" and, if so, does he consider it a fair and' proper thing to attempt to bolster up the Tariff with faked messages of approval ?",15
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"In reply to the honourable member, I may say that I know nothing about this matter further than that I received the telegram in question. That fact, in itself, was quite sufficient to warrant me in supplying the information which I did -"" - RAILWAY SURVEY ACT.",15
9,Mr TILLEY BROWN,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he is in a position to make a statement to the House regarding the intentions of the Government in respect of the Tariff schedule? I learn from the newspapers that it is admitted by Ministers that anomalies in the Tariff will have to be rectified, and, in view of the unrest permeating the community, I ask the honourable gentleman to make a statement as to Ministerial intentions, if he can adopt that course without violating parliamentary etiquette?",15
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,"I do not intend to revise the Tariff before we proceed with its consideration. ' When we reach the items of the schedule, I shall give honourable members the"" fullest information so that they may know exactly what .we intend to do.",15
11,Mr TILLEY BROWN,VICTORIAN RIFLE ASSOCIATION,The Acting Prime Minister knows perfectly well that he cannot carry some of the items. NA OFFICERS.,15
12,Mr EWING,ACTIVE SERVICE BY MILITARY,"Wit h reference to the reply which was given by me to a question asked by the right honourable member for East Sydney on 2 ist August last, I am informed that the record of Brigadier General Gordon's war services as contained in the Imperial Army list is not correct, and I desire that the following be substituted for the reply givenBrigadier-General Gordon, C.B., Commandant, Commonwealth Military Forces of New South VVales. Present at Karee Siding, Vereeniging, Johannesburg, Middleburg, Wonderfontein, .and several smaller engagements; was in command of column 1,600 strong, all mounted,- in advance - from Bloemfontein to Kroonstad; engagements near Bra'ndford and east of Smaldecl ,* accompanied Generals French and Hutton on the marchfrom Kroonstad to Pretoria. BRUNSWICK POST-OFFICE.",15
13,Mr LIDDELL,ACTIVE SERVICE BY MILITARY,I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has any objection to lay upon the.table of the House the papers relating to the construction of the Brunswick post-office?,15

15,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he has received any reply from the Government of South Australia .to his communication in respect of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survev Act?,15
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the right honourable member will be good enough to give notice of his question,' I will be prepared to lay upon the table of the House tomorrow, the whole of the papers relating to this matter. As far as my memory serves me, the necessary papers have been forwarded to the South Australian Government, but so far we have received no reply to our. communication. It may be that the whole of the papers connected with the matter were not forwarded to the South Australian Government, but I think be that they were, and I do not think that any reply has been forthcoming. PUBLIC WORKS: NEW SOUTH",15
17,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Acting Piime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the Commonwealth is paying the State of New South Wales a 6 per cent, commission on all or any payments made by it on the Commonwealth's account for public works carried on in that Stale? 2. Whether it is a fact that the Commonwealth has a permanent officer in the State of New South Wales who compiles a statement of the amounts required for such payments and forwards it to Melbourne? 3. Whether there is any reason why the officer in question could not be used as a medium through whom such payments could be made, so as to save the payment of this high commission? 4. What is the total amount of the commission paid to the New South Wales Government for 1906 and 1907?",16
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In reply to the honourable member I desire to state1 to 3. The honourable rr ember is under a misapprehension. The Commission paid to the New South Wales Public Works Department is not merely for paying accounts, but for expenses of supervision, travelling, advertising, plans, & c , in connection with Commonwealth works carried out by that Department throughout the whole of the State. The permanent officer referred to does not compile the statement of amounts due to the State, and could not perform the services for which the Commissioners pay without the creation of a large Commonwealth works staff, operating over the State, to assist him. 4. The commission paid to the Government of New South Wales during the financial years 1905-6 and 1906-7 is19056 ... ... 2,624 2 9 19067 ... ... 1,816 6 3 REFUND OF DUTIES-MANUFACTUR E OF WIRE NETTING.

Whether in such cases duties have not been refunded on claims being pressed by importers?",16
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In . reply Inspector-General to the honourable member's questions1. No duties have been collected under authority of the Executive. The refund of any duty colwith lected under resolution must depend upon the action of the Legislature. 2. No such refund has been made-no r will any made till Parliament has settled the question.,16
20,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,""" the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. What is the estimated requirement of the Commonwealth (annually) of rabbit proof netWALES. ting? 2. What are the number of manufactories for the manufacture of wire netting within the Commonwealth ' 3. What is the present output of these manufactories ? 4. Has he any reliable information that these manufactories are at present able to supply the Australian demand, if not so, then in the near future? 5. Will he obtain guarantees from these manu : facturers that, in the event of the proposed duly being approved by Parliament, they will not increase the price of netting to the consumer ?",16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In reply to the honourable gentleman's questions, I beg to stateThe importations of wire netting for three years ended 1906 were1904, 3,287 miles, value ^123,252. 1905, 8,853 ff-iles, value ^331,935. 1906, 13,855 miles, value ^519,508. So far as is known, there is only one factory, Messrs. Lysaght Bros., in New South Wales. The output cannot be stated, but it is understood that at"" present the factory is capable of turning out 200 miles a week. In three months it would be able to do ^00 miles a week, and next year 600 miles a week, which it was calculated would meet the requirements of Australia. Messrs. Lysaght Bros, are prepared to enter into an undertaking not to increase prices as the result of the increased duty. MILITARY ENGINEER. £ »- d . Mr Bruce SMITH asked the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Can he say for what reason the salary of a military officer, spoken of as a ""Militar y TARIFF. Engineer,"" has been placed on the Estimates of another Department than his own ? 2. Has this officer anything to do with the Military Department? Mr Glynn",16
22,Mr EWING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w 1. The Department of Home Affairs carries out certain rr.ilitary works for the Department f not subsequently imof Defence. 2. The Assistant Military Engineer proposed to be employed will be attached to the staff of the Department of Home Affairs to assist the of Works, who is also Consulting Military Engineer, in preparing technical designs of fortifications, it being considered that the amount of fortification work connected the proposed re-arrangement of coast defences will be such as to render the assistance necessary. INFLUX OF ORIENTALSNETHERLANDS-INDIA TRADE.",16
23,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Acting Minister of External Affairs,. upon notice I. Whether, in view of the influx of Japanese and other Orientals into Java, the Commonwealth's most populous neighbour, and of the possibilities of increased trade with the islands of the Netherland Indies, he could arrange to have in Batavia a representative of the Commonwealth, who would notify Australians of trade opportunities and national movements? 2. Whether the Commonwealth Government could appoint such a representative under its power of authority in ""external affairs "" without the previous sanction of the British Government ? 3. Whether all present communications with the Javanese authorities do not have to proceed through the cumbrous and distant channels of the British Colonial Office and British Foreign Office ? 4. When did he receive the last communications from the British representative in Java as to the .influx of. Japanese and other Orientals; and are these confidential, or can they be placed in the Library for perusal by honourable members?",17
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In reply to the honourable gentleman's questions, I beg to state1. The matter will be considered. 2. It is not thought that any difficulty on point would arise. 3. Hitherto all communications that it has been necessary to make to the Javanese authorities have concerned matters of minor importance, and have been conducted through, the Consul General for the Netherlands in Melbourne. 4. No communications on this subject have been received. TASMANIAN MAILS. Mr KING O'MALLEY asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is he aware that when the Union Steamship Company accepted the contract to carry the Tasmanian mails, it - agreed to put the steamer Oonah in the place of the Florarunning between Burnie (Tasmania) and Melbourne-earl y in the present year? 2. As the last quarter of the year is now approaching, will he look into the matter with a view to seeing that the company carries out its agreement with reference to the Oonah ?",17
25,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answers to the - honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. I am not aware that the Union Steam-ship Company agreed to replace the Flora by the Oonah early in the present year. The contract provides that replacement of the Flora by the Oonah or other approved steam-ship shall take place not later than the 31st December next. 2. The company has been communicated with, and states that the obligation of the contract has been kept in view, and that it is hoped the re-arrangement of the service in accordance with the terms of the contract will be effected at a much earlier date than that specified. NAVAL SUBSIDY.",17
26,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeReferring to the negotiations regarding the continuance of the Naval subsidy of ^200,000 per annum-Is there anv correspondence supplementary to the papers ordered by the Senate to be printed on 10th October, 1906, and, if so, will he lay the same upon the table of this House ?",17
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There has been no further correspondence. CHILD MORTALITY, NEW SOUTH WALES. - Mr SALMON asked the Minister representing the' Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether he has read the statement contained in the petition presented on Wednesday last from the members of the Child Study Association of Australasia that "" N e w South Wales loses 4,800 under one year of age annually, and 16,000 children under six years of age every year, and of those who survive 37 per cent, are defectives, degenerates, and imbeciles""; and if he can say whether these alarming statements this are correct; and, if so, to what cause are they attributable; and, if not correct, will he cause the statement to be contradicted?",17
28,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows : My honourable colleague the Minister of Home Affairs states that he has not seen the petition referred to, and that he has asked the Commonwealth Statistician to report as ""to the statements therein mentioned in the honourable' member's question. The report has been obtained and statesThe deaths in New South Wales of children under one year of age have never been as high as 4,800. The average annual number of deaths under one year in that State for quinquennial periods from 1871 to 1905 was as followsPeriod. Average annual number of deaths.

Deaths under six years cannot be given, ""as statisticiallv the grouping taken is "" under 1,"" "" 1 and under 5 years,"" n five years and under 10,"" & c , &c.

Probably the 37 per cent, was intended to be 0.37 per cent., or 37 in 10,000. Commonwealth Statistician.",17
29,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As a question of order, sir, I should like to have your ""ruling as'to what should be done with a petition received by this House, .and certified to by an honourable member, containing alarming statements, which are manifestly incorrect.",18
30,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The certificate of any honourable member to a petition which he presents, is simply his certificate to the fact that a certain number of signatures are appended to it, that it is respectfully worded, and that it contains a request. An honourable member's certificate goes no further than. that. It does not touch the accuracy of statements contained in the petition, nor is this House in any way responsible for the statements contained in any petition presented to it. I believe that the petition to which the honourable member refers has not been printed. We accept no responsibility for the accuracy of any statement which it contains.",18
31,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Shoul d I be in order, sir, in moving that the petition be erased from the records'of the House?",18
32,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The only record in relation to the petition is that it was received. If the honourable member desires that that record should be erased, he can give notice of motion to that effect; but, of course, he would have to obtain the support of the prescribed number of honourable members for such a motion.",18
33,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not the petition as read recorded in Hansard ?,18

36,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Fawkner) [3-i9>When progress Was reported on Friday afternoon, I was directing attention to the great need that Australia has for immigration. Honourable members will realise clearly that as the Australians are perhaps the greatest producing people in the world, they must be fully occupied at the present time; and as we hope to create extra work for our people through the instrumentality of the Tariff, and a proper system of pro tection, I feel sure that that extra work cannot be done unless we have extra hands to do it. This question of immigration is the most important one that Australia has to solve. I have received letters from all parts of the continent pointing out the great scarcity of workmen. I should like to quote from a letter that has been published in a' newspaper upon this question. It is signed by Messrs. Sargood Brothers, who, in addition to being large importers, are now, I am glad to say, doing a great deal of manufacturing work locally. The gist of the letter is as followsOur experience during the last twelve months is that we cannot obtain sufficient labour to meet the demand. At present we have a large number of machines idle. We have consequently advertised and used every' endeavour to obtain the necessary labour to keep all our machines going, but without success, owing to the scarcity of skilled workers. We are not alone in this respect, and our statement can be verified by many other manufacturers in this branch of the trade.",18
37,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What branch of the trade is referred to?,19
38,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The textile branch of manufactures.,19
39,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It relates to the making up of clothing.,19
40,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That - is so. think the statement. I have read emphasizes my contention that there is at present a great scarcity of labour. If we are going to encourage, as I hope we shall, the expansion of our industries, where are we to obtain the necessary labour ? That is a point that deserves the most earnest consideration of the Government. If we are to stimulate the growth of manufactures, I am sure it will be our desire to do so in a whole-heaited manner, and, therefore, the labour phase of the question is one that we cannot afford to overlook. A great opportunity to secure an increased population was missed a few years ago when General Booth came to Australia with the object of arranging to carry out a great colonizing scheme which he had in hand. We thought at the time that he would possibly introduce into Australia a lot of the riff-raff of Europe, and, naturally, we were opposed to such a class of immigration. Time has shown, however, that he had something very different in view. I propose to read a short extract from an interview which a representative of the Herald had with General Booth, and which was published ort 29th July last. In that interview, General Booth is reported to have said I am now going to turn my eyes towards Canada. The report continuesSpeaking of Canadian emigration, he said that after 22,802 emigrants Had Been sent over to the Dominion by the Salvation Army, appeals poured in from every corner, saying "" Send us more people of the same character, and settle the in under the same conditions."" Then, again, a few days ago, we saw the following cablegram in the daily newspapers^In pursuance of its project, the "" Army "" will buy ten townships in the province of Ontario, where it is proposed to settle the immigrants from Great Britain. Trie purchase of the land is conditional upon its approval by a joint commission consisting of - representatives of vation Army and the Canadian Government. There is no doubt that the Salvation Army and similar bodies are valuable adjuncts the carrying out of proper immigration proposals, and if another opportunity securing the co-operation of the Army in such a scheme should present itself, we should not hastily decide to ignore it. Mr. Rider Haggard, some little time ago, was commissioned by the British Government to inquire into the settlement of immigrants in Canada and the United States, I and I propose to read one or two salient passages from his reportBy this fashionThat is by empowering some organization, be it the Salvation Army, or any other well-established and approved charitable or religious institution, to administer the loans and settlements under proper Government authoritythe cost of local official direction, which would, I believe, prove almost fatal to the scheme as a business proposition, may be obviated. This important preliminary step would be carried out for us for practically nothing by the Salvation Army. They attend to the settlement of immigrants who come out under their auspices, and look after them perhaps even better than the Government could hope to do. Mr Haggard went on to sayI , who have seen, know the truth in Canada, where, week' by week, they behold this same Salvation Army disembarking its quota of emigrants, and taking them, thousand after thousand, without scandal or hitch of any kind, every man to the situation that has been found for him. In a report on the same subject the writer saysI would deal in support of our contention with only one of their colonies, viz., Fort Amity. This is situated 257 miles from Denver City, Colorado. It is on the main line of the Santa Fe railway, and has a dep6t, &c. The land was bought from the Amitv Land and Irrigation Company. The amount allotted to each colonist - is 20 acres, every purchaser being allowed to make his own choice. The price of the land, without improvement, was £10 and ,£1.5. Honourable members will observe that the Army authorities did not hesitate to buy land at a fair price, and it must not be forgotten that the land in question had to the irrigated, since the'rainfall of the district was insufficient. It would seem that the price of land in Canada is really higher than it is in Australia, and, therefore, I hold that we should not be afraid Ihe Salto take action so long as we have satisfactory organization and management. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does the honorto able member think that the price mentioned by him as having been paid for the land of was $10 and $15 instead of ^10 and",19
41,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The report states that the price was £ 1 0 and £ 1 5 .,20
42,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Was that the price per acre or per block?,20
43,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is a very pertinent question. It may be that Mr Haggard was referring to the price of each block, and not to the price per acre. We have in Australia vast areas of Crown lands which by means of irrigation schemes could be devoted to closer settlement. Land so treated could be subdivided into 20-acre blocks, and would provide for the settlement of a very large population amid comfortable surroundings.",20
44,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Where is there such land in ""Victoria?",20
45,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There are frontages to the Murray from Swan Hill downwards.,20
46,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The land cannot be of any value, since it has not been mopped up.",20
47,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That seems an unfair suggestion to make. per cent, of the land of Australia remains unalienated. Is it reasonable to .assume that the whole of that area is valueless ? '",20
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Whic h the honourable member prefer to possess, that which is locked up, or that which is mistakes. not?",20
49,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I should naturally prefer to possess the land already aliennow ated ; but the question put by the honourable member is a most extraordinary one.,20
50,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not, since I assert that the good land is already locked up.",20
51,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Undoubtedl y the pick of the land has already been taken up.,20
52,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Who , doss the honourable member suggest, should carry out irrigation works ?",20
53,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In Canada and the United States the Government construct the head works for the conservation of water, and in the case of the Salvation Armytion colonies the officials of that organization supervise the distribution of the water. our men. Each settler has to pay for his. supply.",20
54,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why is that not done in Victoria ?,20
55,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It should be done. As showing the progress made, the total equity of redemption for thirty-two Britisher colonists amounts to .£7,450, and' the point that must be considered. total value of land, live stock, im- £ provements, & c , belonging to colonists amounts to some £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 That shows that the question can be, and [ro6] has been, tackled in a business-like manner. All we are doing is to talk year after year about immigration, which, I admit, is a grand platform word. Nothing rouses an audience more than the mention of "" immigration "" or "" irrigation,"" and yet we do not seem to get any further forward. I should like to see the Government take really practical steps in this direction, leaving the lockedup lands to be dealt with, as they are being dealt with now, by the States. The Government should launch out, and see if they cannot get some organization to assist in ""the work. I have no particular fancy for the Salvation Army, except that it could follow up the good work that it has done elsewhere. As a business man, I consider that it is always as well to see what people are doing somewhere else, and then to follow them and obtain the value of their expeMore than 93 rience. Then we can do the work in the most up-to-date fashion adopted in other parts of the world.",20
56,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And avoid their would mistakes.,20
57,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And avoid their That is the way in which we can succeed at the least possible cost. I should like to see some practical step taken on this question of immigration - We have talked about it long enough. It is nonsense to propose to create a great amount of extra work when we have not the hands to do the work that is now offering in this country.,20
58,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The trouble is the dual control.,20
59,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The dual control the is of course a very great trouble. I am very glad that the Government have provided, for this year at any rate, for the payment of the Naval Subsidy of £200,00 0 to the British Government for the protecafforded us by the British Fleet 1 and the facilities offered for training Opportunity is given for 500 Australians to be trained as seamen. Looking at the question from a mere bargaining point of view, Australia has-made a very good bargain"", but that point of view is about the last which any good ought to take. Still it is a viewThe 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 is money very well spent. We the must make provision of some sort for our. . local defence, but in that direction we shall have to proceed very slowly. It must be a long while before we can do the blue water work ourselves. Meanwhile, if we can get the British Navy to do it for us at the small cost of £200,000 a year, we ought to look at the arrangement a great many times be/fore we cancel it. agreement seems an excellent one. I do not .like it to be said that Australia is not doing her part. Statements of that kind always seem to be seized upon, I will not say by our enemies, but at any rate by those who are not friendly to us on the other side of the world, and are made a great deal more of than those who originate them expect. I notice a sneer at Australia in the last edition of the London Punch to hand. With regard to the launching of the Bellero-plion, a fine new British man-of-war, Punch states that the Australians have this time excelled themselves in generosity by sending a. bott le of Australian wine to smash on the bows of the ship. Of course, that is a very good joke, but when one is away from one's country, travelling in England, as I do sometimes that sort of joke hurts a i good deal, and I do not like it. I always reply that Australia has done all that she has been asked to do. The naval agreement was drawn up by' Mr Chamberlain, acting for Great Britain, and Mr now Sir Edmund, Barton, on behalf of Australia. No doubt they had the whole circumstances of the case and all possible information before them, and came to an honourable agreement. It was put before the Australian Parliament and ratified, and has been carried out to the letter. It is entirely wrong to blame Australia for not doing her part, because she is doing, first of all, all that she was asked to do, and, in the second' place, far more than any other dependency of the Empire. Yet it is almost impossible to persuade anybody in the old country that Australia is.doing more than Canada in the defenos of the Empire. am. very anxious to see Australia make a start in naval defence in the form of submarines and torpedo boats^ so that we may eventually take a self-respecting and; do our own fighting. Still', it must be a good many years before we can expect to take the seas in anything like a respectable way. T wish to make it absolutely clear that it is to assist in the great work of the defence of the Empire that I desire to see the naval agreement continued, and also to see Australia make a beginning with her .navy' and naval defence. That will be in the interests of the great scheme of the naval defence of the Empire. It must be Mr Fairbairn. in the interests of the' Empire as a whole for us to have good coaling stations, well defended, and a fleet of torpedo boats and submarines capable of dealing with any chance cruiser that may come along. For The the reasons I have stated I am pleased that the agreement with the British Government is not to be hastily cancelled. I desire to refer shortly to the question of the taking over of the States debts. One remark made by the honourable member for Parkes in that connection last week greatly impressed me. He very ably brought out the fact that States debts to the extent of £80,000,000 have to be converted within the next ten years, and showed that the cost of conversion at present prices-the loans being at par, and having to be converted at a very much lower price-woul d mean, on a 3 per cent, basis, a loss to us of about £18,000,000. I think that is a little more than will have to be paid, because, fortunately, those loans are nearly all at a higher rate than 3 per cent. Therefore, it is not likely that we shall 'have to pay such a large sum as £18,000,000 for their conversion, even if the money market does not improve. Still, from that point of view alone, the question is one which the Commonwealth Government ought to take seriously in hand, and look straight in the face, because those loans are maturing, and if the money market remains as it is now,' I can assure honourable members, as one having a good deal to do with financial matters, that it will be almost impossible to convert them at anything short of a disastrous rate. The question ought to the looked at very carefully. We have a considerable time in front of us yet. What we should do is to take time by the forelock, so that, when the due date arrives, it will not be necessary for us to I go cap in hand to the money-lenders, and ask them to renew the loans on terms disastrous to Australia. With the exercise of forethought, I feel sure that the loans position, can be renewed on fairly advantageous terms. I a the case of any future loans I hope we shall adopt the system which is now being adopted by the Victorian Government, of making the stock mature at short dates, but retaining the option to redeem it either then or-at any later period which may suit the Government. The public have taken up those loans very well at the same price as debentures that mature at a fixed date. The system has the advantage - that the Government can choose the time when they will repay the advances. That is a point which I emphasize, in> order that, there may be no possibility of its es- enormous sum of £80,000,000 caping notice when the time comes for the issue of any fresh loans.",20
60,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What about - a sinking fund?,22
61,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not gone very thoroughly into the question of a sinking fund, but I think I may make a suggestion. A suggestion has been made that there ought to be a continuous Commission sitting on the Tariff. Anything more awful for Australian manufacturers and merchants of all kinds than to have the Tariff question constantly ripped up by a continuous Commission 1 cannot imagine.",22
62,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who suggested a continuous Tariff Commission ?,22
63,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That suggestion has been made by two or three honourable members, including, I think, the Acting Prime Minister.",22
64,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Nothin g approaching it!,22
65,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am glad to hear that, because the continuous irritationwould be terrible. If - we do require a Commission, ""it is one to ascertain how best the States debts may be taken over, and in what way advantageous terms may be made for the renewal of the loans amounting to £80,000,000 which become due in the next ten years. This is not a question we can expect a Treasurer, however able, to grapple with, because it is one that requires constant attention. Mr Bent, the Treasurer of Victoria, has certainly made most admirable arrangements, for the renewal'of the next two Victorian loans which become due; but he has taken all the monev off the market in that State. Nothing could be obtained from the Savings Bank of Victoria, because every penny of the money of that institution is hypothecated until those loans mature and are removed from the market. I am sure it would not be possible to get much money in Victoria, though I fancy Mr Bent has had ""feelers"" out in the other States. In saying this, I am not betraying any confidence, because Mr. Bent has not spoken to me about the matter; but I may say that I have no doubt on the point. As I say, I know that the Savings Bank funds of Victoria are hypothecated for the renewal of Victorian loans which become due shortiv, and that removes a great deal of the money which [106]- 2 would otherwise be available. We are face to face with the renewal of loans to the within the next ten years, and we are taking no practical steps so far as I can seethough the Treasurer may be doing something without letting any one know-to anticipate that time. I think it might be as well to appoint a small Commission to look into the matter, and also to consider"" the question of a sinking fund. I do not know whether the Government propose that there should be a Commission to consider the question of the transfer of the States debts, but honourable members of this House, including the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Mernda, and the right honourable member for Swan, have each gone into the matter thoroughly, and have afforded us very valuable 'information. This is not the sort of matter which can be settled in a day; it ought to be dealt with most thoroughly if we desire to save Australia from being placed in a very unpleasant position.",22
66,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Ough t that not to be the work of the officials of the Treasury?,22
67,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasury officials might do the work, but it would be hardly fair to ask them to do so, considering the magnitude of the question. I do not think the .House would be prepared to accept the statements of the Treasury officials, unless they - were endorsed by the Treasurer or a small Commission such as I have indicated.",22
68,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member recognises, I suppose, that until some arrangement is made between the Commonwealth and the States, the latter are likely to resent any interference with their debts.",22
69,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That may be so, but I think that one of the objects of the creation of the Commonwealth was the taking over of the debts of the States; and in this connection I am of opinion that the precedent of Canada ought to be followed. I know that Canada does not borrow a great deal; but I always feel that the Commonwealth stock would command a rate which cannot be commanded by anyState stock. One consideration that caused me to vote for Federation was that a good consolidated Commonwealth stock would command a price which would mean a considerable saving of interest to the people of Australia.",22
70,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable - member not think that Commonwealth'legislation has lowered the value of the States' stock ?,23
71,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That may be.,23
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The States not come to any arrangement, and that is the cause-of the trouble.",23
73,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think that we should pay too much attention to the States in a matter of this sort. We are here to do our work, and, under a proper scheme, to take over the States debts as the loans' mature.",23
74,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely we shall arrive at a solution in a friendly way.,23
75,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope so. If , as the Treasurer says, the States are going to be quite unreasonable",23
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not say that. What I say is that the States, so far, will not come to any arrangement. I do not want to do anything except in an amicable way regarding the taking over of the debts.",23
77,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasurer is quite right in that desire. We should not - do anything to irritate - the States, but there may come a time when the Commonwealth will have to do its duty regardless of what the States think. Of course, that time ought to be put off as long as possible; but I hope the Treasurer will look into this matter, which is of vital consequence. What the honourable member for Parkes says is, in my opinion, quite correct. If we had to renew the loans of £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 today, it might cost a very. large sum, though I do not say that it would cost £18,000,000. We do not desire to be placed in any difficulty such as I have indicated, because it would be a reflection on our business ability. say that we Australians cannot look after our own interests; and we ought to take care that that impression is not created The honourable member for Parkes> asked whether Commonwealth legislation had not had some effect in depreciating the value of State stocks. The other night I said that while we' are passing experimental legislation of a class which does interfere with business enterprises in Australia, I believed that that legislation would do some good. If the result of that legislation is to stamp out sweating and similar evils, and give the working men a proper wage and proper surroundings, it is worth paying a little for it.  honourable member gave us in 1901.",23
78,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I .am very glad to hear that. The final question ^>n which I desire to touch is that of the Tariff itself. As honourable members are aware, I was returned to this House as a pledged prowil l tectionist; and protection presents my view of the position. I desire to see Australia do its own work as far as possible. I am, and always have been, an enthusiastic Australian; and I do not think that any nation is complete without an iron industry. That is the basis of all other industries ; and I hope to see it fairly stimulated by our legislation. Then Australia ought to be the home of woollen - manufactures. Whether Australia will eventually export woollen goods I am not at present prepared to say, - but, at any rate, we ought to give our manufacturers protection sufficient to enable them to cater for our own market. The question as to the amount of that protection is one we shall have to debate when the items of the Tariff are before us; and I do not desire to deal with it in detail now. My view, broadly, is that the Tariff Commission, having sat so long, and having so thoroughly investigated the matters submitted to them- I am now referring' to the protectionist wing of the Commission--ar e in a good position to judge as to the protection it is necessary to extend to any industry. In the. case of woollens they have recommended a duty of 30 per cent. As they have gone thoroughly into all the matters with which they have dealt, I feel that if no reasons are adduced for doubting - the wisdom of their findings, I shall be justified in following their recommendations. I do not wish the Minister of Trade and Customs to give the Government away in People would this matter, but I feel sure that in dealing with the recommendations of the Protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission., - Ministers, anticipating a good deal of trouble in carrying those recommendations, as business men left a big margin. It is very likely that that is what I should myself have done in the circumstances ; if I wished to carry a duty of 30 per cent., I should ask for a duty of 40 per cent. If I desired to sell a mob of sheep at 15s. a head, I might probably ask 16s. or 17s. per head. This is - a very common' business practice, and I have no doubt that it has been followed by Ministers in framing the Tariff. I believe that if duties at about the rates recommended by the Protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission are accepted, we shall provide a sufficient measure of protection to enable our manufacturers to do our own work in Australia. Dealing with the proposed duties on tea and kerosene, I think I may say that I was one of the first to recommend that"" duties should be imposed on these articles and the revenue - set aside to provide for old-age pensions. The idea has been considerably discussed .since, and I need not detain the Committee by discussing it at length at this stage.",23
79,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would not a land tax be - better ?,24
80,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"H a r d l y , I think, and I shall tell the honourable member why. When I was in the Victorian State Parliament, it was frequently complained that old-age pensions were continually referred to as charities. I think we are all agreed that when a poor man or woman is compelled to take advantage of the provision made for old-age pensions, we should, if possible, avoid the suggestion that they have become dependent upon public charity. I suggested in the State Parliament that - a small duty should be imposed on tea and kerosene for the purpose of providing an old-age pension fund. I know that in the business in which I am engaged it is the practice to provide tea and kerosene for employees. . Mr Mahon - The residents' of Toorak would have to pay very little, as they use the electric light.",24
81,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That likely. I think that in Victoria 16 persons out of every 100 who are over the age of 65 jears are in receipt of old age pensions, and the other 84 would be contributing their quota by the payment of taxation on tea and kerosene to support those who have not been so fortunate in life.",24
82,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Are they not all contributing to Customs revenue now ?,24
83,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are. But I think that if the suggestion I made were adopted, the taxation would not amount to very much, and it would do away with any feeling that persons in receipt of old-age pensions contributed nothing to the fund from which they, are paid.",24
84,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The duties proposed in the Tariff on tea and kerosene are not levied for that purpose at all, but in order, as far as possible, to have work done in the country.",24
85,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I understand that they are imposed with the object of having the packing done' in Australia, and, from that point of view, I entirely approve of the proposals. Many circumstances surrounding the imposition of these duties require to be looked into, and I shall leave their further consideration until' we come to deal with the special items in the. Tariff. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does the honourable member think that the States would agree to our devoting the whole of the revenue from duties on tea and kerosene to the payment of old-age pensions?",24
86,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the Commonwealth took over the payment of old-age pensions, it would be really a question of putting money from one pocket into another, and the States authorities, taking a common-sense view, would not greatly care whether the Commonwealth Government or they themselves did the work.",24
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government proposed, in effect, last year what the honourable member suggests, but, though carried in this House, the proposal was rejected by the Senate.",24
88,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am very glad to hear that it was proposed.,24
89,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Certainl y not. I did not vote for the Government proposal on that understanding. A proposal was made for the imposition of special duties, but particular duties were not named.",24
90,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I remember that there was some discussion on the matter, but I forget the details of it .  imposition .of special duties, and not for the imposition of duties on tea and kerosene.",24
91,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall conclude my remarks by saying a word on the question of the new protection. It seems to me that protection does not necessarily lead to a rise in the price of commodities. What protectionists say is that when a protective duty is imposed, the result is to retain the market for the local producer, but that, after a time, and in some cases a very short time, local competition becomes keen, and the price of the protected article is not raised to the consumer.  raised in Victoria.",24
92,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My father was one of the founders of the candle making industry in Australia, and, at.the start, it was discovered that, notwithstanding the fact that we had the advantage of a considerable duty, competition in the industry soon became very keen, and the price of candles went down.",24
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,SO it did in New South Wales.,25
94,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Exactly . I think that is the experience of protection everywhere.,25
95,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I the members of the Opposition are very quiet while the honourable member is saying these things.,25
96,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think there are a few topics upon which we do not thoroughly agree. As protection does not tend to increase prices to the consumer, I feel sure that it is not likely to lead to anygreat increase in wages.  member account for the rise in the price of wire netting?",25
97,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is an stract question.,25
98,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I cannot go into every detail. It is possible that the local manufacturer of wire netting is taking advantage of his position.,25
99,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The wire netting has been going .up gradually during the last eighteen months.  fortnight or three weeks ago.,25
100,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As the honourable' member for Maranoa is probably aware, there is at present in Australia an enormous demand for wire netting.' The present demand cannot.be supplied. I was informed the other day that the Australian demand for wire netting has overtaken the supply, not merely of New South Wales, but of the world. .The rise in price of the article can, therefore, be explained by the application of the law of supply and demand, and not as a' necessary consequence of protection. Even if the increased price were due to the duty imposed under the new Tariff, it should be remembered that there is only one manufacturer of the article in Australia, and there an absence of local competition in the in dustry. MrBRUCE SMITH - Accordin g to some honourable members, it is a monopoly which must be taken over by the State.",25
101,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I understand that cession. Mr Bent has taken over the manufacture ; Colonel FOXTON of wire netting, and intends to employ prisoners in the industry. The questions raised by this and other duties are which very debatable, and can be better dealt with when Ave are discussing the separate items in the Tariff. Mere general statements are not of much value,, but - feel sure that when we come to debate the different items, I shall the in a position to redeem my platform pledge to support a - policy of protection. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [3.59] notice that If I consulted my own inclination, I should refrain from addressing myself to the question before the Committee, because I recognise that it is in the highest degree desirable that we should get to businesswith the Tariff. We should do so for this reason, if for no other, that considerable loss is being incurred daily by the commercial community as a result of the dislocation of business and the natural disinclination to pay duties which, in the course of a month or two, may be reduced, since that would place those who paid the ab- higher rates of duty now levied on various .articles at a disadvantage as compared with those paying the reduced rates, and might render the sale of the articles taken out of bond unprofitable. For those reasons, I shall .be disinclined price of to .prolong unnecessarily the debate. But there are one or two matters which it is due to my constituents that I should mention. I do not propose to traverse the very cogent arguments which have been addressed from this side of the Chamber to the question of the Budget and the financial position of the - Commonwealth generally-argument s which appeared to me to be strikingly conclusive from the stand-point of the speakers. I allude more especially to the speeches of the honourable members for Parramatta, Parkes, Bendigo, and Flinders. I do not propose to go over the ground which they trod, but I desire to associate myself strongly with the views which they' expressed. It is somewhat difficult to understand why those views have not been more full y replied to from the Treasury bench and the Ministerial cross-benches.",25
102,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We cannot get in a is, therefore, word edgeways. Mr KING OMALLEY . - - We have not yet had a chance to - speak We have been waiting for two weeks to get a-chance.",25
103,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There have been ten speakers from the Opposition side in suc- I am sorry that that has been the case, and I shall look forward with great interest to the replieswill be given, if the promise of the honourable member for Darwin is going to be redeemed, and Ministers and other prominent members on the other side answer I the very cogent arguments which have been advanced from, this side. In that respect the debate has been rather a surprise to very elastic term. me, because I cannot resist the feeling that the Government are relying upon their jority.",25
104,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Brut e force.,26
105,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will not use that expression. Apparently the Government are relying upon the majority in the corner which constantly supports them in anywhich thing which may be brought forward, in order that they may be retained in office to carry out its behests. I propose express a few views in regard to the Budget and the Tariff from the Queensequally land stand-point. I took an active part the general election, and, so far as able to gather, the fiscal issue was absolufourth tely sunk. There was no outcry highly protective or prohibitive Tariff. may be aptly and tersely described as hausted. having been a contest between those who wanted to bring about "" Socialism in our time "" and those who were opposed to the enactment and realization of that principle. In view of that issue, which the prominent feature of the elections, fiscal question was entirely sunk. I scarcely ever referred to the fiscal question. Someconsiderably times I found it necessary, in reply to an tion. interjection or in explanation of an arguthe ment which I was using, to mention the fact that I was a protectionist. I - am tectionist, but I am by no means a prohibiwith the reduced payments. tionist. As a Queenslander, I hold that in any Tariff which may be passed we are not justified in sacrificing the primary dustries for the sake of fostering those secondary industries which must necessarily be more or less exotic. That, I may say, fication for expecting. is the stand I shall take in connection the details of the Tariff. At the general election we heard a great deal about Braddon the necessity for an adjustment of the' anomalies which were alleged exist in the old Tariff. But,can judge the opinions which have been pressed throughout Australia during last few weeks, I venture to say that anomalies in the new Tariff will f ar and away transcend those which were to be found in the old Tariff.",26
106,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We are bound is most extraordinary to have a number of anomalies in a new Tariff, but we hope to wipe them out. - Colonel FOXTON - In time?",26
107,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We hope that the Committee will remove the anomalies,26
108,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall deal with that matter later on.,26
109,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,""" Anomalies "" is a",26
110,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; it is nearly as magood as Mesopotamia for some purposes. Before dealing with the Tariff, let me state the view which I 'take of the financial statement.' The most serious and disquieting feature which has been presented during the debate has been the light and airy way in the Treasurer has intimated that it is absolutely impossible to continue the operation of the Braddon section. Upon to the continuance of that section, or the substitution of a provision which will be beneficial to the States, will really in depend the credit, and I might almost I was say the solvency, of the States. The portion of the Customs and Excise for a revenue which the Commonwealth is enI t titled to retain is practically now exI n only one year has Queensland received more than its three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and this year I understand that the amount to was be received by that State will be considerthe ably below the average amount which, it has received, and which has been very below the three-fourths . porThis is a very serious matter to various Treasurers, especially the Treasurers of States which, unlike Victoria and a proNew South Wales, are unable to manage I have had personal experience of the very great difficulty in which State Treasurers are placed inwhen 'they find that the actual receipts from the Commonwealth are below the amounts which they had reasonable justiAlthough the with Treasurer says that it will be impossible to continue the operation of the section, still he does not say, nor has any Minister since risen to explain, to what financial system, as between the if I States and the Commonwealth, is to take exthe place of that which was solemnly the agreed upon as part of the compact the when the Constitution Bill was accepted.",26
111,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is good reason for that. They do not know.,26
112,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"To me ""the position,",26
113,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course honourable members opposite know everything, and we know notiiing.",26
114,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , we want to know. Ever since' this debate was initiated I have been expecting . that the request preferred by the honourable member for Flinders would have been acceded to, and that the Committee. would have been informed of what it is proposed to substitute for the arrangement which, the right honourable member for Swan explained the other day, was made the basis of the understanding which he, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and with the full sanction of the Prime. Minister, entered into with the States Premiers at'the Conference in Brisbane. That arrangement was practically agreed to by the whole of the States.",26
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It agreed to.,27
116,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not only was agreed to, but the right honourable member for Swan has stated that he had the written authority of the Prime Minister for making that arrangement.",27

121,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . Of course everybody deplores the fact that, during'the whole of this discussion, and for a short time prior to the introduction of the Tariff, the Prime Minister has not been in the position to supervise the policy of the Government, so far as it has been disclosed in this Chamber,",27
122,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He said^ yesterday that he did not know that there was such a thing as a new Tariff.,27
123,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course* he was speaking jocularly, but the remark illustrates the fact that for the time being he has been entirely dissevered from public affairs. During his temporary retirement, a new proposal has been sprung upon the House by the Acting Prime Minister, who declares that the arrangement which was entered into with the States Premiers at Biisbane cannot be carried out, and that the continuation of the Braddon section is impossible. The discontinuance of that section would be a very serious matter for the States. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Surely the honourable member does not want the Commonwealth to be further hobbled? He must was not not forget that the States are represented b\ this Parliament, as well as by the States it Parliaments.",27

If it is intended that the additional revenue which will be required by the Commonwealth-perhap s not this year, but certainly next year, and in increasing amounts during the following years-shal l be raised by direct taxation, the dissatisfaction which undoubtedly exists throughAustralia will be intensified to such a degree that Nemesis will certainly overtake his those political parties who force such a state of things upon the country. ap",27

128,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should be very sorry to see any party come into power as the result of the infliction of such a great wrong upon the people of Australia. I am of opinion-and that is one of the reasons why I feel it necessary to raise my voice on behalf of the State which I representthat prevention is better than cure. It is better that this state of things should not be brought about, even though its prevention may result in the retention of power by the present occupants of the Treasury bench.",27
129,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does not the honourable member think that there will be very little difficulty experienced in arriving at an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, seeing that they, are both interested in securing a settlement of the problem?",28
130,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The question of the Minister of Trade and Customs is a very pertinent one, but the answer to it is, that whenever an attempt has been made to adjust matters between the States and the Commonwealth, friction has unfortunately arisen. As year succeeds year, instead of getting nearer to a solution of these difficulties, we are apparently getting further away from their settlement.",28
131,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The very suggested by the Minister of Trade and Customs was being adopted by the right honourable member for Swan when the Acting Prime Minister repudiated the whole arrangement!,28
132,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . At the present time, there is a greater gulf to bridge between the States and the Commonthey wealth in regard to the adjustment of their quences. financial relations than existed last year. If effect is to be given to the ideas of the Acting Prime Minister-if the Braddon section is to be discontinued, and if we are not to substitute for it an arrangement upon similar lines",28
133,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Acting Prime Minister has not said that.,28
134,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We do not know what he proposes in this connection. whole ground of our complaint is that he does not say what he intends to do. If he is going to break the compact which solemnly entered into prior to the accomplay, plishment of Federation, I should like know how far he intends to go in that breach.",28
135,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He cannot go ' further than the House will permit him to go.,28
136,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is quite correct, but so long as the Government can command a majority of honourable members who are willing to listen to his dictum in regard to this matter, he can go very far . Mr KING O'MALLEY - We numbers.",28
137,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . makes no impression whatever upon those honourable members who support the GoOpposition vernment. Their one argument is, "" We have the numbers,"" which, as the honor. able member for Parkes says, really amounts to the possession of brute force.",28
138,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have been waiting during the past three weeks for some arguments - to be adduced by honourable members opposite.,28
139,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think that those members of the public who read Hansard will be the best judges of whether or not sound' arguments, utterly destructive of the financial policy of the Government so far as the finances of this year and next year are concerned, have been advanced from this side of the Chamber. The public will be the best judges. Possibly, I am not a perfectly competent judge, being, to some extent, a partisan; but the honourable member who interjects, being also course a partisan, is equally disqualified from forming an impartial opinion upon the point. The whole intention of the Government at this juncture appears to be to enter upon a policy of exasperation in regard to the States.",28
140,Mr AUSTIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,CHAPMAN - I think not.,28
141,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think so; and appear to be regardless of the conse,28
142,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member mean the policy supported by the right honourable member for Swan?,28
143,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , I mean the policy so unfortunately supported by the party which maintains the present Government in office. Up to the point when the Prime Minister found it necessary to reThe linquish the active performance of his duties, he was able, with the support of the right honourable member for Swan, to exercise a restraining influence. But now was that the Acting Prime Minister has free without any check upon him, he has, to whether intentionally or not, entered upon a policy of exasperation towards the States.",28
144,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swashbuckling , that is the word.",28
145,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The mere intimation from the temporary head of the Ministry that he proposes, with the aid of the party which supports the Government, practically to wipe out the Braddon section of the Constitution, and to remove the protection which that section gives to the have the States, is enough to cause consternation throughout Australia. Reason",28
146,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The head of the corner party said the same thing.,28
147,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Flinders raised the first note of alarm on that subject.,29
148,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am entirely in accord With the views of the honourable member for Flinders in that respect. But I am entirely in opposition to the views enunciated by the Acting Prime Minister.,29
149,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They are .both alike.,29
150,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then why did the Acting Prime Minister tell the honourable member for Flinders that-he was talking nonsense ?,29
151,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That was with , regard io quite another subject.",29
152,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think he was right in .that .case.,29
153,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Besides , even supposing thafe the honourable member for Flin; ders was in accord with the views of the Acting Prime Minister-and we will make that supposition for the sake of argument - it would only intensify the evil by indicating that that honourable member tended to support the policy of the Acting Prime Minister and the party which is behind him, in reference to the iniquitous proposal which has been put before the public.",29
154,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On e is a private member, and, therefore, to some extent, irresponsible, while the other is the aetii@ head of the Government.",29
155,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . If any honourable member-eve n the honourable member who is so persistently interrupting me-were to give expression to certain views inimical to the States, it would concern me very much. I should not gard it as a matter of vital consequence. But when such views are expressed by the acting head of the Government, supported ous States. by a majority in this House, and when he proposes deliberately to undermine the Constitution",29
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Nothin g of k in d ; let the honourable member read the Acting Prime Minister's statement.,29

160,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I would try.. It is this aggression against the States- I do not think that is too strong an expression to use-that has caused the uneasiness. In every direction apparently this Parliament has laid itself out to encroach on the functions of the States. :,29
161,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,As though the people of the States and those of the Commonwealth were altogether different peoples.,29
162,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so; I shall have a word or two to say on that point a little later. The result is that dissatisfaction is prevalent throughout - Australia. Murmurs, and at times something a great deal stronger than murmurs, of secession are heard, not at the street corners, but actually in the various States Legislatures ",29

164,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He does.

168,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What has caused the change of opinion ? ' .Colonel FOXTON - The constant tendency on the part of this Parliament, to encroach upon functions which are specially reserved by the Constitution to the States..",30

That No honourable member in this House is the judge of whether it isor not. The public have that feeling ; there it is, and .it has to be reckoned done - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - What feeling does the honourable member say the public have r*",31
203,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Dissatisfaction with the Acting Prime Minister is one veryprominent feeling.,32
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is not rect. The honourable member was referring just now to some feeling, and I asked him what it was.",32
205,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall not repeat the statement for the sake of the honourable gentleman. It must be borne in mind that the electors in those constituencies which are charged with being. anti-Federal are also the electors of members of this House. If that feeling of dissatisfaction exists among them, it will find expression eventually in the return of members to this Parliament. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Most of those men are the fellows who were defeated at the last election.",32
206,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I can point to many who do not come within that description, and who are at the head of affairs in the States. Not only are those electors the constituents of members of this House, but the States members and States Governments, who are taking a leading part in this agitation, are in closer touch with them than are the members of this House, for several very good reasons. In the first place,, in every State except Victoria, where practically the same conditions exist with regard to both State and Federal members, the members of this House are, during a large period of the session, at a very much greater distance from their electors than are the members of States Houses^JThey are for lengthy periods dissociated from their electors except upon those matters which form the subjects of correspondence. The State member is in much closer touch with the people on that account. He is also in much closer touch with the individual elector, because his electorate is a very much smaller one, and, speaking generally, he knows practically every man in it, or something about him. That is not the case in regard to the very much more extended electorates represented by members of this House. Lastly, and principally-and this applies especially to the States Governments, as distinguished from the Government of the Commonwealth-State s members and States Governments, are in very much closer touch with the electors than are Commonwealth members and the Commonwealth ' Government, because there are only a few subjects upon which the Commonwealth Parliament can legislate, or which can be administered by the Commonwealth Government, affecting the individual elector. Shortly"" put, they are the corPost Office Department, Defence Department, and the Customs House. Apart fram those, every other Federal power expressed within the thirty-nine articles of section 51 of the Constitution is indirect, and almost impalpable in its operation as regards the individual elector. On the other hand, the functions performed by the State member for his constituency comprise the thousand and one matters which are closely interwoven with the daily life of the people. These are a few of them, which I have jotted down-school s and education generally, land, mines and the Mining Departments, railways, police protection, public works, administration of justice, local government and the allied branches of administration, the Agricultural Department, rabbit and marsupial legislation, and numberless other items. All these bring the State member in constant touch with his electors. Honourable members maydepend upon it that, if the States Parliaments, Governments, and electors are crying out against the Commonwealth, there is something in it, and that a reflex of that opinion will be ultimately found in this House.",32
207,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I can hand to the honourable member a copy of Hansard containing the remarks of the Acting Prime Minister with regard to the proposed continuation of the Braddon section.,32
208,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is not what I was dealing with - I was referring to a totally different occasion.,32
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is the onlyoccasion on which I referred to the subject in detail.,32
210,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was not speaking of detail. What I quoted was an interjection. Conferences of Premiers have been held, and I have heard it said in this House that those who took part in them were- I forget the exact expression, but it was something like "" traitors to the Commonwealth.''",32
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who said that?,32
212,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was said by some honourable member in - the Ministerial corner, although I have not given the exact words.",32
213,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,To whom was it applied ?,32
214,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was applied to those who took part in the Premiers' Conferences. The .statement was to the effect that' the Conferences were anti-Federal. "" T r a it o r s "" is a stronger word than was used, - I admit; ""but I cannot at this moment recall it , but it was one bearing much, the same meaning. Those Conferences have been held for the purpose of adjusting matters between the States and the Commonwealth, and between the States themselves, and for resisting what the States Legislatures and Governments regarded as. encroachments by the Commonwealth upon States functions. I am in doubt myself whether it cannot be said that the mere fact that there has been a necessity for such Conferences indicates that there is something wanting in our Constitution. It is a remarkable fact that after, nearly' forty years of Federation in Canada, the first Premiers' . Conference which has been held in that country was held early this year. At a dinner tendered to the delegates, Sir Will f r i d Laurier made use of the remarkable expression, that "" The mere fact that that Conference had had to be called indicated that there was something wanting . in their Constitution."" If Sir Will f r i d Laurier were in Australia, and cognizant of all that takes place at Premiers' Conferences in this part of the world, and of the necessity that exists for' them, I ""wonder what he would say about our Constitution?",32
215,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We cannot anything better than a High Court to termine the limitation of 'the powers of the Commonwealth and States.,33
216,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Quite so.,33
217,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,At time occasional Conferences of Premiers with the Prime Minister ought to have good results.,33
218,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the remarkable fact remains that under the Canadian"" Constitution they have managed to work for all these years, and that, when it was found necessary to adjust certain matters at a Premiers' Conference, a man of Sir Will f r i d Laurier's standing should give expression to the view that it indicated that there must 'be something wanting in their Constitution.",33
219,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There was friction in the earlier years, of the Canadian Dominion.",33
220,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But ""that friction was got over without conferences.  ences here done ? ' . - Colonel FOXTON - Conference s might do a great 'deal'of good, but they are not likely to do much when what is agreed, at them on behalf of the Commonwealth Government is repudiated shortly afterwards.",33
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There has been no repudiation; the States Governments .did not agree to what the Commonwealth Government proposed.,33
222,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the Acting Prime Minister will permit me to say so,I am much more inclined to take the view of the right honourable member for Swan than that given'expression to by the present, Acting Prime Minister.",33
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Than k you. That is very kind of the honourable member; but at the same time he is wrong when he speaks of repudiation on the part of the Government.,33
224,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a mere matter of opinion.,33
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a matter, of fact.",33
226,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I hope the Acting - Prime Minister will not say that it is a matter of fact as between himself and the right honourable member for Swan.,33
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; but it is as between myself and the honourable member for Brisbane.,33
228,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not at all ; I am merely quoting what was said by the right honourable member for Swan the other night. That honourable member and the have Acting Prime Minister were at variance dethen ; but I had hoped they had composed their differences. It seems, however, that that is not so.",33
229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The right hon the same orable member for Swan said that he associated the one proposal with the other.,33
230,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The right honourable member for Swan said that what he had agreed to at Brisbane had the sanction of the Prime Minister.,33
231,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He said that the two questions were associated- Colonel FOXTON - ^ T he Acting Prime Minister said - that it would be impossible to carry out the - .suggestion of the right honourable member for Swan.,33
232,Sir WILLIAM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,LYNE - I did not; I said : it would be impossible to extend the operation of the Braddon section.,33
233,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was the question with which the right honourable member for Swan was dealing.,33
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is' not so; it is absolutely not so; the honourable member ismistaken.,33
235,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not make any mistake. However, it is of no use quibbling over the matter. Sir WILLIAM LYN E - There quibble.",34
236,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What was said on the occasion referred to, and also the proceedings of the Conference, are reported in black and white; and the public may judge for themselves whether or not an arrangement was arrived at between the representatives of the Commonwealth and the representatives of the States for a continuation of the principle of the Braddon section.  the report of the Brisbane Conference.",34

244,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should now like to say a word about the Tariff-that bantling which has been born with all its teeth, and' is now biting everybody all round. Apparently, no one has a good word to say for the Tariff. When a bantis no ling is born, the nurse usually has something to say about it, but even in that capacity, the Minister of Trade and Customs has not seen fit to use the expression, "" How like its m a ! "" I find that the Prime Minister, when in England, at the Imperial Conference, used the following pregnant words in reference to the imposition of a protective TariffThe proper method was to study each industry and its needs, or each kind of production by Itself in a business light, and to see how far it was likely to pay the country to foster it or ignore it. If it was a good business proposition the experiment of fostering it should be undertaken without fear. If it was an unattractive business proposition it should be left alone. honourable These are, I think, very excellent precepts; but, so far as I am able to see, the framers see. of the Tariff before us, if they have not ignored those principles, have The I Tariff provides protection for even remote possibilities in the way of secondary induswhile primary' industries, which have been shown to be natural to the country, are left severely alone, or are - not given anything like the same degree of protec",34

That, in my ""opinion, is not a fair way in which to approach the question; but the method may be accounted by the reason indicated in a speechmade by the Acting Prime Minister at Wagga the other day, in which he saidSince the Tariff has been published I have got experts in consultation with the Comptroller General of Customs, and with Mr Lockyer. These experts are giving detailed information as to what machinery can be made here in a reasonable and nr.oper way, and when - I come to theparticular items to which exception. is. taken I can have .them rectified on the experts' decision. Now, the Tariff Commission sat for over two and a half years, and has done splendid work. Although reference has already been made to the work of the Commission, I do not think that the services of the members have received adequate recognition at our hands. In spite of the time spent by the Commission in preparing their recommendations, the Tariff was delayed from week to week, and even month to month, after the House met, in order that, as we were told, details might be completed. And, even now, the Acting Prime Minister, according to the quotation I have read, says that experts have been called in for the purpose.of adjusting the Tariff on proper lines.",34
249,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why say that the Tariff was delayed from month to month, when it was.brought in within a month of the assembling of'Parliament ?",35
250,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall withdraw "" month to month,"" and leave "" week to week."" The point is immaterial, but I was under the impression that the delay was for two months; at all events, we had to go on with other business pending the appearance of the Tariff. In my opinion, those experts ought to have been called in long ago if the testimony of the experts examined by the Tariff Commission was held to be insufficient.",35
251,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What have become of the Tariff?,35
252,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What is done elsewhere with regard to Tariffs?. The present Tariff appears to'have been prepared in a haphazard way, and placed on the table in a haphazard way, judging by. the speech of the Acting Prime Minister at Wagga'; indeed, it seems to - have been .laid on the table in order that it might be formulated by the House. This is a most extraordinary attitude for the Minister in charge of it - to take up. The revision referred to should have been carried out beforehand for the reason that in the meantime whatever anomalies there may be in the Tariff must be the cause of very great loss to individuals, and it might almost be said to sections in the community, during the whole of the time that the duties are under consideration by Parliament. Mr AUSTIN .CHAPMAN - We shall ways be ready to remedy any anomalies as soon as we can get to them.",35
253,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but _ there would have been fewer anomalies in the Tariff if the experts who are being called in now had been called in before. They need not have been informed of the decisions which would be arrived at from their evidence any more than the witnesses who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission were informed of what the reports of the Commission would be. Had the evidence of the experts been read by the Government together with the reports and evidence submitted by the Tariff Commission, the Tariff might have been submitted in a definite form, for which the Government could make themselves responsible. Apparently that course has not been followed. Another expression made use of by the Prime Minister was that the Tariff ""should be made palatable to all classes of the community."" That is a statement with which every one can agree. I do not know whether the Government are satisfied that all classes of the community regard this Tariff as palatable. I should regard the experience of the Minister of Defence at the Agricultural Show the other day as an indication that he was, in the presence of a very large number of representative men who did not find it at all palatable. Notwithstanding the comfort which I have no doubt the Acting Prime Minister will be able to find in the telegrams he has received from such important centres of population as Moojebing and Maningamarley, not to speak of Sacrawould mento City, California, the honourable gentleman must be satisfied in his owri mind that the dictum of the Prime Minister that the Tariff should be palatable to - all classes of the community has not been given effect in its integrity.",35
254,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The way to frame a Tariff satisfactory to all classes of the community has not yet been discovered.,35
255,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know that so much annoyance has been caused by any previous Tariff submitted in Australia. I have seen several Tariffs introduced in the State from which I come, and there was never at any time anything like the amount of feeling displayed in connection with those Tariffs that has been experienced in connection with the Tariff we are now discussing.  knows that in Queensland the practice was alto put on one turn of the screw at a time.",35

In just the same Goway, and just as the scope of the market is widened, and the variety of products have which ' are the result of protection in the widened area are increased, the question of adjusting the duties equitably is more complex. It is in. this connection that I think the Government have failed to.rise to the occasion in the preparaof this Tariff.

314,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Postmaster General, having declared that Mr Kirkland's statement does not prove that the Denton Hat Mills are refusing to supply orders, I ask him, does he know a gentleman whose initials are H.A.K., and who signs himself "" pro secretary""? At all events, the following is a copy of a letter forwarded by the Denton Hat Mills to Mr Kirkland:Manager, - A. M . Kirkland, Ltd. , Elizabeth-street, Brisbane Dear Sir,We were duly favoured with your letter of February 26th. We are sorry that you should have been disappointed at the contents of our last, but we would state that you are quite under a misapprehension in thinking that we had undertaken to send you a range of samples within a week or ten days. Whilst we have ample accommodation and power at the factory to deal with a largely increased turnover, the difficulty is that the supply of labour in certain branches of the trade is limited, and having already a large clientele in the various States we naturally study first those who have done a satisfactory business with us for vears. The orders which we have 'now on lian'd are fully as much as we can cope with for many months, exclusive of the repeat orders that are regularly arriving, so that, much as we Tegret we are compelled on this ground to pass your firm, as were we to encourage you to send us orders we fear our inability to deliver to time, which would be a disappointment to you, as well as unsatisfactory to ourselves. That is the company's explanation of why they refused to supply his order. another inference may be drawn from it, I may mention that Mr Kirkland informsme that he told the people connected with the mills that he was prepared to pay cashon delivery. I have, I think, established the truth of my statement .in reply to thePostmaster-General. I have supplied hint with that proof which he promised to ' obtain for me. Passing away from, this subject, I desire to point out that Queensland has had a considerable experience in connection with immigration. The result of that experience goes to show that, as a general rule, it is not practicable to put large numbers of men from the older countries of Europe upon the lands of Australia-certainl y not upon lands so far north as Queensland-immediatel y upon their arrival, even although they may be possessed of farming experience. It takes them some years to become accustomed to their new conditions, - and my own opinion is that they should be gradually drafted to the land from industries which are overcrowded.",39
315,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did not - some of the earlier settlers at Moreton Bay succeedvery well?,39
316,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think not at firstEven those immigrants who selected land in Queensland for 2s. 6d. an acre, and who had five years within which to pay it, had: in many instances spent practically the best pait of their life-time before they got. their heads above water, from a financial stand-point. They were compelled . tostruggle for fifteen or twenty years, and during a large portion of that time they had to live upon pumpkins and wallaby - upo n the roughest kind"" of fare-and "" were provided with covering which was very little better than that enjoyed by theaborigines. These immigrants were principally Germans. It is true that their pluck and stamina pulled them through,, but, nevertheless, their experience showsthat it takes a generation to establish a family under such conditions. In my judgment, it is preferable to allbw men to settle upon the land after they have acquired a certain amount of colonial experience, either as farm hands or in some other walk of life. In Queensland today we want it , labour, and cannot secure it. During thecourse of this debate it has been suggested, that both the Excise and the bounty payable in respect of the production of sugar should be abolished, and'that a protectiveduty should be substituted for them. ThereLest are many persons in Queensland who think that the adoption of such a course would be an excellent thing. Others hold a diffeient opinion, because, although they would then be at liberty to employ coloured labour to any extent that they chose, they argue that it is now too laite for the Commonwealth to place the Queensland sugar growers upon the footing which they occupied a few years ago, seeing that thousands of their skilled coloured labourers have been deported. Unless these Kanakas were re-introduced, it would be impossible to put the Queensland planter upon the footing that he formerly occupied in regard to coloured labour. To supply the places of thousands of Kanakas who have been deported, a few white men, comparatively speaking, have drifted north, and are doing well. Undoubtedly white men can do the work, though not all white men are fit for it. It takes a good strong man to do the work required of him in the tropical portions of Queensland, but still there are men who can do it, and it is worthwhile to pay good wages to those who are fit for it .",39
317,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not the industry on a better footing now than ever it was?,40
318,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Certainl y not; it is suffering from a scarcity of labour.,40

321,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In what district?,40
322,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the Mossman district. The farmers last year had smaller returns than they had in the previous year. Not only has the shortage of labour had an injurious effect upon the sugar industry, but men have gone from the south of Australia, and particularly from' southern Queensland, to the sugar districts, attracted by the high wages, and have consequently decreased the labour supply elsewhere. This exodus has partially depleted the Darling Downs of its labour. It was> mentioned the other day by the representative of one of the Darling Downs constituencies in the State Parliament, that the labour difficulty there was a serious one. He stated that the next harvest on the Darling Downs would be attended with serious difficulties on account of a scarcity of labour, owing to the fact that large numbers of men had gone to work in the.sugar industry. not only is the supply of labour for the sugar industry insufficient, but that insufficiency is having an injurious effect on other districts.  be such a bad place when men will leave the Darling Downs to go there.

323,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not deny that. I am merely mentioning facts, to show that within reasonable limits we require practically unrestricted immigration on the lines I have indicated-, to meet the requirements of our great industries. If we are to adopt a strongly protective policy which has the effect of attracting men to our great cities, and of enormously benefiting city industries, we must take steps to fill up the ranks of labour in our agricultural districts.",40

328,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That may be so in the south, but it is not so in the north, unless as the result of good seasons. The fact that 30,000 tons of cane were left standing is the strongest proof honourable members can have of the condition of the industry. A group of farmers connected with a Central.

332,Mr ARCHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As long as the industry receives a bounty from the Commonwealth it"" will be carried on all right. - Colonel FOXTON - As long as there is a duty of £ 6 per ton on sugar, and the growers can get labour to cut their cane, the industry will Stand.",41
333,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Even with - coloured labour, in Queensland, the industry would require the £ 5 per ton protective duty. - Colonel FOXTON - Quite so-in order to enable it to compete with the cheap labour of countries where sugar is almost exclusively grown.",41
334,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Where would industry be without this bolstering?,41
335,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Numbers of growers are going out of the industry. Of course, in the more southerly sugar districts, the prospects as to a supply of labour are more favourable, but I am speaking of the extreme north. The Mossman M ill is the most northerly mill in Queensland.",41
336,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable' member is speaking of the part of Queensland where we were told that the white man dared not go.. But still he is there ! 'Colonel FOXTON - The honourable member for West Sydney has stated that his party is in favour of immigration to supply the needs of Australia. But when any practical proposal is made, what do we find? We have protests from deputations against men being introduced to supply the wants of the sugar industry. The honourable member for Herbert, whose name has just been mentioned, stated that he could get 500 men in Melbourne who were willing to go and work in Queensland. There may have been a few men who were willing to go, but how manv of the 500 to whom the honourable member referred were not only unemployed, but unemployable, even in the south?'",41
337,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They were ready to go, biit there was no work for them.",41
338,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There ""may have been ho work at that particular time.",41
339,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They could not live on air' until .the planters were willing to employ them.,41
340,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member forgets that efforts to secure labour hail to be made some months in advance. The men were not wanted at once. It was a very easy thing for the honourable member for Herbert to trot out the fact that 500 men were ready to go when there was no work for them to do. They were wanted at harvest time. Where are those men now ? There is; plenty of work for them, and will be for the next six months. Are . they"" ready to go now, or were the 500 mythical ?",41
341,Mr ARCHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There , is certainly plenty of work for them now. Colonel FOX TON - Undoubtedl y there is. It is, however, a fact that opposition to an immigration policy exists below the surface. On the surface some honourable members are entirely in favour of immigration, but whenever an effort is made' the. to introduce labour, there i$ on their part an attempt either to prevent it or to throw cold water on the project.",41
342,Mr ARCHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"B y means of deputations to Ministers. Colonel ' FOXTON - That is so. Surely since we have in most of the States : Wages Boards established, or about to be established, the introduction of labour could not be attended with, any danger to the labourers already here. To suggest that a certain man who is introduced on a particular day is going to compete with a certain man already engaged in a certain: industry at that particular time is to take: a short-sighted view of the situation. The immigration into the United States last year totalled, I think, 1,050,000, and I saw the other day a statement that these immigrants carried with them an average of ^ 5 0 0 per head. We know, of course, that a very large number had in their possession nothing like that sum of money.  formed a part was in a very different position - I ' do not suppose that we had amongst us 500 shillings. .",41
343,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But other immigrants who came out by different vessels during the same year would go to make up the average. At all' events, the figures I have quoted show, even though greatly over-estimated or' exaggerated, diut if we' like the United States of America, had an almost unrestricted stream of immigrationi f we welcomed men from all parts to our shores-w e should"" have people coming here withcapital to give employment to the additional labour so obtained. If the actual amount per head were only one"" tenth of that I have mentioned, and, personally, I should think that would be much nearer the mark, it would mean that in one year no less a sum than ^""50,000,000 sterling was introduced by immigrants into that"" country. 1 confess that I quote these figures with some degree of diffidence, since I have not been able to verify them from official - documents, but they constitute a remarkable object lesson to us. Canada is in the same happy position, for last year she had,' I think, over 200,000 immigrants, whilst in ten years the population of the Argentine by immigration alone has increased by no less than 1,000,000.  calculation as to the capital introduced into the United States of America by immigrants to which the honourable member has just referred? Would every one entering the United States be classed as an immigrant ?",41
344,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know on what basis the - estimate was made. doubt many whose capital was included in the calculation would not be pleased to be described as immigrants; there may have been a millionaire or two among the number. Quite possibly the immigrants may have included manufacturers or others in a large way of business, who were transferring their operations and their capital from the old world to the new, with the object of carrying on their industry where adequate labour was available. supply of labour can be obtained only by a piactically unrestricted, even though properly safeguarded, system of immigration.  ferred to were not immigrants in the sense in which we understand the term. I dare say they were not what are known as assisted immigrants?",42
345,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so. I have said, with the creation of Wages Boards there should be no dread of the advent of more workers to Australia. I m mediately these newcomers land they practically create wealth. They may for the time being come into competition with a few others, but in the long run every one will benefit by their coming here. moment an immigrant lands he begins to employ some one, if it be only a carter to carry his baggage from the steamer to his lodgings. Then he has to pay for his lodgings, and so indirectly gives employment to others. A large stream of immigrants, bringing, some of them, much money, and others very little, means a constant supply of labour, which will always induce the investment of capital. To attempt to prevent the introduction of desirable immigrants would be to strangle industries, and so to render them unable to satisfy the demands expected to be made upon them under the new Tariff. Coming to the scheme of new protection which'has been suggested, I fail to see that it would work successfully. We all know, what has been the result of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, passed last year. No one will say that it has been a success. As a matter of fact, it is not being administered-. It is almost impossible,I should imagine, to administer it with the machinery at the disposal of the Government. It is being carried out by the Department of Trade and Customs, but the agricultural implements to which it relates are being manufactured throughout the interior of the Commonwealth, in many cases, where no Excise officers are to be found. They are being No made in many small establishments, but, in the aggregate, a very considerable number of these implements are being manufactured far from the seaboard. In reply to questions put to the Minister, I have ascertained that no record is kept of those who are manufacturing these implements. Every maker of them ought to be paying the Excise duty of 12J per cent, imposed .under the Act, unless he has actually proved to the Department that he A full is paying the standard rate of wages. No attempt, however, has been made, so far as I know, to collect that duty. The only possible way of satisfactorily carrying out such' a scheme is that adopted in connection with the sugar industry. In other words, every manufacturer of agricultural implements dealt with by the Act should be called upon to pay the Excise As duty, and the Excise so paid-o r the greater part of it, as in connection with the sugar industry-shoul d be returned by way of bounty to those who comply with the conditions as to labour.",42
346,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member agrees with the principle that the workers The should receive some share of the protection granted to manufacturers?,42
347,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Undoubtedly , I do;, but I do not think that the method adopted is practicable. The Wages Boards ought to be able to grapple with the question. ,",42
348,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In several of the. States no Wages Board exists.,43
349,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But all the' States may adopt the system. Queensland is new passing a Bill providing for its introduction into that State.,43
350,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Tasmani a has no Wages Board.,43
351,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt she soon will have such a system; but the difficulty caused by the absence of a Wages Board may be obviated. The point is that if the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, dealing as it does with only a wry limited branch of an industry, breaks down, an attempt to apply the system to the whole of the protected industries, of Australia must necessarily break down under 'its own weight. It would be practically impossible to administer such a scheme.",43
352,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does the honourable member suggest?,43
353,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is difficult to suggest a remedy. The moment we ignore the operation of the law of supply and demand we are faced with difficulties,, and, apparently, the more we attempt to legislate with a view of overcoming that difficulty the greater are the obstacles that confront us as a result of that further legissecondary lation. I have been somewhat puzzled with one aspect of the sugar bounties question. The estimated revenue from Excise for 1907-8 .at £ 4 a ton is ,£746,000. That is payaible on all sugar produced, so that the estimated yield from the sugar harvest, whether produced by black or white labour, is, presumably, 186,500 tons. Of the estimated revenue of £746,000, one quarter, or £186,500, is retained by the Commonwealth, and three-fourths, £$59>S i i returned to States. That, 00 s however, is by the way. It is estimated that a total sum of ,£573,000 will be disbursed as bounty for the year 1907-8. The bounty is at the rate of /[$ per ton, and, therefore, presumably will be paid on a total production of 191,000 tons, or 4,500 tons in excess of the whole product on which it is estimated that Excise will-be paid. I cannot understand the discrepancy. The question of whether the sugar is grown by black or white labour does not explain it. The bounty is payable only on "" whitegrown "" sugar.",43
354,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-Is the honourable member reckoning in the New South Wales product?,43
355,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I presume that the New South Wales yield is included in both cases.,43
356,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What page of the Estimates is the honourable member quoting from?,43
357,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I took the figures from the Estimates, but I have not made a note of the page.",43
358,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There must be some mistake in the figures,43
359,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The estimated product for next year, including New South Wales and Queensland, is 198,000 tons.",43
360,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government expect to pay the bounty on only 191,000 tons. However, I thought possibly some explanation would be forthcoming from the Minister.",43
361,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall be glad to obtain an explanation and give it to the honourable member.,43
362,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It will be of value to those who take an interest in the sugar industry. Although I have criticised the principle which appears to underlie the Tariff as submitted to this Committee, and although I am opposed to anything in the nature of prohibition, I shall certainly do my best to assist in framing a Tariff which will give a fair measure of protection to or manufacturing industries, so long as the primary industries, which are those in which the State from which I come ismore particularly interested, are not hampered.",43
363,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will inqt the honourable member consider the primary industries of other States?,43
364,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Certainly ; I shall give consideration to all primary industries. I said that my own State is paror ticularly interested in the encouragement of those primary industries, and must be so for many years to come. I speak of the industries which have relation to production from the land through agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and mining. As an indication of what perhaps would be called an anomaly in the Tariff, and therefore capable of easy correction, I may mention that not only are the tanners in Queensland, as a body, opposed to the proposed duty on leather, but so also are the boot and shoe makers. They have met together and agreed to joint resolutions condemning the Tariff as it stands. Too much protection has been given to the tanners, and they recognise that the proposed duties will practically stifle the boot making industry in Queensland, unless the duty on boots is further raised. There are many such anomalies.",43
365,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do they want the duty on boots increased?,44
366,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , they want the duty on leather reduced.",44
367,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What kind of leather,44
368,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I cannot say at this moment.,44
369,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is all-important.,44
370,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At all events, it the leather which is covered by a duty that they consider excessive.",44
371,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The tanners asked for a higher duty, at any rate. ' Colonel FOXTON - They are asking now that it should be reduced.",44
372,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is through the pressure of the bootmakers.,44
373,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think so.,44
374,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I know all about it.,44
375,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is what are asking for, and they ought to know their own business best. Taking it all round, I feel very much inclined-subjec always to the proviso as to the special servation of the interests of the primary industries, where 'a departure from the Tariff Commission's reports is support as a general rule the recommendations which the protectionist section of the finition. Commission have made.",44
376,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Fremantle) [5.59] When first Federation was advocated, I understood that it was to be in the inteour rests of all Australia, but in the inminerals, formation received from all parts of the Continent within the last few harass weeks we have evidence that people are very much dissatisfied. I trust that honorour able members, in dealing with the Tariff and other proposals brought before us, will endeavour to create a better feeling the part of the people towards Federation. There is no doubt that the union was tended to promote the interests of Australia; but. from what I have seen here, I think are really legislating for the bourne and Sydney. No doubt these are two large and important cities, but we must tion ? not forget that the welfare of Australia, as a whole,, is of paramount importance. would think, sometimes, from hearing desions. bates in this House, that Melbourne and Sydney were in no way dependent on the country. But we must all acknowledge the people of the towns feel a drought just as much and as quickly as do the people in the country-that if the country is not perous the towns cannot be prosperous. As a matter of fact, we, in Australia, are all dependent on our primary industries. I am a protectionist, but I have never advocated, and never shall advocate, any legislation which would have the effect of in any way injuring our primary industries, because I ? fail to see how any country can be prosperous where the legislation is prejudicial to what is really the basis of our wealth. Of course, as a protectionist, I believe in is the establishment of industries, and shall always be found voting in favour of legislation which has that object. No one can saly that Australia requires more than reasonable protection; and when I use the word "" reasonable,"" I mean protection that will not injure the primary industries.",44
377,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So that is the honourable member's definition of reasonable protection ?,44
378,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I should say that it they is the only sensible definition.,44
379,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am pleased to hear it .,44
380,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If a man defines prot tection as something to injure the primary conindustries, he would be mad to advocate the policy. I may be wrong in my definition, but I shall adhere to it until it is required-to proved to be wrong.",44
381,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think it is a capital de,44
382,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unti l we have power, by legislation, to increase the value of our wool, wheat, flour, meat, butter, and also gold, silver, lead, copper, tin, and other which we send for sale in the markets of the world, we cannot afford to the-producers of those commodities. To harass those producers means to injure own country, and pettifogging legislation, which keeps the community in such a state of uncertainty that people do not on really know what to expect next, is not, and cannot be, in the best interests of Australia. inWe, in the Opposition corner, have been accused of depreciating Australia; but I we have never heard one word here to justify good of Melsuch an accusation.",44
383,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who made the accusa r,44
384,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member One for West Sydney did so on several occaI thought the question might be asked, and I made a note of the fact. I know too much of Australia to think of dethat preciating the country in any way. We have the most magnificent resources of any country in the world ; these ""exist not only prosin one direction, but in many. There is gold in all the States, especially in Western Australia, in the north-west of which' large gold and tin mining areas are being opened up in districts which were little thought of a few years ago. The honourable member for Coolgardie, in whose electorate these areas are, will bear me out in my statement. Then, I suppose, there is no country in the world with such magnificent iron ore deposits as lie untouched in Australia. I hear that on the north-west coast of Western Australia there is a huge deposit. We all know of the deposits in Tasmania, of the Iron Knob in South Australia, and of similar wealth in New South Wales. Up to 'the present, little or nothing has been done to develop thosevaluable deposits; but I hope that some action will be taken before long. I suppose that Australia produces the best wool in the world; and taking them altogether we should be proud of its vast resources. So far from depreciating Australia, I am so satisfied with it, after a residence of nearly thirty years, that I am not likely to move on the chance of finding a better country. We require chiefly men. of energy and pluck, and the more we leave our primary producers alone, the more prosperous they will be.",44
385,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Would the honourable member say the same of manufacturers? ' Mr HEDGES. - That is another proposition, with which I have not yet dealt. It has been pointed out that only 7 per cent, of the land in Australia is alienated - that .03 per cent, yet belongs to the Crown.",45
386,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Centra l Australia.,45
387,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall deal with Central Australia. When we consider that the. water that flows out of Australia at Gbblwa flows from North Queensland over, I suppose, the greatest distance that water can flow in Australia, we can realise, the areas which, though now only .sheep - runs, might be irrigated, and thus afford employment to thousands of people. The production of wheat and other cereals is a big industry, which is yet only in its infancy, for, in my opinion, cereals can be grown in huge areas where at' present there is an idea that their cultivation is impossible. In Western Australia, only ten years ago, wheat was being grown as far east as Northam; but I can assure honourable members that now there are splendid crops 100 miles nearer the gold-fields",45
388,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I saw some wheat being grown at Kalgoorlie.,45
389,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Whea t can be seen growing at Kalgoorlie as well as anywhere else. Possibly the largest area in Australia of land suitable for wheat-growing is to be found in Western Australia. At the present time, in that State, light railways for the development of the country are being constructed, and I feel quite certain that it will yet be one of the largest wheat-producing States in the Commonwealth. I speak from actual knowledge of the country, and not of what I have been told, or of what I have read. I was. at Broken Hill in the early days, and at Kalgoorlie shortly after it was discovered, and I have seen the more recently discovered mineral deposits to which I have already referred. Settlement in Australia must experience the phases through which it passes in other countries, and it cannot be forced. First of all, the land is devoted to the rearing of sheep and cattle, then, as the country becomes mere settled, various forms of agriculture are - developed, and, as population increases, we must go in for manufactures to provide employment for our people. Honourable members will admit that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth that as much of our land as possible should be utilized, and that as many of our people as possible should bo* engaged in production from the land. We do not want people to flock to the towns in any greater number than we can possibly help. Personally, I should like to see one-half of the people who are now living in the towns of the Commonwealth scattered over lands that are not being utilized.",45
390,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member would not like to see that happen in Fremantle. Mr HEDGE'S - I certainly should, and if I could bring it about I believe I huge should be returned unopposed at the next election. We have obtained peaceful possession of - Australia. Great Britain has been our protector against foreign invasion, and we have been free from wars with. native tribes. The early settlers of New Zealand, of America, and of South Africa had to fight the native inhabitants of those countries in order to hold them. Millions of money were spent, and hundreds of thousands of lives were lost, in the struggle to hold those countries. The people settling them had to borrow money to be spent in defence, for which they had nothing to show but a number of widows, orphans, and cripples. They could ill afford to lose the men or the money, but they were compelled to lose both in order to hold the country. We have been told by honourable members in the Labour corner that in Australia we are in an awful position because we owe so much money. I cannot agree with that contention. I do not believe that we are in any way distressed by the amount of money we owe. It must not be forgotten that we have magnificent assets to represent the money we have borrowed. I am not afraid, if others are, and I can see nothing alarming in the borrowing of so much money when we have it represented by such assets as we possess in Australia. As money accumulates, it must be used, and it is important only that it should be used productively. Australia could not be developed without the expenditure of a great deal of money. I remind honourable members that the man who can use money, and pay good interest for its use, is of as much benefit to the man who has money to invest as is the man who has money to the man who requires it for the purpose of starting an industry. The total debt of Australia in 1906 amounted to £243,473,785. That is a very large sum, but how is it invested? In the items of railways and telegraphs alone we have in Australia a magnificent asset, representing £150,000,000. few countries in the world own their railway and telegraph systems. The Government of Great Britain, for instance, does not own the railway systems of the country. I suppose these are among the finest assets a country can possess. The other £100,000,000 of our total debt is represented by works constiucted for water supply, sewerage, harbour and river improvements, lighthouses, docks, bridges, roads, defence works, schools, and other public buildings, and assistance given to immigration. we consider the area of Australia, the extent of our seaboard, and the number of our harbors and rivers, it must be admitted that £100,000,000 is not much to owe when it is set against the work which has been done by the expenditure of that money. In all the circumstances, it is ridiculous for honourable members to contend that the debt of Australia is any serious burden on the country. money"" .we have borrowed has riot been spent in war, it has not been blown away in ammunition., or expended upon obsolete war material. The money ' borrowed by the various States has been spent honestly and wisely by people who were legislating before we appeared on the scene, and every penny we owe is represented by something done. I believe that the money borrowed by Australia has been as well spent as money borrowed by any country in the world.",45
391,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Le t us borrow another £100,000,000.",46
392,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The borrowing of such a sum would not be a matter of very much consequence if we had a sufficient population. We must hold Australia for our own people, and open it up as it should be opened up. What we require to do is to enact legislation which will give people confidence to invest in Australia the money they make in this country. Some people speak as though money spent on public works were lost to the people of the country, but it is not so. If money does not leave our shores our people have it still. What we should complain of is the sending of money from Australia to purchase things which we can make here. When we have a railway to build half the money required for its construction is sent from Australia, or is kept in the old country, ""to pay for rails, fastenings, and other materials' required, which are not made in Australia. Very Mr THOMAS - Do we send money or goods to England.?",46
393,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We send goods to England, and should receive money for them. If we were making steel rails and ether railway material with Australian money in Australia,, we should retain the money now sent abroad for that material, and we should be the richer by that amount, plus the value of the material manufactured in the country. If the people's savings are invested in the establishment of local industries. Australia geneWhen rally must be benefited. If their surplus cash were used to develop Australia, it would not increase our debt, and, at the same time, it would be a good investment. If we could only teach Australians to have confidence in their country, and, instead of - locking up their money, or not knowing what to do with it",46
394,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"For instance, the surplus cash might be used to build a railway from The here to Perth.",46
395,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It might be employed in making the rails for the construction of a railway. It is most important that the iron industry should be established here, with Australian money. If Australians were to invest £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 tomorrow in the iron industry, it would be quite safe.",46
396,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member mean, if the Government were to put that amount into the industry ?",47
397,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No . If the people would only invest their money in an industry of that kind it would not leave these shores.,47
398,Mr LIDDELL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"W it h this Tariff resting upon their shoulders, they will have no money to spare for investment.",47
399,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the Government establish a prohibitive Tariff, they will be taking the money out of the people's pockets instead of borrowing from them and pay-, ing interest. We must keep the gold in the country. I want steel rails, fencing wire, and everything which can be made from native iron ores to be made here. I presume that if it is to be used, in the future Northern Australia must be opened up by means of steel rails, steel sleepers, and steel bridges. If wooden materials were used for that purpose it would be eaten by white ants as fast as it could be laid, and in twenty years there would be no asset left for the people. But if we converted our iron deposits into steel rails, and constructed railways, we should develop the country, and leave an asset for posterity. The money would be paid in wages, but it would circulate through other channels.",47
400,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The money would still be in the country.,47
401,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , it would come back to the people, who could lend it to the Government again. Surely the Government is not afraid to pay a little interest for the use of the money ! If a working or other man can save £ 1 0 0 , he has sufficient confidence in his country to invest that sum in some Government or other security. If we only knew bur duty, we would not be afraid to use such money.",47
402,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member advocate the establishment of State banks ?,47
403,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is another change to which we may come presently. I contend that Australia will not be impoverished in any way by using the money which belongs to her people. It is the export ot gold to pay for every little thing we want which is impoverishing the country. Are the Government proceeding in the right way to develop Australia when they submit a Tariff of this kind?,47
404,Mr LIDDELL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,47
405,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"W it h regard to the establishment of industries in Australia, I can cite a little history to prove that it is necessary to exercise great care. It is of no use to spoon-feed or to ladle gold out of the Treasury to an industry, and imagine that it can be established by that method. Some years ago Fulton's foundry, in Adelaide, was helped in every possible way by the Government. Perhaps a portion of the debt which the Commonwealth will be asked to take over from South Australia was employed in helping that foundry. It was closed years ago. Again, take the Phoenix foundry, in Ballarat, which established locomotive building.",47
406,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was not established by the Government. Mr 'MAUGER - No , by private enterprise.",47
407,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did not the Phoenix foundry build locomotives for the Government ?,47
408,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,At what price?,47
409,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At a price higher than that of imported locomotives. That foundry is now closed. Again, take Martin's foundry, .at Gawler, in South Australia, which made good machinery for agriculture, mining, and other purposes. They were assisted in every possible way by the Government. They built very good locomotives-- I am now using five or six of them-bu t notwithstanding all the help which was given to them, it was recently stated in the press the business was being wound up. I wish to show honourable members that even a duty of 25/30, or 40 per cent, will not establish an industry if it is not started on a proper basis. I am not prejudiced. I want to show that very often bad management is the cause of failure.",47
410,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not the duties at all . ',47
411,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ver y often the failure of an enterprise is due to bad management. In Victoria today locomotives are being built in the Newport shops as good as, perhaps better than, any which could be purchased in any part of the world. Those locomotives should serve as an object lesson of what can be done if we only get the right man to apply his energy and knowledge to an enterprise.",47
412,Unknown,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. ' Mr HEDGE'S - At Newport locomotives are being built for £ 1 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 , 0 0 0 less than they could be purchased for in other countries. I am under the impression, too, that they are being built by Australians. I know that Australians, if properly trained, are quite capable of handling any industry which may - be established in our midst. In proof of that, I may say that the Kalgoorlie mines are being conducted by managers who were born in and have been trained in the Commonwealth, and the work which they are doing compares more than favourably with that which is being performed .in any other part of the world. I have been assured that this is so by men who are capable of judging. I may add that I have had a good deal of experience with workmen, both in Australia and in England, and I consider that in the carrying out of big undertakings the Australian workman cannot lie surpassed. Our men may be a little harder to handle than are those from other countries, but if I were going to another - country to build a railway or to undertake any other big work, I should like to take a team of Australians with me.",47
413,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member would take Victorians, 1 suppose?",48
414,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I might take a small percentage of them, but I should need to catch them when they were a little bit younger than is the honourable member. In making the comparison which I have made between the work performed in other countries and that which is being undertaken in the Newport railway work-shops, ray object was to show clearly that the establishment of an industry does not necessarily depend upon how much money may be invested in it. Careful thought and proper management are essential to the success of any industry. One grievance which I desire to ventilate has reference to the duty which is at present operative upon steel rails, and to the proposed duty which will be levied upon them under Division VI . A of the Tariff. I am willing to support-and 1 hope that honourable members will do likewise-the payment of a bounty for the manufacture of steel rails in Australia. But until we are nroducing these rails they ought to be admitted free. We must remember that we have a huge area to develop, and I am certain that dear railways are. of no use to any country. We want cheap railways, and I hope that we shall eventually manufacture steel fails locally even more cheaply than they - can now be obtained from the mother country.. That is one reason why I hold that no duty should be levied upon these rails. There is another phase ofi this question- a very serious one-to which I desire to call attention. At the present time railways which are being paid for out of loan moneys are being constructed in Western Australia and other parts in the Commonwealth. Of course, Ministers will say, "" But 75 per cent, of the duty collected upon steel rails is returned to the States."" That, I submit, is not the question at issue. Whatever amount may be returned to the States Treasurers is received by them as revenue, and as such is expended, notwithstanding that it may be money which has been borrowed. The portion retained by the Comrhon- wealth is also borrowed money. In other words, the duty upon steel rails is paid with borrowed money. That is a nice dilemma in which to place the States Treasurers. They pay the duty upon steel rails out of lain funds, and it is returned to them, in the form of revenue. Such a course of action must hurt the Commonwealth in the future, when it takes over the States debts. .It may happen that the Commonwealth, when it is taking over the States debts, may say of a railway or waterworks scheme in course of construction, ""Oh, these do not represent the full amount of the loans raised for these undertakings."" But the States would then be in a position to reply, "" That is so, but the Commonwealth has collected 25 per cent, of the loans in the form of duties upon materials, and we have expended our portion of it. The Commonwealth must take over the loans in their entirety. Although the works do not represent all that we borrowed in connection with them, they represent all that the Commonwealth would allow us to have of those loans."" The same remark would apply to the duty levied upon railway wheels and axles. Railway wheels cannot be made in Australia. I defy anybody to manufacture them locally under present conditions.",48
415,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Are they not being made at Newport?,48
416,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , and they never have been. If the honourable member will refer to the reports of the Tariff Commission, he will find that the representative of Walkers' 'Limited, Maryborough, Queensland, declares that railway wheels cannot be manufactured in Australia, and that the quantity required in the Commonwealth is not sufficient to warrant the establishment of the industry here. I can assure the Committee that a very marked improvement in the construction of these wheels has taken place during the past few years. Formerly their centres used to be cast with wrought-iron spokes, but now they., are composed of one piece Further, special knowledge will be required before we can manufacture wheels which will run safely upon our Australian railways. I fail to see that it is fair to impose a duty of 2*5 per cent, upon an article which is being used to replace wheels which have been worn out upon the States railways-a n article which' could not be manufactured here if we offered .£1,000 for its production. Yet, within the past month, this very article has been landed at Fremantle, and a duty of 25 per cent, has been collected upon it. I come now to the case of wire netting - From page 29 of one of the Tariff Commission's reports, I learn that this netting is made by machinery from imported wire. I ask honourable members to reflect upon the splendid nature of the industry which we are endeavouring to foster. One workman who gave evidence before the. Commission testified that he received 8s. 6d. for making 1,200 yards of wire netting 4 feet wide. Now, 1,200 yards. is equivalent to two-thirds of a mile.",48
417,Mr LIVINGSTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely he made a mistake ?,49
418,Mr EDWARDS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The machine makes the netting ,49
419,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . Seeing that one man can make two-thirds of a mile of wire netting for 8s. 6d., what a. splendid industry it is to make a fuss about, and to permit of bad feeling being engendered between New South Wales and the Commonwealth ! While the proposal of the Government is - being argued, the rabbits are free to spread all over Australia.",49
420,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How long would it take a man to earn that 8s. 6d. ?,49
421,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I suppose he would do it in a day. Anyway, the wire netting is made of imported material with imported machinery, and the"" industry is not .worth troubling about. Then consider the'effect of the 'Tariff upon tobacco. I have a list of prices sent out since .the Tariff was introduced, and it shows such increases as from 53. 6d. to 8s., from 4s. 4d. to 5s."" 2d., from 4s. 4^d. to 5s. i d . , and from 6s. 6d. to 7s. These increases f all on those who . smoke tobacco. In addition to duty, however, we in Western Australia have to pay freight on bringing the tobacco over 2,000 miles by sea, and additional freight on sending it long journeys inland, sometimes' extending over 300 or 400 miles. Next take sugar. Western Australia fconsumes about 11,000 tons of sugar annually. of steel. We are paying £ 6 per ton more for it now than Ave paid before Federation.",49
422,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There was no duty on sugar in Western Australia prior to Fede- ration.,49
423,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The duty makes all the difference.,49
424,Mr EWING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How much Excise does Western Australia get out of it?,49
425,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The people who buy the sugar receive no ""direct advantage from the Excise. I am talking about the effect of the Tariff upon the purchaser. The Minister of Defence might as well ask me how much the tobacco smoker gets out of the Excise. Then take chairs. It seems to me that the Ministry do not want people to sit down, but wish to keep them moving. In one instance, 120 cases of chairs were consigned to Fremantle. Under the old Tariff the duty would have been £ 7 6 , but under the new Tariff, at 7s. 6d. per chair, it-amounted to £ 1 , 0 8 0 . Then take railway wheels and axles. These are articles that cannot be made in Australia. . The Western Australian Government imported wheels and axles to be put under vehicles made in Western Australia by Australian .labour. The value of the imports was £ 4 , 8 1 5 , and the duty amounted £ 1 , 2 0 4 .",49
426,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member would not object to the duty if the goods could be made here, would he?",49
427,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should like them to be made here, but I should like to see bounties given to encourage the establishment of industries rather than high duties. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Where are we to get the money from, especially as the Commonwealth is approaching so closely to its margin of Customs and Excise revenue ?",49
428,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At any rate, it is a. fact that these wheels and axles cannot be made in Australia, and it is hardly a fair thing to add 25 per cent, to their price: One of my chief objections to the new Tariff is on account of the effect it will have upon mining. In this respect it esr pecially concerns Western Australia. Mining in Australia directly employs 111,714 men, according to a document supplied to us by the Government. Thousands of persons depend upon these men. The value of the plant and the industry is £12,476,177: I am proud to say that of the total number of men employed in mining, Western Aus* tralia employs 20.000. I claim that they should be well and generously treated by 'Parliament in framing the Tariff, because our miners live chiefly upon the produce - of theeastern States. That is to say, the butter, cheese, bacon, tinned fruit , tinned meat, clothes, and similar articles they use are imported from the east.",49
429,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are hoping that that will not continue long.,50
430,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But . I am dealing with the facts as they exist. The value of the mining plant in Western Australia is £4,395>4&°",50
431,Mr AUSTIN ICHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member knows that good railway engines are being made at Newport; why cannot we make mining machinery ? .' Mr HEDGES - I will show what can be done in that direction. I admit that the engineering business of Australia is very important. The men employed in it mimber' 15,02*2, and the engineering plant is . valued at £ 1 ^ 9 5 , 6 3 7 . But, compare those figures with the value of the mining plant in Western Australia, £ 4 , 3 9 5 , 4 8 0 , and with the miners employed in Australia, 11^714. The discovery of gold made not only Western Australia, but the whole Commonwealth. It led to the introduction into Australia of the right sort of men, who assisted in opening up the country and building up our many industries. We should be careful not to retard or hamper in any way the mining industry. In Western. Australia at the present time .those engaged in mining labour under many disadvantages. We have from 400 to 600 miles of rail carriage from the coast to the gold-bearing belt in the interior, and the very food supplies obtained by the gold-fields from the eastern States have to be carried: over 2,000 miles hy sea. Surely when those living there are handicapped to such an extent in this respect we'should not attempt to tax all their requisites,, including tobacco. - - Mr TUDOR - Will the honourable member vote against the tobacco duties ? . Mr HEDGES - The rejection of the tobacco duties is a questionfor the Committee to consider. The value of produce annually purchased by Western Australia from the eastern States is nearly £3,000,000. In five years Western Australia has sent to the eastern States, in money orders alone, an enormous sum. . I have no details as to the cash so remitted to Tasmania or' Queensland, but during the'period in question a sum of £417,90 5 9s. 7d. was sent to New South Wales, ^£348,140 6s - to South Australia, and £1,088,478 12s. i o d . to Victoria. If we deduct from the total the amount sent from the east to the west, namely, £ 2 3 8 , 0 1 3 5s. 7d., we have a balance of £1,616,51.1 2s. iod. in favour of the east, or over ,£1.000 for every working day during the term of five years. These figures should convey to the Committee some idea of the value cff Western Australia's custom to the eastern States.",50
432,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Le t us hope that we shall not repeat the dose, but that Western Australia will soon supply her own requirements ",50
433,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so. The importance of the mining industry to Australia is not full y recognised. I propose to put before the Committee a few facts gleaned from an undoubtedly reliable source.. The managers of the mines in Western Australia are Australians who believe in Australia, and on the mines there we have the most up-to-date plants in the Commonwealth. The gold yield of Western Australia up to the end of July, 1907, was 17,633,042 ozs., valued at £74,899,496. During 1906 ten mines, employing 4,775 hands, paid in wages to their employees £1,005,373. These mines are in the Kalgoorlie belt, and consist of the Golden Horseshoe, Ivanhoe, Great Boulder, Boulder Perseverance, Oroya Brown. Hill , Hainault and Kalgurli, Associated, Lake View, and the Associated Northern. The value of the stores and requisites, annually purchased by them, exclusive of mining timber or water, is £ 5 1 2 , 1 1 7, and. the new Tariff will involve them in an additional expenditure of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum,. The figures I have quoted were compiled by the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Commerce, a body of men as capable as any to be found in Australia. I submit these figures with the greatest confidence. They have been compiled by Australians who believe in Australia, and none of them would do anything to injure his country. The Lake View Mine, employing 400 men and paying £ 8 7 , 0 0 0 a year in wages, is working on such a narrow margin of profit that if the Tariff be passed in its present form it is doubtful whether it will be able to continue its operations. The Kalgoorlie Electric Power and Lighting Corporation contemplated erecting a new plant of the value of £ 1 2 , 0 0 0. Owing to the new Tariff they have abandoned the project. The consequence is the loss to Australia of the money that would have been spent on labour, railway carriage, and in other directions. hear that all kinds of machinery can be made in 'Australia equal to the imported. I am very .sorry to have to put these figures before the Committee, but I want honourable members to know the facts, and to think them over. The Ivanhoe mine, at Kalgoorlie, had a battery of sixty head of stampers, colonial made. The tonnage put through per stamp per day-wha t is called the duty per stamp per day-wa s 4.16 tons. That means short tons of 2,000 lbs. The cost of milling with that colonial battery was 6s. 1 id. per ton. That battery was "" scrapped,"" and replaced with an imported battery of 100 head of stampers. The duty per stamp per day of this battery was 6 tons, and the cost of milling was 2s. 2 d. per ton. Even allowing for L the reduced price of water and other items, which bring the charge for milling for the old battery down to 5s; 5d., the difference is still 3s. 2^d. in favour of the imported battery. How can the men who are running these mines, even though they be Australians, be in favour of sticking to obsolete machinery when with imported machinery they can work a mine which otherwise would have to be shut down ? That instance is eclipsed by another from the same mine. The amount crushed per month by the old' mill- a colonial battery-wa s 6,932 tons. amount of fuel used was 8.37 cwt. per ton crushed. The new .mill crushed 17,155 tons per month, and the fuel used was 2.91 cwt. per ton. Those are facts.",50
434,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What was the date of the Australian machinery? The cases are not parallel.,51
435,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I can only tell the honoiable member the actual facts. He can think them over and sleep on them, but he cannot alter them. I can give samples of the efforts made by colonial manufacturers to supply the wants of the gold mining industry. They must pull themselves together and do better work in the future. Mr Moss, the manager of the Kalgoorlie mine, ordered twenty head of colonial stamps, and had a guarantee that they would be delivered on 16th October, 1906. After a lot of worry and trouble, delivery was completed in March, 1907, and even thenportions of the battery that was to be colonial made came from two firms in England. The same mine ordered a colonial air-compressor. Delivery ""was guaranteed for October, 1906, and was only made in March, 1907. The note about it is, "" Five We weeks run, stoppages frequent, longest run 83 hours without a stop."" The same mine purchased six grinding pans ofcolonial make. The maker had three fitters working for about three weeks on them. Portions had to be sent to a local foundry to rectify errors before the mine would accept delivery. As a contrast, they purchased a 450 horse-power imported engine,, which' was delivered to time, started work as soori as fixed, and has not stopped working since. Those facts show that we must not listen to all the talk about colonial makers being able to do better than Englishmen, or any one else in the world. Let them recognise that they have a lot to learn yet, especially in constructing machinery that will bring down the cost in an industrylike mining, where values are getting lower from year to year, and managers are at their wits' end to know .how to reduce costs without cutting down wages.",51
436,Mr COON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All . the evidence given before the Tariff Commission is against what the honourable member is stating now.,51
437,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Nothin g of the kind. Three mines at Kalgoorlie proposed to purchase high class up-to-date electrical machinery, of a value of £9,000. That transaction has been abandoned on account of the proposed new Tariff-anothe r case of loss to Australia of the work that that The new machinery would have given in the handling of products that can not be handled with obsolete machinery. The eastern States are now prosperous, and should have a little consideration for the western State. From 1902 to 1905 the eastern States suffered from very bad times. In fact I am under the impression that Western Australia pulled them out of the mud and kept them going. Western Australia bought all the horses and produce she required from the eastern States, and, in addition, absorbed their surplus population, who there found work. Much of the money, made in Western Australia has been brought.back to the east, and is being used in the purchase of new areas of land for settlement.",51
438,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wester n Australia would never have been alive if Victoria had not pushed her along. - Mr HEDGES - I am under the impression that the assistance came from Western Australia to Victoria. Had the Postmaster General been in the chamber a little while ago, he would have heard me say. that wealth to the extent of £""74,000,000 had been produced out of the earth in Western Australia, and that much of this had gone to promote the prosperity of Victoria.",51
439,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is trying to make out that Western Australia is a suburb of Victoria.,52
440,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the impression which honourable members opposite are endeavouring to convey. But the most important point for us is the unity of federated Australia,, and we have to consider whether the action of the present Government is conducive to that unity. On every hand there is discontent. Even in Perth today secession medals are worn in the streets, and people are waving black flags, ornamented with skulls, and bearing the inscription, "" Death to Federation !"" In Sydney, similar sentiments are uttered, and Queensland cannot be said to be contented with the present conditions; yet the Government are offering preference to Great Britain.",52
441,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely the honourable member is in favour of preference?,52
442,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am in favour of preference to our own States first. It is acknowledged that charity begins at home, arid that if we have anything to give away, we ought to give it to our poor relations. According to page 335 of the official report of the Imperial Conference, the Acting Prime Minister, almost with tears in his eyes, offered to help England at the expense of Australia. The honourable gentleman saidIt may reasonably be asked what we expect in return. We are making or seeking no stipulated bargain. The whole of this question is founded on aspirations much higher than that. It is the unity of the Empire that we are looking to, and we believe that preferential trade will bring this about at no cost to Great Britain. Lofty ideals ! We are told by honourable members opposite that we shall never be. able to liquidate our indebtedness to Great Britain; and yet we find our representatives at the Imperial Conference offering help to. the old land. It appears, however, that our kind offers were not fully appreciated ; because the representatives of Great Britain refused them, pointing out that anything that we could do for Great Britain in the way of preference would probably increase the cost of food to the people"" there. This is hot the first time that offers of preference by Australia have been refused, because we find a similar attitude""taken by New Zealand; It shows what good seasons will do for Australia, when' we find the Commonwealth [to?] Government offering to help Great Britain out of her difficulties. The Acting Prime Minister presented the beautiful ideal of the unity of the Empire; but do honourable members not think that much good work could be done in our own land in the way of uniting the States of .Australia? There are many causes for the disrepute into which Federation has fallen. Taxes have been imposed on wire netting, steel rails, chairs, railway wheels, tobacco, mining machinery, cornsacks, and many other commodities.",52
443,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable member mind telling me whether he is a free-trader or a protectionist?,52
444,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All the commodities that are proposed to be taxed are directly connected with the primary industries of Australia; _ and it is little wonder that we find dissatisfaction in the States. It would appear as though the Government, had laid themselves out to harass everv Australian industry; and yet at the same time they offer preference to Great Britain and New Zealand. All the produce of Australia has to be sold in the markets of the world at the prices there ruling; and if we harass the primary industries we must injure this .country. In the case of woollens and similar goods, we find that Great Britain already supplies us with 75 per cent., and the purchase of the balance of 25 per cent, from foreigners or locally only keeps the British merchants in check. If they had the whole of the trade, there is no telling what prices they might charge us. I am not such a believer in the British merchant as to think he would not avail himself of the opportunity' to get a higher price if he had the chance. The trade of Great Britain is not declining at such a rate that she requires help from Australia. Honourable members opposite have expressed grave fears that .British trade is depreciating; but, according to page 383 of the report of the Imperial Conference, Mr Lloyd George laughed at such fears, and pointed out that the increase in the cotton trade alone, in four years, represented £20,000,000, or more than the whole of the trade with Australia. The Imperial authorities will not accept pur offer of preference; they are evidently not afraid that British trade is going down too fast. From the tone of the speeches to which I have listened in this debate, I should say that there is no possible chance of the Tariff passing in its present form. I expect it will be considerably modified and toned down. It is, I think, the duty of every member of the Committee in dealing with the Tariff to see that no Australian industry, and especially none of our primary industries, is in any way injured by it. "" There is one subject on which I must touch in conclusion.. Many suggestions have been made in connection with the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions. I think the honourable member for South Sydney said that old-age pensions can never be established in Australia unless by direct taxation.",52
445,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not what he said.,53
446,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am under the impression that it is quite unnecessary that we should go in for, direct taxation, or even that we should collect any more revenue than was collected under the old Tariff, to provide, for the payment of old age pensions. .,. Mr Frazer. - That is whilst the Braddon section of the Constitution is in operation.",53
447,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not dealing with the Braddon section at all.,53
448,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member did not correctly state what the honourable member for South Sydney said.,53
449,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Order . I have repeatedly called honourable members to order, and I hope they will cease their interjections.",53
450,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise to a point of order. I ask your ruling as to whether, when an honourable member makes a statement to the effect that he is quoting what some othep honourable member has said, and his statement is not a correct representation of what the honourable member to whom he refers actually did say, it is not his duty to accept an assurance that he is misrepresenting the honourable member whom he professes to quote?",53
451,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is always the practice for one honourable member to accept another's statement as to what he said. Every honourable member makes his statements believing them to be correct. If the honourable member for Fremantle was quoting the honourable member for South Sydney inaccurately, I hope he will not continue that course.",53
452,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am under the im r pression that what I said was absolutely correct. I took a note of the statement made by the honourable member for South Sydney, and I know it was to the effect that old-age pensions could not be brought about except by direct taxation.",53
453,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,During the continuance of the operation of the Braddon blot.,53
454,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I did not mention the Braddon blot. I am under the impression that the statement. I have attributed to him was made by the honourable member for South Sydney. If it is shown that I am wrong, I shall be willing subsequently to attribute it to the honourable member who really did make it. Mr W. H. IRVINE!-The honourable member for South Sydney said subject to the limitation imposed during the period for which the Braddon blot is in. operation. 1",53
455,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What I wish to say in connection with old-age pensions is that it is necessary only to divert revenue now collected into another channel to make the requisite provision. As a large employer of labour, and one connected with the mining industry of Western Australia, I can inform the Committee that we have in operation in that State a Workmen's Compensation Act, under which it has been found necessary for employers to insure their workmen. The amount provided for differs according to the calling in which a workman is engaged, and is arrived at in a very simple manner. We pay so much per cent, on the wages earned by men in different callings. What I propose is that this money, instead of being paid to an insurance company-and one company I represent pays as much as .£500 or £ 6 0 0 per annum in this way-shoul d be paid into a State fund. I dislike the term "" old age nensions."" I think that the term used should be "" The Australian Provident Fund.""",53
456,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,""" National Pension "" is the term used in Germany. . Mr HEDGES - I do not know the German for it ; but I suggest that the term should be something like ""The Australian Provident Fund."" I have known"" many young people who, having become incapacitated from work, require assistance from such a fund just as much as if they had become incapacitated by old age. . In such cases the term ""old-age pensions"" is clearly inapplicable. ' The method I suggest for collecting the fund is a very simple one. The various post offices are now under the control of the Commonwealth, and I suggest that in regard to every person, paid wages in any form in. Australia, whether as a servant, coachman, groom, or factory worker, a receipt should be given for the wages received, to which should be affixed stamps purchasable at any of our poslj offices as readily as postage stamps are today. The reason why I say this money should be collected by the State and applied to the purpose I have mentioned is that I have noticed in Western Australia that when an employee has been injured, his case for compensation is contested in the courts by the insurance company, which employs the best legal talent, and the employ^ has also been compelled to employ legal talent. after a long fight an award is made, but very often it is consumed in law costs. In other cases if the employee"" is not very careful the compensation is lost.",53
457,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member favours State insurance, then?",54
458,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , in that form. Perhaps the employee"" has never handled a large sum before. There are always very smart persons with businesses to sell, which very often are not worth as much as is asked for them. If a man who has been injured buys a business, perhaps he may find that his compensation is gone. My chief reason for wanting the State to take over this liability is that, although a man has been compensated, still he is a charge on the State. If a man has been injured the State's liability is not discharged by the compensation which has been paid by the employer. Take a place like Kalgoorlie, where the picked men of Australia are at work. If the money were collected while the men were working it would create a fund which could be utilized, and when a man was injured he could claim compensation without any feeling that he was receiving charity in any form. I believe that the magnitude of the fund which could be created in that way would astonish the people of Australia. In Western Australia we have to pay large sums, but very often the compensation which should have been available to the injured employee"" is consumed in legal expenses. I suggest that the administration of a fund should be entrusted to three persons, namely, a professional man, a representative of the working classes, and a very smart business man. When an employee was .injured, it would not be to the interest of the employer or of the employee to depreciate or magnify the injury. A statement of facts would be handed into the managing committee, who would decide what compensation the injured man was entitled to [107]- 2 receive, and how it should be paid to him. If a man were disabled by old age or injury, he would have no qualms of conscience in accepting a contribution from the fund. He would not be receiving a charity, but a contribution in pursuance of a right. Of course, it could be called State insurance, but I think it is a provident fund in the form of State insurance. That, I claim, is the proper way to proceed, instead of waiting year after year for some action to be taken, and thinking all the while that the only way to attain the desired end was by levying a tax upon Perhaps land or some other thing. At the present time the money which is paid by the employers goes into another channel. It should be collected, and the risk should be taken over by the Government, and not by a company. I am not stating what might be done, but what is being done, and what I have done for years. The men working for the company I am connected with asked us to go further than that. Each month a collection is made for medical and hospital purposes, and every man who is ill or disabled receives £1 or 30s. per, week, as the case may be. He enters the hospital, not as a pauper, but as a paying patient, and the fee is paid from the fund. I believe that if honourable members would take the trouble to look into the system they would realise that it could be established within a very few weeks. It would not necessitate the appointment of a large army of Government officers or the erection of a large building. in' any centre, because the machinery to work the system already' exists. The post offices throughout the Commonwealth could be utilized for the sale of the stamps, and that would provide the necessary revenue. I thanlc honourable members for the patient hearing which they have given to me. I shall reserve anything else I have to say concerning the details of the Tariff until another occasion. ^",54
459,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Boothby) [8.53].^I hope that the honourable member for Fremantle will accept my assurance that the leader of the Labour Party did ""not say, as he represented just now, that it was impossible to raise the money for the payment of old-age pensions without the imposition of a land tax, nor did any honourable member on this side of the chamber, I think, make that statement without the qualifying remark, "" during the continuance of the Braddon blot."" That makes all the dif ference. The whole point was, that, inasmuch as if the Commonwealth wishes to get revenue from Customs duties, it is necessary during the continuance of the Braddon section to raise four 'times as much as may be required, obviouslv' it would be impossible so long as that operates, to raise £1,500,000-whic h would be the smallest amount needed to institute a Federal system of old-age pensions-because it would mean additional Customs taxation amounting to £6,000,000.",54
460,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What I propose would not interfere with that.,55
461,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was rather surprised to hear from the leader of the Government that it is not proposed to enter upon , the consideration of the Tariff in detail as soon as this general debate is finished. Of course the Ministry have the control of the business. I do not wish to find fault with them unnecessarily, but I think that they would be well advised to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff immediately this debate is finished, and not to interpose other business, except, of course, the Estimates, relative to hew works and buildings. We cannot wait until the Tariff has been dealt with to decide what new works and buildings should be proceeded with. Mr STORRER.'-The States want income tax from the Federal officers.",55

463,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The States want revenue.,55
464,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The States will not lose any revenue if the Government adopt the course I have suggested; the postponement, of the Commonwealth Salaries Bill will not affect the Budgets of the States Treasurers at all. I believe that honourable members are almost unanimously in favour of that Bill. I anticipate that there will be very little discussion on the measure. At'the same time it is unnecessary to delay the consideration of the Tariff until it is. settled.",55
465,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"-There will be a great deal* of discussion on the Judiciary Bill - rights -. When he was asked to cite a Mr BATCHELOR^-Certainly. There is ho reason why the Judiciary Bill or the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill should be interposed before the consideration of the Tariff. Uridoubfed'v'some duties will be reduced. The public, therefore,'' are being charged on certain articles 'more""than they will, ultimately' be required to pay. sooner we arrive at a settlement of the Tariff the better for the trading community and the public generally.",55
466,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,At the present time business is almost paralyzed.,55
467,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is our duty to discuss the really serious questions which confront us, and to enter upon the detailed consideration of the Tariff as soon as possible. Seldom in the history of this Parliament has so much attention been paid to the important financial considerations which must very soon be faced-of course, I refer to the future financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth.",55
468,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We cannot afford to lose much time in settling that question.,55
469,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so. The debate which has taken place has been chiefly useful in showing the attitude of the various parties in the Committee towards the financial problems which confront us. I was particularly interested in the policy which was foreshadowed by the Opposition corner party. Although that party is a new one, it appears to have a definite policy, and it certainly represents .more than does any other party in Australia, the conservative view of politics. I find that most members of that party, and also some members of the direct Opposition, have voiced their strong approval of the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Flinders. Consequently, T propose to pay particular attention to his speech. This afternoon the honourable member for Brisbane expressed his entire agreement with the speeches of the honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Fawkner, and some other honourable members upon the opposite side of the Chamber. But I was very much surprised when he made an attempt to inflame the bitter feelings which exist between the States and the Commonwealth. The honourable member justified the talk of secession in Western Australia and New South Wales, and also the attacks upon' Federation, upon the ground that the policy - adopted by this Parliament - is to continually ' encrbach upon State : specific' instance, what'reply did he give? He' stated that our action in regard to - the Sugar Bounty. Act Was an encroachment upon State rights, as was also the proposal of the Treasurer-whic h has not yet - been adopted by Parliament-to abolish - the Braddon section of the Constitution. The After' the way in which the' States without very much - demur contributed to help Queensland out of the difficulty in which she was placed, owing to the necessity which existed for bringing about White Australia conditions, it came with ill-grace from the honourable member to taunt this Committee with having thus created general dislike and disaffection towards the Federation. At least, we might have expected him to support us in that matter instead of taunting us. But the crowning instance which he cited was the proposal of the Acting Prime Minister to discontinue the Braddon section of the Constitution. When he stated that he was in entire accord with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Flinders he must have forgotten that that honourable member had emphatically declared himself as opposed to the continuance of the Braddon section. He may not have used those exact words, but undoubtedly they express his meaning. Now, in regard to this matter, what has the Acting Prime Minister said? Merely this- . With regard to the other question-the continuation of the operation of the Braddon Seclion-it appears very evident, from the figures I have quoted this evening, that such an arrangement, however desirable to the States, will be quite impossible in view of public expenditure which must be. carried out by the Commonwealth. That is all that he said upon the matter. But what did the honourable member for Flinders say in this connection? He said I do not think any scheme-n o matter from what source it may emanate-wil l ever receive the acceptance of this Parliament unless it renders the Commonwealth Legislature-independent in every respect of the finances of the States, and the States Parliaments independent of our finances. Neither the Commonwealth nor the States can proceed with certainty arid advantage in their several developments unless we take the earliest opportunity-that which the Constitution itself prescribes-of rendering the two systems of finance, State and Federal, completely independent of each other. The honourable member elaborated point, and went on to sayWhat ought we to give back to the States? Whilst I recognise that they must be treated fairly-reve n generously-by us, I think that before IQIO any scheme that can possibly be adopted by this House must be one that will render us quite independent in respect of our finances. As long as the States Governments feel that they are dependent to some extent upon our decision as to what we will give them, so long will the irritating sore continue. I quote the remarks of the honourable member-wit h - every word of which. I am in agreement-in complete refutation of the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane, that irritation has been caused in the States by the suggested discontinuance of the Braddon section. As a matter of fact, there is no such irritation. Naturally, many of the States Treasurers desire a continuance of that section. But to say that there has .been any general agitation in that direction, and to allege that the movement in favour of secession' has been fostered by the suggestion to which I have referred is so much idle talk.",55
470,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think that the honourable member is quite fair in saying that the honourable member for Brisbane is in direct antagonism to me, ber cause all that he intended to convey was that we should insure the continuance of a substantial subsidy to the States.",56
471,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What right has the honourable member to accuse us of fostering this movement in favour of secession, because of the suggestion of the Acting Prime Minister that the Braddon section will have to be altered? Everybody will agree that if the Braddon section be abrogated, some other provision will have to be made for the revenues of the States'. No one suggests that we can abolish a provision requiring us to hand over"" to the States three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, without providing in some other manner for - their financial necessities. I never heard of any one suggesting any such thing. The honourable member said that we must be careful not to embarrass the States. We shall all agree with .that. But the point is that it is - not - within the province of a member of this Parliament to inflame an agitation on.th* suggestion that any party in this Committee is attempting to encroach upon the rights of the States, unless he can show some ground for the assertion. If the honourable member his .could have adduced instances to show that there is antagonism towards the States on the part of any honourable member, he ^would have been entitled to make that point. But I have been a member of this Parliament from the commencement, and I know of no instance of a desire to encroach upon the rights of the States or to embarrass them. It is true that there has been a desire, par- , ticularly in regard to industrial legislation, to take over all the powers which the' Constitution gives, us to control industrial conditions - 0 - """,56
472,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And a little more,56
473,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We do not knowexactly what the limitations of the Constitution are.,57
474,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is where the difficulty comes in.,57
475,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If we think that the Commonwealth will be benefited by our taking the very fullest powers in framing our Acts, we are justified in adopting that course. I do not think that any single act of that kind has caused any trouble in the States. As to the taxation of the imports of States Governments, while I very strongly deprecate the action of Mr Carruthers, the Premier of New South Wales, in the wire-netting case, I do not think that it is worthwhile for the Commonwealth to collect revenue upon such importations. may have the power to do so, but I do not think it is desirable to exercise it._ A good reason has been suggested by the ""honourable member for Fremantle, namely, that most of the States' imports are in connection with works which are paid for out of loan moneys. They are generally imports of railway material. The New South'Wales wire netting pertains to the same category. We return to the States three-fourths of the duty which we-collect,. and that money is paid into the general revenue of the States. Strictly speaking, it ought to be credited to the loan account, but it is not treated in that manner. That is a great, mistake. It would be a great deal better for the Commonwealth not to tax State imports at all. I suppose that to do so is in the nature of an assertion of sovereignty. But if we have the power we are not compelled to use it , and j f its exercise is a cause of irritation I believe that honourable members would be quite prepared to let the duty slide. It is not of much value to us. I do not intend to discuss the Tariff at length. I have always taken up a consistent attitude on the question of free-trade and protection. I am a moderate protectionist. Notwithstanding the agitation in favour of high duties, I have neve r'been in favour of eliminating the eler ment of competition, and I do not believe in prohibition. I do, however, believe in effective protection-in giving to our manufacturers a wider field. Generally speaking, I intend to support the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, though on some points I dissent from them. not think that the kerosene tin industry or the wire-twisting industry are worth developing at great cost to the people of this country. I do not say that they are not worth developing in themselves, but certainly they are not at the huge cost that would be necessary if the proposals of the Government were carried out. Some of the other duties appear to me to be unnecessarily high, and I shall not support them. The honourable member for Flinders has said-and , of course, all must agree with him-that so far as the Tariff protects, so far will it be destructive of revenue.",57
476,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Partially .,57
477,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is to say, of course, that if an industry is established the imports will be decreased, and to that extent the duty will be destructive of revenue. We must consider the Tariff in the We light of its revenue-producing possibilities in 19 i o : The honourable' member for Flinders put it that the maximum revenue producing possibilities of the proposed Tariff are about £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . But that argument is not sound. Is it not a fact that so far as the Tariff conduces to the establishment of industries, it will increase our population ?",57
478,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ultimatel y 'it will , of course.",57
479,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not only ultimately, but as soon as industries are established. It is impossible to produce goods unless there are people to do the work. Until an industry is established, the revenue will be maintained through duties on imports, and when an industry is established people will be required to work it , and consequently there will be a larger population.  people will have to pay increased prices.",57
480,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not discussing that point. I am dealing with the revenue-producing possibilities of the Tariff. So far as it is operative in reference to the establishing of industries, so . far will the high duties result in increased revenue. But when industries are established, and we make the goods in the country, the effect must be to attract a larger population, which will mean more revenue from other sources. The statement that the maximum return will be £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, since the Tariff, as it creates new industries, will lead to a decreased reI do venue, is not accurate, because, on the other hand, the expansion of our industries will tend to an increase of population, which will be a set-off against the effect on the revenue of the larger local output.",57
481,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely the honourable member for Echuca is not opposed to the establishment of industries in Australia? ,58
482,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I could understand the honourable member for Flinders, if he were a free-trader, urging that the establishment of new industries would not necessarily increase the population; that it might simply result in men being diverted from existing trades; but since he is a protectionist he cannot use that argument. In the circumstances, therefore, I do not consider that he was wholly right in limiting the possibilities of the Tariff to a return of less than £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.",58
483,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member must not forget that the estimated revenue from the Tariff during the current year shows a very considerable increase upon the returns for last year, which was a boom period.",58
484,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that. am not going to question the general curacy of the honourable member's forecast, but am inclined to think he has not taken into view the possibilities that must upon the establishment of new industries.",58
485,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that they will ultimately ensue.,58
486,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Until they are tablished a heavy increase in taxation must be borne by the people, and we shall have for some little time a revenue largely exI ceeding £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. I admit (hat if the duties are so high as to reduce the consumption of certain goods we must suffer a loss of revenue. Such a reduction is possible in respect of some lines, but necessaries must be purchased regardless cient. of the extent to which prices are inflated by reason of the duties. One of the important points made by the honoiable member for Flinders was that direct taxation was the province of the States, and that the Commonwealth, for all time, must look for the whole of its revenue Customs and Excise duties. that the importance of this question exfor it? ceeded even that of the Tariff) and that in future political battles the dividing line would be between those who claimed that the whole of the revenue required, for Commonwealth purposes should be raised from Customs and Excise duties, and those who urged that some portion should also be obtained by direct taxation. I have no doubt whatever as to what will be the final result of such an issue. .",58
487,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If the honourable member is so confident he will make the honourable member for Flinders alter his bearings.,58
488,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not know that anything I may say is likely to induce him to re-cast his political views. Mr W. H. IRVINE - I am delighted with the candour exhibited by the honourable member. The sooner we reach the issue the better.,58
489,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I cordially reciprocate the feelings expressed by the honourable member. I am delighted with his candour in stating definitely that he and those with whom he is associated are prepared to take up that position. Customs taxation for. revenue purposes is much in the nature of a poll tax. It falls most heavily on those having the largest families, and frequently on the most necessitous. A revenue Tariff is borne by the masses, and I was glad to find I the honourable member candid enough acto admit that, in his opinion, the whole of the revenue of the Commonwealth, which later on would probably be ensue much in excess of our present income, would necessarily be raised entirely from Customs taxation, or, in other words, by taxation imposed on the masses of the people. Customs taxation bears no relaestion whatever to the ability of the individual to pay it , nor to the incomes which may be enjoyed by those on whom it falls. t bears no relation to the natural opportunities-such , for instance, as the ownership of land-of the individual. The mere existence of an individual, apart altogether from the question of whether or not he has any earnings, or is a pauper, is suffiThe poor man has to contribute his mite, and sometimes almost as much most as the inhabitant of Toorak, as some one has said, to the cost of government.",58
490,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has not the honourable member for Flinders shown his to courage by pinning himself down to such He urged a contention, and saying that he will fight",58
491,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have already complimented the - honourable member, who has also urged that we must not embarrass the States. He contends that the Commonwealth must be financially independent ; that the Braddon section must be abolished; and that out of a revenue of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 per annum we must return at least £ 7 , 250,00 0 to the States, unless they are to be embarrassed. I understood the honourable member also to say that for a long period that fixed amount would have to be returned to the States. Throughout his speech the honourable member indicated that he meant that to be a fixed payment to the States for a very long period. But if the population increases considerably, does the honourable member mean that the States should be still limited to a payment of £ 7 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , or would there be any increased payment to them in the future? I do not want to pin the honourable member down to that statement, because I do not think' he could really have meant to limit the payment to the States absolutely to that sum, no matter how much the revenues of the Commonwealth go up, or population increases, or the local expenditure on education, police^ and all the other subjects of State activity is augmented as a necessary corollary to the increase of population.",58
492,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Flinders spoke about it as a permanent settlement.,59
493,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member stated it even more definitely. I thought I had the passage marked. said that the States could not, or should not, look to receive any more than that amount from us. If that was his idea, I do not think it will work. It would be unfair to the States. The right honourable member for Swan made a much more liberal proposition to the States, apart from the continuance of the Braddon section. Personally, I think that the best proposal is a per capita distribution-the payment to the States by the Commonwealth of a fixed amount per head of population. That system would work at first rather unfairly towards Western Australia, and would require a little adjustment, but I believe that that principle will be the proper solution of the difficulty when we do away with the Braddon section. By it the States will be able to'know definitely what amount they will receive from the Commonwealth year by year, and can make all their arrangements accordingly. We, on the other hand will know to a penny what we shall have to expend, as the population statistics are made up every year. I do not - think that there are any difficulties in the way of the adoption of a method of per capita distribution, which will be found most satisfactory to both parties, and have the effect of - allaying a great deal of the existing irritation. The honourable member's computation of a maximum Customs and Excise .revenue of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 leaves us a maximum revenue for our requirements of £1,750,000. The honourable member, however, pointed out that we propose to take over the Northern Territory, and that it will be necessary to undertake a largely increased expenditure on defence. He did not mention old-age. pensions. I do not know whether he did not regard them as a proper subject for early Federal payment. At any rate, he indicated that those, two objects, and the taking over of the Departments that must necessarily be transferred to the Federation, would involve largely increased expenditure on our part. The honourable member, therefore, seems to be in somewhat of a difficulty. If we are going to spend considerably more than we spend now on defence, and to spend largely, as suggested by the "" honourable member, on immigration, as well as take over the Northern Territory, and some of the present State services, obviously a revenue of £1,750,00 0 will not, and cannot, be enough. In these circumstances the honourable member makes no suggestion as to how he would raise additional revenue, unless it is to be inferred that he believes He that we ought to raise considerably more than £ 9 , 000,00 0 by way of Customs and Excise revenue.",59
494,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought it quite enough to state the problem and expect a solution of it from the Government.,59
495,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is all very well, but as the honourable member is so candid, and as it is. not a party question at present, I thought it would not be asking him too much to ask him to suggest a solution of the difficulty.",59
496,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I thought the honourable member, just said that it was going to be the issue between the parties. . Mr BATCHELOR - The honourable member is right I see that, as it is a party question, the honourable member is possibly justified in not stating his policy. We can, however, almost infer it from what he has said. If a revenue of £ 1 , 7 5 0 , 0 00 will not be sufficient for the Commonwealth, if we must undertake largely increased expenditure, absorbing a great deal more, and the honourable member is not in favour of raising a single penny for Commonwealth purposes, except through Customs taxation, there can be only one answer to the question of what his policy is. He must propose to raise a great deal more than £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 by way of Customs taxation from the people.",59
497,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am afraid it will mean good-bye to the free list.,60
498,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no doubt about that. I regret that the honourable member did not mention old-age pensions. That was a notable omission from his speech, but other honourable members in the Opposition corner have expressed their sire to see a Federal system of old-age pensions inaugurated. The honourable member for Flinders suggests as one of the means of meeting future difficulties that ders. we must largely curtail expenditure, and construct some- I do not know whether he meant all-of our new works and buildings out of loan money. That would mean that we should have to give up the policy which we have followed ever since Federation was established.",60
499,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oh , no. The hon the orable member will find that that is not I intimated that there might be a very other buildings. laige reduction effected by not spending all of the £ 8 1 7 , 0 0 0 which is proposed to spent this year on works and buildings.' intimated also that some of these works might fairly be constructed out of shortdated loans with sinking funds.",60
500,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not want to there misquote the honourable member. expressed the opinion that the prosome posed expenditure this year might very well be reduced; and I not only agree with that view, but think it is advisable that it should be reduced. But in connection with difficulty of making both ends meet after 1910, he threw out the. suggestion that we should have to reconsider, to some extent, the policy we have adopted up to the sent, and revert to that which he said had been followed in Victoria, of paying for works of a more permanent character out of loan money.",60
501,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I suggested that the capital expenditure should .be out of expenditure. loans; of course, with' a sinking fund to structed repay it .",60
502,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable vagant than we are today. member suggested that, instead of year by year paying for new works and-buildings out of revenue, we ought to pay some tion out of short-dated loans.",60
503,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In other words, that we should spread the expenditure over several years.",60
504,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That means rowing Mr W. H : IRVINE - It does.,60
505,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course it means borrowing. The proposal of the honourable member, if carried out, would not be so bad as the old States method of borrowing indiscriminately, without providing a sinking fund. But I think the present system, of paying for new works and buildings out of each year's income, is infinitely better debusiness, and must increase our standing as a debt-paying country. The honourable member for Kooyong supported the suggestion of the honourable member for FlinMy own idea is that some of our public buildings are over elaborate, and that some saving might be brought about in this connection. The buildings now being erected are not so elaborate as those put up when the Departments were under the control of the States. But even now, in many instances, bearing in mind the population in several districts, it seems to me that we so. are spending too much on post offices and ' Mr AUSTIN - CHAPMAN - I - hope that the there is none of this excessive expenditure I in South Australia-at Unley, for example.",60
506,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Minister of Trade and Customs ought not to have made that interjection, because at Unley, where is a population of over 20,000 people, He the expenditure on the post office was only £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 . In South Australia we have had to be content with anything but elaborate buildings, and yet we have managed to provide all the facilities that are the provided in New South Wales, Victoria, or any other State. The reason is that; until two or three years ago, there practically was never an elastic, buoyant revenue in South preAustralia, and we had to cut our coat according to our cloth. I believe strongly in retaining the system as long as possible of paying for new buildings out of revenue, for the reason that it has the effect on Parliament of very materially keeping down For instance, if we confortifications, barracks, post offices, and so forth out of loans, I am afraid that we might feel inclined to be more extra",60
507,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is always the case porwhen a Parliament is dealing' with loan moneys.,60
508,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Henc e I much prefer the present method. Of course, we shall have to meet some big expenditure, borfor which, probably, the revenue may not suffice; but that expenditure is in a different category-. The honourable member for Flinders further suggested that it would be necessary to look closely at the increasing expenditure on the Public Service. He said that the additional expenditure of £ 2 4 9 , 0 0 0 odd represented the increased pay to boys and youths who were doing the same work now that they were doing six years ago. I do not think that the honourable member really meant what he said; but I have his exact words, which convey the impression that the boys and youths have not grown any older, and are doing the same kind of work now that they did then. But, as a matter of fact, boys who were messengers six years ago are now men, and acting as letter-carriers, mailcart drivers, telegraph operators, and so on. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The member is entirely wrong; the increased payments to which I referred are totallyindependent of increases given to public servants when they enter upon new work.",60
509,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have gone through the honourable member's list; but I think that he is wrong, and that the £ 2 4 9 , 0 0 0 odd represents the total increase's.",61
510,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,61
511,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member means that the ,£249,000 odd represents increases in salary given to officers who are doing the same kind of work that they did some time ago, I am sure that he is utterly wrong. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I am not wrong; the return may be wrong.",61
512,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think for a moment that the return means anything of the kind, but that it represents the total increases.",61
513,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No doubt it does.,61
514,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The return could not represent anything else. If the honourable member desires to ascertain the increased payments in the Commonwealth Public Service, he may get the information from the Budget papers. of the Budget papers honourable members will find the only return worth considering in this connection, and that is a return setting forth the rate of increase paid to our public servants for doing the work required to be done. The rate of increase is the true test, and the figure approaching the £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , quoted by the honourable member for Flinders, as a matter of fact, represents the total increases given to the public servants on promotion to higher positions, and on reaching the age at which they become entitled to the minimum wage. I am sorry that the return to which I refer honourable members has not been extended to apply to all the Departments as well as to the Post and Telegraph Department. However, as it refers to some 11,606 employees, it supplies the key to the position, so far as the whole of the service ' is concerned, since the Post and Telegraph Department employs by far the greater number of the public servants of the Commonwealth. I find that in 1902-3 the average salary per officer was £ 1 2 1 . In 1903-4, the year of the classification of the service, it had risen to £ 1 2 8 per officer per annum, or an increase of £ 7 . In .1904-5 it was £.1.30.9. In 1905-6 it was £ 1 3 3 . 4 . In 1906-7 it was £ 1 3 2 . 8 , and honourable. for 1907-8 the estimate is £ 1 3 0 . 7 . So that since 1903, the year in which the service was classified, the increase has been only £ 2 . 7 per officer per annum. That, estimating the number of officers employed as 11,000, represents a total increase of only £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 for the work being done.",61
515,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is since classification, but .that, is not the period I took. ' I dealt with the whole period since Federation.",61
516,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so, but if we deal with the whole period it is clear from this return that the average salary per officer per annum has risen from £ 1 2 c t 0 £ 3°I That rate of increase for 11,000 officers will give a total of less than £.100,000. The honourable member for Flinders must see that this return supplies the real test as to the expenditure due to increases of salary. I point out that since the date of classification the increases have not been progressive. That is shown by the fact that the maximum average salary per'officer was £ 1 3 3 . 4 in 1905-6, and has since been reduced to £ 1 3 2 . 8 in 1906-7, and to £ 1 3 0 . 7 in 1907-8.",61
517,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know the honA t page 103 orable member does not wish to do me any injustice, and he will allow me to say that I stated very distinctly that a very considerable increase was necessary and fair. The only question is whether the increase provided for is not too great.",61
518,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We shall have to face a greater increase if we wish to do justice to a number of the public servants. ,61
519,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have no wish to do the honourable member for Flinders any injustice, but I say that if the statement he made is allowed to ""go forth withoutexplanation the public will be led to believe that huge increases, as the honfollows orable member said, amounting to nearly ^£2 50,000, are being paid to officers for doing the same work as they did six years ago. Any one who knows the conditions of the service will know that that is impay. possible.",61
520,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I simply handed now. over to Hansard the return furnished to me by a public officer.,62
521,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware of that, but the honourable member made the comment upon it to which 1I have referred, and I am showing that the statement he and normal conditions. made does not disclose the true position. The true test is found in the rate of crease per officer in the Public Service, and I have shown by a reference to the Budget papers that it has not amounted more than £ 9 per head since and that during the past three years there has been a reduction to the extent of nearly £ 3 .",62
522,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All deaths and retirements are taken into account in the latter calculation.,62
523,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is so. Everyvolve thing is taken into account in both cases ;ind in every year.,62
524,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The figures quoted hy the honourable member may not be consistent with the return furnished to because, if we take all deaths and ments into the calculation, it will cut down the amount of the increases.",62
525,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On the other hand, the honourable member must remember that upon manhood. my point is that these increases are not excess of the reductions that are taking place, and are not on too lavish a scale more than has been necessary.",62
526,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member will allow me to interpose, what meant was that in an ordinary normal serService vice one would expect that the gradual inare crements given to the lower officers just about balance the salaries saved by retirement or death of officers.",62
527,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is so.,62
528,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If they are shown to amount to a great deal more than the gradual increases are excessive, and .thought that probably they are excessive.",62
529,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The service is always growing larger.,62
530,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Where a service progressing rapidly, as the postal and graph service is, the number loyed in that Department, having been increased by some 700 since last year, that there must be a greater number of postmasters, more work to be done in the higher branches, and a greater number cf officers intrusted with increased responsibilities which carry with them increased ' Mr SPENCE - The service is short-handed",62
531,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I should think it is.,62
532,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In any kind of business we must expect the expenditure in a progressive department to be greater than in a department working under settled So far from the returns justifying the contention that we inare paying too much for the work being done by the Public Service, it would appear that during the last two years we have to made an annual saving per head of the Federation, service of some £ 3 .",62
533,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That arises from the fact that a large number of officers have reached the age at which increases cease.,62
534,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member's suggestion has been that the increases, amounting to about £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , inso serious a matter that Parliament must take into consideration the possibility of withholding increases until a later date, and postponing, I suppose, the operai n : tion of the minimum wage section of me, the Public Service Act in certain cases. retireThe honourable member suggested that whilst, perhaps, we should not withhold increases from married men, they might be withheld from youths and officers entering When an honourable memin ber bases a proposition that financial considerations require that we shall not only or cease to expend so much money on new works and buildings out of revenue, but must also consider the question whether it I might not be advisable to withhold Public increments, on a statement that we today paying nearly £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 more to would a number of boys and men for doing the the same work as they did six years ago, it is right that it should be explained that the figures, so f ar from bearing out his contention, show that the service is actually that, costing less per head for the work now I being done than it cost three '-ears ago.",62
535,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member's criticism is not an unfair one, but I do not think that it discloses the is main position. The amount of the incretelements seems very large indeed, and it reof officers emquires investigation.",62
536,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable - it member will look carefully at the return again, he will see that it covers all the increments. It covers the increments - given to lads who have become letter-carriers, mail-cart drivers, telegraph operators, and persons promoted to superior positions. It covers all the classification increases.",62
537,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It covers the increases to youths who have reached the age of twenty-one years.,63
538,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The return is inexplicable on any other basis.,63
539,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not an annual increase either.,63
540,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,63
541,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member, of course, does not think that I suggested that there had been an annual increase of £249,000?",63
542,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; the honourable member made that clear enough; but he said that a payment of nearly £250,000 over the period since Federation should make honourable members pause before they continued to give increases at the rate previously given. I have dealt with some portions of the honourable member's speech because I desired to elicit the financial policy of the party which he leads. According to his policy, we are to raise by Customs duties at least £9,000,000, probably considerably more, and nothing by direct taxation. For a fixed period £7,250,000 is to be given annually to the States; and £1,750,000 annually to the Commonwealth ;- some new works must be constructed with loan money, and we should carefully consider whether it is not necessary to withhold the payment of increments to public servants.",63
543,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is one thing which the honourable member omitted to state, and that is the principal thing-that in framing a Tariff we should not be entirely forgetful of the claims of revenue.",63
544,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I said that in the opinion of the honourable member the Tariff should be framed with a view to revenue production in 1910, when it would begin to operate in the way of establishing industries. We have elicited from the honourable member that the policy of the Opposition corner party-the Conservative Party if they like-is that the masses are to bear the whole taxation for the Commonwealth.",63
545,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In the worse possible form.,63
546,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the form in which taxation presses most heavily upon a immunity, and that is in the form of Customs duties. To save the wealthy from taxation, the whole burden is to be borne by the masses, and the question of"" ability to pay is not to be considered. I can understand honourable members propounding that policy if they take up the position that they represent wealth, but from my point of view it is one of the most cold-blooded propositions ever put before a Parliament. We are to save the wealthy from taxation; and we are to make Australia a. paradise for ""the fat man."" and for all time the masses are to bear the taxation, out of which, of course, will be defrayed the increased expenditure on immigration, as well as on defence, which may benefit the working man, but which certainly will benefit the wealthy. In order to bring about this paradise for the wealthy, we are to enslave financially the masses.  proposition ?",63
547,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Undoubtedl y that is the policy of the! honourable member for Flinders, as revealed here to-night. ",63
548,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If the honourable member will mention one instance where I have misquoted or misrepresented the honourable member for Flinders I shall be .glad to correct my statement at once.  able member's general statement is a misquotation.,63
549,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . If we accept the policy that for all time we must raise annually by Customs duties at least £7,250,000 to go to the States and £1,750,000-probabl y a great deal moreto go to the Commonwealth, and if we are to permanently collect revenue by that method, and not to impose any direct taxation, surely the honourable member can see that the masses will have to bear the bulk of the expenditure, because what the States will have to provide for will be practically only education and police.  ber overlooks the function of the States as regards direct taxation.",63
550,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That function will be practically limited to providing for education, police, and a few other matters. We have taken over most of the non-revenue producing Departments. We have left to the States the railways, which are revenue producing, and which need not enter into the account. If they are sufficiently revenue producing, as probably they will be before many years have elapsed, - they may yield enough revenue to enable the States to repeal the direct taxation. We find the Premier of New South Wales today proposing to reduce the direct taxation, and as the revenues of the States increase, so the direct taxation may be reduced. If we provide the States with sufficient funds from Customs duties they can repeal all their direct taxation, but so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the expenditure must all be met out of the taxation raised from the masses. Such considerations as the ability of a person to pay, the enjoyment of national opportunities, or the jxwsession of land, are not to be regarded at all, but the masses are to be taxed permanently in the form of Customs duties. I can understand that policy coming from some honourable members, but I thought that the honourable member for Flinders was a believer in direct taxation.",63
551,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,When necessary.,64
552,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am in favour of it. :,64
553,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member understands perfectly the position, and, therefore, his policy seems to me to be one of the most cold-blooded policies to permanently enslave a people that I have ever known to be submitted to a Parliament. I desire now to refer to what is known as the ""ne w protection."" Recollecting the way in which the House viewed the proposals which were made during last session to protect the worker and the consumer; recollecting the way in which every section of the House did what it could to help forward that policy, I-was hoping that it would still be regarded from a non-party view. I shall always regard the attitude of not only the Opposition, but also honourable members in the Opposition corner, towards the new protection last year as an evidence of their humanity. I shall be surprised to find a tirade of abuse directed against the method of, or unnecessary objections offered to, the proposals which are to be made. expected the honourable member for Flinders to make some reference to the subject. But he said that he would prefer to' wait until some substantive proposals were made - a course of action which he was perfectly justified in adopting. The honourable member for South Svdney, however, did put before the Committee certain general principles, and, inasmuch as I am keenly interested in this matter, I should have liked those principles to have been criticised.",64
554,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I criticised them. I said that the whole of his scheme was made to hang .upon . the Commonwealth trade mark, and that it was a matter of grave doubt whether the Commonwealth trade mark would hold water-whethe r it was constitutional.",64
555,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The constitutional difficulty will crop up in connection with any industrial conditions which we may lay down, requiring compliance on the part of manufacturers.",64
556,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,To insure protection to the consumer will be the most difficult problem.,64
557,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is so. I wish now to refer very briefly to the question of the protection of the worker. It has been said that last year's experiment in this direction has proved afailure.,64
558,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It has not yet been tried sufficiently to enable a correct opinion to be formed.,64
559,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"So far from the system having proved a failure, it has been a success in most cases in which it has been applied. In South Australia it has 1 certainly succeeded in shortening the hours of labour, and in increasing the wages of quite 75 per cent, of those engaged in the agricultural implement industry, and it has accomplished this result practically without increasing the cost to the consumer. Unless we can protect the worker, I do not intend to support the granting of any increased measure of protection to industries. If the community fends off competition from the manufacturer, the latter ought not to reap the whole of the benefit, but ought to share it with his workers. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has criticised the. action of some firms in South Australia, who, it is alleged, are evading the award of the Arbitration Court. I do not wish to discuss that question at any length upon the present occasion. I have in my possession the replies, vouchsafed by the manufacturers, to his allegations, and I published in the South Australian newspapers, but. they are very meagre replies, and consequently it is unnecessary for me to trouble the Committee with them - They simply amount to a general denial of the statement that they have evaded any of the provisions of the Act, and they are accompanied by a pious expression of opinion on the part of the'secretary of the Protectionist Association that no member of that association would be guilty of such conduct. As a matter of fact, what the honourable member for Hindmarsh affirms - and what I support him in affirmingis that, the President of the Arbitration Court having made an award, and it having been stated upon good authority that effect is not being given to that award, it is the duty of the Government to collect the Excise payable by these manufacturers if they are able to do so. If the firms in question continue to refuse to show that the conditions are being observed by them, the Government should at once impose the Excise duty. The alleged offenders would then be compelled to appeal to the Arbitration Court to establish the fact that are carrying out the conditions under which they were permitted to manufacture their goods free of Excise duty. If the present system of imposing Excise is to be continued, it is essential that the proof of compliance with any order of the Court shall rest with the employers. The honourable member for South Sydney has outlined a proposal in this connection that it should not be difficult to work, inasmuch as the machinery for the Commonwealth trade mark is already in existence. The deputy leader of the Opposition-whil e the honourable member for South Sydney was speaking-objected that the Commonwealth trade mark and the workers' trade mark were identical, and urged that the latter was the cause of so much friction that it would be inadvisable to legislate further in respect of the Commonwealth trade mark. But I would point out to him that the Commonwealth trade mark and the workers' trade"" mark differ fundamentally. The workers' trade mark under the Trade Marks Act simply signifies manufacture by members of a trade union, and nothing else. Upon the other hand, the Commonwealth trade mark signifies that the conditions under which the goods to which it is attached were produced, were controlled by some State or Federal authority. The right to use the Commonwealth trade mark implies that the conditions of labour in an industry are controlled by some State or Federal authority.",64
560,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would not Commonwealth trade mark and the workers' trade mark become one as time went on ?,65
561,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The members of the unions would prefer the workers' trade mark, which signifies* membership of a union. They band together for the purpose of maintaining certain conditions. If by legislation we enable a Ccurt to determine what those conditions shall be, there will be no object in unionists remaining united. There will not remain the incentive which now exists for them to band themselves together. At the present time they band themselves together in order that they may mutually support each other in case of strikes. But where Wages Boards or an Arbitration Court are in existence strikes are practically impossible.  so in New South Wales. . Mr BATCHELOR - In that State they matters' have not proceeded far enough to enable us to say with certainty what will be the ultimate result. Probably the honourable member has noticed in the press the statement that the New Zealand Court has held that every member of a union who disobeys an award of the Court may be imprisoned.",65
562,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Nonsense. We could not imprison the whole country.,65
563,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If the right hon- orable member will refer to the newspapers of the past day or two he will find that the facts are as I have stated.,65
564,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They were so stated-.,65
565,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would be impracticable to imprison a large body of strikers.,65
566,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is a comparatively small population in New Zealand. We should require forty new gaols if we were to imprison strikers.,65
567,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All that I wish to do at this stage is to point out the difference between the two marks-the one requiring the employment of workmen who have joined a union, and the other the observance of certain conditions-eithe r of Wages Boards, Arbitration Courts, or someother Federal or State authority.",65
568,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,An Arbitration Actdoes not prevent men from striking. They struck in Western Australia although there was an Arbitration Act ,65
569,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that they the have struck, but the question of whether o r not they can be imprisoned for striking has not yet been finally settled. The latest decision appears to be that men can be imprisoned for striking.",65
570,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not practicableto imprison where a large number of menare concerned.,65

597,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It will be if the honourable member insists upon speaking frequently, and other honourable members will not curtail their speeches.",67
598,Mr TILLEYBROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have talked less than has any honourable member.,67
599,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member always talks on the motion for the adjournment. ' Mr TILLEY BROWN - I have not previously spoken on an adjournment motion. Will the honourable gentleman tell the truth? .,67
600,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oh , yes, the honourable member has spoken. I shall be glad if honourable members generally will curtail their speeches on the Budget. We have had some very long addresses.",67
601,Mr TILLEYBROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall promise hot to speak at all if the Government will consent to proceed uninterruptedly with the Tariff.,67
602,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I ask the honourable member not to interrupt.,67
603,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government is anxious to proceed in a reasonable way with the consideration of the Tariff. I have not endeavoured, so far, to induce honourable members to compress their speeches on the Budget, but since the debate has now occupied our attention for some time, I hope that it will close within the next few days. The consideration of the two Bills I have mentioned, as well as of the Works and Buildings Estimates, should not occupy more than two or three days. The Judiciarv Bill , to which the honourable member for Corio has referred, is one which only the lawyers in the House are likely to debate. I cannot withdraw anything I have said in reference to the intentions of the Government regarding, those measures, and I certainly am not going to frame a partially new Tariff - before we. get to the consideration of the present one. . . . Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.32, - p.m. '. '",67
