6,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Which members or prospective members of statutory boards have you or your office asked to sign a secret deal in which they agree to resign whenever you ask them to? Who signed up to this secret deal and to which boards were they appointed? Mr SHA.RP-I took the opportunity yesterday, following the honourable member for Melbourne's question, to ascertain what was meant by the question and the facts of it. I can inform the honourable member for Melbourne that most of the potential applicants or appointees to boards have willingly signed such a letter to which he refers. I can also say that I subsequently noted public comments of the honourable member for Melbourne on radio and in his press release that claim that this is a breach of the to defend. act-in particular the Air Services Act. I note the comments the honourable member for Melbourne made in regard to the fact that this potentially invalidates their appointments or invalidates decisions made by these organisations. I can assure the House that the accusations made in typical fashion by the honourable member for Melbourne are nothing more than scaremongering and are totally and utterly inaccurate, as so many of his statements in regard to these matters are. I have legal advice, which I will be happy to table, which confirms that all of the claims made yesterday by the member for Melbourne are false, that they are nothing more than scaremongering. As usual, all the honourable member for Melbourne is doing in this issue and in others related to this important public safety regulation is undermining the safe and proper operation of these important public institutions. Literacy Standards",13
7,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the outstanding Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Minister, given the widespread concern among parents in my electorate of Fisher and elsewhere about literacy standards, what are the critical steps that must be taken to ensure that every child is reading and writing by the end of year 3? What support is there for the implementation of these steps?",13
8,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. He has made me very clearly aware of the concern of parents in his electorate about literacy standards. The first mission of schools in this country is to teach young children how to read and write. The improvement of literacy levels is not a question of money; it is a question of will. To ensure that every childMr MCClelland-You have cut their funding.,13
9,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you never had any will. That was the great difficulty on the other side of the House over the last 13 years. We all the know the commitment of the Labor Party to low literacy standards because that was their record and it is the record they currently seek To ensure that every child in this country can read and write by grade 3, there are a number of critical steps which need to be taken. Firstly, there needs to be a clearing of the overcrowded curriculum in those early years of schooling to ensure that there is the time for every young person who has difficulties in learning to read and write to do so. Secondly, there needs to be a thorough evaluation of the teaching methods which are used in schools to assess the effectiveness of different methods in teaching young people to read and write. Thirdly, there needs to be a clear recognition of the fact that standards currently are too low, and there needs to be a commitment to the national standard which was applied to the analysis of the English literacy survey. Finally, there needs to be quality information provided to parents and the community on the performance of schools. This government is not alone in believing that steps of this kind are necessary. I would like to quote some important words to this effect. They are: The first task of the education service must be to ensure that every child is taught to read and Literacy is crucial because it opens the door to success across all other subject areas. Who was it who said that? It was a Labour Party member. It was not the member for Sydney.",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am delighted to hear it!,14
11,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was the Labour Party member for North Tyneside, the schools minister of Tony Blair in England. What the Blair government has committed itself to is the clearing of that primary curriculum to make way for one hour of literacy teaching each day in school. The Blair government has also determined that all primary schools must produce literacy action plans. The only people who seem not to have woken up to what is necessary are those in the Australian Labor Party. It is quite astonishing that the Leader of the Opposition could go over to England and learn nothing about what needs to be done. The Australian Labor Party show again and again that they are out of touch with Australian parents and out of touch with the Australian community. For far too long they have received their education policy in the post from the Australian Education Union. They have not listened to the concerns of parents. If there is any clearing out to be done on the Labor side, it is not the primary curriculum which needs it but the Jurassic Park on the Labor Party front-bench. As the member for Banks warned the member for Werriwa, 'Always remember, you are surrounded by assassins.' The only thing wrong with that remark, Daryl, was that you did not make it to the Leader of the Opposition. Statutory Authorities",14
12,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Do you support the Minister for Transport and Regional Development requesting statutory board appointees to sign secret deals agreeing to resign whenever the minister asks them to? Do you have confidence that this minister has at all times acted in accordance with the ministerial guidelines and proper principles of government?,14
13,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have immense confiwrite. dence in the minister and he has my full support. Budget Outcome 1996-97,14
14,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister provide the House with details of the 1996-97 budget outcome? What are the implications of this outcome for the Australian economy?,14
15,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his timely question. It is well known to the members of this House-and, for that matter, to the Australian public-that this government inherited a reprehensible budget deficit from the Beazley-Keating government. Under Labor the 1995-96 budget outcome showed a deficit of $10.3 billion. In our first full financial year of government we have reduced that deficit by more than half to less than $5 billion. The final budget outcome for 1995-96 shows that the underlying deficit has reduced to $4.934 billion. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions-and I believe the Australian people should be reminded of this time and time again-under Labor the general government debt increased from around $16 billion or four per cent of GDP in 1989-90 to around $93 billion or nearly 20 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. We have stopped that reckless extravagance and, as the OECD has projected, over 1997 and 1998 Australia will have the third lowest public debt to GDP ratio in the OECD. By 2000-2001 we will have reduced our debt by almost half, to what it was in 1995-96. Commonwealth outlays on public debt interest increased by only three per cent last financial year, compared to over 14 per cent in 1995-96 and to an enormous 24 per cent in 1994-95. Last year's result represents sound, responsible fiscal management, a far cry from the profligate and blatant fiscal mismanagement this country received under the Beazley and Keating governments. This is a stunning turnaround, and we are not resting on our laurels. There will be reduction in outlays on public debt interest during the current financial year, and by 1998-99 the government will be in a str-ng position to realise its expected underlymg budget surplus-the first since 1990-91. By reducing our level of public debt, we are reducing the burden on future generations of Australians. As we continue to reduce outlays on public debt interest, the government will have more flexibility to adjust spending in more important areas of the budget, while still maintaining the strong fiscal stance so essential to the future prospects of Australia. Unlike our predecessors, we are not a government of big budget deficits, large public debt and taxation increases. Our s-ratÂ­ egy is based on getting the fundamentals nght for strong, sustainable economic growth. Our fiscal consolidation effort is focused primarily on outlays. Underlying outlays will decline from 27 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to just under 23 per cent of GDP by 2000-2001, the lowest percentage of GDP since 1973-74. At the same time, we are raising national savings, providing a low interest rate, low inflation environment to encourage investment and raising productivity in Australian workplaces. The budget outcome for 1996-97 is a good news story for all Australians. It demonstrates quite clearly that this is a responsible government. The budget outcome, as most commentators have acknowledged, sets the stage for long-tenn and sustainable recovery of the economy after 13 years of Labor mismanagement. Employment",14
16,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Treasurer and it follows the answer he has just given. I ask him: if the coalition's budgetary policy is such a good-news story, how can the Acting Treasurer explain the fact that the last 12 months has been the first time ever, on available data, that annual employment growth in Australia has been negative without the economy having been in recession?",15
17,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again comes the questionÂ· on employment from Labor-the government that presided over 11.2 per cent unemployme-t: In the time that the Leader of the OppOSItIOn a real was the employm<.jnt minister-December 1991 to December 1993-unemployment at the beginning was 10.4 per cent; at the conclusion, it was 10.6 per cent. Mr Martin Ferguson-Now! Now!",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Batman.,15
19,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the six years leading up to a change of government, Labor created 7,100 jobs in six years-7,100 jobs were the net result of Labor presiding over the economy of this nation and being responsible for employment. And, of course, in that time we saw through that recession an enormous reduction in full-time jobs in this country. The former leader of the ACTU, the member for Batman, of course was the henchman in all of this process. He was not in this place; he was pulling the strings and he was very much part and parcel of that disastrous period in this country's history.",15
20,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order regarding the leader of the FaheyHoward government, and the point of order concerns relevance. He had a question totally devoted to how he explained the fact that he has gone into negative growth, as far as employment is concerned, for the first time in Australian history when there has been a 12month period of growth. He was asked why that was so-quite simple, but there has been no answer to it.",15
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,15
22,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first thing that you do about creating employment is to obtain sustainable economic growth, and in the 18 months of government we have brought inflation down, we have brought interest rates down, and we have increased national savings but, more importantly, we have started to clear-as I have just informed the Housethat deficit we inherited which, of course, did more than anything else to create a climate in this country which did not encourage investment. So I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and all members of this House that the ingredients are there to see growth, and the indicators show that that growth is going to occur as we proceed into the first half of next year. Mr Crean-But what is your target for jobs?",16
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Wills. Greenhouse Gases,16
24,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Minister, will you acquaint the House of the most recent scientific assessments of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions prepared by eminent authorities?",16
25,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. Representing, as he does, the city of Gladstone, he has a vital interest in all matters greenhouse. There is a great deal of misinformation and at times hysteria, often deliberately manufactured, about the issue of climate change. The government has always accepted that the balance of scientific evidence suggests the earth's average temperature is increasing, thereby causing the climate to change. We do not, however, accept wild doomsday predictions based on faulty or non-existent science-to do so would be to sell out Australia and Australian jobs. We instead rely in the formulation of policy on credible scientific data. The latest estimates on the consequences of greenhouse emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-IPCC, which was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organisation and the United Nations Environment Program and represents the views of several hundred recognised experts from around the world-are that temperatures have risen between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees Centigrade since the last century and are expected to rise by about two degrees by the year 2100-more than a hundred years from now.",16
26,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are giving the bottom of the range.,16
27,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,16
28,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Interestingly, this is about one-third lower than the best estimate made in 1990. At the same time, global sea level has risen by between 10 and 25 centimetres over the last 120 years and is expected to increase by about 50 centimetres again by the year 2100.",16
29,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are misleading us.,16
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Denison!,16
31,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is being misleading.,16
32,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is 25 per cent lower than the best estimate in 1990. There are still considerable uncertainties in these estimates and more work is required on greenhouse gas sources and sinks and on understanding the climate system--clouds, oceans, sea ice and vegetation.",16
33,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is quoting the document out of context.,16
34,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"However, the figures do show that, whilst there is indeed climate change due to human activity",16
35,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is giving the bottom of the range of figures.,16
36,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,the predictions are considerably more modest than a few years ago.,16
37,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hey, Kemp, you should give him a lesson about numeracy.",16
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Denison.,16
39,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whatever the precise impacts of climate change, the government believes we must act in a precautionary and prudent way. For this reason we are making domestic progress in preventing significant emissions that would otherwise have occurred. It is vit!ll that greenhouse be addressed sci entifically, professionally and objectively-it must be credible. Only then are you going to secure the support of all nations to achieve abatement of greenhouse gases. Exaggerations and distortions, which are the stock in trade of the opposition, may suit their political agenda but will surely damage world resolve to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse Gases",16
40,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows on from the answer by the Minister for Science and Technology in respect of greenhouse. I ask whether the Prime Minister recalls in the runup to the 1996 election the coalition making the following commitment: If Australia is to have an effective influence on the tenns of this [Kyoto] protocol it must ... act now to develop a credible domestic response . . . The Liberal and National Parties will ... encourage the development and use of new and renewable forms of energy and promote end-use energy efficiency ... [and] maintain current support for the Energy Research and Development Corporation. Given the government has, since coming to office, abolished the Energy Research and Development Corporation and slashed $50 million over four years from the national energy efficiency program, will the government make an immediate decision to, at the very least, restore the ERDC and restore funding to the national energy efficiency program?",17
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think that question should have been addressed to his own leader, because, if his own leader had not misled the Australian public and left us with a deficit of $10.5 billion, it would not have been necessary to make any of the expenditure cuts. Let me further say to the honourable member for Perth that the other measures that this government has brought in, and most particularly the $1.25 billion investment in the National Heritage Trust, which you tried to stop, which you opposed not only here but also in the Senate, has contributed more to the environment in Australia, has had a more beneficial effect on the matters that were referred to in your question, than any of the other measures that you are talking about.",17
42,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is absolute hogwash and you know it.,17
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would also remind the honourable gentleman that in addition to that there is the challenge program, involving some of the very largest companies in Australia.",17
44,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is our program-the greenhouse challenge.,17
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Their goal, which is well within the reach of being achieved, is to reduce by 15 per cent the greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, we are reaching a target of something like 18 or 20 per cent.",17
46,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Our program-the only one you did not touch.,17
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When you add that program to the $1.25 billion program that you tried to,17
48,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The only program of ours you did nottouch. It is our program-the only one you did not touch.,17
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the Prime Minister resume his seat for a moment. I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Denison.,17
50,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Excuse me if! proceed slowly.,17
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have all the patience in the world. The honourable member for Denison thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,17
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Everybody knows that I am a keen supporter of the Western Bulldogs, so you know why I have done it. As the Prime Minister has finished, I call the honourable member for Robertson. Greenhouse Gases",17
53,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, also on greenhouse gas emissions. Minister, is there agreement internationally on what the outcome should be from the climate change negotiations at the Kyoto conference in December? Is Australia isolated in its opposition to the European Union's proposal for emission reductions? What is the government doing to further Australia's interest in the Climate change negotiations? Finally, is the government's position in the national interest?",17
54,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question on this very important issue. As the honourable member points out in his question,. the European Union has indeed put forward for the Kyoto conference a proposal of a reduction in greenhouse emissions between 1990 and 2010 of some 15 per cent. This is one of a wide range of different proposals which are being canvassed at the moment by almost all of the countries which will be party to the discussions in Kyoto. So at this point we are nowhere close to a consensus being achieved. Of course, all countries recognise that something needs to be done, we included. We recognise, as I think a lot do, that we should make a contribution, and that contribution should be fair and it should be equitable. But it is well known that the proposal that Australia puts forward is a proposal for differentithe ated national targets. That is, what we are arguing is that Australia is prepared to make a contribution, but it is only prepared to make a fair and equitable contribution. We are not prepared to carry on our own shoulders a disproportionate burden to solve this problem, and other countries should not ask Australia to carry a disproportionate burden: to give up more jobs proportionately than they are prepared to give up; to give up more of our living standards than they are prepared to give up. To put it very simply, that is why we so strongly argue for differentiated national targets. The concept of differentiation is supported by a number of countries, and the argument that people like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition use, that somehow we are embarrassed in our isolation-and I will come back to that-is simply not true. As far as the European Union is concerned, I am not aware of any country outside of the European Union supporting the proposals of the European Union. As far as differentiation is concerned, while different countries may have different views about how differentiation should work, the concept of differentiation is supported by countries such as Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil and China. So it is quite a long list of countries that support differentiation. Of course, the European Union supports differentiation as well, but the European Union only supports differentiation for the European Union. If you are outside of the European Union it is not okay; if you are in the European Union it is. Portugal, according to the European Union's program, is able to increase its emissions by 40 per cent, whereas Luxembourg is to reduce its emissions by 30 per cent. That is the differentiation of the European Union, and its simple point is that if it is all right for the European Union it should be all right for the annex 1 countries as a whole. Australia will work for a good outcome, but we will stand up for our national interest. That is one of the great differences between this side of the House and the other side of House. The other side of the House, particularly on this issue, led by the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, believes that, if you disagree with other countries, you should fold up immediately and fall in line with them, because otherwise you will be embarrassed. We called our white paper In The National Interest. The Labor Party would call its white paper, if ever it were to produce one-and it never has-'The White Flag'. As long as you keep everyone else happy, you have achieved your full objectives in international relations. But you haven't. The greatest responsibility in international relations is to stand up for the national interest, and we will stand up for our national interest on this greenhouse issue. People in the Labor Party keep running the line that, if you do not agree with all of the members of the South Pacific Forum, you do not agree with the European Union or you do not agree with someone else, you are embarrassing Australia! Mr Crean-No. You embarrass Australians-you, you!",18
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham!,18
56,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You embarrass Australia because you never stand up for our country. In opposition, whenever there is disagreement between Australia and any other country in the world, you always take the other side. You are never on Australia's side. In conclusion, the Prime Minister yesterday gave some figures. The House will recall that .he said it would cost us something like $68 billion in projects and 90,000 jobs in those projected investments if we were to adopt something like the European Union's proposal. It is clear the Labor Party supports the European Union's proposal. It is also clear to South Australian electors what that will mean in the South Australian election. What Labor is arguing will put something like $4 billion worth of investment in South Australia at risk, at the expense of 5,000 jobs, and let South Australian electors know on 11 October that that is the plan of the Labor Party, in stark contrast to the coalition, which will stand up for the national interest on this issue. Mr BEAZLEy-it is important to stand up for the national interest competently.",18
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will address his question,19
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is a problem for the foreign minister but my question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a letter from the Anglican Archbishop of Perth to himself, dated 1 September 1997, regarding the government's proposed changes to aged care, which says: The Anglican Homes Board ... [has] ... concluded that the Minister seems not to understand the serious concerns presented to her by the industry leaders. . . . 'I am personally very alarmec:! at the levels of hostility abroad in the community' .... the Board of Anglican Homes has come to the conclusion that Minister Moylan is ... unable to understand the implications of her reform agenda. And, finally: It may be that a hidden agenda is operating in relation to these matters which seeks to diminish the role of ""not for profit"" providers by favouring the profit seekers in the industry. Will the government now heed the concerns raised by the archbishop and many other not for profit providers in the industry and put on hold your aged care changes?",19
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will not be putting on hold our aged care changes because they are necessary. For years and years, you neglected the need to get additional capital into this area. You put the problem off and you now seek, in relation to nursing homes, to argue the opposite proposition that you yourself espoused when you were in government in relation to hostels. I believe this is yet another example of the Labor Party mantra-that is, you say one thing and you do another. The policies we have introduced in this area bear very significant similarities to the policies that you pursued when you were in. government. In so many cases, what you have done since going into opposition is to attack and criticise positions that you yourselves championed and supported when you were in government. I believe that, far from being condemned, the minister deserves support and commendation for the way in which he has piloted some complicated but nonetheless Aged Care very important and far reaching reforms through the parliament. Human Rights and EquaJ Opportunity Commission",19
60,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General would be aware of reports over recent months that the government intends to reorganise the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Would the Attorney-General advise the House of the government's intended action with regard to the commission?,19
61,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"""::Order! There is too much noise on my left!",19
63,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Most members of the House would be well aware of the interest of the member for Kingston in children's rights and the protection of children. It is timely that she gets the opportunity to ask a question relevant to that when students from her daughter's school, Urrbrae High School, are in the gallery. The Howard government's commitment to effective and equitable protection and promotion of human rights is clearly demonstrated, and will continue to be, through the establishment of a new Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission. Under the reorganised commission, the protection which is afforded to all Australians under the Commonwealth discrimination laws will be The new Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission will consist of a president and three deputy presidents. The commission a whole, comprising the president and deputy presidents, will have the joint responsibility of promoting and protecting human rights.

The deputy presisaid dent responsible for human rights and disinto ability discrimination will also be able develop expertise in presently unspecified areas, such as children and the aged.

The establishment of deputy presidents with more general responsibilities will remove the widespread perception that the commission seeks only to protect sections of the community for whom a specific commisfully maintained. sioner exists. As the previous government recognised but failed to address, a top-heavy Human Rights as Commission has not been providing the best outcomes for human rights. The government is determined to provide equitable and efficient human rights promotion and protection through the establishment of the human rights the and responsibilities commission and the establishment of that body will achieve our Workplace Relations: Waterfront",19
64,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the for Workplace Relations and Small Minister, have you now adopted a policy of being partisan not only against workers and unions but also against employers who want to work cooperatively with them? If not, why are you attacking waterbe front employers who will not be provoked of into industrial disputes-those employers who of you that you are getting everybody a frenzy but not achieving anything? to Why are you attacking companies like BHP who work cooperatively with unions and workers to improve productivity without confrontation?",20
65,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I am attacking are the inefficiencies on the waterfront which are costing thousands of Australians their jobs. is what I am attacking. I am attacking this situation in a Queensland port which we inherited from you. Let me go through it be quietly for you. Waterside workers are on a week-this is a real-life example on under the system you gave us-and have been many years. However, unlike most industries they are paid during their tea and meal which reduces the time available to 31.25 hours a week. In addition, walking time and from the crib room extends the time the stopped by, on average, seven minutes each way or 28 minutes per shift, further reducing work time from the 35 hours all the way properly down to 28.9 hours a week. Waterside workers are therefore available for 31.25 hours a week; however the number of days that they are available during the year is reduced by the following entitlements. First of all, how many working days? There are 261 a year. So they get five weeks annual leave, they get 10 days sick leave, they get four days long service leave, they get 11 days public holiday and they get 171h idle time which comes to 351h days. So out of the total number of work days in a year-52 weeks, put it that way, for most people; most people get four weeks annual leave-these guys, if you take all their benefits, are not at work 17.1 weeks of the year. And they are being paid for it. In addition to that they getMr MCGauran-What about the allowances?",20
66,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is an interjection asking about the allowances. Sure, you get a dust allowance. So if you are working in an environment which is dusty you get paid an allowance. But if you are at home you get paid the dust allowance as well. And these people say: what are we on about? We are on about fixing up the mess which we inherited from you with wharfies who have, in effect, to struggle to get to work for 52 minus 17 weeks of the year. And you say, 'The government is attacking the union. The government is attacking the employers.' I will tell you what we are doing: we are attacking the problem you left us. Workplace Relations: Waterfront",21
67,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minIster aware of claims in today's Australian newspaper by Chris Corrigan, the Chairman of Patricks Stevedores, that since the last enterprise agreement was negotiated at a cost of several million dollars productivity on the waterfront has fallen by more than 20 per cent? Could the minister further outline some of the impediments to improved efficiencies on the waterfront?",21
68,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The news in today's papers highlights the false claims being put out by the MUA, with the MUA being supported by the federal Labor opposition, because it was only as recently as yesterday that John Coombs, who runs the MUA, was claiming that waterfront productivity was increasing. 'It's on the up,' says John Coombs. Yet here you have in the paper today a real live example where, in fact, things are going backwards. For example, in November last year the MUA negotiated a new enterprise bargaining agreement with Patricks for Melbourne's East Swanston dock. At that time the average lifts per hour were 15 TEUs, down from 22 lifts in July of that year. But despite the agreement, which for was entered into to increase productivity, the average lifts are 20 per cent down on what they were before the agreement. So you have the Labor Party and the MUA basically saying, 'What is the problem?' You have John Coombs saying, 'Things are on the up.' Yet, when you look behind it and actually look at the figures and the facts, the reality is the company has been losing productivity since the agreement was entered into-an agreement purporighted to be to improve productivity. All this is happening in the Patricks operation at a time when they have been pumping in something like $200 million worth of investment to improve the capital equipment available to do the job better in the future. The Labor opposition says, 'What are the problems? What are the reasons for this?' Of course, one of the reasons for this is that we have a very high level of industrial action on the waterfront. What are the reasons? If you look at the facts, the international group Shipowners Mutual Strike Insurance Association ranked the Australian waterside as No. 1 in terms of strikes in 1996-No. 1 in terms of strikes in 1996--and, what is most amazing, that is in a situation where Australia only accounts for 2 per cent of the world's shipping trade but nearly 23 per cent of all days lost due to industrial action. On top of that, we get these inane questions from the opposition, who believe that politically they can stand shoulder to shoulder with the MUA, whilst the MUA is rorting the system day in and day out at the expense of the vast bulk of the Australian population. Do not think that ordinary rank and file trade union members are going to thank you for standing up and supporting the rorts of the MUA I heard another one the other day. In a well- disposal? known Australian port the wharfies were at smoko. They are being paid to be at smoko, as usual; under the award, of course they are. It is a wonder that they are not getting the 27lh per cent loading they get for annual leave.",21

71,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Anyway, they are at smoko. There is some dispute, I gather, about the surface of the billiard table. So what do they do? They serve notice on the terminal manager to say that they are going to bring the whole place to a standstill, unless they get billiard table covered. The rorters' supporters over here support that; they support that. This is the latest in a long list of rorts-the Eddie Charlton rort-and you guys support it. As a final point, I understand that the Bulletin has a survey out tomorrow which asks the public what steps need to be taken to improve Australia's economy and to create more jobs. As I am told, something like 83 per cent say eliminating inefficient work practices to improve productivity is the way to create more jobs. That is common sense. What is interesting is that, whilst 83 per cent of the population can see it with a simple question being asked, you over there cannot see it. In fact, you stand there, supporters, shoulder to shoulder with the MUA. Well might you rue the day that you decided to. Parkes International Airport",22
72,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. You recently announced the appointment of Mr David Asimus to review the very positive Maunsell feasibility study into the Inland Marketing Corporation's Parkes freight airport proposal. In the light of the 9,500 state-wide jobs in Maunsell's assessment of the Parkes project and given the Prime Minister's undertaking that jobs are the government's priority, could you please give me the timetable for this review: when Mr Asimus is likely to be briefed and by whom, and the resources he is likely to have at his",22
73,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Calare for his question. The matter he refers to is a proposal by a number of councils in central western New South Wales for the construction of an international airport based at Parkes, as part of the Inland Marketing Corporation's proposals for the development of new economic activity in that part of New South Wales. The Inland Marketing Corporation has undertaken a feasibility study by D.J. Maunsell. Of that feasibility study, the executive summary has been publicly released. It makes a number of claims as to the feasibility of an international airport at Parkes. I have, the in return, on behalf of the government, indicated that we will find an eminent citizen to analyse the claims made by the DJ. Maunsell study. That eminent citizen, I am pleased to announce, is Mr David Asimus, who is well known throughout regional Australia as a very eminent person as well as, of course, in major corporate circles as well. Mr Asimus has agreed to do it. He has not set a timetable yet for the completion of the work. That will not be done until such time as Mr Asimus has had the opportunity to look at the parent document from which the claims and the executive summary are substantiated. And Mr Asimus will not be able to look at the parent document or analyse that until such time as the council involved, Mr Asimus and I are satisfied that proper confidentiality arrangements that the Inland Marketing Corporation wishes to maintain have been agreed upon. So Mr Asimus can then go and analyse the work and then, when he makes his analysis public, justify that analysis one way or the other by referring to material in the parent document of D.J. Maunsell's feasibility study. Bushcare Program: Tree Planting",22
74,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to the government's proposals in relation to vegetation and bush care. Will the minister explain how these proposals will benefit my electorate of Mallee, and how they will integrate with the government's overall position regarding better management of Australia's environment?",22
75,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question; I know he has a great interest in environmental matters. The coalition's Natural Heritage Trust is, as is well known in this place, a comprehensive, integrated and responsible approach to the environment, involving expenditure in the area of $1.25 billion over the next five years. A critical part of that is native vegetation protection and tree planting-a critical part of what we put forward at the last election, and we are about delivering what we put forward at the last election. Last Friday the bushcare program, although perhaps not as widely recognised as I would have liked to have seen, was launched at the National Landcare Conference in Adelaide by Senator Robert Hill. He and I were there at that conference, and there were 900 people involved in landcare from across Australia at it. The House might be interested to know that, at the moment, there are another two landcare groups a day being formed. Something like 1,000 when we came to government is now well over 4,000, up from just over 3,000 some 18 months ago, which is testimony to national enthusiasm, particularly in rural and regional Australia, for landcare. The bushcare program-I have a pamphlet here which I would encourage all members of the House to obtain and distribute-takes the place of no fewer than seven programs that existed under the previous regime and increases, by a factor of 10, expenditure on retention of remnant vegetation and planting of new trees. It will see a target of some 250,000 hectares of tree planting and prQtection areas being developed each year by the year 2001. These are projects which will conserve wildlife habitat and biodiversity and help the rehabilitation of degraded areas. They help lower saline water tables, absorb greenhouse gases, which is very important to us in Australia at the moment, and create both jobs and commercial opportunities-not least in the area of tourism, given that the overwhelming bulk of tourists to this land or even mainly, because they want to see our magnificent natural environment. Where the previous government left behind a very messy arrangement of programs in the area of trees, we are putting real substance behind our commitments. I really believe that this is an area where the coalition can say that we have not only delivered on our commitments but also overdelivered. Hunter Valley Mr FITZGffiBON-My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, before you submitted to the commission that the Hunter Valley No- 1 dispute was not 'threatening to cause significant - damage to the Australian economy or any important part of it', did you determine that the dispute was not causing significant damage to the Hunter Valley economy, or did you determine that the Hunter Valley economy is not an important part of the Australian economy?",23
76,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The 'submission that we made to the Industrial Relations Commission centred on the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. I invite the member to read them. Wages: Safety Net,23
77,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed also to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware of reports today indicating that the ACTU is pushing for a new wages claim of over $20 a week plus other safety net adjustments? Does the federal government support safety net adjustments to minimum wages? Is the ACTU's claim in the interest of employment growth and the economy as a whole?,23
78,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly did see those comments. I also saw the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, who is quickly with moving into support the ACTU, as usual. will The government's position is to provide for a system whereby the Industrial Relations Commission can provide for safety net wage increases. In fact, it was one of the commitments we made before the last election-that we have a system that is fair to people who come in part, are on low incomes. One of the great things of the first 12 months or 18 months of this government is that we not only made that commitment to people but also legislated it. In the $10 a week wage increase that people got from the commission earlier this year, we delivered in full on the commitinent that we made. I tell you what: those people have had - a hell of a lot better deal now than they ever had under the previous Labor government-so much so that, for the 1997 June quarter, it amounted to a real increase of 2.4 per cent. How ashamed you must be that in 13 years you were never able to deliver as good a deal as we have been able to for people on low pay. On behalf of the government, I responded quickly last night to the ACTU's claim. I did so because these issues have been the subject of a lot of debate. They have also been subject to some comments by the Industrial Relations Commission in the safety net wage case that we had earlier this year-back in April or thereabouts. It is very interesting to hear what the commission itself said. On page 74-this is not the government talking; this is what the commission said about the application made by the ACTU-it said: There are significant risks in our view that such increases wouldThey were increases referring to $12 to $15; the latest one is a $20 increase1) raise the levels of settlements in future workplace and enterprise bargains; 2) raise the growth rate of average weekly ordinary time earnings to a level inconsistent with the Reserve Bank's inflation target; 3) diminish the incentive for unions and employees to engage in bargaining. On page 75, it said: We are seriously concerned that increases much in excess of that levelNamely, the $8 a week proposed by the joint governmentswould jeopardise the achievement of that target, i.e., the Reserve Bank's inflation target, and cause increases in interest rates and consequential adverse effects on employment. As I understand it, the latest ACTU claim is to be different from that which was put in last year. We would need to look at the differences and obviously the economic circumstances changing as time moves on. You cannot deny the basic fact: if you have very substantial increases which are not tied to productivity, the people who cop it, the people who are disadvantaged, are the very people that you claim to be supporting and concerned about-namely, the low paid. If we do not have a responsible economic decision on low paid workers, those who will suffer are the very people that the Labor Party and the ACTU claim to represent. The facts are very clear. The ACTU's new claim-it is an ambit claim-cannot be sustained economically. That claim, if it were successful, would jeopardise the jobs of Australia's lowest paid workers and act as a significant break on employment growth more generally, which just shows you the hypocrisy of the other side. They support this claim when they know that the effect of that claim would be to cost people jobs. It threatens the maintenance of Australia's low inflation rate, which has been a key to delivering significantly lower interest rates for the very people who again you claim to be concerned about. Of course, it would significantly impact on business and consumers. An increase of that magnitude would be a serious impediment to agreement making, which when you were in government you said, as we now say, is the way in which people can genuinely have the opportunity to do a deal at work, get the higher pay and the productivity to go with it so the thing can be sustained. I think it was grossly irresponsible of the federal opposition to so quickly fall in line with the ACTU. This is not to the advantage of low income people; this is to the detriment of low income people. Even the New South Wales Labor government, when these matters were before the commission earlier this year, refused to go along with the ACTU claim last time. I think if you were genuine about concern for the disadvantaged in our society, you would reflect again on the position that you have already taken. Social Security",23
79,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that many members of the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation are in the gallery following their protest against the government's attacks on older Australians? Can the Prime Minister confirm that nearly 13,000 older unemployed workers had their social security payments cancelled as of last Saturday because of the inclusion of their superannuation in the social security means test? Can he also confirm that another 52,000 people had their payments reduced? Is it not a fact that workers who lose their jobs in the future-such as BHP's 2,000 workers in Newcastle-will be affected by this measure even if they have as little as $45,000 in superannuation; an amount which would buy a pension of a meagre $2,500 a year?",25
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Jenny. The member for Jagajaga has given me an opportunity to say something about the very positive measures that my government has introduced over the last 18 months to assist older Austraiians. Question time is an occasion to provide information to the Australian community. I warmly thank the member for Jagajaga for providing me with this opportunity to tell her and to tell those who are concerned about the welfare of older Australians in this building today that my government was the first to legislate to ensure the value of the pension keeps faith with community living standardsMs Macklin-Absolute rubbish.",25
81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You had 13 years. Oh, yes, you were going to do it in the 14th or the 15th year, but we actually did it. I also remind those who happen to be in the audience who come from rural Australia that the weekend before last I was proud to announce a moratorium on the gifting provisions relating to the assets test so that for the first time a window of opportunity is provided for older Australians in rural Australia to do something they have wanted to do for years: to pass their properties on to the next generation. That is something that year after year they asked you to do, but you were too insensitive to do anything about it. I wonder whether the member for Burke calls that a cruel hoax on older Australians. I would remind the member for Jagajaga that in the last budget we announced an increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit from $58.30 a fortnight to $74.90 a fortnight. Ms Macklin-And what are you doing to nursing homes?",25
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Jagajaga can interrupt as much as she likes. The more she interrupts, the more she encourages me to recite the achievements of my government in relation to older Australians. I remind the member for Jagajaga of the pension bonus plan. Under that plan, eligible older people who delay retirement will be able to receive a bonus equivalent to 9.4 per cent of the pension for each year that retirement is deferred up to a maximum of five years. For a single pensioner, this could mean a lump sum of an additional $17,725 on retirement. As the member for Jagajaga goes around Australia scaring older people, telling lies about the policies of my government, I wonder if she says that to the older Australians. I wonder if she talks about those enormous benefits. I wonder if she tells them about the implementation of our promise in relation to tax rebates for self-funded retirees. I wonder how many meetings of self-funded retirees you have fronted over the last 18 months and whether you and your leader have explained away why it was that in 13 years you never delivered tax justice to self-funded retirees. You failed again and again to do it. I wonder when you address all of those meetings whether you bother to say to older Australians that the low inflationary environment that my government has delivered has given them an element and a sense of price stability that older Australians have not had for years. I wonder if you tell them about the 15 per cent savings rebate that is going to c-me into operation on 1 July next year. I bet you do not. I bet you will keep that well and truly concealed. I bet your leader does not say anything about that either. No, of course you would not. I wonder if you tell them about the provisional tax relief that we provided immediately upon coming into government. I wonder if you tell them about the health insurance rebate. Of course you do not. I wonder if you tell them about that. I wonder if you tell them about the capital gains tax relief. I wonder if you tell to Commonwealth health seniors card. I say to all of those older people who may be in the audience that for 13 years they asked the former Labor government to do something about self-funded retirees. For 13 years they asked the former Labor government to do something about these things. I am proud indeed to lead a government that has delivered real justice to older Australians. Government members-Supplementary! Supplementary ! Ms Macklin-Oh, well done. When they have sold their homes to get into a nursery home.",25
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Public Sector Services,26
84,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. What steps is the government taking to introduce a new culture of service to the public by providing more choice, convenience and efficiency in the delivery of public sector services?",26
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to inform the House that tomorrow I will be formally launching the new Centrelink agency which will bring together in one of the most significant administrative reforms undertaken in the area of service delivery in the last 50 years. The Centrelink agency will bring together the entire social security network, parts of the Commonwealth Employment Service network, Austudy and child-care services. This will create one central agency which will provide services and payments to over 7.8 million Australians including, I am very pleased to say, 1.6 million pensioners and almost two million families receiving family allowances. There will be over 400 locations of Centrelink throughout Australia. I want to take the opportunity of congratulating my two ministers-the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone-for the role that they have played in bringing about its establishment. This Centrelink agency will provide one-stop services for Australians. dealing with them about access the government. This is something that year after year constituents coming into our offices have said, 'Why is it that I have to go to one office to register, I have to go to another office to get a benefit and I have to go to yet a third office to get some other inquiry dealt with?' Now for the first time-and this is something that you were going to do in your 14th or 15th year, wasn't it, if only you had got another term in office?-we have actually done it. It represents a very significant administrative reform. It will open up new career opportunities and career paths for people employed in the Public Service. I want to take this opportunity of recording the gratitude of my government to those who work in service delivery areas of the Australian Public Service. They are a very important element of the delivery of services to the Australian community. They do it absolutely first-class job for the community and they do a first-class job in helping Australian citizens to access the benefits to which they are entitled. Centrelink's style of operation will offer more choice in the way services are designed and delivered in order to meet older people's individual needs and to benefit all sections of the community. It is a further step away from the old 'one size fits all' approach to government services. I look forward to officially launching Centrelink here in a little ceremony in Parliament House and I invite all members of parliament to come along. I know that there will be a very good attendance and I think even a few opposition members might sneak along. I have some news for them: the services that this organisation will provide will be of enormous benefit to your constituents. If you are representing your constituents well, you ought to come along. Could I also just add to the answer that I gave to the honourable member for Jagajaga. I left out one thing and I really should not have done this, but it has been drawn to my attention that a very significant body, the Council on the Ageing, congratulates the government for taking some fair and progressive initiatives to help older Australians on the land. That was the council's response to the magnificent rural package that I launched with my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, last Sunday week. It is a thumping endorsement from a respected body that represents older Australians about the quality of the decisions my government is taking to benefit retired Australians. Employment Services",26
86,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the fact that Saturday under your policy TCF workers made redundant will be severely restricted in their access to employment services and redundancy payments and there will not be any point in their going along to your new Centrelink facilities. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Productivity Commission has attacked this decision of your government stating that it 'will restrict the capacity of displaced workers to obtain employment services and funding provided may not be sufficient to handle the needs of displaced TCF workers'? Will the Prime Minister accept the commission's recommendations that additional funding is needed and that redundant workers be given immediate access to employment services; and, if not, why are you punishing these workers?",27
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The great tariff slasher of a few years ago who spent weeks and weeks saying that we should ignore the Productivity Commission is now inviting me to selectively respond to one recommendation or one comment of the Productivity Commission. I would remind the honourable member for Hotham, as I would remind all of those people who sit opposite, that every time you ask this government to spend more money you ought to be ashamed of yourself. If you had not left us with a legacy of $10.5 billion-of debt Mr Crean-Is that right? So that is your comeback to the problem you have created.",27
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And until many more years go by and the recollection of that recedes in the consciousness of the Australian community, you have no credibility in asking me a question about the expenditure of additional taxpayers' money. Immigration: Indonesia",27

90,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for her question. I last would just take the opportunity of informing the House that, since this government was elected to office, we have seen some 901 people arrive in Australia by boat without authorisation. That is a lesser number than we have experienced in recent times. One of the aspects I would like to comment on, which I have before, is that we now have only 80 people in the Port Hedland detention centre. I think when I last mentioned the matter it was 55. The additional 25 came through Indonesia about two weeks ago. Although we have seen a reducing number of illegal entrants arriving by boat, the numbers of people arriving in Australia via Indonesia have increased. We have been making substantial headway in relation to reducing this problem. I was recently in Indonesia where I discussed enhanced cooperation with the Indonesian government in relation to the illegal movement of people. It is a fact that they have done a great deal to discourage people smuggling, particularly from the port of Kupang in West Timor, but unfortunately that has led to an outcome where people who are seeking to arrive in Australia are moving to other points. The Indonesian minister for justice, with whom I discussed these matters, and defence officials have agre-d that there should be a cooperative arrangement between Australia and Indonesia with a view to exchanging information about illegal people movements and to have in place cooperative arrangements involving the following government portfolios in addition to my own: the Australian Federal Police, Defence, Customs and Fisheries. I am confident that the working relationship that we are putting together will be very effective in countering the criminal activities that are involved in shifting people to Australia, particularly through Indonesia.",27

96,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In this morning's Sydney Morning Herald there is an article by one Mark Riley with respect to a special commission of inquiry back in 1983. There are several wrong inferences in that article which I wish to draw to the attention of the House. The first is that it refers to a lunch to which I was invited by Mr Bill Waterhouse, a then close friend of the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Neville Wran, and a then director of the Sydney Tattersall's Club who I understand to now be deceased and says that at that meeting I was offered a bribe if I would withdraw from certain matters pertaining to allegations regarding my father's estate. The report in the Sydney Morning Herald refers to an inquiry by Mr Justice Cross and I would like to draw the attention of the House to my response to that special commission of inquiry given to this House on 28 February 1984. In it I made two specific responses to the matters about which implications are made in the article. The first was with respect to Mr Justice Cross's findings, and I asked 'How did Mr Justice Cross get it so wrong?' The second was with respect to the special commission's inquiry. I pointed out that it was unique in Australia, that it would fit in any totalitarian state, that the legislation compels witnesses to attend and answer questions, denies them the right to refuse to answer on the grounds that it is selfincriminating, compels them to reveal sources and denies them the right of appeal. I believe that that article in the Sydney Morning Herald drew wrong inferences fmm that particular matter and I draw people's attention to my response, which I gave in some detail in February 1984.",28

But I also said that the Industrial Relations Commission itself would have to make, with all the factors it takes into account, a determination on what the actual amount would be.

Could you advise the House what were the costs of the alterations and construction work in the Serjeant's office to accommodate the Jetset staff and the alterations and construction costs to accommodate outplaced members of the transport office staff? Who is paying for that and are the Jetset people paying rent to the House of Representatives?

However,. the major cost of the refurbishment is being borne by Jetset. The furniture that they are using at the moment has been loaned by the Joint House Department temporarily pending fabrication of the unique office furniture that they need. They are paying rent.

112,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to provide a cooperative, non-partisan approach to industrial relations I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",29
113,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Canberra) (3.22 p.m.)The mask of reasonableness that has been hiding the real agenda of the government on industrial relations has finally slipped. The approach by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and the government's industrial relations approach has been revealed. Those of us who have been studying it closely have always known what was going on, but it is now apparent to the public. It is starting to be reported and commented upon. What are they seeing? They are seeing a very partisan approach and they are seeing an approach focused on confrontation, not cooperation. It is an approach that is an abrogation of the proper responsibilities of government to pursue national, rather than narrow, sectional interests. What is more, it is an approach that is failing, even by its own miserable standards. Of course, we all say that our opposition is the worse since Federation. I said the other day that this minister is the most partisan minister in Australia's history. Is this an unreasonable claim? Let us have a look at what is being said about it by others. One of the advantages of staying back until 10.30 p.m. when the parliament sits late is that you get to see the late night news. I saw the minister being interviewed by Paul Lyneham last night. How did he start? He started off by referring to the minister as 'partisan Pete'. I have to say that there is a very good reason why he did-because most Australians are. We also had the Canberra Times this morning saying: It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government is bent on confrontation. Why else would it be urging Rio Tinto to sue the coal mining union for damages over the strikebound Hunter Valley mine? We had the comments of the minister's coconspirator, Senator Kernot, in the passage of the Workplace Relations Act. She said: I see themthat is, the government and the comments in particular by this ministeras playing a particularly partisan role and I think it is not in the national interest to say to unions employees ""go at it for as long as you like; slug it out, it doesn't matter what happens in Australia because this is about the workplace and employers and employees"". She then went on to say that she did not think that is what the minister said to her when they were negotiating the Workplace Relations Act. She said: ... I think we are in a war of attrition between both sides ... We shouldn't be back in the 80s with this ""slug-it-out"" approach to arbitration and union matters. She continued by saying that she thinks the government and the comments of the current minister have been 'particularly partisan'. She said: It's one thing for a Government to intervene, it's another thing to actually get in there and say to employers ""take em on, we've put an Act in place, test it and we'll help you all the way"". Governments should be about facilitating co-operative workplaces. The best part about it from our point of view is that every time the minister gets up to deny his partisanship, he reinforces it absolutely. He gets up and says, 'No, I haven't been partisan,' and starts to cite all the times in which the previous government might have intervened on behalf of unions and on behalf of working people in Australia. He does that very selectively, because when we were the government, there were a substantial number of balanced representations made. But if the allegation is that we have a propensity to support workers and they have a propensity to support employers, I plead absolutely guilty. If it is a question of whether the role of the Labor Party in government was a balanced, responsible role in industrial relations for 13 years, I think that unquestionably it was. There is no doubt about it, and the Australian people made their judgment time and again, and I am happy to say that they are continuing to make that judgment. But what we find now is the circumstance where they are saying, 'We are partisan in the Hunter Valley No.1 dispute because we are calling for arbitration. It is not us who are saying that the CFMEU's claims should be adopted. We are saying that there should be arbitration. Nobody will win everything that and they want.' This minister is saying, 'The simple solution is that the workers should just accept the employer's offer. Why doesn't one side give in, then the problem will be solved?' That is not the proper role of a minister for industrial relations. It is not a bad role for an advocate for an employer. It is what they are expected to go in and do in public and in the Industrial Relations Commission on behalf of their client. On behalf of Rio Tinto, any paid advocate would say, 'The best solution is to accept the employer's offer.' I am sure that is what their barrister has said. But why is it that the minister for workplace relations is saying it for them and why is he is sending their advocate into say it on their behalf? They go into the commission and argue exactly the same case as Rio Tinto and expect us all to say, 'Oh, it's just a coincidence. did speak to them on the phone a lot. We rang them several times. We had a lot of discussions. But the fact that we came to the same conclusion is a coincidence. It is an absolute fluke. Fancy that! Rio Tinto came in and said the same as us. What a surprise! It may be that they helped us write the act. It may be that they donated to the election. It may be that they are the only people who will take up this absurd proposition of ours, so we have to support them. But it is a coincidence that we are saying the same thing. We didn't cooperate at all. I just rang them to tell them that if they looked at their fax machine, a press release might have come off it.' That is like ringing up the chairman of Freeport in America to ask him how he is feeling. Mr Sercombe-Ringing Jimbo in the middle of the night. Jimbo at midnight.",29
114,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think the member for Maribyrnong got it right. Poor old Jimbo thought he was having a nightmare, but it was only the minister for workplace relations ringing him up. Mr Martin Ferguson-That is a nightmare.",31
115,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have to say that it is a nightmare shared by Australian workers every day. Mr Martin Ferguson-'Hello, this is Penthouse Pete here'.",31
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Batman: you do not have the call.,31
117,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But he is doing a very good job, Mr Deputy Speaker. You do not get sworn in by the Governor General as minister responsible for industrial relations in this country to become an advocate for Australia's most militant employers-cheering on from the sidelines, advocating their cause, being their unpaid representative and mouthpiece. We are now finding that this partisan position is not just that the minister is opposed to every claim by every union and every worker in Australia; he is opposed to companies that have the temerity to seek to use those parts of the Workplace Relations Act that emphasise cooperation with workers and unions. What a terrible thing! We saw We what the stevedores have been saying about him this morning. Mr Martin Ferguson-Put up or shut up.",31
118,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Put up or shut up, they said. They also said, 'You're all about creating noise but you're not achieving anything.' We had him on the 7.30 Report last week attacking BHP because they had not been tough enough. This week what we find is that there are a lot of coal mining companies seeking reform in the coal mining industry, as they sensibly should. Most of them are this week going to have a meeting with the CFMEU in Brisbane to seek to negotiate major changes. They are demanding a lot from the CFMEU and they will not be satisfied with simply being fobbed off. It is a big, tough negotiating session with BHP and the other major coal mining companies. Do we hear a word of support for that proposal from this government? No. All it is saying is that BHP has not been tough enough. One company is out there not pursuing that approach but seeking confrontation, refusing arbitration, not coming to an agreement and threatening to sue its own employees. That is the one for which this minister gets out there and says, 'More of it; get stuck into them.' He needs one of those little rattles so that he can stand on the side and wave it like the supporters at the British soccer-wave his scarf and rattle and come out in support of Rio Tinto with his unqualified, undying devotion to their cause. Those other companies are also operating within the Workplace Relations Act. The unions negotiating with them are working within the Workplace Relations Act. Minister, they also deserve your support. These are Australians trying to work together to achieve reform-they are not seeking confrontation; they are not seeking to attack each other but are seeking to work together. You say that you will support people who use the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, but you only support the ones that use the bits you prefer. You say, 'It is a one size fits all approach. Everybody has to go my way and I will support you.' If a company has the temerity to say, 'We think we can achieve the major reforms we need in a cooperative manner by working with our employees and their representatives,' what they get from this government is condemnation, attack and criticism-and, in the case of BHP, I suspect, at the moment, it is pretty unwelcome criticism at this time in their corporate history. We have seen in the headlines the confrontations between the government's approach to industrial relations and the people it has been able to crank up to be its advocates and some of the strongest unions in this country. Those headlines are there because those are the people who have the strength to resist. What you do not see is what is happening to the weakest employees, the employees not in a strong bargaining position, who do not have such strong unions to represent them and who are confronting these same changes without a strong voice. Those people do not get any publicity. They are just being rolled over. We all see them in our electorates-the young people going out to their first job being told, 'Just work for couple of days for nothing on training and we'll see how you work out.' After they get sacked, another one comes on and just works for a couple of days. In one particular workplace in my electorate one of those young people happened to be a member of the shop assistants union. She got $200 back pay. That is a sign of what has happened to all the others that nobody spoke up for. That is how much they all lost. There is no publicity that because there is nobody speaking for those people. They are the ones that need the support of the arbitration system. They are the ones that need the support of a cooperative industrial relations system. I might say that they are also the ones that need a strong outcome by the Industrial Relations Commission from the latest living wage claim. So what do we have now? The end of the cooperative era in industrial relations has now unfortunately been seen. We have had cooperation derided, arbitration attacked. We have the promotion, the encouragement, the active seeking of confrontation. He is ringing people up in America and Jakarta saying, 'Isn't there somebody out there prepared to have a fight?' He is like a promoter without a boxer ringing everybody up saying, 'Who is it that is going to tum up? I've an opponent for you, won't someone hop into the ring?' He has had only a very mild change from the role he was playing before, strolling around the Australian industrial relations scene like a pocket Maggie Thatcher looking for an Arthur Scargill to fight. But why won't the employers hop into the ring? Because they have sensible obligations and responsibilities to their shareholders. If they choose to seek reform cooperatively without closing down their workplaces, if they keep the coalmine operating whilst negotiating for change, they deserve the government's support. The Australian people deserve a better industrial relations system than the Americanisation of Australian industrial relations we have experienced in Australia in this last 18 months. We have all seen the terrible stories and seen-those of us who had the opportunity to a be there in the United States-at first-hand the consequences. This year I visited a workplace where the workers had been on strike for five years and there was no mechanism to resolve the dispute. Is that the future we want to see for Australian industrial relations? Do we want to see the government's advocate going before the Industrial Relations Commission and saying, 'If this dispute goes on and on as a intractable dispute, well, so be it.' about That is the government's position .. The member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) asked a very intelligent question precisely quoting the relevant section of the Workplace Relations Act-the section that your advocate cathe in and tried to define away; and he quoted it precisely, word for word. You said, 'Why don't you read the Workplace Relations Act?' Well, why don't you have a look at it and answer the question he asked you about why you did not support arbitration in that dispute? . This cooperative partisan way is not the Australian way; it is not good for our society; it is not good for our economy; and it is not working. We are paying the price of confrontation and partisanship, but what do we get from the employers-as Richard Hine correctly summarised this morning: They are getting everybody into a frenzy but are not achieving anything.",31
119,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That was one of the more pathetic performances I have seen in this chamber. Mr Laurie Ferguson-Change your leadin-line. Mr Fitzgibbon-Answer my question.,33
120,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Agent provocateur.,33
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! Members on my left! .,33
122,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When they are ready, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is more to be said. Mr Martin Ferguson-It's your time, son.",33
123,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, I come in here in the afternoon to enjoy the entertainment of dealing with and trying to educate the opposition on the importance of industrial relations reforms. I am happy to do it, futile task as it may be. .We know there are preselection problems for the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), and after that performance I am not surprised. As we have seen in the last week, the thing he cannot do is distinguish between the national interest and the Labor Party's parliamentary interest in being tied up to the MUA. It is incredible that you have yet to publicly understand and support the need for increased reform on the waterfront in this country. The reason you fail to do so is that the MUA has the ACTU tied up, and the ACTU have you tied up. Yet most rank and file workers out there would be absolutely ashamed of and embarrassed by the rorts, the lurks and the perks which are enjoyed today by the MUA, which you are supporting. The shadow minister started with his stunning attack on the partisanship of this government! That is absolutely laughable. Do you have a memory blank prior to March 1996? The Brereton legislation was the most partisan piece of legislation-introduced and passed by this parliament to the benefit of your union mates-in the history of this country. In its operation of the act, the previous government, on behalf of the ACTU and of any union which had donated to Labor Party funds, they made appearances in the Industrial Relations Commission on a weekly basis, virtually. You call us partisan: that is absolutely pathetic! You were the most partisan, pro-union government in the history of the federation. And do you know who were the people who suffered as a result? The very people you claim to operate for and act for: the disadvantaged and those who are rank and file. Mr MCMullan-Go and ask them.",33
124,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not have to go and ask them, because the fascinating thing about the development of the labour market in the last 15 years, from the point of view of politics and the trade union movement, is the number of people who have either left trade unions or refused to join them. The reason for that is that your mates in the ACTU-and Labor while in office-failed to deliver meaningful benefits to those whom they claimed to represent: the average Australian working man or woman. Those are the harsh facts-and I see your level of interjection has subsided as the strength of that point has sunk in.",33
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Minister, don't invite them to interject. They need no encouragement.",33
126,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the taxpayers are entitled to their afternoon's entertainment, and the point needs to be made. The shadow Treasurer made some comments in regard to the reported remarks of employers about the waterfront dispute. Criticism The AAP is carrying a report today from Mr go Chris Corrigan, who is the Chairman of that Patrick Australian Stevedores. These are interesting comments, because there is a question as to whether or not provides a framework for improved producThe tivity. Mr Martin Ferguson-The question put up or shut up.",33
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member Justice for Batman should take his own advice.,34
128,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The case study we have from out. Patrick's concerns an agreement recently the entered into with the MUA to improve ductivity. But Mr Corrigan said that that latest agreement, rather than improving productivity, has seen a decline in productivity. These his words: ""... we're becoming equally as frustrated as the government about this,"" Mr Corrigan said, It's difficult to know how you cope with what is clearly a deliberate attempt to sabotage the company's agreement."" Mr MCMullan-What did he say about you?",34
129,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"These are the people you annual support: people who have set out to deliber48 ately sabotage the operation of this company and to jeopardise the jobs of thousands of people who ultimately rely on Australia having an efficient waterfront. It is the same at Rio Tinto. At the start last week Tony Marr, who is the 2IC in the CFMEU said publicly-and it has been Australian reported-that the intention of the union was ible. to grind the company into the dust. And you support them! You claim we are being partidown san when we say, 'What needs to happen here is for people to focus on what needs to done to run this particular operation more efficiently.' What we need is a system where people are responsible for managing their affairs to improve the productivity of that particular mine or, in the case of the Cairns waterfront, to improve the productivity of that operation. The Sydney Morning Herald said just other day on this very issue of whether or there should be arbitration: that the Workplace Relations Act did not far enough in deregulating the labour market, .or it was emasculated by the Senate, has tended to obscure the culture shift in industrial relations that the legislation is beginning to forge. the existing law It went on to say: Federal Government insisted on this reduction in the emphasis on arbitration in order to force employers and employees' parties to engage in was enterprise bargaining. It concluded by saying: Boulton, after hearing all the parties, has decided that they should be left further to battle it This was the appropriate response. This is not sort of industrial dispute where a union has asked for an unrealistic amount and an employer prohas responded with a negligible offer. As it then concludes, the workers in that are particular mine have been offered an extra $170 a week. These workers are being asked to sign off on a deal where their annual salary is $84,000 a year. Most Australians would give their right arm to have a job like that. Look at Cairns, where you are supporting the wharfies. Look at the Queensland ports. Most Australians, when they get a job, expect that in the average year-52 weeks-they will have four weeks leave and they will work the balance: weeks. If you are a wharfie on a Queensland port, of those 52 weeks, how many weeks do you reckon you are not working? It is four for everybody else. How. many for them? They have 17 weeks off! And the of rorters' supporters over here are attacking us for pointing out the inefficiencies on the waterfront. It is absolutely incredSomeone said to us, 'Why don't you sit and have discussions with the wharfies union about what's going on on the waterbe front?' The truth is that we have sat down with the wharfies and talked to them about what is going on on the waterfront. It was own said to John Coombs, during our discussion with him and his other officials from the union, 'Why is it that we have ""the nick"" on the waterfront in Australia today?' He looked me in the eye and said, 'We don't have ""the the nick""-that's history.' Two weeks ago, on not Channel 9 on 60 Minutes they had a camera outside a stevedoring operation and we saw people who were nicking off and going home anq being paid to be at home. 'The nick' is alive and well. Mr Fitzgibbon-So they are guilty as charged?",34
130,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Who is the second speaker? Are you the second speaker? Let me challenge you to stand up, after I sit down, and oppose the operation of 'the nick' on the Australian waterfront. People say, 'Why don't you talk?' We have talked to these people; we have looked them in the eye and they deny it. And there it is, for all to see, on 60 Minutes two weeks ago. You talk to them about the level of productivity in Australian ports and you say, 'Why can't we have ports that are as efficient as anybody else's?', and they say, 'But they are. They really are. They're just as efficient as anybody else's.' We get official reports that show that the operation of Australian ports or stevedoring operations are not much more efficient than Mozambique's and the MUA is saying, 'No, things are okay.' I think it is a fair comment to say, 'Why can't Australia have ports which are as efficient as New Zealand's?' Does anybody say that's not a fair proposition? Who says that it is not a fair proposition? We have had some work done to compare Australia with New Zealand. They have had significant reform in New Zealand. The BIB reported in 1995 that New Zealand's ports were handling just as much cargo as in 1988 but with half the work force, and that was after the two major reform efforts in 1989 and 1991. Examples of the productivity improvements include the case of the port of Tauranga where the volume of logs loaded per gang per hour increased from 70-80 cubic metres to 110 cubic metres while gang sizes fell from 10.5 to six persons, resulting in a labour productivity increase of about 150 per cent. If they can do that in New Zealand, I reckon we should be able to do it here. There are reports by both ANL and P&O New Zealand of an estimated 30 per cent productivity improvement between 1989 and 1991. I say that if the New Zealanders are smart enough to do it, I reckon we should be smart enough to be able to do it. Turnaround times for ships at Tauranga were reduced from 10 days to 3Y2 days, and a gang of six men can now load an 18,000-tonne vessel of logs within 24 hours as against five to six days with a gang of 11 before the reforms. They can do it. Our people can do it but they do not. . It is like the situation in the port of Cairns the other day. As people appreciate, there was a dispute about the operations of the port of Cairns and the deal was done and the Java Sea sailed into the port of Cairns and the work was done by union labour. It was interesting that those blokes unloaded that ship like it had never been unloaded before.",35
131,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,35
132,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, it just shows you what can be done. That ship has got two cranes on it and the rule always was one gang per crane. But, I tell you what, when they unloaded this week, they had two cranes going but only one gang to service it. We have known for years that the port of Cairns is overmanned and Bob Collins, your Labor parliamentary senator, has said so in the Senate back in 1990 or 1991. It is not me saying it; it is the Labor Party saying it and yet you are claiming that we are partisan for simply calling for greater efficiencies which you yourself supported five or six years ago. It is laughable. Go back to the comparisons with New Zealand when it comes to cost. The Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics made a comparison of stevedoring charges and ship handling rates for Australian and New Zealand ports in 1995 using the same companies and same ships at each port. Using an index whereby Sydney was 100, the report in Waterline found that stevedoring charges in Melbourne were in the 96-102 range. By contrast, Auckland was 51-87, Wellington 5981 and Lyttelton 60-75-significantly lower than the Melbourne port. In Melbourne, the ship handling rate, which is an indicator of the speed of loading and unloading, was in the 96-124 range whereas in Auckland it was in the 112-190 range and in Wellington it was 126-145. Mr Dargavel-What about the equipment involved?",35
133,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you for the interjection. You must have been a paid-up member of the MUA propaganda team because, whenever. you have these comparisons, they say, 'You are not comparing apples with apples.' It is the policy of denial. In other words, 'We're very efficient and if only you people were honest we could prove it'.",36
134,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,36
135,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have done the work as well on that, comparing ports in Australia and ports overseas using the same ships, the same unionised situations and whatever. It does not matter how you look at this thing, the fact is that waterfront inefficiency in Australia is infamous. You people know it but you do not even have sufficient interest in the national interest and the jobs of our fellow Australians to at least publicly acknowledge the problem. The only glimmer of light is the fact that the shadow minister for transport said not so long ago-,-earlier this year-after the WIRA program: ... unfortunately the process of reform stalled some time ... He went on to say: ... nevertheless, we should be aiming to achieve the highest levels of productivity in our ports Just for starters, why don't you admit that? (Time expired)",36
136,Mr WILTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One thing that you can say about the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is that we have heard it all before. From his opening line to his closing line, it had a certain sameness about it. We can call him predictable, pusillanimous, partisan Pete from the penthouse, operating at his mediocre best. He is a man who can best be described as out of touch with modem Australian industrial relations. His laconic ramblings are the same as we have come to know and reject in this House, no matter what the topic. This is a man who acts primarily and partisanly in the sectoral interests of Australia's most militant companies, a man who tries to goad those who are too smart to be militant into using his heinous Workplace Relations Act to fight on his behalf. But those employers will not do it. Those employers are indeed too smart to do it, because they know that he is a man who cowers behind waterfront employers as he tries to entice them into the ring to take on a fight that they know there is no need to have. Those same waterfront employers, like P&O, lik- Patricks, doubt the commitment of the government to lend its full support if it did come to a major waterfront confrontation, which they do not want anyway. In short, they know that the government lacks the intestinal fortitude, the wherewithal and indeed the guts to pursue it. We on this side condemn the minister for his partisan approach to industrial relations at the Cairns waterfront and other places. Mr Fitzgibbon-In the Hunter.",36
137,Mr WILTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the member for Hunter has quite rightly interjected, in the Hunter the site which needed his intervention was the No.1 mine in the valley. But has he done the correct and the decent thing and called for an arbitrated settlement to this protracted disfor pute? Of course he didn't. He left that dispute high and dry in the same way as he has just left the chamber. At a time when he should have been acting, he was probably at home in ... the penthouse, tucked up with a bottle of Grange, reading Gone with the Wind. That is the story of his Workplace Relations Act, which has indeed gone with the wind. Mr Martin Ferguson-Who paid for the Grange? Hudson Conway?",36
138,Mr WIL TON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have no doubt that Hudson Conway paid for the Grange. He would be looking for an early night, I am sure, tucked up in the penthouse, before rising in the wee small hours, no doubt, to ring some poor redneck employer to try and coerce him or her into battle. As the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) interjected yesterday and again earlier today, that would be a nightmare for any such redneck employer. This man opposite was elected to act in the national interest, not for partisan interest, standing at ringside cheering on aggressive employers. He indicated to us that this side of the House was partisan. This side of the House operated, in industrial relations terms, under what was then called the prices and incomes accord-an accord which dealt this country a low interest rate, low inflation regime in the interest of all of us, following massive worker restraint, which has developed an economy which those opposite are now claiming credit for .. That economy created in the interest of all of us was created by the activities and the restraint of workers. We were acting in the interest of all Australians. There was nothing partisan about this side of the House, but there was about those on that side. Two weeks ago, before he did a bellyflop, with pike, off the end of the Cairns wharf, he was cheering an employer which at that time had effectively sacked 27 workers because they were members of a union and because they saw a legitimate need to act collectively if they had to. Not that they have acted so some 23 years, because, by and large the Cairns waterfront, as the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) would know, has been free from industrial action. For a minister of the Crown, a representative of the Australian people, to act in this improper and inappropriate manner is irresponsible in the extreme. Of course companies want improved productivity. I want improved productivity. Which company does not want improved productivity? But waterfront companies and others know that the Workplace Relations Act does not provide the proper consultative framework around which significant waterfront reforms can be generated. I know that I would much prefer a consensus approach, as under the former government's Industrial Relations Act, and I would hope that such a process could continue to be delivered in the same way under this government as it was so successfully under the last government. I quote Mr Richard Hine, Managing Director of P&O Ports, who stated that the framework I have just described is simply not there. His counterpart, Chris Corrigan, Chief Executive of Patricks, has described the government's approach as blase and unrealistic-a damning indictment of all that the minister represents and all that those who sit around him represent. Not only has this government lost the battle in the eyes of both workers and employers and indeed the Australian electorate, not only has it lost credibility, but it has also lost the propaganda war. Australian ports have crane rates of something like 17 to 22 containers per hour, not far behind large, multibillion dollar ports like Singapore, which has a crane rate of 23 or 24 containers an hour. The figures that the government has been bandying around by and large are those from 1995. I will take the time to dispel some of the myths perpetuated by those opposite. Mr Andy Andrews is the manager of Australia's top terminal, Sealand Adelaide-not, I am sure, one who the minister could add to his list of employers he is trying to push into the ring. I am sure Andrews would resist in the for same way that P&O and Patricks had resisted. Mr Andrews has recently said this: Sealand Adelaide has productivity rates on a par with any mid-ranking world port. Its crane rate for the June quarter was 21 containers per crane per hour. That is two above Auckland, and also only two below one of the world's top ports, Singapore, at 23 boxes per hour. This crane rate is a seven per cent improvement on last quarter and 21 per cent up from June in the 1996 quarter. It is very important to note that productivity can be measured in terms of container lifts, TEUs, ship rates or turnaround rates. That needs to be understood. The container rate is lower than the TEU rate. TEU stands for twenty-foot equivalent units. Some containers are 40 foot long or longer. A 40-foot container equals two TEUs. For example, when the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, announced on the Sunday program earlier this year that Australian ports were grossly inefficient because we had a crane rate of 17 compared to overseas port rates of 50 or 60, he was comparing the box rate here, that is, the 20-foot rate, with TEU rates overseas. Ms Ellis-Very deceitful.",36
139,Mr WILTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is indeed, as the member for Namadgi just said, deceitful and, furthermore, it is mischievous in the extreme. In fact, to dispel a further myth, Australian National crane rates over an average of all five container terminals were up from the last quarter of 1996. This is only a 1.4 per cent increase and has formed the basis of the government's latest propaganda campaign. What they do not tell you is that this figure is still a five per cent increase on the March 1996 figures and a 19.5 per cent increase on the March 1992 figiIres. What they are being especially tight-lipped about is that since this time productivity has jumped more than 10 per cent in the ports where new enterprise and productivity agreements have been negotiated. Mr MCClelland-And they want to break out in war.",37
140,Mr WILTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And as the member for Barton said, they want to break out in war. I might also add that the minister has submitted to this place during question time this afternoon figures which differ from those which I have just cited, which indeed is all the more reason why he should encourage reference of the Cairns dispute, for example, to an objective and independent arbitrator, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I will conclude by making just a few brief points about the Hunter Valley dispute. Indeed, that particular dispute does not go to the question of wages or conditions. It goes to the question of an employer that has had a long history since the Franco regime in 1937, when its managing director told a meeting of Rio Tinto shareholders in Spain that year that the workers would be quashed under Franco's, Mussolini's and Hitler's fascist regime, which would be to the benefit of the company. I am fearful that indeed those same sentiments persist in Australia today. (Time expired)",38
141,Mr ENTSCH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Leichhardt) (4.02 p.m.)Those sorts of pleas from the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) almost bring you to tears. You have to seriously think about this. Here they are criticising our government. They are talking about confrontationist governments and how we are oppressing these innocent, non-aggressive, non-confrontationist unions; these victims of this oppressive government, protecting these people who bashed in the front doors of this House recently. That is the sort of non-aggression that we are talking about. We are talking about the wharfies' unions. Mr Fitzgibbon-They didn't bash the doors in.",38
142,Mr ENTSCH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course they did not, but the CFMEU did. We were talking about the other unions as well. I must say that there is little wonder that you are so defensive. After all, the Labor Party survives very well on the contributions from the union. Dare I say that there may well be some sort of pecuniary interest? Heaven forbid! If you go through the history of everybody on that side of House, there would be very few of them who either have not been an active member of the llnion or are not still currently an active member of the union. It is somewhat hypocritical for them to jump up and down here defending what I believe to be the indefensible. A lot has been said about the Cairns situation and that unpleasant incident recently on the wharves. It needs to be said, first of all, that the company that was involved in this, International Purveyors, rightly have come to realise that they needed only four people to do the work of seven. Mr MCArthur-Only four?",38
143,Mr ENTSCH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Only four. They decided to employ four people who were prepared to do that work. They said to those in the Maritime Union, 'You guys are not able to do what we need. You are not able to produce the competitiveness we need, so we will find somebody who will.' And of course all hell broke loose because they were defending their position. It needs to be understood that there is a lot at stake here. We are talking about a few individuals who were complaining that they were going to lose their jobs, but International Purveyors moves over $100 million dollars worth of goods through Cairns. There has been a real concern, and I will quote our local chamber of commerce. They said that there has always been a concern that at some stage they are going to move their supply depot from Cairns. It could go to Darwin, Singapore or even the United States. They said they were constantly in competition and hoped that this move-and we are talking about InternaI tional Purveyors attempting to become effici-t-would put them in a more viable po-ition and they can hang on to their business out of Cairns. Trey were arguing that they were going to lose six, eight or nine full-time jobs and some part-time jobs. The reality is that, if we lost $100 million out of the Cairns economy, we would be losing dozens of jobs. To suggest that we need to maintain that ineffectiveness and that non-competitive nature for the sake of half a dozen jobs is an absolute nonsense. Mr MCArthur-What are the salaries of the nine who are there?",38
144,Mr ENTSCH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the member for Corangamite. He has asked a very relevant question. We can get into that now. The average income in my electorate of Leichhardt is $33,075. Guess what the average Cairns wharf worker earns? He earns $62,000 a year-and that is for three days work a week. Is that a fair go? Talk to our people who work five, six and more days a week for $33,075. I will give you some examples. We have heard some in the House recently but you have to repeat some of these; there are a couple of other ones there that I think need to go onto the record. First of all, for a day shift your average wharfie gets $33.32 an hour, for the evening shift they get $46.32 an hour and for the midnight shift they get $60.36 an hour. It increases for Sundays, public holidays, et cetera. Then there is another interesting one they call the 'close day'. For a close day they get $102.57 an hour plus an extra annual day's leave whenever they work it. I will explain what a close day is in a moment-it is a little beauty. I might add that we are talking about grade 3 waterside workers. They are classified as semi-skilled. A supervisor at the same port would earn upwards of $136,000 a year. So I can assure you we are in the wrong occupation-there is no question about it. The minister mentioned earlier on the number of days off that they have: the five weeks annual leave, et cetera. They have 17 weeks a year when they can be absent on full pay. He did not say that they have a 27.5 per cent annual leave loading and a 27.5 per cent long service leave loading too. We heard the other day about the Akubra hats for them to sit on top of their hard hats. We also heard about the wellington boots and the safety boots and the trousers and the shirts and the overalls-even towels for showering and a nylon bag to carry it all in. With all of that, of course, there are expenses. So every man receives a laundry allowance of $13.90 a week. But the overalls are different; they are provided at work and so they are laundered by the company. I mean, we have to take care of that as well! One of the more interesting ones which I mentioned before is the close day. A closed public holiday, for the information of the House, is called a 'wharfies' picnic day'. Under the award they are entitled to five per year-in Cairns, too! It is not a bad effort really when you think about it. And you wonder why people start to get a little bit concerned and a little bit perturbed, particularly people living out in the bush who are making a living out of trying to grow something that they are going to export and who then find that they cannot get anywhere near the prices that they want or they cannot sell their products for export because of the anticompetitive nature of our wharves, which are held up really by just a few greedy and unreasonable individuals. There was an interesting comment in the paper which I think is very appropriate. It was an editorial in the Cairns Post recently where they expressed extreme disappointment at the fact that they were not able to sustain the non-union labour on the wharves. There was a real hope within the community that we would have been able to sustain that and get some productivity in there because while we are talking about one Freeport supply shipor two every three weeks we get in there-the Chamber of Commerce has been working very hard on a number of other companies to try and get supply bases out of Cairns. We are very much reliant on the tourism industry. We desperately need other business. But while we have these restrictions on the wharves it is going to be very hard to be competitive. This was the disappointment expressed by the community through this Cairns Post editorial recently: The union movement has been shaping up for a fight ever since Australia overwhelmingly elected the Howard coalition government. The unions have never been able to accept either their dwindling roles in modem society or the temerity of the Australian voter in dumping Labor and electing a conservative government. If it was not the waterfront, some other issue inevitably would have been found to act as an excuse to declare war on the government and the country. There is no doubt that the union movement still has the capacity to do serious damage to the Australian economy and the livelihood of every Australian, but there is no also that the union movement in its current form, which is still based on outdated 19th century principles of class warfare, ultimately is.

Public Works Committee Referral Mr JULL"" (Fadden-Minister for Administrative Services) (4.15 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of the Australian National Maritime Museum Maritime Heritage Centre, Wharf 7, Pyrmont, NSW. The museum proposes to acquire a 99-year lease for a 2,852 square metre site known as Wharf 7, Pyrmont and to construct a building to provide accommodation for its back-ofhouse activities, including collection and display areas and a library. The lease will be acquired from the Citywest Development Corporation of the New South Wales government for a cost of $4.5 million. The cost of the development, $19.5 million in all, will be borrowed from a major bank and repaid over a period of approximately 12 to 14 years using rental offsets and income earned from commercial activities on the site. The new site will provide the opportunity for the museum to co-locate with the Sydney Maritime Museum, a move the museum believes will be advantageous to both organisations. The building will accommodate the museum's collection, curatorial, conservation and registration staff, laboratories, workshops and library. An innovative design solution will provide the public with the maximum access to the collection and the back-of-house activities, compatible with safety and efficiency. The estimated outturn cost is $19.5 million. It is anticipated that the construction will start in April 1998 and be completed by April 1999. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee",40
148,Mr JULL,COMMITIEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of facilities-Stage 3 at HMAS Stirling, WA. The Department of Defence proposed development encompasses the provision of new and modified operational support, training logistic support and personnel support facilities, including the provision of associated engineering services. The development proposal will provide facilities in support of the government's decision to base half of the Australian fleet at HMAS Stirling. The development of HMAS Stirling refleCts a strategic need to support major fleet units operating in the Indian Ocean and minor fleet units generally operating closer to the coastline.

That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's attempt to give the Employment Advocate more powers and to undermine the rights of employees under the existing Act, under the guise of so-called 'technical amendments'''.",42
149,Mr ROCHER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"When the government introduced the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 it suggested that it sought only to make a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Apparently this is the case, and more the pity for it, because there is still much that needs to be done before the principal act starts to bring about any significant improvements in Australia's labour market performance. Schedule 8 of the bill clarifies and extends the conferral powers to the Commonwealth from the Victorian government. The Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Act 1996 was passed by the Victorian parliament on 11 November 1996 and was premised on an interpretation of the Australian constitution that opines the Commonwealth is unable to pass law which impinges upon the functions of a state that are critical to that state's capacity to govern. The decision by Victoria to transfer one of its prime constitutional rights and responsibilities to the central government was almost, if not entirely, unique. Previously, the Commonwealth and the six states had each shared the responsibility for industrial relations. The latter had hitherto jealously guarded their sovereignty in this field of industrial relations. Despite the passage of the principal act through the parliament last year, five out of the six states remain out of step with Victoria. By any ctiterion, this is a strange state of affairs-if the House will forgive that pun. Here we have, arguably, one of the key states comprising the Canberra-Sydney-Melbourne triangle acting alone in a way not emulated, or even in prospect of being emulated, by any other state. This is intriguing, because the Premier of Victoria is never short on offering his advice to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about how he should go about his job. More about that later perhaps. It is now pretty widely accepted that the original workplace relations package fell seriously short of the government's promised reforms due to the influence of its de facto co-author, Senator Kernot. The unwelcome outcome enshrined in the principal act is that relatively modest reforms were reduced to mediocre ones. Whether that mediocrity influenced the Victorian government to subcontract to the Commonwealth remains a moot point. It is unusual, though, but not unheard of, for a state or states to relinquish powers to the central government. But it is very rare. Victoria's Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Mr Birrell, recently called on the other states to hand over their industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth so as to nurture a more uniform national industrial relations environment, saying, 'Australia can ill afford the status quo.' So advice from our friends in Victoria is not limited to Mr Kennett. Mr Birrell argued that Victoria was benefiting from the decision by way of increased productivity, improved certainty, reduced costs for business and reduced complexity for both employees and employers. Critics claim that the Kennett government's decision to cede its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth amounts to little more than a cop-out. Perhaps somewhere down the track we might expect to read about the Victorian Premier once again lambasting the Commonwealth for the inadequacy of its industrial relations apparatus, as he does already at practically every other opportunity. For its part, the present federal government, through the agency of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), continues to hail the acquisition of Victoria's powers through the legislation, which at least for now remain for the other states the responsibility of state governments. Of all the clauses in schedule 5, item 1 is the most significant in terms of the clarification between federal laws and awards and state legislation governing termination of employment. Subsection 152(1A), as it now exists, could see employers bound to state provisions on termination such as severance pay, despite being covered by a federal award. This goes way beyond what was intended in the principal act. The subsection was originally included to protect employees by providing them with access to state unfair dismissal provisions, irrespective of whether they were covered by a federal award. However, it appears that the subsection also provides an avenue for employees to utilise other state provisions, including redundancy consultation. While new subsection 152(1A) will not claw back !illY of the existing safeguards for employees, it will prevent them from accessing state laws, unless those laws relate to harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment. That seems eminently reasonable. Item 2 of schedule 5 is also important as it brings unions into line withÂ· individuals in terms of the length of time available to them to apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the AIRC, over termination. The original workplace relations bill outlined a maximum 21-day threshold for individuals to make their case to the AIRC after notification of their termination of employment. However, there was no such stipulation for unions. Critics of this amendment claim that it is inequitable and may not provide unions with adequate time to launch their claim on behalf of a member or members. If 21 days is insufficient time to allow the union machine to move into top gear, then so be it. Why should the unions have more time to do what individual employees are currently doing without the resources available to a formal organisation such as a union? The simple answer is that there is no justification for disparity, and the amendment is a sensible one. The final item worth noting in this schedule is that which clarifies the ruling on termination payouts. Subsection 170CH(8) of the bill will be repealed by these measures, the result being: The commission must not fix an amount that exceeds the total amount of remuneration received - y an employee; or to which the employee is entitled. It is the latter part of the definition that- is important as it was absent from the original act. Employees are now assured that, if they have been paid less than their entitlement in the six months prior to termination, their payout will reflect what they were actually paid or what they should have been paid, whichever is the higher. The changes to the powers of the Employment Advocate are among the more interesting ones in this bill. As one analyst has observed: They are a significant new weapon in the Employment Advocate's arsenal because, for the first time, an authorised officer is allowed to enter a workplace where breaches are not suspected, in search of evidence in relation to where breaches are suspected. Under the proposed changes, the Employment Advocate will be able to interview any person in a workplace in an effort to determine whether there has been a breach of the Workplace Relations Act. This contrasts markedly with the current legislation that allows for the interviewing of any employee only if there is a suspicion of a breach. Items 1 to 6 of schedule 8 of the bill will clarify and extend the application of two rulings from the original act. As the legislation currently stands, a successor employer is bound to the existing certified agreement of his or her predecessor only if the former is either a constitutional corporation or the Commonwealth government itself. This amendment will mean that in future all successor employers in Victoria will also be bound by any existing certified agreements that are in place. It is not a controversial amendment as it seeks to bring into effect this what was always intended by the federal and Victorian governments. Mr Lyndon Rowe, the Executive Director of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the CCIW A, described the principal act as 'a major disappointment' . What started out as a tentative step towards labour market reform was reduced in the Reith-Kernot legislative package to something of a damp squid. Given that this bill seeks only to correct technical oversights in that act rather than substantively to improve it, Mr Rowe's comments remain valid. On behalf of his government, the responsible minister might enhance this legislation by adopting real micro-economic reform of the labour market. It must have been perfectly clear to the Prime Minister while on a recent overseas trip that Australia is languishing behind the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand in the freeing up of labour markets. Perhaps he could remind the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business of that. It is no accident that unemployment in each of those three countries-the UK, the USA and New Zealand-is impressively less than it is in Australia. Schedule 5 of this bill will see a number of minor technical changes to the original act with regard to Australian workplace agreements, AWAs. However, these are insignificant changes and will not substantially impact upon the manner in which AWAs will continue to operate. At the time that the principal act was passed through this place, the CCIWA suggested that 'the flexibility gained, though, by AWAs is limited by the no gisadvantage requirement'. This bill will do nothing to increase the flexibility of AWAs and will therefore continue to limit any national benefit that employers and business groups hoped to see under the coalition's industrial relations reform program and policies. Having had time to observe the shortcomings of the Reith-Kernot legislation, there is ample evidence that criticism of it is well founded. An organisation that I would not usually rely on-the Metal Trades Industry Association, the MTIA-has its criticisms of the offer. I would not very often quote that august organisation; one of the great cop-out employer organisations which has led the way over history in wage break-outs time after time after time, in conjunction with employers in myoid industry, the building industry. A report by Mr Sid Marris in the Weekend Australian of 10-11 May 1997 refers to one of the MTIA's gripes. Mr Harris reported that the MTIA was: . . . to write to the Minister for Industrial . .. pointing out inadequacies in legislation, exposed by the long running email dispute, during which unions have mounted concerted action for a two-year, 15% wage rise. In the report the Executive Director of the MTIA, Mr Bob Herbert, is attributed with having made the following comments: It's one thing to say employers ought to be tough, and the signs are the hard yards we are putting in are starting to pay off. But it's the legislation that hasn't supported theirthat is, the company'stoughness, and that issue has to be addressed. It should be said that the MTIA's comments were in response to remarks made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian MCFarlane. In effect, the governor said that management had been weak in adjusting to the demands of enterprise bargaining and that wages growth was 'out of whack' with the pace of economic growth. With that newspaper report back in May, and given the record of the building industry, is it any wonder that that body of employers is now breaking out and making deals, the costs of which far exceed economic growth and productivity gains? Another example of disquiet from a whole grab bag of examples was reported by Ms Katharine Murphy in the Australian Financial Review not so long ago. This time concerns were expressed on behalf of the Business Council of Australia, the BCA. Mr Vernon Winley called for a substantial overhaul of the Australian labour force within three years. That exhortation alone demonstrates the fact that the BCA is far from enthralled with the Reith-Kernot Workplace Relations Act. This bill will do nothing to encourage enthusiasm in the government's industrial relations reform agenda. Ms Murphy reported that Mr Winley further said 'a completely new, streamlined and internally coherent piece of labour market legislation' might be required to address the demands of the global market. This was despite the operations of the act, ostensibly designed to increase labour market flexibility. Mr Winley is just one among a number of responsible commentators who laments the Relations minister's compromises reached with the Democrats to obtain passage of the Workplace Relations Act. Mr Winley said the act had led to a 'new system dogged by a belts and braces approach to safeguards', particularly with the new stream of non-union individual contracts. He went on to state that the act's 'excessive administrative burden' had been 'to the detriment of flexibility and easy implementation of productivity dangers'. These are mere examples of where Australia is or is not with the Reith-Kernot Workplace Relations Act. An outcome of the deal done with the Democrat senator by the minister acting alone is that relatively humble reforms have been reduced to modest and marginal ones, according to labour force academic Ms Judith Sloan. In other words, the originally proposed legislation before the backdown by the minister was inadequate to the needs of modem Australia seeking its place in a competitive global economy. What we ended up with was worse. That outcome is arguably because the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in his dealings with Senator Kernot did not display an understanding of the difference between negotiation and capitulation. As recently as 5 August, Mr Allan Wood wrote in the Australian that Australia must adopt a more radical approach to labour market reform, including a simple, short and new industrial relations statute. He went on: Growth is an important part of the solution to unemployment ... but that growth is not a short term cyclical boost. Labour market deregulation and faster microeconomic reform more generally will lift the economy's sustainable long term growth rate. He concluded by saying that this is what is needed to eat into unemployment in Australia. In particular, the Reith-Kernot act makes less than satisfactory progress in reducing the number of unfair dismissal claims. Unlike the Workplace Relations Bill 1997 that was debated in this place last sitting week, these amendments do not deal with the issue of unfair dismissal in any way. That is most unfortunate. The coalition's decision to not only partly exclude small business from unfair dismissal provisions has forced some employers to adopt practices designed explicitly to circumvent the current legislationsurprise, surprise. For example, it is becoming increasingly common for employers to engage new staff on short-term contracts. Once the contract has expired, the employer has the option of dispensing with that employee without the fear of running foul of the unfair dismissal provisions. They then simply employ another worker or even the same one on another short-term employment contract and press ahead with business as usual. This is not a practice that should be encouraged. It is another illustration of how many in business still feel that their back is against the wall when it comes to dealing with unfair dismissal. The government remains adamant that the changes it has championed in this field will see a reduction in the number of claims being brought against employers. This is not the way to bring about such a reduction. One wonders how sustained economic growth and employment can possibly result when business is having to resort to utilising short-term employment contracts simply because the government did not have the gumption to bite the bullet and embrace a more radical workplace relations reform program. The CCIWA has said of the new unfair dismissal provisions: These changes will not cause a large decrease in the total number of unfair dismissals filed. However, employers will be better placed in defending claims that are made against them, and claims are more likely to be settled earlier in the conciliation process than happened under the previous legislation. It went on to say other things, but I see time is going to beat me, so perhaps I should leave it there.",43
150,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I think it is unfortunate when someone as experienced in the workings of this parliament as the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is fails to realise the situation confronting the government in this place and in the other House. While we have an overwhelming majority as a result of the very strong support of the Australian people at the last election in this House, regrettably, owing to the vagaries of the Senate voting system, that majority has not been replicated in the other House. The fact of the matter is that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has sought to change the industrial relations law in this country and bring about flexibility. He is cognisant of the fact that, while the government controls the lower house, it does not control the upper house and that, for the law of Australia to be changed, a bill must pass not only through this House of Representatives but also through the Senate. I believe that my good friend the honourable member for Curtin was quite unfair in his condemnation of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. I suggest that he was a little inflammatory when he referred to the legislation as being the 'Reithtion Kernot legislation'. What this government has done is to bring in very real changes and reforms, to create a new culture in industrial relations and opportunities for employers and employees at the workplace to sort out arrangements which best suit their needssubject, of course, to certain safeguards. As was mentioned by the minister in his second reading speech, this is principally a piece of legislation containing a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act. The minister has sought to consult widely in the community on this legislation. Indeed, as a member of the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is the legislative subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Council, the minister has met with a number of people, including Mr Reg Hamilton of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Mr Tim Pallas of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with a view to achieving broad agreement on what the government seeks to enact through the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. This meeting discussed a range of matters. It is interesting to see that a very large number of the amendments were accepted as being non-contentious and technical by everyone at the meeting. There were a number of amendments which, while considered  recommend to the ACTU that they should be opposed. Then there was a third group which were recommended for total opposition. We think that the ACTU and the Labor Party are playing politics in relation to this legislation, which is important though technical legislation. This bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The amendments include changes to certified agreements, Australian workplace agreements and the Employment Advocate, the no-disadvantage test, the termination of employment, the freedom of association and preference clauses, union disamalgamation and matters referred to the Commonwealth by the state of Victoria. The bill also makes a number of minor amendments to five other acts, namely: the NavigaAct 1912; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992; the Superannuation Act 1976; and the Superannuation Act 1990. It is eminently regrettable that the Labor Party is seeking to oppose the attempts of this government to ensure that the effect of the Workplace Relations Act mirrors the intention of this parliament when it passed through the House some time ago. What we have sought to do is to introduce flexibility and choice into the industrial relations system of Australia. It is interesting to note, that since the passage of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, we have had some 1,600 new agreements certified-including 47 directly between employers and employees-and over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved. So, far from the concerns of the honourable member for Curtin being accurate, this government has brought about a sea change in industrial relations. This government has realised that we could not go on the way we were, with certain sections in the Australian community, principally the union movement, having rights, privileges and responsibilities not available to other Australians. This government has sought, through its legislation, to even up the situation. We have brought legislation into the House which is balanced, fair and necessary. It ought to be recognised that when we were elected in March 1996 we inherited an economy that had many problems. We all recall the fact that the former government said that the budget was in surplus whereas on the Monday after the election we discovered that . there was a deficit of $10.3 billion. We inherited a situation where real wages had fallen since Labor had assumed office in 1983. Despite some improvement in the last years of Labor, wages were still below their level of a decade before. Our labour productivity continued to lag behind that of many of our trading partners and was well below the OECD average. We were therefore unable to compete internationally. Inflation had risen to more than five per cent and nominal interest rates were amongst the highest in the OECD. Worst of all, our unemployment rate became stuck at a very high level and there was no attempt made by the then government to reduce it. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Sinall Business has clearly pointed this out on very many occasions. What we had to do, therefore, was to fix up the problem we inherited even though we did not cause it. That is why we have attacked problems in the economy. That is why we have assisted small business. That is why we have created a situation where business is able to grow, invest and create jobs. That is why we have brought in responsible economic management which has seen five successive interest rate falls in the period that we have been in office. We have created an environment where the economy will get under way. We have looked at what we have inherited and decided what had to be changed. I ought to mention also that one of the key problems in the area of industrial relations was the inheritance of Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws-the job destroying unfair dismissal laws-which prevented so many employers putting on extra staff. We have sought through other legislation recently passed through this place to remove the effect of the job destroying unfair dismissal laws for small business. So this government has looked at the mire and the mess that we inherited and done something about it. Consequently the workplace relations bill was introduced to the parliament. It was a very strong piece of legislation, clearly recognising the realities of this place. It was necessary to talk to the Democrats because we took the view that it was best to get most of what we wanted into the law of Australia rather than none at all. Had we taken the advice proffered to the minister by the honourable member for Curtin, we would have been stuck with the industrial relations regime of the former government, we would not have had any legislation through the parliament, and we would therefore have had business languishing under the industrial relations system given to us by the Labor Party. It is eminently reasonable that the minister was prepared to be flexible, that he was prepared to sit down and talk to Senator Kernot and to anyone else who would talk in the Senate with a view to making sure that we got through most of what we wanted. The Workplace Relations Act has been a particularly successful piece of legislation. Every day this legislation is considered to be a success. A number of newspaper reports and editorials have pointed out very clearly that this legislation is necessary and will benefit the Australian community. When the government reviews legislationpart of the law of this land-it must from time to time make changes. We always said that we would review the legislation after it became law, and that is why we considered a number of the amendments which are currently part of the legislation before the House. We are pointing out that these are technical amendments. They do not include matters of great moment or substance. I am very sorry that once again we find that the opposition is seeking to frustrate the government as it endeavours to sweep up the mess left behind by the opposition when it left the treasury bench in March 1996. I referred a moment ago to the meeting which took place between the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reg Hamilton, Mr Tim Pallas and other members of the Committee on Industrial Legislation-the legislative subcommittee of the National Labor Consultative Council. Mr Pallas pointed out that the ACTU remained opposed to the policy of the Workplace Relations Act But, as I said, he recommended that a number of matters listed in the first group of items were technical and ought not to be opposed. Those matters include: clarifying the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's power to arbitrate in relation to safety net wage adjustments during a bargaining period; clarifying the status of awards made under section 170MX; updating the reference to 'awards' in legislation other than the Workplace Relations Act; ensuring that designated awards can be determined for the purposes of the no disadvantage test for certified agreements; clarifying the successor provisions for certified agreements and AW As binding on Victorian employees; clarifying the time limit allowed for applications to certify an agreement; removing section 170VT(2), which is obsolete; correcting paragraph 170XA(2)(b) by omitting the word 'other'; extending the prohibition on hindering the AWA negotiations and providing false statements to ensure that it applies in relation to variation, sion and termination of AWAs; clarifying the provision dealing with access to AWAs for Victorian employees; setting time limits on the making of certain termination of employment applications and for discontinuance of such applications; correcting an unintended limitation on access to disamalgamation by registered organisations; clarifying who may make an application for a disamalgamation ballot to ensure that a committee of management can make such application, whether it was elected by a direct or collegiate voting system; clarifying what documents may be inspected under a right of entry permit by defining the term 'ancillary document', which relates to AWAs; removing from section 178 obsolete references to section 182 and bans clauses; removing a number of obsolete references and updating references to state legislation; and clarifying the status of 'inciinclude dental and necessary' provisions in awards simplified by the AIRC during the award simplification process. The items in group 1 also permit the Employment Advocate or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as appropriate, to designate a state award for the purpose of the no disadvantage test where there is no federal award regulating the terms and conditions of employees engaged in the same kind of work as the employees whose employment is to be covered by an agreement. Lastly, they provide for compensation which may be awarded in respect of an unfair dismissal to be calculated by reference to the amount o{remuneration to which the applicant was entitled rather than the amount the applicant actually received. That is the range of technical matters in  present at the meeting signed off on. One would hope that the opposition would have been prepared not to oppose those matters at  able, in all cases, to persuade his colleagues in the Labor opposition to support the position that he took at that particular meeting. That is unfortunate. Maybe my good friend opposite, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), might be prepared to tell us later if he makes a. contribution why the exten- ACTU and the Labor Party have reneged on this situation. There is a group of amendments which Mr Pallas also conceded were technical amendments, but he indicated that he would recommend to the ACTU that these items should be opposed even though they are technical. So we find the ACTU, no doubt supported by the political wing of the ACTU, the Labor Party, clearly opposing the technical amendments in group 2. I think I should outline to the House what those particular amendments in group 2 are. They seek to: make clear the 14-day period to be provided to employees to consider .a certified agreement is not affected by new staff commencing work within the period; expand the definition of 'AWA official' to all staff of the Office of the Employment Advocate; clarify the provision relating to the publication of AW A determinations; clarify the rights of entry and powers of authorised officers of the Employment Advocate; and clarify reference to 'relevant award' in section 152 to make clear that relevant awards are relevant state awards. As one can see, there is nothing major, nothing complex, nothing complicated and nothing difficult in the changes proposed to be included as a result of those items set out in group 2. Yet, despite that, the ACTU has recommended that they be opposed. This government has gone out to consult, has talked and been reasonable. The minister has been prepared to talk through and discuss all of these matters with all parties in the community. Yet at the end of the day we find that, despite the fact that the law is not substantially changed as a result of the techniMinister cal amendments in group 2, the Labor Party is clearly not prepared to come on board and be reasonable. There are a number of items set out in group 3. I suppose these are items which would positively cause the ACTU to frothnot for any particular reason, because they also are technical amendments. Clearly, those amendments are amendments which the Labor Party and the ACTU are not prepared to stomach. That is an absolutely ridiculous attitude from both of them, because these amendments merely seek to extend the time limit allowed for filing AWAs from 14 days to 21 days. They permit persons authorised by AWA parties to provide information to the Employment Advocate if the Employment Advocate considers it appropriate. They allow the Employment Advocate to waive technical filing requirements in relation to AWAs where waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AW A. They clarify the application of state lawsÂ· on termination to employers covered by federal awards. They ensure that an agreement may not be approved where it includes a preference provision inconsistent with the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, and they provide for the removal of void preference clauses in awards and agreements. Again I stress that the amendments currently before the chamber are not major amendments. We are not rewriting the industrial relations legislation of Australia. We are not seeking to gut the Workplace Relations Act. What we aim to do through this legislation is to bring into legal force and effect and practiattempt cal application the intention of the Workplace Relations Act as carried by this parliament. We have brought in a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act and a number of other pieces of legislation. This is the kind of bill that should have been sent off to the Main Committee as non-contentious legislation. Unfortunately, the people opposite tend to be argumentative, they tend to play politics and they tend not to want to join with the government to improve this excellent piece of legislation brought onto being the statute books of this country by the for Workplace Relations and Small Business I am very proud and pleased to support this legislation, which is reasonable, fair, moderate and simply seeks to improve the legislation which we have already collectively endorsed as a parliament. The coalition government has brought about new flexibility. We have changed the industrial relations culture to enable employers and employees to talk. We have got away from the industrial warfare tactics of those opposite. I must say that, from talking to both employers and employees in my own electorate of Fisher, overwhelmingly, most people are very happy with the Workplace Relations Act 1996. They believe, as I do, that the act is working well. But obviously we will continue to monitor the act on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the Australian community. The amendment bill before the chamber now makes a number of technical amendments. I urge those opposite to support the government in its endeavours to bring into practical application the intentions of the Workplace Relations Act as carried by the parliament. (Time expired)",46
151,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), opposition spokesman on industrial relations, moved on our behalf an amendment to the second reading of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. That amendment was in these words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's to give the Employment Advocate more powers and to undermine the rights of employees under the existing Act, under the guise of so-called 'technical amendments'."" The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who preceded me, sought to reaffirm those comments that had initially been made by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in his second reading speech. The minister said: This bill makes a number of technical amendments Yes, a number of technical amendments are provided for in this legislation. He said: The minor changes will give appropriate effect to the major reforms which have been achieved through ... the Workplace Relations Act. I want to emphasise that those statements by the minister mean that he has established pretty broad parameters for what can be considered by the parliament in this amendment bill. He went on to say: The act is delivering genuine flexibility at the workplace level. Those comments were repeated by the member for Fisher in his contribution. The member for Fisher is one of the great apologists for the government. He is one of those people who has the capacity to call black white and to call white black and to do it without even smiling. I am not going into the myriad of issues that were pursued by him, but there are a couple of them. I would like to mention to confirm the point I have just made. He said in relation to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill that these technical amendments seek to even up the situation. I presume that what he means by that is that the amendments are designed to ensure an even balance between the employers on one side and the employees on the other side. The claim that is made by the member for Fisher and by those people who sit alongside him and on the front bench is that, in some way, this legislation will ensure that negotiations, particularly at the Australian workplace agreement level, will be undertaken by equals. Nothing is further from the truth. The point that we have emphasised-and let me emphasise it again-concerns a situation where you have an employer, with the power of his corporation behind him, sitting across the table from some young kid that he is just about ready to employ. If the kid signs the contract, we do not believe for one moment that they are negotiations between equals. In his more objective, dispassionate moments, the member for Fisher will endorse that. Let me say another thing. He said that the purpose of this legislation is to create jobs. In fact, government members use the adjective 'real' in that connection. They generally say that the purpose of this government and the purpose of the government's policies are to create real jobs. I said that he says it without even a smile-to create real jobs.",50
152,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Real long-term jobs.,51
153,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Do you know what you have done to jobs since your last budget? Through you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",51
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Order! I was about to draw the honourable member's attention to that fact: he should direct his comments through the chair.,51
155,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Absolutely. I appreciate your guidance and advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, could I ask the member for Fisher: does he realise what has happened to employment under this government since its budget in August last year? He obviously does not because he did not even smile when he was talking about creating jobs. I will tell him what has happened. This government has been responsible for the loss of 60,000 full-time jobs since August last year-60,000 full-time jobs have disappeared under this government since August last year, since that budget. It was a budget introduced to provide for growth, to encourage employment. As we know, when the minister introduced this legislation, he said that this legislation was also designed to increase flexibility and choice. For whom?",51
156,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,For everyone.,51
157,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I will tell you who it is designed to increase the flexibility and choice for: employers.,51
158,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Nonsense. Absolute nonsense.,51
159,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will give you an example. Under this legislation the first case was brought before the courts in Perth by a 21-year-old kid. His dad, fortunately, had been a union official. He said to his son, 'Look, son, you're going into see your employer, the manager, this afternoon and he is going to negotiate an individual contract with you. Put a tape recorder in your pocket.' This was the first occasion on which a court had accepted evidence of a tape recording that had been recorded without the knowledge of the people involved. The court took that as evidence and accepted that intimidation and threats had been used against that kid. Do not tell me you people did not design it that way.",51
160,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,We did not.,52
161,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Of course you did. Of course you designed it that way. That was your purpose-to get kids into the offices of managers one on one, evenly balanced. Like hell it is evenly balanced, as you called it.",52
162,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,It is evenly balanced.,52
163,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Like hell it is evenly balanced.,52
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member shall direct his remarks through the chair.,52
165,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am. I did not address them to him. I am addressing them through you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The other thing that was saidMr Reith-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. My point of order is on relevance. It seems that the honourable member has a case study about a state law. What we have before the federal parliament are federal laws, and he should only refer to state laws-not otherwise.",52
166,Mr ROBERT,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"ROWN-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I am going to quote what the minister said. He suggests that I am becoming irrelevant, but in his second reading speech the minister said, 'These minor changes will give appropriate effect to the major reforms of that act.' When I started to speak, I established the point that, as a result of that, the minister established pretty wide parameters for this debate, and I am speaking within them.",52
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"There is no point of order, but it would help the House if the member for Charlton would direct his remarks strictly through the chair and . not engage in a debate across the chamber with the member for Fisher. And I ask the member for Fisher also to restrict his interjections in this debate.",52
168,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"They were the points that I wanted to mention. I am not going to go through all of them. One other thing that the member for Fisher said was, 'This legislation has been a success.' Has it? Let me quote what the P&O boss, Richard Hein, said. It was not Jennie George, Kim Beazley, Bob MCMullan or Bob Brown saying this; it was Richard Hein, the boss of P&O. He criticised the government's strong reform rhetoric, saying it was 'getting everybody into a frenzy but not achieving anything' .",52
169,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The legislation is there, but he won't use it.",52
170,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Listen to what I have said! Richard Hein said that this government is getting everyone into a frenzy but not achieving anything. The member for Fisher said that this legislation was a success. He should ask Richard Hein whether this legislation is a success or not. The particular issue we have taken exception to-quite apart from some of the others I have personal reservations about-was the question of the Employment Advocate and the Australian workplace agreements. In our second reading amendment we have indicated that, while not declining to give the bill a second reading, we deplore the government's attempt to use this legislation in order to achieve objectives by the backdoor. I have here a poster which was produced by the CFMEU about Australian workplace agreements. The poster shows old-time miners with their horses and wagons. For all I know some of my antecedents may be among them, because they were all miners. This poster says, referring to these old-time miners, 'They too fought for what we have today. Don't give it away with an AWA.' That is the sort of sentiment which is influencing coalminers, people on the wharves and people whom this government has set in its sights. That is the sentiment, the philosophy, the tradition and the history of people in these industries. It says at the bottom, 'Stick with the union.' I endorse that. Here is another CFMEU poster. This is a pretty compelling comment too. It says, 'Wanted: information on any award rights and benefits that employers have offered Australian workers without the union first campaigning for them. Reward: $500.' If there is any evidence of it, you can apply to the CFMEU for a reward of $500. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the minister if he has any information on any award rights and benefits that employers have offered Australian workers without the union first campaigning for them? Let the CFMEU know if you have. They will write out a cheque for $500 and send it through to you. The provisions of the Workplace Relations Act express more clearly than most other things the philosophy of this government towards the whole area of industrial relations. The act reflects the determination of the government to exclude vast sections of the Australian people from any meaningful participation-to prevent them having any significant say-in matters which concern them, especially the terms of their employment and the conditions under which they work. This government, as a result of this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and the parent legislation to which it relates, divides participants in the Australian community into those it considers have a right to make decisions and then, apart from them, that vast majority of people whose obligation, according to this government, is to do what they are told-under threats and intimidation, like that kid over in Western Australia. This government divides the community into the managers and the managed, the rulers and the subjects, the masters and the servants. I remind you that this was confirmed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself, when he said business people have a right to manage their own business. The point I made after that comment was this: that could have been said 50 years ago, but the world is a more enlightened place now . We understand that there are many different types of participants in the production process, and we should all see the production process as a social process undertaken by equals. There are some people who provide capital and management; there are other people who provide labour. Let me make it perfectly clear that, as far as I am concerned-and I believe the majority of my colleagues would agree-the people who provide labour are equally important in that process. They are equally significant in the process of making decisions about the conditions under which they make their labour available and under which they work. Anyone who says businessmen have a right to manage their own business and make their own decisions simply does not understand, or simply does not accept, the proposition that I put forward. It is not just masters and servants; it is also the proprietors and the factory fodder; and it is also the decision makers and the decision takers. That attitude might have been relevant in the past. It has ceased to be relevant. It has ceased to be correct. There are fundamental differences between our position and the position of the government. First of all, we believe that negotiated reforms of the industrial relations system are the appropriate way to go. As far as the coalition is concerned, it has used draconian measures to remove safeguards and to discourage the development of strategies that might facilitate civilised, sane, constructive, fruitful negotiations between employers and employees. We believe in enterprise agreements. We have no objection to enterprise agreements being entered into, but we also accept the right of employees to be represented by their unions and not to sit across the table with the boss in the boss's office. My concern includes, of course, the Employment Advocate, who refuses to disclose many of those contract terms. It was suggested that, if he were concerned about the confidentiality of the agreements-the question of privacy-all he had to do was blot out the names and then he could let us know some of the terms that were being negotiated between these so-called 'equals' across the table in the boss's office. Let us see some of the terms. I would have liked to have seen the terms that would have finished up in the individual contract of that kid over in Perth if he did not have his tape recorder. Let me forewarn all kids and all employees invited into the boss's office to work out the terms of the individual contract: take the tape recorder. The coalition, by its whole approach, believes that individual contracts are more appropriate. In our approach to enterprise agreements, we accept the rights of workers to negotiate collectively in open consultation and to be represented by their union. The coalition believes in the secrecy of the executive office. Labor believes in a comprehensive award safety net. The government believes in 20 basic core elements. But let me say, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know and the minister knows, many of the agreements that have been entered into have in fact been negotiated. That is why they are there and why they have been written into the award. They then have the force of the award, but they were negotiated. Those opposite talk about negotiations, but not genuine negotiations. They like the boss's office formula. They do not like the idea of the union in a civilised, mature, balanced, constructive way sitting down with the employers and with the managers. Mr Reith-Oh yeah, like the MUA.",52
171,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The minister's interjection encourages me to say that he has attempted to bring into serious discredit all of the employees in Australia who are in those unions that he has in his sights. So when he is talking, for example, about efficiency on the wharf up in Cairns, he does not talk in terms of management competence, he does not talk in terms of capital investment, and he does not talk in terms of the loading and unloading facilities. He does not talk in terms of any of those things, but he attempts to discredit the employees-the seven full-time union members on the Cairns wharf, the seven full-time union stevedores up there-by drawing attention to the fact that they might have a laundry allowance. Mr Reith-And the rest.",54
172,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I hope the minister is not suggesting that they are important elements relevant to the efficiency with which the wharf is operating. He uses those examples, as he well knows, for one reason only-that is, to discredit those people, to discredit their aspirations and to attempt to get the community against them and onside with the one-sided approach he has taken. Labor has respect for the existence and the rights of trade unions, and the coalition has this manic determination to exclude trade unions from the agreement making process. Labor seeks to build on the industrial relations structure, the origins of which can be traced to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904. The coalition seeks to remake the entire industrial relations structure by reasserting the rights of management to manage and the obligation of employees to obey. (Time expired)",54
173,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"In summing up, I thank all the members who have made a contribution to this debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, including the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who has put on his usual windbag performance. But it was entertaining for all of that. I thank the members who have put the time into debate the actual provisions in the bill before the House. Whilst there has been a lot of rhetoric on this particular piece of legislation, the fact of the matter is that this bill is proposing various technical amendments to the operation of the Workplace Relations Act, which, by and large, came into effect on 1 January this year. In preparing the amendments, the government sat down with the ACTU and the employers organisation, the ACCI, and we comprehensively went through each and every one of the propositions that the government was proposing. Most of the amendments were put by the government as we have monitored the operation of our new workplace relations laws, but we did accept one amendment- from the employers and we accepted one amendment from the ACTU. In one of the final meetings that we held in Melbourne on a Saturday with this committee-it is known as the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is a subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Committee-we ended up agreeing that one lot of amendments being proposed were entirely technical, which the ACTU would not oppose; one lot they agreed were technical but they would oppose them; and there were some that they would not agree were technical and were opposed. I think it would be fair to say that, on the ones where they disagree, they disagree because they disagree with the original proposition rather than fighting over the technical amendment. We have deliberately kept this at a technical level. Whilst there are many fights and arguments we have with the Labor Party and the ACTU, we do prefer to argue on the substantive issues rather than the technical ones. For that reason, obviously we would encourage our colleagues in the Senate to give due and appropriate passage to the legislation. It is appropriate, however, that I say thing about Australian workplace agreements, which have created so much excitement in the L-bor Party in recent times. These are individual, or maybe collective, agreements available under the Workplace Relations Act. I should say that, if you are going to have one of those agreements, they still have to pass the no disadvantage test; in other words, in total you cannot be worse off than the total benefit provided by the award. That is established by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and is a fair protection for people in entering into agreements. I think the little case study that the for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) hadMr Robert Brown-A good one.",54
174,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I do not think it was a good one. You would have to give me the details, but that one, as it was reported to me, was about a circumstance in Western Australia with regard to an agreement proposed to be under Western Australian law. The federal law is different from the Western Australian law. For example, in the federal law, if you wish to go into an Australian workplace agreement, we have specifically provided that the union may be your agent. I think that is fair enough. If people want to be in a union, I agree that they should be able to be in the union. If they want the union to negotiate on their behalf, to be their bargaining agent, they should be able to do that. We passed that as part of the federal law, to give people basic protections. We also have made it very clear in the law to the Employment Advocate that these agreements must be genuine. If there were any suggestions of duress, obviously it is important that there be a person to whom people can go to raise their concerns. We do have duress in the system. Sometimes we have duress by union bullies who get stuck into employees and make them toe the line. If the member for Charlton is genuinely concerned about duress, he would acknowledge that. I had a woman ring up the other day: apparently her son was frogmarched by the local CFMEU bloke down to the ATM. He told him to take some money out so that the kid could make a donation to the some- CFMEU. You hold up the posters from the CFMEU. We remember the CFMEU. Some of them were outside the front door of this place in the infamous riot of last year. The opposition claims that some of the proposed amendments increase the powers of the Employment Advocate. This claim does misrepresent the nature and intention of these technical amendments. As I have said before, they are simply technical. They are designed to correct drafting oversights which have led to minor errors and anomalies, to clarify existing provisions and to make some other minor changes to make sure the legislation member operates as intended. Even the ACTU does agree that most of them are technical. As to the few that they say are not technical, we obviously disagree with that opinion. One of the amendments would give the Employment Advocate the discretion to waive strict compliance with elements of the filing procedures in circumstances where the Employment Advocate considers that waiver would not disadvantage a party to the Australian workplace agreement. In the absence of such a waiver, the Employment Advocate has had to return a number of AW As lodged because the applications failed in some minor way to meet the filing requirements, such as omitting the employer's Australian company number. The capacity to waive minor defects is a sensible technical amendment aimed at smoothing the operation of the AW A provisions and eliminating unnecessary delays and procedural burdens. It is in keeping with the intention of the AW A scheme that it is to provide a simple and speedy means of formaIi sing agreements entered into by employers and employees. To suggest that the amendment amounts to an increase in the powers of the Employment Advocate is obviously a nonsense. The amendment makes clear that the advocate will have to be satisfied the waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AW A. The amendment will not affect the substantive requirements to be met by an AW A. There will still be a need for strict compliance with the substantive requirements, such as the provisions relating to the no disadvantage test and, of course, genuine consent. The amendment provides only for defects of a technical nature to be waived. This will avoid a waste of time and resources involved in correcting minor defects whilst ensuring that the interests of AW A parties are protected. There are other circumstances in administrative law where the appropriate authority is entitled by the parliament to waive technical defects. It is in everybody's interest. I would hope that there would not be any more serious opposition to that proposal. Another proposed amendment extends the time limit for filing an AWA from 14 to 21 days after it is signed. This is a simple, practical change designed to assist the parties, especially those in rural centres. It could hardly be described as an increase in the powers of the advocate. The bill provides for AW A parties to choose to obtain assistance in explaining the operation of their AW A to the Employment Advocate. The amendment will help AW A parties who have not appointed a bargaining agent or do not wish to utilise the services of a bargaining agent for the purpose of explaining the operation of their AW A to the Employment Advocate. Again, this amendment could hardly be characterised as increasing the powers of the Employment Advocate. On accountability, the opposition claims there is a lack of accountability in the AW A process. It has previously suggested that the advocate should provide written decisions. Provided an agreement meets all relevant statutory requirements, including the no disadvantage test, there is no point in the advocate wasting time and resources preparing written reasons for decisions. A requirement to publish decisions would do nothing to improve the operation of AWAs; it would simply delay it. Contrary to the claims made by the opposition, AW As are not secret documents. Parties to AW As, both employers and employees, are free to disclose the content of their AW As to anyone, and the act specifically provides that an agreement must not include any provision that prohibits or restricts disclosure of details of the AW A by either party. The fact that approval arrangements are streamlined does not mean that employee protections are compromised. The act provides extensive protection for employees and these protections are explained in the information statement which employers wishing to enter into AWAs must provide to their employees. The information statement is a detailed booklet prepared by the advocate. It makes clear that to be approved an employee must genuinely consent to the agreement and the agreement must meet the no disadvantage test. The information statement explains how the test operates and provides advice about the appointment and role of bargaining agents. It makes very clear that an employee cannot be dismissed for refusing to sign an AW A. It also sets out how to obtain further information from the Office of the Employment Advocate. The Employment Advocate can only approve an AWAif it clearly meets the no disadvantage test. If the Employment Advocate has any unresolved concerns about whether the test is met, the advocate is obliged to refer the agreement to the AIRC. The commission may decide to reduce particular AW A determinations to writing if it chooses to do so. This is a matter for the discretion of the commission, but any determination which is to be published must be edited to ensure it does not disclose the identity of the AW A parties. Where any concerns about compliance with the no disadvantage test are resolved by written undertakings given by the employer, those undertakings are deemed to be part of the agreement to which they relate and are therefore enforceable as part of the agreement. Stripped of their rhetoric, the opposition's objections to the proposed amendments amount to no more than the fact that they object to employers and employees taking responsibility for their own workplace relationships without the intervention of uninvited third parties. The amendments, as I say, are merely technical. They should not give rise to too much excitement in the caucuses of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. I again thank all members for their contributions. In particular, I thank those in my department for the work they have done on this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Schedule I-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Schedule 2.",55
175,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (5.34 p.m.)by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 1 to 3: (1) Schedule 2, item 1, page 4 (lines 10-12), omit paragraph (aa), substitute: (aa) any person first employed less than 14 days before approval is given either has, or has ready access to, the agreement, in writing, at least 7 days before the approval is unless the Commission determines a lesser period. (2) Schedule 2, item 2, page 4, (lines 21-23), omit paragraph (b), substitute: (b) 7 days' notice, in writing, of intention to make the agreement is given to every person first employed after the first notice is given .under paragraph (a), unless the Commission determines a lesser period. (3) Schedule 2, item 3, page 4, (lines 31-33), omit paragraph (aa), substitute: (aa) any person first employed less than 14 days before approval is given either has, or has ready access to, the agreement, in writing, at least 7 days before the approval is given, unless the Commission determines a lesser period. The opposition understands the mischief to which the government is trying to respond in this particular set of amendments. We have a situation of continuous employment: some new person is employed every day. So the provision of the act that says you have to give 14 days' notice to everybody is impossible to comply with. You never get to a point where everybody has had 14 days' notice. We understand that. Our concern-and we want to facilitate dealing fairly with that concernis that the rather stark way it has been dealt with in the bill has the potential of creating a situation where the time period for the lastemployed employee could get down to five minutes. We are trying to accommodate that by way of a two-stage process. I will speak t6 all the amendments together; they essentially go to the same point. We are trying to say, first, that a lesser period should occur as of right. It is not an extreme or unusual position for someone to be employed every day. Where a person has been employed within the last 14 days and, but for that fact, every other aspect of the approval arrangements has been complied with, the fact that the notice was between seven and 14 days as a result of late employment should not stand in the way. In all the circumstances up to and including that, the outcome of our proposal would be the same as that for the government. We are looking to have in place some mechanism for people employed less than given, seven days that says it ought to be a reasonable period. But in an extreme case-for example, the case that I gave in my opening-where it is a very big project and a new person is being employed every day, you will never meet the test. Even if the test is any specified number of days, you will never meet it because there is always a new person coming on. There ought to be the capacity for an independent body-the commission-to say, 'You are dealing with this fairly. You have put a fair set of arrangements in place. You cannot meet even the seven-day test but it is as fair as it can possibly be; therefore, that lesser period is approved.' That is the structure. It is reflected differently in each of the three amendments because they are dealing with slightly different circumstances, but they come together to try to meet the legitimate concern of the government that there are circumstances in which these sorts of agreements will not otherwise be able to receive approval in meeting the technical requirements which most will, and should, meet. We want to put a proposal in place that strikes a balance and I think it is the same balance the government is trying to strike. I do not think in this instance we have different objectives. Our concern is that the way it is constructed creates the potential for an individual, through no fault of anybody, to fail to receive reasonable notice of an agreement about which they are required to give their consent and that they will not have had adequate notice to give them the opportunity to consider the pros and cons and maybe take a bit of advice. That is the framework, that is the objective and that is the structure. It is not designed to interfere with the government's attempt to achieve the flexibility that its amendments are designed to achieve in schedule 2. As I said, we understand that objective. Without any action being taken you would get into the situation where some agreements could never properly be approved and that is obviously not a reasonable situation. Whatever we think about the broad structure of the agreement stream, you cannot render it inoperable by administrative technicality. We do not seek to do that so we therefore propose this alternative framework.",57
176,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We did have quite a discussion in the coil about this, looking to meet the various concerns. When you go through it from each and every angle I think our proposition is a reasonable one. The employees still get the agreement and they have it explained to them; that is important. If you had a lot of employees in a business and you had someone who was employed five minutes prior to the approval, quite frankly if it was another 10 minutes would it make any difference? They slightly would then be employed under terms and conditions of which they were aware. Would one person make the difference if a majority had approved it? Obviously not. I do not think there is much that can be said about this. Your proposal gives us a more complicated way of dealing with the issue. Under Labor people did not get a say anyway. If an agreement is in place and you enter into employment on the basis of the terms and conditions being offered by the employer, that is the choice you make. That happens every day. Every day people are taking jobs on terms and conditions being offered by employers. As I said, we certainly had a lot of discussions in coil about how we might handle this in the best way for employees. I put it to the House that what we have proposed is reasonable and we therefore reject this amendment. I have had a look at the opposition's amendments and you are proposing more amendments and opposing more of these propositions than even the ACTU did. Mr MCMullan interjecting",58
177,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is a change, you operating independently of the ACTU. You can see it from my point of view. If the ACTU is supporting something that the government is doing, what makes you think I would go along with any amendments that you have? Amendments negatived. Schedule 2-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Schedule 3-by leave-taken as a whole.",58
178,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (5.41 p.m.)by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 4 to 8: (4) Schedule 3, items 1-5, page 6 (lines 6-29), omit the items. (5) Schedule 3, item 7, page 7 (lines 6-12), omit the item. (6) Schedule 3, item 8, page 7 (lines 13-23), omit the item (7) Schedule 3, item 14, page 8 (lines 4-12), omit the item. (8) Schedule 3, item 15, page 8 (lines 15-22), omit proposed section 170WHC, substitute: 170WHA Industrial Registrar to publish AWA determinations The Industrial Registrar is obliged under section 143 to publish any determination of Commission that approves or refuses to approve an AWA or a variation agreement, or that terminates an AWA. When the Industrial Registrar publishes such a determination under section 143, he or she must ensure that the publication does not disclose the identity of either party to the AW A. Although to facilitate things I am seeking to do amendments 4 to 8 together, there are actually two batches of amendments here. I will try to deal with all of them in five minutes. Most of them are quite minor and go only to the general question that we all dealt with in the second reading speech. We do not wish to reiterate and rehearse unnecessarily the general tenor of AWAs and the Employment Advocate and our overall concerns. The position of the Employment Advocate should never have been created. The way it is operating is reinforcing our worse fears. I did not pretend during the second reading, and do not now, that any of these is a major important new change. Our opposition is to each increment in opportunity for the employment advocate to act in the way that he has done in that remarkable lack of accountability to the parliament and the failure to in any way meet what we would regard as reasonable standards for protection of employees subjected to these AWAs which the employment advocate or his office has to apply. We will oppose and resist that until we get the opportunity to abolish the position altogether. That is our position. It is not going to be productive spending hours reiterating it; I simply state it. It is a position shared and expressed by many of my colleagues in their second reading contributions. I regard amendment 8 as different and more important-not that I expect this minister in the House of Representatives to be swayed by the rhetoric about this matter. I hope for greater success when my more persuasive colleagues in the Senate advocate the case. I am particularly concerned that the lack of public access to the nature of decisions being made, which are affecting the lives of Australians and have ramifications for those beyond the immediate agreement, should not extend to the Industrial Relations Commission. Our concern is that item 15 on page 8 the of the bill does, in its present form, start to extend to the Industrial Registrar and the Industrial Relations Commission those sorts of provisions where decisions are made but they are not public, they are not open to scrutiny, they are not open for other people to assess their implications. in connection with potential future matters on which they might impact-not just if they are not parties to this, but if they work in a similar industry or are confronting a similar problem. Up until now, if a decision having been made by a public authority has the capacity to affect your rights or set a precedent that might affect your rights, you can consult on it; you can see whether or not you agree with it; you even have some capacity to respond to it. We do not want to see that important function undermined. We would like to see it taken away from the Employment Advocate, but we cannot do that in this particular set of amendments to the legislation. So that is a question for another day. However, what we would like to do is make sure that the poor standard that is set with regard to the Employment Advocate is not extended to the Industrial Relations Commission. So we are seeking to substitute item 15 on page 8 with the amendment contained in amendment 8. It is, I think, an important question of principle. We do not want to drag the Industrial Relations Commission standard of accountability down to the level of the Employment Advocate. Therefore, I recommend the amendment to the House.",58
179,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I will respond just briefly on a couple of these matters. With regard to the power of authorised officers to retain documents produced to them, being the matters I think in items 3 and 4, these amendments simply correct some anomalies in the right of entry powers that are available to authorised offic- market. ers appointed by the Employment Advocate. The amendments will assist in protecting employees. They would, for example, ensure that authorised officers are able to properly investigate suspected coercion of employees in relation to AW As, which I would have thought the Labor opposition surely would support. As is the case with the existing rights of entry, the new provision does not allow access to premises used for residential purposes, and the right to interview does not empower an authorised officer to compel a person to answer questions. Authorised officers must still announce their presence produce their identity cards for inspection before entering premises. In respect of the opposition's proposed amendment No.8, the government obviously will oppose that particular measure, a proposed section 170WHA. The commission already has the powers, should it so wish, to publish its determinations provided that, in doing so, it does not disclose the identity of the relevant parties. In terms of people having access to information as to the operation of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, in respect of the application of the no disadvantage test and, generally, the functions of the Office of the Employment Advocate in approving AW As, I would say that the Australian Democrats were similarly very concerned to ensure that the parliament was appropriately informed about what was happening. We did not disagree with what they had to say. So provision has been made for there to be an appropriately comprehensive review of processes within the AWA by the bringing in of outside academics, independent persons, by the OEA so as to prepare a report which will be made available on the operations of AWAs. That can then look at the impact of this new system on persons from non-English speaking background, on women, on those who are disadvantaged and otherwise, so as to be able to give the parliament some real information about how AWAs are working and the impact they are having on the labour We originally proposed that ourselves and, if you like, we toughened up those provisions in the act in the negotiations with the Democrats. Mr Rowe, the Employment Advocate, in his recent appearance before the Senate estimates committee, gave further detailsÂ· of how that program of research would be undertaken. So we hear what the opposition says about these issues; they are not new. More than adequate provision has been made for them. I do welcome one thing that the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) has said: he is opposed to AWAs and, basically, he will and oppose anything that has anything to do with AW As, regardless of how technical the amendment might be. I do not think that is a reasonable way to proceed. I think you should just let them go through to the keeper, and you can have your policy day when we have an election. Amendments negatived. Schedule agreed to. Schedule 4-by leave-taken as a whole.",59
180,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (5.51 p.m.)by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 9 to 11: (9) Schedule 4, item 1, page 9 (lines 5-6), omit the item. (10) Schedule 4, item 2, page 9 (lines 7-22), omit the item. (11) Schedule 4, item 4, page 9 (line 25) to page 10 (line 10), omit the item. These amendments are some of those that we consider significantly more than technical. These are changes which lead to a potentially lower standard of test for the no disadvantage test in the scrutiny of AWAs. There are some similar concerns we have about scrutiny of other agreements which will comeÂ· up in consideration of a different schedule. It gets very technical, and I do not want to start pursuing it in an inordinate amount of detail, but if I can put it in layman's language in the broad we have here the possibility that the no disadvantage test can be met by a standard set by a state award rather than a federal award. That is a cause of concern to the opposition, particularly in those states where the standards are deplorably low. Given that I grew up in Western Australia, I suppose the prejudices that I have in this matter might be obvious, but it is not exclusively a Western Australian problem and will not necessarily in the future be exclusively a Western Australian problem. If, by some mischance, the current Queensland government were to be re-elected at the next state election, there is no doubt they would wish to move in that direction, and I have some apprehensions about the seco-d-term agenda of a re-elected Liberal government in South Australia should that be the result of the forthcoming election. So, while it is Western Australia about whom everybody has the priority concern at the moment, it is not exclusively a problem that could be resolved by dealing with Western Australia alone. There is no automaticity that state standards are necessarily lower than those of federal. Of course, if the state standard is higher, the problem does not arise. In meeting the federal standard for no disadvantage test, a standard is not going to be lowered by meeting it in that circumstance. We would have no objection. The circumstance in which that might arise is highly speCUlative but not impossible. We are seriously concerned that this is not a technical amendment. It is not technical from our point of view, and it is not technical in its potential to affect the industrial rights Australian men and women. So we will be opposing the amendments in schedule 4. We made it quite clear in the principal debate about the Workplace Relations Act that the nature of the no disadvantage test, as originally proposed by the government, was entirely unacceptable to us. We had a debate about that in the House, and it was changed in the Senate. We might not think that what emerged from the Senate compromise is ideal. It is certainly better than that which the government proposed and which passed this House. It might not be what we would wish to see, but certainly we do not wish to see it watered down. That is the concern which strikes us with regard to schedule 4. There are slightly different aspects with regard to each subsection in the schedule, but I will not take the time of the House by going through them bit by bit. The point of principle is the same in each one. It is something which we think probably does not even meet the standard the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) set of being technical amendments. I understand why even the other ones I disagree with are in here. They are to make sections for which the minister set down original intention operate in accordance with their original intention. That is why we are letting a lot of them go through without criticism-because that was clearly the intention of the parliament, and let us not debate every dam thing twice. I do not think it meets that, and we are opposed to it for that reason, but more particularly for its potential to have an effect of lowering the standard of no disadvantage test applying in the scrutiny of AWAs.",60
181,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Schedule 4, item 1, of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill amends paragraph 170XA(2)(b) to correct the misleading reference to 'any other law'. In its ordinary sense, law of the Commonwealth means a legislative instrument and does not include an award as an award itself is not a law. The law referred to in paragraph 170XA(2)(b) should not be referred to as 'any of other law'. You could not get a more technical amendment than that one. On the other matter, I do not think you are right. I do not think you have caught the problem. I would invite you to talk with the ACTU about this. They have a reasonable technical understanding of the operation of these matters. Mr Bevis-You're urging us to support the ACTU on this, are you?",61
182,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Tim Pallas and John Cairns do at least have a working knowledge of these things. They supported this because this was in the interests of the employees. I know you think I am a cousin of Genghis Khan and all I want to do is dud employees, but when the ACTU say, 'This is a good idea,' and they publicly support it, surely even the ALP might get the message that maybe there is a point here that they are missing somehow. Mr MCMullan and Mr Bevis interjecting",61
183,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am glad you have spoken to them. Perhaps now you will go along with it, or they will now oppose what they said wasMr MCMullan-I haven't spoken to them in the last minute.",62
184,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Well, you usually do speak to them minute by minute, so I am surprised you have not. The act presently provides that, where there is no award covering the work of employees who are to be covered by certified agreement or AWA, the commission or the advocate, as the case requires, is to designate an appropriate federal award for the purposes of applying the no disadvantage test to the agreement. I think we all agree on that. There may be some circumstances in which it is not possible to identify a suitable federal award. The proposed amendment will therefore allow the commission or the advocate to designate a state award as the benchmark for the no disadvantage test where there is no federal award covering work of the same kind as that performed by employees whose work is to be subject to an agreement. This will ensure that the absence of a suitable federal award will not prevent the effective operation of the no disadvantage test. That seems quite a good idea to me. If you do not have an underlying award, what have you got? It is not much of a no disadvantage test if it does not have something to which it can be compared. That is all this says. You could have some alternative inappropriate federal award, but that might be dudding your employees even more so, which I think is why the ACTU went along with it. I think this is nothing other than a technical amendment. I encourage you, in your next conversation with the ACTU, to reconsider. Amendment negatived. Schedule agreed to. Schedule 5-by leave-taken as a whole.",62
185,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (6.00 p.m.)by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 12 to 16: (12) Schedule 5, item 1, page 11 (lines 5-11), omit the item. (13) Schedule 5, items 2 and 3, page 11 (lines 12-18), omit the items. (14) Schedule 5, item 6, page 12 (lines 5-12), omit the item. (15) Schedule 5, item 7, page 12 (lines 13 and 14), omit the item. (16) Schedule 5, item 8, page 12 (lines 15-21), omit the item. This schedule deals with changes to the unfair dismissal provisions or, as the heading states, the terminati!)fl of employment. We are concerned that the changes have the capacity to restrict the access of employees to the unfair dismissal provisions, if I can use that as a generic description of our concern. There are applications which could meet the standards set in the legislation that will fall outside the standards set in this schedule and therefore would fail to be admitted. In being concerned about this, I do not think we are opening the door to some continuous frivolous applications. There are already provisions dealing with that, and I have not seen any evidence that has been brought forward that says there is a problem arising with a flood of applications of a particular sort, a flood that needs to be stemmed with these sorts of changes. While it may suit the administrative convenience of somebody to make these changes, they are not changes without effect on people's rights, and that is where our concern arises. It is what has led us to oppose these amendments. There is a lot of controversy about the whole issue of unfair dismissal, and that will be debated in a Senate committee on Friday. Then, at some time after that, as determined by the government, it will be debated in the Senate. They are very important questions. These are not issues of that level of magnitude. These are not issues about which we expect to see thundering threats of double dissolution. I accept that these are matters of technicality, but I have not seen or heard or read in the explanatory memorandum or the second reading speech anything that says to me these changes which have a capacity to limit or restrict the access of people to the unfair dismissal provisions and these changes which lead to a circumstance in which some application which may be validly operable under the existing provisions will be excluded under these amendments. I do not see circumstances developing here why that proposal should be agreed to. We are therefore not sympathetic to that. The protections that are open to workers in terms of their state provisions and their relationship to awards, AW As and certified agreements are not changes that recommend themselves to us. I do not want to lift it level of higher principle that we have dealt with in the original unfair dismissal changes or, more particularly, those that have recently passed through the House and are currently before the Senate. I do not want to get into that level of concern, but at this stage nothing that I have heard recommends these changes to me. They seem to me to be in the pattern where nobody gains and some people could lose. Therefore, we do not support these amendments.",62
186,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We would be more than happy to give the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) a further briefing on the implication of these issues if he would care to have it. Again, I do not think this proposal is anything other than a technical one which makes more certain the operation of the Workplace Relations Act. The purpose of this particular amendment is to clarify the application of state laws in relation to the termination of employment of an employee covered by a federal award. The intention of subsection IS2(IA) was to ensure that federal system employees who do not have access to a federal remedy for unfair dismissals, such as employees whose former employers were not constitutional corporations, would still have access to a state unfair dismissal remedy. This provision was needed because some federal system employees have been denied access to state unfair dismissal remedies on the basis that federal award clauses dealing with termination of employment have been taken to cover the field to the exclusion of the state remedy. Subsection IS2(IA) was not intended to give federal award employees access to other provisions of state laws or awards dealing with termination of employment, such as entitlements and notice and severance pay under a state award. This is because any federal award entitlements they may have related to termination and redundancy pay are unaffected by the fact that their former employer was not a constitutional corporation or engaged in constitutional trade or commerce. Section IS2(1A) was only intended to provide access to unfair dismissal remedies. The to the proposed amendment makes it clear that it does precisely that. Consistent with the original intention of the legislation, the amended provision will still allow an employee covered by a federal award who has no access to a federal remedy for unfair dismissal to apply for an unfair dismissal remedy under state law. However, the amendment will make it clear that employers bound by federal awards are not subject to other state laws relating to termination of employment, such requirements in relation to severance payor redundancy. I think that says it all. As I say, it is entirely technical. Amendments negatived. Schedule agreed to. Schedule 6-by leave-taken as a whole.",63
187,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (6.07 p.m.)by leave-I move: (17) Schedule 6, items 1 and 2, page 13 (lines 531), omit the items. (18) Schedule 6, item 3, page 13 (line 32) to page 14 (line 10), omit the item. (19) Schedule 6, item 4, page 14, (lines 11-15), omit the item. (20) Schedule 6, item 5, page 14, (lines 16-19), omit the item. (21) Schedule 6, item 6, page 14 (line 20) to page 15 (line 16), omit the item. (22) Schedule 6, item 7, page 15 (line 17) to page 16 (line 2), omit the item. We are dealing with a large number of amendments to schedule 6 but they all essentially go to the same point in terms of our concern with schedule 6. They relate to the circumstance in which a preference clause is in an award or agreement. Obviously, the act means that that clause cannot have effect. That will be the impact of the Workplace Relations Act. A lot of people might expend millions of dollars on QCs trying to interpret that in fine detail. But, in broad principle, that is what it means. We are not trying to argue that point; we accept that conclusion. But that is not the same as saying that the fact the preference clauses are not operative means they ought immediately be struck out of every agreement or award that they are in. Let us think about the implications of that: how did the clauses get in the award or the agreement? Once you think about that, the process becomes evident. They came into the award usually by agreement but, if not by agreement, then by considered decision of the arbitral authority of the time, whatever it might have been called. For the purpose of this, we have said it is the Industrial Relations Commission but, when it happened, it might have been some different body. What happened is that the arbitral authority at the time, the court or commission, made a decision or accepted an agreement that such a clause should be introduced into an award. In the case of an agreement, by definition such a clause went in there because the parties to it signed on and said that is what they wanted. Now that cannot override a law passed by the parliament saying such a clause does not have any effect. Obviously, it would be wrong should that be the case. But that does not, it seems to me, create the justification for saying that we should pretend that those agreements never existed and that those decisions were never made. Mr Reith-Yes, but they are illegal. You are trying to deceive people as part of the CFMEU campaign. It is a disgrace that you should even say it.",63
188,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,You are inventing. You should stop frothing at the mouth. It will be all right. Mr Reith-It is a disgrace.,64
189,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"You are absolutely making it up. You have a famous reputation for stating whatever piece of invention it suits you to pretend is a fact and asselt it as a fact. Mr Reith-Those clauses are void, and you want them in.",64
190,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Nobody has argued that they are not. The fact is you have a propensity to invent everybody else's grounds for a decision that you disagree withMr Reith-Tell me how that is wrong.,64
191,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"You suddenly start saying, 'Well, you're doing this for this reason. That is a terrible reason. You're a shocking person.' Mr Reith-Tell me where I am wrong.",64
192,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"And if the reason is something quite different, you try to distort the argument. We are not the slightest bit concerned about it. To my great pleasure, the Australian people are starting to wake up to you. In fact, the two of you sitting there-you and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)-sum up some of the arguments that have led them to making that conclusion. It is a photograph that should be put up on many walls. Mr Bevis-It is nice to see them here.",64
193,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"That is right, we are delighted to see them there. Mr Reith-Just rationally tell us. Tell us why you want to deceive people with void clauses.",64
194,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The potential for a loaded question-no wonder you had to come into parliament; you obviously were a lousy lawyer. The situation is simply this-as I was in the process of saying and as I will reiterate as often as it requires-the fact that those agreements were entered into and those decisions were made does not disappear off the face of the historical. record. The preference clause cannot be enforced and should not be able to be enforced because the parliament has decided otherwise. I accept that and I do not wish to counteract that. Everybody accepts it; and nobody should be seeking to pretend otherwise. I do not support anybody pretending otherwise. But I also do not believe that, when the parliament changes the law, you should have to go back and renegotiate your agreement or seek a new decision to re-establish the position previously established. (Time expired) Â·, Mr REITH (Flinders-Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business) (6.12 p.m.)-This is quite an interesting developtrade ment. We are putting up 29 technical amendcompulsory ments and even the ACTU does not really object to most of them. Just looking through your amendments, you are proposing to omit 24 of those 29 amendments. But the amendunion. ments in relation to schedule 6 really take cake. Let me just explain what is proposed here. If somebody enters into an agreement today and that agreement includes a clause which is not legal under the Workplace Relations Act because it is discriminatory, it is proposed our amendment that that agreement should be approved. The reason is quite simple: the CFMEU-it is the CFMEU, .the CPSU various others. and a couple of other trade unions-get some weak employer to agree to a discriminatory, illegal clause, then the union plan is to that agreement approved through the commispeople sion so that it can then go around the work sites and say to employees and to employers, 'This has been agreed. This has been certified by the commission. This is the deal.' That what they have been doing. All we are saying is-as the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) acknowledges-that it is not legal because it is outlawed by the federal act. There are penalties for breaching the discriminatory provisions of the federal law; yet the shadow minister wants the CFMEU and some of these other types to be able to have these clauses in agreements with a commission stamp on them so that they can go around deceiving people and misleading people about the nature of the agreements particular work sites. I am amazed that you would go along with this. What you are setting out here is to conspire in a little scheme with the CFMEU so that they should be able to bowl employers and then go around and misrepresent to employees that, because an agreeMi ment has been certified with this particular clause in it, there is a requirement on particular site that people be members of union. It is a clear breach of the rights that people have under the federal law and you are proposing this amendment effectively to collaborate with some of these people in the union movement who want to enforce unionism. It is the old game. Quite frankly, the amazing thing about this is most rank and file trade union members do not believe you should be forced into the And certainly 70 or 80 per cent of the the Australian public do not believe in compulsory unionism. Yet that is all that this is: it is just a device to be able to mislead people. It is a pretty serious thing too because there are penalties for enforcing compulsory unionism. Yet you are going along with a deal to get in these clauses through the commission so that not the usual games can be played out on the if CBD work sites, the building industry and It does show an incredible attitude from the federal parliamentary Labor Party that, in a get labour force today where only one in four are in a union, where people have been leaving trade unions and where there is a very strong value in the Australian community that you should not be able to jackis boot people into unions, it believes that unions should have a right to effectively incorporate into agreements to be certified by the federal commission clauses which they know are void and which will entrap people into breaches of federal law and expose antiemployees to penalties under that law. You have sunk to a new low. We have abolished compulsory unionism. We think it is quite wrong for you to set out, as you have today, to mislead employees about their basic rights just to support the campaigns of a few people in the trade union movement to drafor goon people into unions against their will. This is quite wrong. It shows a lot about the thinking in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. I am disappointed that you do not see the common sense of the technical amendover weak ments before the House.",64
195,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (6.17 p.m.)Deputy Speaker, I think that you should get someone to check the water during the a dinner break. The Minister for Workplace a Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has had something put in his water again. He is really at it again. I thought during the MPI that they had been lacing the water and they are at it again. I urge the attendants to be very careful about this as it seems to be a serious problem because we have just had a virtually hysterical performance. We had all the invented, confected anxiety about something that is not before us at all. There is this great passion that somehow or other we are trying to say that people ought to be able to act contrary to the law. Do we think that? Do we think people should be able to deceive people and break the law? No, we do not. Do we advocate that? No, we do not. Do we support it? No, we do not. Has anybody suggested we do? Only the old fella here who has been drinking the funny water again. I am really concerned about it. Let us think about what it is that is actually happening here. We are saying that we recognise that a clause that is in breach of an act of parliament, a clause that an act of parliament says has no effect, has no effect. We support the fact that the decision of the parliament should be superior to an agreement, but we do not support the provision that people who have agreements or awardssome people have had them for a very long time-are not entitled to continue to have those and have to renegotiate those agreements, to re-establish those awardsMr Reith-What does Laurie's note say?",65
196,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is a very good note and I value it highly. It is very useful advice, although I am not sure how to implement it at the moment. I am sure that you could probably help me, but I am not going to show you the note to give you the chance. Mr Reith-I'll look in the bin after you've finished.",66
197,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I would not be the slightest bit surprised. There was a former colleague of yours who was reputed to be always doing that around the Lodge when Paul Keating was there. I did not think it was you. Now I know where David Connolly used to get the information from. I was always wondering. I have to say on behalf of my constituents that it would not do much good to forage around the bins in the Lodge these days-there is nobody there. It is a cause of great anxiety to my electors. I am not sure that it is because they miss the foraging. Mr Reith-Is this relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker?",66
198,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is as relevant as the interjection. When you interject you create these problems. I did not mean to go off on that tangent, but you understand that it is of local concern. We go back to the point. It is not a complicated one but it is not an unimportant one. There are two different things. An important issue-the minister said it many different ways for five minutes-is that the will of the parliament is superior to anybody wanting to enter into an agreement to say something different. That is right. Who would argue otherwise? Somebody might argue with it, but we do not. This clause does not. Nobody should breach the law by seeking to enforce something that is void. I do not support it and we will not support it. If there is one thing about which I would not take the word of this minister, it is his comments on the CFMEU. If there is one thing in Australia-there are probably quite a number-that I would not take the word of this minister on, it is anything he says about the alleged activities, of which he has no evidence, of the CFMEU. He has got form on that. We do not accept that that is a way in which anybody ought reasonably to behave. This is a set of amendments with which we are going to persevere not only here where, you will be shocked to hear-the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) will be alarmed-we are going to lose",66
199,Mr BRERETON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,That is a shameful outcome.,66
200,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Yes, it is an inadequacy in my advocacy and I apologise for it. But we will persist with the amendments in the Senate.",66
201,Mr BEVIS,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The whole issue of preference for unionists has been one of the most misrepresented issues in the entire modem history of industrial relations debates in this country. The present Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has indulged in the same time-honoured practice of misrepresenting the entire process of preference for unionists. I notice that he seems to replace the words 'preference for unionists' with 'compulsory unionism' on an interchangeable basis. It really does demonstrate the ideological view that the Liberal government has brought to the entire industrial relations issue. Compulsory unionism does not and has never existed. Preference for unionists is nothing of the sort and even in its heyday did not provide, with the possible exception of one or two types of employment, anything approaching an absolute requirement. In fact, there are plenty of examples where matters were taken to industrial commissions for determination on those clauses when they were enforceable in awards only to be turfed out because, as the minister would well know, the concept of preference was one that applied only where all else was equal. It was not difficult for employers to subvert the actual intent and desire of those preference clauses by obfuscating a whole range of other qualities which they may have sought in prospective employees. The whole thing about preference for unionists has been built up as a major smokescreen by successive conservative advocates. The minister is simply the latest in that line of conservative advocates doing his darnedest to tell people why workers on low wages do not deserve an increase and why preference for unionism is somehow compulsory unionism, widespread and evil. It was nothing of the sort and it is hollow rhetoric. It has always amazed me that, on the one hand, the advocates-the minister has fallen into this trap as well-for the minister's cause will argue the evils of preference for unionists and compulsory unionism as being the dreaded impost of union bosses who wield an almighty power over their membership, the work force and the economy. In the next breath-in fact, he did it a few minutes ago in the same speech-he then points out that the number of people in unions represents about 24 to 25 per cent of the population and, therefore, they are pretty insignificant and dying. On the one hand, this is a powerful and dangerous group of people wielding enormous authority and in the next moment they are a group of people who are anachronistic and have no place and no power in Australia today. You cannot have it both ways. The minister went one better in the debate on this bill when he actually urged the opposition to accept the advice of those same people. In one breath he castigates these people as being dangerous, all-powerful, manipulative union bosses who forced people into the union and stopped decent Australians from getting jobs. He then turns around and says to the shadow minister, 'You should go and talk to Tim Pallas.' Mr Reith-When they agree with me, I always say that.",66
202,Mr BEVIS,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Now we understand the criteria. As the minister points out, when those dreaded union bosses agree with him, it is clearly wise counsel and their views should be adhered to by the Labor Party, but on any other occasion, they are evil, manipulative, powerful union left-wing bosses. Mr Reith interjecting",67
203,Mr BEVIS,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It demonstrates that, as a former solicitor, this man will do and say anything to suit the purpose of the argument before him. I guess that generates a few dollars when you are a solicitor but in public life, people actually expect some greater integrity than that. They are willing to pay for a voice in a court, but when you are actually a minister of the Crown, they might expect some degree of integrity and continuity of principle. You have demonstrated that you do not have either. You have demonstrated that again today. Make up your mind: either these people are nasty, manipulative folk who we should certainly not be taking heed of and who have great power and who do all these terrible things with preference for unionists or they are a minority little group who are out there on the fringe, make up 25 per cent of the population, have had their day and are anachronistic. Decide which one you want, but if you want to use both of them, do not use both of them in the same debate. Do not use both in the same paragraph. (Time expired)",67
204,Mr ROBERT BROWN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I want to take the couple of minutes that remain before 6.30 to make a few observations about this particular question. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) referred to the outlawing of compulsory unionism. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) quite correctly said that the minister and the government members tend to equate compulsory unionism with preference for unionists. The minister was quite aghast that the Labor opposition should be, in effect, supporting what he alleges these circumstances to be. All I want to do is to remind the minister that, in connection with the CRA dispute up at Weipa, the Industrial Relations Commission found that CRA was acting contrary to federal law in not discriminating in favour of unionists or giving preference to unionists but, rather, discriminating against them and showing disadvantage to them. Who was the person who was supporting that position up at Weipa? None other than the minister himself. I think it is important for us to understand that there is a particular sentiment around; it is not just a matter of philosophy. If the minister was aware of those types of communities that I am personally familiar with, he would understand the background to the development of the sentiment which gives rise to a powerful motivation on the part of those people to see everyone in the union. It does not take very long for people who are involved in industries of that kind to be affected by that sentiment and to understand its importance. I want to draw attention to a man named Robbie Loane, who is employed at Mount Thorley. There is an article in the Newcastle Herald about this chap. He came from a small business background. He was one of 34 people selected out of 1,200 applicants for a job at Mount Thorley. He said that he had no background in unions; he had not supported unions and there was no particular support on his part for unions. But he said: I probably wasn't much of a union man before But I am now. It was that fellow's own experience which caused him to adopt that position. If the government and the minister fail to understand that sentiment and act in accordance with it and show respect for it, the sort of problems that they have been having will simply continue and compound. It is important that those attitudes and those experiences of working people be respected. We prevail upon the minister in connection with his whole approach to industrial relations to try to see that. Amendments negatived. Schedule agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Amendments (by Mr MCMulIan)-by leave-negatived: (23) Schedule 7, item 4, page 17 (line 30) to page 18 (line 4), omit the item. (24) Schedule 9, item 1, page 23 (lines 5 and 6), omit the item.

251,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES,"I move, as a second reading amendment: AYES That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""this Bill, which relates to payments for child care, should not be proceeded with until an explanation has been provided t(l the House for misstatements of ministerial allowance payments, and the House has decided on the matter."" NOES This is a legitimate amendment within the framework of standing orders prepared under advice, and it is entirely appropriate to be moved in this place. I might say that I am not taking the opposition spokesman's 30 minutes on this matter. I am going to take 20 or thereabouts in regard to it. We move the amendment because it is necessary for this House to give serious consideration to accountability matters before it considers anything else. The reason for that, no less, is the fact that this relates to documents that have misadvised us and which have been tabled in this place. This House has been either inadvertently or deliberately misled-we do not yet know which and we do not yet know by whom, but misled it has been and misled massively. This is a case of smart alecs being caught out. What is the evidence for the fact that we have a cover-up here? Let us take the starting point of this particular cover-up. Members will recollect that, when ministerial travel allowance statements were previously tabled in this House and there was an element of a repayment involved in a minister's position, an asterisk was placed alongside their names with advice as to the amount that they repaid as a result of having effectively misclaimed. There was a coincidence about that asterisk. It was placed only against members of the PAIRS former government in reporting in this place. It must be said that that particular inadvertence did not in fact relate to any degree of misclaiming of an entitlement that had been determined by the parliament or by the government, but by a convention that had been put in place by the previous government that, from a particular point during an election campaign, unless circumstances otherwise indicated, that should not beDr Southcott-On a point of order: I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to standing order 173: Every amendment must be relevant to the question which it is proposed to amend. I ask you to make a ruling on that standing order.",71

As I was saying before I was interrupted, let us return to the asterisks. The asterisks were placed against a set of claims repaidMr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order to you is that the standing orders have a provision which requires that the matters before the chair by way of motions and notices and including debates should be relevant to the matter originating the debate currently before the House. The matter before the House is the relevant bill in respect of child care. As is apparent from the words of the Leader of the Opposition, what you have before you is a ruse, a disguise, and an attempt to avoid the processes of the standing orders.

255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"Order! The honourable member for Watson! Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have expanded my point of order because the matter has been before you. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, on any common sense understanding of the standing orders, it is quite clear that this whole presentation by the Leader of the Opposition is a device to avoid the normal operation of the standing orders and should be dealt with either by a ruling from you or, in the event of you not being persuaded by this presentation, a motion that the member be not further heard.",72

The final point of my point of order was that, under the standing orders, the options are either that you rule it out of order, or alternatively, I suppose, an interpretation of the standing orders would be that I would have to move that the member be not further heard. It seems to me that it is so beyond the spirit of the standing orders that you ought to so rule.",72
258,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"Order! The Leader of the House has made an important point of order. We are in fact debating the Child Care Payments Bill 1997, and the Leader of the Opposition is well entitled to speak, but he should be directing his attention to that bill.",72

269,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution. It has been a long time since the parliament has been full when I have made a speech and I am a little overcome. In fact, it is actually worse than that because I was planning to be sitting here quietly for half an hour listening while the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) spoke, making some notes to take the opportunity to rebut the arguments that she put forward. But I am not going to have that opportunity now, so I am a little embarrassed by that. I was rather disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) took the opportunity that he did to obviously flout the standing orders or at least the spirit of the standing orders. The matters may well be matters that he may wish to raise in this House. He, when he was leader of the House, frequently pulled us into line on those sorts of matters when we were in opposition, so he knows that there are many facilities available to him to pursue the matters that he wishes to pursue. I do not deny that he might wish to pursue them but I believe that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) was absolutely right in making the point that the Leader of the Opposition was flouting the rules and he should have done better. The other matter that I understood was that the government was concerned to have this bill passed through the House this evening. There was a suggestion that members might keep their speeches short. I have not been told whether that is still to be the case or not but that was my understanding. Perhaps the whip might let me know as I make my remarks whether they need to be curtailed earlier than the 20 minutes that the time shows that I have allotted. The fact is that the child care industry has grown largely unchecked because in recent . years it has been underpinned by government largess. It is an industry that has grown because of the system which allowed it to grow. Something had to be done about it; something had to be done to bring that growth into perspective and to make sure that the problems that existed in it were fixed. I understand that the problems are exacerbated in south-east Queensland. I understand that in some other parts of Australia the problems are not as bad as they are in south-east Queensland. But I can tell you that we have a serious problem in the child care industry in southeast Queensland. The child care industry is now a multibillion dollar industry, accounting for .5 per cent of GDP, with government providing 60 per cent of the costs. That amounts to $1.5 billion that the government is putting into child care. Let us examine the question of why. In recent years, debate about early childhood has become complicated and confusing. But there is no doubt in my mind-and I would have been interested to see whether this was an issue the member for Jagajaga might have taken up-that parent involvement gives children the best start in life whilst it also brings deep satisfaction to their parents. I recently read a book by Dr Peter Cook entitled Early Child Care-Infants and Nations at Risk. One paragraph from that book rather sums up my philosophy on child care. Dr Cook says: It should be obvious that it goes against nature for mothers to be put under pressure to hand over their infants and toddlers to unrelated strangers for most of their waking hours. The Howard government is committed to giving families a real choice about how their children are cared for-and I mean real choice. This legislation that we have before us is entirely consistent with actions that this government has already taken to ensure that parents do get a real choice about the sort of care that their children receive. It is also consistent with the economic imperatives that this government faced when it came into government. I do not need to remind the House tonight that there were very serious economic problems faced by this government when it took office, problems which it inherited from the previous government. Expenditure on child care in that regard, like expenditure in many other areas, had to be reigned in. Already actions have been taken to limit child care assistance to 50 hours a week. There have been situations where exemptions can be gained from that particular limitation. Indeed, I think most people would regard 50 hours child care a week as being very generous. A number of other measures have already been implemented. I would have been interested to know what the member for Jagajaga was saying about the bill in respect of the 20-hour limitation which is being imposed on non-working parents' access to child care. Ms Macklin-What was your pre-election promise?",74
270,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"I assume that the opposition is supporting the 20-hour limitation. If it is not, it easily will be accused of being absolutely hypocritical on that issue, having when it was in government proposed a 12-hour limit to access. Ms Macklin-That's right.",75
271,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Jagajaga.,75
272,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"I am not sure whether I would be excited about staying around now to listen to what the member for Jagajaga has to say. But if she had spoken before me in the chamber this evening, I would have been interested in listening to her. Mr MCMullan-You might learn something.",75
273,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"I doubt very much that I would learn anything. But I would be interested to know whether the opposition is s-pporting the - O-hour limit. I assume they will be supportIng the 20-hour limit. If they do .not, they will look a tad hypocritical, havIng attempted when in government to impose a 12-hour limit on the access of nonworking parents to child care. The government in this legislation also imposes a limit of 7,000 on the number of new private child-care places eligible for child-care assistance in the two years 1998 and 1999. Once again, I have to assume that the opposition will support that limitation. Again, I would find it rather inconceivable if they were not to, even if they were only halfaware of what the child-care industry is about-and particularly considering the problems existing in the child-care industry as I was saying, in south-east Queensland. ' In south-east Queensland, child care has grown to the point where there child-care centres -:m - lmost every comer. In fact, they are a btt lIke comer stores; they have just sprung up everywhere. We now have an excess supply situation that is threatening the viability of existing child-care centres. So I am very pleased that this legislation proposes that 7,000 limitation for the years 1998 and 1999. Also, I need to foreshadow that I think there will be a need to give consideration to extending that limitation beyond those two particular years. There have been-and I am sure the memb-r for J agaj aga would have gone into some detail about this-'-some concerns expressed, and in n:;ty view quite rightly and justifiably, by the Industry about the complication or complexity of the changes and also about some of the particular impacts of the changes on the industry in south-east Queensland. I need to say-and the members opposite have detected quite correctly that I would be consistent with the line that I have put throughout the eight years that I have been in this place-that I am not a great supporter of the child-care industry. I am not a fan of the child-care industry by any means. I am in that quaint group in this place and outside that believes parent care is good for kids. I believe that parent care is the best care that money can buy for kids. Especially-and the member forJagajaga will collapse when I say this-I belIeve mother care happens to be important to kids as well. Parents should be able to choose the care that they want for their children. I noticed that during my opening remarks there was much mirth opposite when I made those sorts of statements because, of course, my pro-child or pro-family views-and they are views that are shared by a large number of my colleagues here-are offensive to extreme feminists. I notice that Eva Cox, for instance, is one who said that women not back in the work force by the time their child is one-year-old are bludgers. That would describe, unfortunately, a very large number of women who choose not to return to work so soon-and my wife is one of them. That description is offensive to a large number of women. The debate about child care was hijacked for many years by the extreme feminists who dominated the previous government's policy making in this area, and the result was unchecked growth of an industry almost completely underpinned by government largess. As I said, it has risen almost exponentially over the years and it is now costing us $1.5 billion. This government was elected with a mandate to fix up the problems in many areas, and child care is only one of those areas which has needed attention. I am pleased that this legislation is consistent with our underlying objective in this particular area-that is, to provide real choice for families; to enable families to make choices about the child care which best suits them. I would be interested to hear what members of the opposition have to say about this issue of choice. They have always been in favour of choice. But, essentially, they want to give families Hobson's choice, or their choice. The choice was that you could make any choice you like, as long asMs Macklin-Back in the kitchen!",76
274,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"That is the sort of inane interjection I would expect from the member for Jagajaga. She does herself no service by identifying with the very few people who have driven this debate for so long. This legislation is part of the process of fixing up the problems that you created. You let this debate be hijacked all along by an ideological position that essentially downgraded the importance of families and which did not take into account the best interests of children. I can understand why you are sensitive about that. If I were in your position, I would be sensitive about it too. But the fact is that is what you allowed to occur, that is what this debate will be about and that is what this legislation is about-fixing up the mess that you particularly left us. In the minute that I really ought only to take, I will refer to the immunisation requirements in this particular legislation. I want to put on record my concl!rns about this. I understand that there is, I think, within the community a good deal of support for it. But, once again, my position on this issue would be that parents should have a choice about this particular matter. I do not believe that they do have a real choice about this issue. The act provides that children attending child care be fully immunised before any child-care assistance is payable. According to the act, parents can become conscientious objectors, but a strict test applies to that particular position being taken, and it is not certain yet exactly what the requirements will be. I understand that in part they would have to be counselled by a doctor, who presumably would tell them about the risks of not vaccinating, but not necessarily the risks of vaccinating. I will finish off. Mr Crean-You have five minutes to go! Are you going to defend this fraud?",77
275,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"We have been asked to curtail our remarks a little in the interests of getting through this debate tonight. Unfortunately for you people, I think we will achieve that objective. Eva Cox was right when she spoke about this immunisation requirement. It irks me to say that she is right about anything, but she is right when she says that this adds what is essentially a health measure to already complicated arrangements that are in place for claiming child care. As she says, it will impact heavily on the poor. I need to put those remarks on record. I know they are not consistent with the govern""' ment or opposition positions, but I feel strongly that it is a matter of choice for parents. Seeing it is something that I subscribe to very strongly, then I think it should apply to the choice of whether your children are immunised or not. I have chosen to that immunise mine. I am not against immunisation, but I have some concerns about the obligatory or the compulsory nature of this requirement. Child care is important. I assume there would be general agreement on that. In fact, nothing could be more important. Let us decide and be sure in this debate that this legislation is consistent, as I believe it is, with really finding what is best for children. There has been too much of the dog wagging the tail in the child-care debate for too long. The debate has been hijacked, as I said, by those who have an agenda other than finding out what is best for children. I believe this legislation is broadly consistent with that very desirable objective. Mrs SulIivan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing order 227 says: Any amendment may be moved to any part of the bill, provided it is within the title or relevant to the subject matter of the bill . . . Now that I have had the opportunity of looking at a copy of the amendment that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition, it is my view that under the standing orders and procedure of this House this amendment is out of order and should not be proceeded with.",77
276,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I thank the member for Moncrieff. I now have had the opportunity to see and examine the terms of the amendment. While it makes a valiant attempt to be relevant, the second reading amendment is out of order. The question therefore is that this bill be now read a second time. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, are you seriously ruling that our amendment is out of order?",77
277,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! You have not got the call. Mr Crean-I seek the call.,78
278,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"On what? Mr Crean-Are you ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker",78

290,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I rise in this debate because of the commitment of the Labor Party to advancing child care for working families in this country-a commitment that we never shirked during our 13 years in office. During Labor's years in office, 1983 to 1996, there was a 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth funded child-care places. Labor's policies were about addressing needs, not cutting for the sakeÂ· of cutting. What we were about was offering security to families and the ability for them to exercise choice in the work force, and we had to recognise that one of the barriers to people getting into the work force, which was how they could have their children cared for whilst they were so participating. In contrast to Labor's commitment to child care, what have we got from the coalition government? A cut of $820 million in child care. And that is essentially what we are debating here tonight. For the sake of some point of reference, let me indicate to you what it costs an average family a week for child care. It costs $170 a week to participate in child care. But we have the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) defrauding the Commonwealth for that amount every night in Canberra-$154 a night and he has done it for 47 nights. It costs $170 a week for child care and the minister is defrauding the Commonwealth for that every night for 47 nights at least. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order is the obvious one. This is a gross abuse of the standing orders. Mr Crean interjecting",81
291,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,You're like a dog running up and down the fence.,81
292,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for O'Connor! Mr Crean-You'll never get there on your merits. You'll get there by fraud, too.",81
293,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I call the Leader of the House. Mr Reith-:- Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order is that, as you will be aware from the events of the evening, the opposition has spent the whole evening attempting to raise a matter other than child care. Under these circumstances, given the repeated attempts by the opposition to flout the standing orders,it would be appropriate for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to require the Manager of Opposition Business to confine his remarks to the matter before the chair. He is speaking instead of the member for Jagajaga for the very purpose of defeating the standing orders. I make that submission to you.",81
294,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I uphold the point of order of the Leader of the House. Mr O'Keefe-Oh, what is this?",81
295,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I warn the member for Burke. I uphold the point of order and I remind all honourable members that understanding order 81 no member may digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion. I urge the honourable member for Hotham to stick to the subject of the bill.,81
296,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. A minute ago the member accused me of fraud and I ask him to withdraw that. Mr Crean-I did not accuse him of fraud, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr O'Keefe interjecting",81
297,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The member for Burke, you have been warned. Mr Tuckey interjecting",81
298,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I warn the member for O'Connor as well. I repeat that no member may digress from the subject matter. I invite the member for Hotham to continue, but to speak on the subject matter of the bill. Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I understand that the words used by the Manager of Opposition Business to another member of this place were to the effect that 'You are a fraud.' Those words are not parliamentary and I ask you to ask the member to withdraw.",81
299,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I thank the Leader of the House. I did not hear the words. I do ask the member for Hotham to withdraw. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not accuse the member for O'Connor of fraud. I accused the Minister for Transport and Regional Development of fraud. And he is a fraud. He has defrauded the Commonwealth for 47 nights at $154 a night.",82
300,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I name the member for Hotham. Mr Crean-He is a fraud and he should come into this House and explain why he says that he is offended. Let him come into the House.,82
301,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I name the member for Hotham. Motion (by Mr Reith) put: That the member for Hotham be suspended from the service of the House. A division having been called and the bells being rung Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, in an exchange across the table, the Manager of Opposition Business was boasting that, by getting himself thrown out, he will not have to withdraw. That cannot be parliamentary, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it should be required of him to withdraw. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: the oil slick is at it again. That Billson, B. F. is not what I said across the table-not at all. If you listen to him, you will get yourself into the same trouble the Speaker is in.",82
302,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I would like to advise the House that, of course, the question of withdrawal is still alive. If the honourable member for Hotham does not withdraw, it is open to the House to resume that matter at the end of his suspension from the House. I would like to give the member for Hotham another opportunity to withdraw if he so desires. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, in the debate I did not call the member for O'Connor a fraud. I did not call him a fraud.",82
303,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Thank you. Mr Crean-I called the minister for transport a fraud.,82
304,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I would suggest to you that it would be wise, in the interests of the House, to withdraw the calling of the minister for transport a fraud. Mr Crean-At this point I do. But not in the earlier debate.",82
305,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Lock the doors. The question is that the honourable member for Hotham be suspended from the service of the House. The ayes will pass to the right of the chair, the noes to the left. I appoint the honourable membersMrs Crosio- Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Curtin is on his feet over there.

307,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member for Hotham is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Hotham thereupon withdrew from the chamber. CHILD CARE PAYMENTS BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed. AYES Mr MCDOUGALL (Griffith) (9.29 p.m.)As I stand to address the measures contained in the Child Care Payments Bill, I am reminded that a major part of our job is to help our constituents carve their way through the red tape of bureaucracy. Absolutely nothing separates politicians from the people they serve when it comes to dealing with the bureaucracy. We all experience the same frustrations. The word bureaucracy tells the story. It means, according to Webster's: An unwieldy administrative system, burdened with excessive complexity and lack of flexibility. What a perfect description of the Child Care Act this government inherited. I could be easily convinced that it would be easier to have a baby than it would be to work out the child-care entitlements. Currently, child-care assistance is paid direct to approved long day care centres by the Department of Health and Family Services, but the child':care cash rebate is paid direct to the family by the Health Insurance Commission. The commission is better known for its Medicare role, which is why parents claiming their child-care cash rebate have had to apply to a Medicare office as opposed to the Department of Health and Family Services. Many, of course, have not known this; nor, sadly, have they been advised by either organisation. Thankfully, the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 tidies up this split system merry-goround. As laid down in this bill, both the PAIRS child-care assistance and the child-care rebate will be paid through the one agency. This will be the newly formed Centrelink, the one-stop shop which will absorb our local Social Security offices while taking over many other government services. When we took over government 18 months ago we inherited an outdated and out of control child-care system. The Child Care Act dates back to 1972 when taxpayer funded child-care assistance was virtually unheard of. The government's first move in the early 1970s was logical and involved providing capital funding to help establish childminding facilities in the suburbs where they were sorely needed. We have pretty well turned a complete cycle with an overabundance of centres in some areas and not enough in others. Child care has grown into a massive industry, both public and private. As a result, the system has been patched and filled so many times that even a person with the wits to program a VCR would have trouble with it. I certainly have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) whose job it has been to completely restructure the child-care system. Some of the changes she has made have had predictable reaction in the community. Community funded centres want more funds and privately run centres want less competition. But everyone agreed the system was badly in need of an overhaul and concede that the changes made by this government have made child care accessible to more low income families. Rationalising child-care assistance has been an easy task and this bill resolves some of the more minor but vital aspects. (Quorum formed) One of those aspects involves the introduction of a limit of 20 hours per week of taxpayer funded care for non-working parents. This change met with unqualified support by my community in south-east Brisbane. There was one memorable story in our local paper of a non-working mother who was annoyed as the cut in hours from 50 hours per week to 20 hours per week meant that she would lose a fair amount of her leisure time. But, otherwise, the taxpayers of Griffith were happy their funds were assisting working parents and not being used for babysitting. This bill amends one aspect of that cut to 20 hours for the parents of children who have special needs. I do not believe anyone in our community of Griffith would begrudge extending assistance to a family with a child who has special needs. I commend the Minister for Family Services for extending child-care assistance to not just the child with the disability but also its brothers and/or sisters. (Quorum formed) This change will mean much needed relief for the parents and will also assist the children by giving them time in another caring and safe environment. In addressing the many aspects of the childchild-care care system, which sorely needed reform, this Child Care Payments Bill also attacks the emotive issue of immunisation. I have made it clear to my electorate of Griffith that I support our program for the immunisation of our children, I have produced immunisation charts which I have delivered to child-care centres, preschools, kindergartens, medical centres and pharmacies. Without exception everyone has been supportive of the program. This amendment to the Child Care Payments Bill makes it easier for parents to ensure that their child has been immunised before placing them in child care. The Child Care Payments Bill as it currently stands does not give parents a period of grace when they make a retrospective claim for a child-care payment. Following these changes, a family will be given the time to meet the immunisation requirements, which will be of special benefit to those who do not use child care on not a regular basis. This does not mean that they can avoid having their child immunisedquite the contrary. Any subsequent claim will be rejected. This bill-in particular the introduction of a limit on the number of new, private sector child care places in the next two yearsbrings some coherence to a system which had grown with almost carefree abandon. Recently I spent time contacting all child-care facilities in my electorate. I spoke to the managers of community long day care centres and the operators of private centres. Both expressed concern at the growing number of private facilities opening in the electorate. The community based long day care centres admitted that they were losing customers to the private centres. Established private centres expressed concern that new centres opening were aiming to entice customers from existing centres. In other words, unchecked funding by the previous government has allowed the caring of children to become big business, and competition in some areas is rife. Queensland has the highest per capita number of private long day care places of any state in Australia-74,600 places in all. Too many centres in one area cannot be to the advantage of the children as spreading the dollar can only result in the watering down of services. This bill not only places a limit on the number of new, private sector child-care places eligible for government assistance but also introduces a planning system. The government has limited control over the forces of the marketplace but, if a planning system is put in place, the private sector, the community sector and, ultimately, all families using child-care facilities will benefit.",83
308,Mr KERR,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr MCDougall is finding it difficult to hold his audience. Again, I draw your attention to the state of the House. The bells being rungDr Southcott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I seek clarification. Past speakers have ruled that it is reasonable to call quorums at a period of about 15 minutes apart. Could you rule on that.",85
309,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Nehl}--The standing orders provide for a quorum to be called at any time. (Quorum formed),85
310,Mr MCDOUGALL,NOES,"We cannot allow the child-care system to continue running like a stream that has broken its banks. Nor can we expect the taxpayer to fund child care for parents who use the facility as a baby-sitting service or as a boost to an already healthy income. I support the need for government funded child care, and I have great admiration for those supermums of the 1970s who worked and had no government assistance at all, but if we do not take a long, close look the way the industry is going we will find ourselves with an overabundance of child-care centres and not enough customers. To ensure well-managed, well-maintained and well-regulated child-care centres, we need a planning system that everyone in the industry can access. This bill ensures that this be done and that parents can be assured not only of assistance where needed but also of high quality care. I support the bill.",85
311,Mr KERR,NOES,"It appears the government is moving on with an icy resolve to insist upon what is frankly not a common sense approach, given that there is an issue of substance that we all know ought be before this parliament, to debate an issue that is not principally on the minds of any members of this House. But let us put it frankly before us. Child care is a crucial issue for all Australians. For those who have young children, there is nothing more important than making certain that they have quality, affordable care. Parents who require child care have been let down by this government, which has withdrawn some $800 million-notwithstanding pledges given before the last electionfrom the way in which this works. But let us look at what happens in child care. Let us look at what they pay child-care workers. A child-care worker on the award receives $359.60 gross. A minister of the Crown who resides and spends a night in Sydney gets more than that tax free in effective outcome, and when we have allegations before us of theft and fraud and this House battles on facingMr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this House has gone over that issue and really what the member for Denison is talking about is not relevant to this debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that you bring him back to the topic under debate.",85
312,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I thank the parliamentary secretary. The honourable member for Denison will of course be relevant to the question before the House, and I will be listening very carefully.",85
313,Mr KERR,NOES,"Thank you indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I do not wish to suffer any ill fate. I have already left the chamber once at today, and I do not want to repeat it. But might I say that it is entirely relevant to the issue of child care, this bill and the withdrawal of funding to make some proper comparisons between the way in which this government is dealing with the funding of child care, . the way it is dealing with the legitimate salary will and wage needs of those employed in the sector that have been kept down because of the way in which this government has dealt with the sector-salaries which work out at $359.60 per week gross, out of which tax is paid-and the way a minister of the Crown, in a capital city like Sydney, who makes a claim can receive I think $320-it used to be $300-tax free so that one night's claim of TA is equivalent to the salary of that childcare worker for a week. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I am being very forbearing in regard to this matter. I just want to draw your attention again, Mr Deputy Speaker, to relevance, and I point out to you that what is being said is not relevant to this debate at all.",85
314,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I thank the parliamentary secretary. The honourable member for Denison will of course be relevant, and I will try again to listen very carefully.",86
315,Mr KERR,NOES,"Thank you indeed. What I am seeking to do is to highlight the absurdity of today's proceedings when we are studiously ignoring what the honourable member who sought to interrupt before about the calling of quorums said in saying, 'Let's have some common sense and let's deal with the serious matters in front of us.' There are serious matters that everyone knows are here, and we sit here ignoring them while we proceed with ordinary debate as if we can ignore the stench that is emanating from these matters. Coming to this bill, let us look at what it means. (Quorum formed) Child-care centres in the community sector have had $100 million in operational subsidies withdrawn. That effectively means that, on average, parents who place their children in such centres-and I was one and I was very grateful for the quality of care-now face an additional burden of $20 per week. Let us see how $20 a week works out against a minister of the Crown's travel allowance. Let us take a hypothetical example. Mr Leo MCLeay-No, don't do that.",86
316,Mr KERR,NOES,"No, it is just a hypothetical example. Mr Brough-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. This bill does not go to travel expenses, this bill does not go to ministers' wages, nor does it go to the wages of child-care providers. The speaker has flagrantly disregarded your rulings. You have attempted to bring him back to order. I suggest strongly that you do in fact rule him out of order altogether. He has already been removed once today, and twice might teach him a better lesson. Mr MCMullan-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I realise that people are very sensitive about the matters that the speaker raising, but it is perfectly within the standing orders, it seems to me, to draw analogies to say that there are cuts being made in subject A and there is waste in area B.",86
317,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"There is no point of order. Before I call the honourable member for Denison again, for his benefit and the benefit of all members. I draw attention to standing order 81: No Member may digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion: Also standing order 85 states: The Speaker, or the Chair, after having called the attention of the House, or of the Main Committee, to the conduct of a Member, who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his or her own arguments, or the arguments used by other Members in debate, may direct the Member to discontinue his or her speech: I call the honourable member for Denison, who I do advise in the strongest possible terms to be relevant to the bill.",86
318,Mr KERR,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. But I do think members of the House, and indeed yourself, sir, would be cognisant of the difficulty of conducting a debate in the absurdity of this situation. We are discussing under the standing orders a child-care bill, but we are discussing it against an environment where, before this debate came on, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) came into this House and dropped a dead cat on the table, from which it is plain that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) stands charged with allegations of theft and fraud. There is no doubt that this is a difficult situation to address.",86
319,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Denison will resume his seat. I call the parliamentary secretary on a point of order. I might say to all members in the chamber that I am having considerable difficulty in hearing the honourable member for Denison because I am trying to give some attention to the standing orders so that I canMrs Bailey-Throw him out with his crutches.,86
320,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I do not need your advice, Madam. As I was saying, on is each occasion this has happened, and I do not know whether the member for Denison is deliberately doing this, once I am absorbed in the standing orders he digresses. It seems that every time. I look in the standing orders someone rises on a point of order. The honourable member for Denison has the call, and I do advise him that I will apply the standing orders unless he sticks to the subject of the bill. Mr Miles-On a: point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: you did call me a moment ago, and I just want to make this point. I refer to standing order 85, which you have just read to the House.",86
321,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Thank you. I have just read it to the House. There is no need for you to read it again. Mr Miles-Okay. What I am suggesting is that standing order 85 says: ... may direct the Member to discontinue his or her speech: This is the fourth time he has been regarded as irrelevant.,87
322,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I thank the parliamentary secretary, and I say to all members in this place that the same standing order can apply to points of order. I call the honourable member for Denison, who I do encourage to be relevant.",87
323,Mr KERR,NOES,"Thank you very much. I understand that there is a great deal of sensitivity in this parliament tonight, and rightly so. Mind you, that sensitivity should be extended with respect to the minister directly responsible for the child-care area. If you look today at the reports that are in the Australian Associated Press, they tell us today that federal family services minister Judy Moylan-responsible for child care, responsible for the debacle that we are talking about here, responsible for the funding cutbacks, responsible for the shameful behaviour that contrasts so odiously with the kind of slippery conduct that you do not want me to be able to speak about or anyone else to be able to speak aboutMr Leo MCLeay-The stench is rising.",87
324,Mr KERR,NOES,"The stench is rising. It says of her that her front bench position looks in doubt today after a party room bucketing that saw Prime Minister John Howard take her outside. Here we have the debate on who is the most grievously wounded and the next to fall-whether it be Minister Sharp, who is plainly now in a circumstance where the Australian public see him as indicted and needing to defend himself against the most serious charges involving potential fraud and corruption",87
325,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"The honourable member for Denison, this is the last time that I will wam you.",87
326,Mr KERR,NOES,"As to Ms Moylan, she flew home to Perth sick after the meeting and was not in parliament for question time",87
327,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"The honourable member for Denison will resume his seat. The question is that this bill be now read a second time. I call the honourable member for Canning. Mr Leo MCLeay-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill was introduced into the House by Minister Moylan. To canvass the position of Minister Moylan in relation to a bill that Minister Moylan has before this House is certainly relevant and certainly in order. I cannot see for the life of me why, when the government has banished the minister from town because the Prime Minister had to take her outside, and she is not here tonight, you will not let us raise that. My goodness. It is cover-up No.4.",87
328,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,There is no just point of order. Resume your seat. The question is that this bill be now read a second time. I call the honourable member for Canning.,87
329,Mrs JOHNSTON,NOES,"In speaking to this Child Care Payments Bill 1997 today, I am sure that everyone, even those on the other side of this great chamber, would agree that the people of Australia are our greatest assets; although, listening to the performance we have had here tonight, I am not quite sure whether that introduction is still relevant. But I would like to think that in the future the members on the other side of the House will have a bit more decorum. I believe it is in our children that we find the greatest hope for our future. That is at the very heart of the Howard government's social policy is a fundamental commitment to require. get a better deal for families-a fairer deal that helps to give our children both social economic stability. Experts consider that the early years of child's life are the most important for their development. Indeed, these formative years childhood are invaluable. They are significant because it is during this time that parents create the secure and loving family environis ment that gives our children the best chance community. to achieve their childhood dreams. (Quorum formed) My personal view as a mother is that often the best care and upbringing a child can receive is one where the primary caregiverweek and that predominantly is still considered be the woman--comes from within the family environment. But it would be insensible not to acknowledge that because of different circumstances an increasing number of women wish, or indeed need, to enter the work force. For these women, the possibility for child care to be provided outside the home by a non-parental figure is a necessity. Parents who seek the assistance of professional child-care workers do so for a variety of reasons. One of these is to heighten child's social and educational developmental process through interaction with other chilnot dren of a similar age. Yet Arleen Leibowitz, in an article on child care last year, stated: Despite the research on the educational value of child care, most families see day care as a of freeing the mother's time for market work. That is why the Howard government, through legislation introduced as part of the 1996-97 budget and through the bill we are debating in this place today, is giving to child care for families where parents either work or are seeking a job. Similarly, those taking part in schemes as work for the dole or who are undertaking study or training to improve their opportunicentralised ties of securing paid work have the same access. Therefore, it follows that child-care assistance should, in the main, be targeted at working parents with dependent children. government's philosophy is to foster a childwhy care system that helps people who have the greatest need to secure the assistance they Let me tum to one of the many reforms that and the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 seeks to introduce, namely, the limiting of child-care a assistance to 20 hours per week for each child in non-work related care. By doing this, the of government demonstrates that it is not in the business of providing respite from the responcan sibilities of parenthood over and above what considered acceptable by the tax paying Parents whose primary responsibility is the rearing and caring of their offspring utilise the child-care system, on average, for 14 hours per week. Therefore, a cap of 20 hours per as stated in this legislation is supported to by many who serve in the industry. The changes being debated today as part of this bill seek to give parents the right to choose the level of care that they consider appropriate. It also seeks to ensure that the system in which child-care payments are made and distributed is compatible with a hectic family life. (Quorum formed) The Howard government recognises that raising a family can at times be demanding. a This government does not want to make the job of parenting any more difficult. We do want a quagmire of bureaucratic processes for mums and dads to battle with before being able to receive the child-care benefits they are entitled to. That is why the application, means provision and appeals procedures for childcare payments will soon be made through one agency, the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency's Centrelink, currently still known to most people as the Department of priority of access Social Security. From January 1998, families applying for child-care benefits will have to lodge only such one form at one government agency. This is good news for parents, who will find the method of lodging paperwork for all aspects of the benefits system much more convenient than is their current experience. The long-term strategy of the Howard This government is to implement a child-care system that serves our families and children well into the next century. This is in stark contrast to the previous government's policy on child care, which showed that those opposformed) ite had, and still have, a complete lack vision. It was the intention of Labor to only quick fix solutions to our most pressing family concerns. That is why, on coming to government, we in the coalition have sought to redress the unacceptable situation of an undersupply of child-care centres in some areas and an oversupply in others, a situation, I would suggest, that is most unacceptable parents. The coalition government's intention rectify this inefficiency. We will creating a child-care system that is flexible enough to meet the emerging needs of most families. Simultaneously, it will provide the required framework to ensure our primary objective of creating an effective and efficient child-care system. That is why this bill to introduce measures aimed at confining the number of new child-care places to areas where they are most needed. This move is chances. welcomed by responsible child-care providers because they understand and acknowledge that controlled growth is essential if the industry is to reach its full potential. In the 1996-97 budget the government introduced legislation to encourage communifour ty based long day care centres to become more efficient and cost competitive with their private sector counterparts. This government has offered additional funding to such centres so they can obtain financial planning advice which may assist them with undertaking restructuring. Measures such as this will ultimately bring benefit to the community the form of more productive use of taxpayer subsidies. This measure is consistent with the finding of the 1996 child-care task force interim report, which identified that one of the nationthat al goals for child-care provision is for quality services to be provided at the least cost for that required quality. The report goes on say: Value for money is the appropriate goal for lies and governments. I would suggest that the opposition takes heed of this because it is this goal that the government most certainly concurs with. (Quorum The coalition government has also of been instrumental in developing a new inforapply mation system to meet the planning and access needs of both service providers and parents alike. In an ideal world with perfect information, people would be equipped to make perfectly rational choices. It is then the duty of government, in this imperfect world, to ensure that an adequate level of informato tion is made available. This will equip all concerned to make an informed decision in the best interests of the family. The national is to child-care information strategy seeks to do this by provide just that measure. In concluding my comments on this bill before us, I wish to bring the attention of the members in this place to some further practical illustrations of the Howard government's seeks commitments to families in action.",87
330,Mr KERR,NOES,You are going to run short. Keep going! I even tried to give you more,89
331,Mrs JOHNSTON,NOES,"Where is Martin? He is not here. From our election to government in March 1996, the coalition will have created over 30,000 new child-care places at a full cost to the government of $86 million over years. Seventy thousand low and.middle income families will benefit from the provision of outside school hours care services at a higher rate of child-care assistance than before. More good news, I would suggest, for Australian families and particularly those constituents in my electorate of Canning. As previously mentioned, the streamlining of in child-care benefit assessments, payments and appeals procedures within one government department will assist everyone who operates within the system. The Child Care Payments Bill 1997 will go a long way in delivering a child-care system is better targeted, more effective and more efficient. Aspects of the bill, as I have discussed today, seek to strike and appropriate to balance between the more immediate needs of families and child-care providers against the famineed to ensure the long-term viability of the industry as a whole. A well planned and administered child-care policy is imperative if we are to create the future for our kids that they so deserve. With this in mind, I have absolutely no hesitation in commending this bill to the House.",89
332,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,We hear a whole lot of people in this debate standing up and pretending that they believe this is a very serious bill and they wish to deal with it seriously. But if the government were serious about the Child Care Payments Bill they would not absolutely degrade the debate about it knowing that it is going to be continuously overwhelmed by the concern in the parliament and in the public about the stench of corruption that is around the government at this time. Anybody who seriously wished to deal with this bill,90
333,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Nehl}-I draw the attention of the member for Canberra to the fate of the honourable member for Denison. I do urge you to be relevant to the bill.,90
334,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"I listened very carefully to your advice to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and was seeking very carefully to stick to the bill. I certainly think it is appropriate to debate the way in which the parliament is handling the bill. I think it is a proper matter to say that I believe it is being grossly mishandled by this government. A government that seriously considered this as a priority matter, where they wanted a debate around the issues and the public to focus on their real concerns about child care, would not be having the debate tonight when everything that happens tonight, whether it is relevant to this bill or not, is going to be overwhelmed by the surrounding circumstances, by the context in which it is taken into account and by the fact that all the news coverage is dominated by concern about the issue of allegations of theft and fraud and the issue of the cover up.",90
335,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I would say to the member for Canberra that the news stories are irrelevant to the content of the bill.,90
336,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,But they are not irrelevant to the conduct of the bill. Can I now tum to a very important child-care issue,90
337,Mr SLIPPER,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order relates to relevance. Other points of order have been taken on opposition members who have deviated most grossly from the. subject matter of the bill. The shadow minister is doing so. He is seeking to circumvent your ruling. I would ask that you ask him to be relevant or si t him down.",90
338,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I thank the honourable member for Fisher. I had hoped that he might have been listening to what I have been saying because I have been saying very much to the member for Canberra what is necessary to be said.,90
339,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"And the difference between you and him is that you knew the standing orders that were relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker. I now want to return to the childcare question that the member for Denison was trying to raise in the latter part of his speech when he was referring to the significant report on the AAP wire service tonight which was very much about child care-the party room attack about the application forms that the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) was referring to in the speech. If her reference to those forms was relevant, then my response about them is equally relevant. Mr Hockey interjecting",90
340,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member for North Sydney will not interject from where he is presently sitting.,90
341,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"What is reported to have taken place in the party room today is exactly about those matters that the member for Canning was referring to. The attack that took place on the minister responsible for this bill was directly related to those matters to which she referred. It is another sign of the serious problems confronting this government and their ministers. It is a government that cannot manage its own affairs and it cannot win the confidence of the Australian peopleand, of course, it does not deserve the confidence of the Australian people.",90
342,Mr BRERETON,NOES,It knows how to fill in a crook TA though.,90
343,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"Yes, indeed it does. The member for Kingsford-Smith makes a very important interjection, for which I thank him.",90
344,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I don't. Government member interjecting,91
345,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"Any port in a storm. there But the way this child-care bill is before the way it is being handled, the significance improprietyof what is in it and the contrast with what is fundamentally going on is an absolute metaphor for what is happening with this government: it is slashing funds to areas of public necessity, and it is absolutely selfindulgent in expenditure on itself. That is contrast that is appalling the Australian people-and it properly is appalling them. my own electorate we have child-care centres closing down, child-care workers losing jobs.",91
346,Dr NELSON,NOES,"Which ones, Bob?",91
347,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"Marymead. It is closing not down, the workers there are losing their jobs and the parents there, my constituents, are losing access to those child-care centres. I am seriously concerned about that. Those people are being forced to withdraw for a variety of reasons, all of which go back to this governty ment. To some extent, they have been by the sackings that have been undertaken by this government. That means there number of people out of work who cannot therefore access child care. To some extent, it is affected by other issues of this governof ment which are forcing up the price of child care. Those people will be even more appalled the morning to find that the cuts to child that are affecting them and their access to services to which they are entitled, and which they have enjoyed up until very recently, until the last two weeks, are occurring simulcurrently taneously with this government's selfRelations indulgent expenditure on itself-this governgovernment. ment's capacity to spend $9,000 on a minister who is responsible for ripping off a travel allowance that they know they were not entitled to.",91
348,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! If the Australians-a honourable member for Canberra wishes to make such a charge, he knows the forms the House that are available to him. He will withdraw.",91
349,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"If there is something for which I need to withdraw, I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. But I am concerned that does appear to be a substantial amount us, of evidence of concerns about fraud and",91
350,Mr KERR,NOES,It's prima facie evidence.,91
351,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"Prima facie evidence, my colleague says. Mr Randall- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a a point of order. It goes to your ruling on standing order 85 which talks about digresIn sions. The member for Canberra has deliberately flouted your ruling several times. I ask their that you rule him disorderly.",91
352,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I thank the honourable member for Swan, but I would point out to him that standing order 85 does refer to digressions but rather to tedious repetition and irrelevance. I call the honourable member for Canberra and again remind him of the need to be relevant to the bill.",91
353,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"And indeed, Mr DepuSpeaker, you will acknowledge that I am caused trying very hard to do so.",91
354,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,You are trying is a large me very hard too.,91
355,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"There is another source very serious concern for all of us on this side of the House with regard to what is happening at the moment in the child-care industry. The concern we have, which was in reflected in the public debate today, goes to care the appalling wages received by workers in the the child-care industry. The base rate is $359.60 gross. Those wages are all less than up $380, which is the minimum wage application before the Australian Industrial Commission being opposed by this The government says that $359.60 is enough for a person to have as their before-tax income for working 38 hours in a responsible position, taking care of the children of other very important, serious profession, which is undervalued in our country. of The amount of $359.60 is supposed to be enough for that. Yet we have one person who says, 'I need another $8,000 of travel allowance over and above that for which I am entitled.'",91
356,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"No, we are not talking about travel allowance.",92
357,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"That is an amount it would take that child-care worker 20 weeks to earn. Mr Brough- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have been stunned by your patience tonight and the latitude that you have allowed numerous speakers. You have four times tonight referred this speaker to relevance. My question to you is",92
358,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,You are not asking me a question; you are raising a point of order. Mr Brough-My point of order is: how many times will he be brought back to the question or is he going to continue to be able to flout your rulings? Mrs Crosio-That is a statement. Mr Brough-It is a good one too.,92
359,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I thank the honourable member for Longman for hisMrs Crosio-It's not a point of order.,92
360,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I do not need the assistance of the member for Prospect either. I thank the honourable member for Longman. I would say to him and to others that the trail of points of order are not really helping. I now ask the honourable member for Canberra to give heed for the last time, before I sit him down, to speak about child care.",92
361,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"I was speaking very directly about child care. I was speaking about the 20 weeks of salary of a worker in child care-it is a very fundamental child-care question-or the whole year of adult childcare fees-$8,500-that would amount to the same as the amount that was claimed for travel allowance by the minister, over and above the proper entitlement. One whole year of child-care fees-a massive distortion of priorities! When the people of Australia are called upon to assess a government, one of the things you would think they might assess is how its actions reflect the priorities which it sets. One of the actions is the standards.it applies to itself and the standards it applies to others. We have in this bill, in the context in which it is being debated, a very serious, sad and profound example of double standards which I think would appal the peopleÂ· ()f Australia. I think they would be seriously, grievously concerned about the fact that, on the same day, a bill is being brought into this House in the context of a whole program of calculated attacks and cutbacks in child care and of fees in community owned centres increasing by $18 per child place per week. In four states the weekly fee for one child in full-time care is $170 or more. We heard on the news tonight that child care is costing more than private schools in some states and in some circumstances. More than four families in each centre are having to reduce their hours or have left the centre. More than 25 per cent of centres have had to reduce their staff, costing more jobs in Australia. Seventy-four per cent of parents are exiting care, citing increased fees as the reason. Sixty-seven per cent of families are leaving centres to use informal care, at great risk to those children. Seventy-six per cent of parents are reporting that their fees are due to increase again before the end of this year. All those points establish that a very serious situation is confronting our child-care centres, a situation of massive cuts to fundingmassive, unfair, unreasonable and continuing cuts. Upon measuring that, you see that that is the priority the government applies to the people of Australia in need: cuts, increases in fees and denial of access. The standard it applies to itself is largesse. It says, 'Don't worry what the law says, just apply. If you get caught out, we'll come into the parliament and cover it up. We will come into the parliament-'",92
362,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"No, we are not talking about cover-ups, the member for Canberra; we are talking about child care.",92
363,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"I agree that we are, Mr Deputy Speaker. The contrast is stark. If one individual were to claim child-care support they were not entitled to, they would be attacked by this government for fraud. They would be in court. The government would be chasing their money back. Nobody would be coming in here trying to cover that up. They would be out there saying, 'This person is a welfare cheat; they took $45 they were not entitled to.' What do they say about someone who takes $8,000? Nothing. They try to tell this House it did not happen. This is a contrast and a contradiction that the Australian people should not have to put up with for one minute more. It is totally unfair, unreasonable and improper. We have 47 nights of mistakes in travel allowanceover $8,000-and no one individual",92

375,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Forget the metaphor, stay with the bill.",93
376,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"Metaphors are relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have a circumstance where a government of monumental selfindulgence is imposing great pain upon Australian people, upon the constituents of all the honourable members here.

He was concerned at seeing that in his electorate, as in mine and the electorate of the member for Denison, people were losing their rights as citizens in child-care services, as in other services. This is but a microcosm of the cuts that are happening across Australia. Yet at the same time he, like us, would have been appalled to see that the government is dishing out money to itself, dishing out money to its own members.

381,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjoum. Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek  to report tonight on a meeting I attended on Sunday at Bowman Hall. This was a rally of people against Badgerys Creek airport. There has already been extensive coverage of the wide number of people who attended this meeting organised by Charlie Lowles, the Mayor of Blacktown City Council. It was also attended by quite a number of other surrounding mayors, by two state ministers and by my federal colleague the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield). I undertook at that meeting to bring back a message to the parliament: the unanimous, overwhelming view of the many hundreds, if not thousands, of people who attended that meeting that they did not want an airport at Badgerys Creek. Indeed, they did not want an airport in the Sydney Basin. In particular, they were not in favour of option B. Those Liberal ministers and backbenchers who favour option B should clearly hear that message. They were not in favour of option A, nor of option C. And why would they be? The summary EIS that was released by Minister Sharp-how long will he be the minister?-is very deficient. It ignores serious implications with regard to the air we breathe, endangered and vulnerable flora and fauna, and noise. I thought the most poignant point made at that meeting was that 63 schools will be adversely affected by this airport-under any option. If honourable members opposite do not care about that, that translates to 30,000 students. That is a very conservative figure. In the western suburbs of Sydney, we understand that we suffer from educational disadvantage already. This airport will only add to that educational disadvantage. In terms of the information provided in the EIS, no information was provided as to how the noise levels will vary during one day or even seasonally for different climatic conditions or even operational conditions. The only conclusion to be drawn from these averages is that for at least 50 per cent of the year tens of thousands of residents of western Sydney who thought they would not be affected by aircraft noise will be. In this EIS, the minister is using the Australian noise exposure concept methodology. This is the very methodology which was used in the third runway debacle and which was completely discredited and criticised. The very same methodology is being used in the Badgerys Creek EIS summary that was released by the minister. If members opposite are not concerned about endangered plant species, let me say that 31 species are vulnerable in western Sydney and will be affected by this airport. Even the Commonwealth's own national environment protection measure standards for fine particle pollution are ignored in the EIS. Government members-Ah!  but it is well known that residents and children in western Sydney suffer disproportionately from asthma. If you ignore fine particle pollution, all you are doing is increasing the propensity of children in western suburbs to contract asthma or to have an even worse case of asthma than they currently have. The EIS also ignores the importance of ozone as a regional issue in western Sydney and ignores any attempts to reduce ozone levels in western Sydney. The clear message is that the people of western Sydney do not want the airport. They have resolved to fight, and fight it we will. (Time expired) Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek",94
382,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"It is fortuitous that the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) is in the chamber at this moment because he is the person most responsible for Badgerys Creek airport. It is about time that the member for  pect (Mrs Crosio) faced up to the fact that the existing policy of the Australian Labor Party is to support Badgerys Creek. How can you sit there and shake your heads when you have the member for Kingsford-Smith, who was the person responsible for Badgerys Creek, walking out of the chamber? You have been sold out by your own party. You are not prepared toÂ· front the facts that the hands of the Australian Labor Party are all over Badgerys Creek. The absolute hypocrisy of the ALP in this instance",94
383,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,It's breathtaking.,95
384,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"It is breathtaking. The Badgerys Creek option is going to provide 63,000 jobs in western Sydney-63,000 jobs that did not exist under the Labor Party; 63,000 jobs that will provide opportunities for the people of western Sydney. I want to know what the real position of the Labor Party is. Is it the position that Bob Carr has adopted, which seems to flip-flop? On 25 March 1995, on the night of the state election, Bob Carr pledged on television in black and white-for those people who do not have colour televisions-that the Australian Labor Party would deliver to the people of Sydney the Badgerys Creek airport option. Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, said that. Yet more recently we have had the New South Wales planning minister, Craig Knowles, come out and say , 'Well, the Labor Party has never been really committed to Badgerys Creek.' But that is hypocrisy only at a state level. Let us find out how the members for Chifley and Prospect squirm at the fact that the existing policy of the Australexplain Ian Labor Party is to support Badgerys Creek. Before the last federal election, the Australmembers Ian Labor Party went to the people of western Sydney and said, 'No, we are not even going to have another EIS, we just want to build Badgerys Creek.' The member for Kingsford Smith, the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, were out there promoting to the people of western Sydney and to the people inÂ· the Sydney basin the prospect of having the second international airport at Badgerys Creek. In fact, they said they had started work and that they had spent $360 million on Badgerys Creek.",95
385,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"What have they done with it? Mr HOCKEy-It has the most expensive signage in Australia's history-there is a $360 million sign saying, 'We are going to build an airport here.'",95
386,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,I suppose the MUA are mates with the signwriters.,95
387,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"It must have been the MUA that was doing the signwriting at the time. But it goes one step further. As soon as the Liberal Party went to the people of Sydney and promised that we would have a second international airport but said that, just in case, we would have a second EIS on Badgerys Creek, the Labor Party said, 'What a great idea. We will take that idea but we are still going to build Badgerys Creek.' The Labor Party have said that when the heat is turned on, but this is after having made numerous promises to the people of Sydney that they would build Badgerys Creek. They announced it in 1985 but, in fact, the original proposal goes back to the 1970s. As Alan Ramsay revealed quite bluntly in the Sydney Morning Herald some time ago, 'The ALP has announced on numerous occasions that it was going to commit to the second international airport at Badgerys Creek.' The member for Prospect stands up here and waffles on with the gross hypocrisy that is typical of someone who is flip-flopping between airports and flip-flopping between policies on airports. How is she going to to the October meeting of the Labor Party that she wants a change to a policy that has been in existence for some years? The for Prospect and Chifley have been promoting western Sydney for years, but now they are going to try to flip-flop back in the interests of self-gratification. At the end of the day, the people of western Sydney are the big losers because the Labor Party is lying, lying and lying again. Minister for Transport and Regional Development: Travelling Allowance",95
388,Mr ANDREN,ADJOURNMENT,"Calare) (10.40 p.m.)Tonight I have witnessed a piece of breathtaking hypocrisy by both government and opposition in this House as the government tried to prevent debate and the opposition tried to exploit the story that broke just five hours ago on the repayment of travel allowances by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). I say 'hypocrisy' because both sides of this House are guilty of exploitRepresentatives ing the rorts and perks available to members. Mr Sharp has paid back almost $9,000. I wonder whether other members are prepared to do the same for the spurious overseas trips that have been taken by many members in this parliament and ones before that serve absolutely no good purpose for the Australian electorate. We have members of the now opposition who were party to the paying back of travel allowances by a member of their own party a decade and a half ago-something not revealed until many years later-and now they claim a cover-up from a minister of another government. Yes, we probably have had a cover-up. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) should explain to this House why an apparent special arrangement was made for a minister of the Crown to pay back an overclaimed amount, and I would like to know how those claims could have been made given the diary that a minister must have of his movements. But the irony of all this is that, unless the transport minister had drawn attention to the overpayment, nothing that the administrative services minister's special investigators could have found out--or even the FBI--could have detected those overpayments, even under the allegedly tighter system put in place in May this year to supposedly make members' entitlements more accountable. Why? Because the minister uses a car to travel between his home base and Canberra-as do 1. There is no way of cross checking travel and accommodation at the Sunday evening or Thursday evening end of a sitting week. The system relies on the good intent, the honesty and, it now seems, the memory of members. That is just not good enough nor is it the accountability the public demands. So let us not stand up here in the sort of pious exhibition of self righteousness that we have seen tonight, desperately scrambling to reach the higher moral ground, because the public knows the system is rotten-that in itself it is a cover-up-and they demand changes. Let us not. forget that, if Senator Colston had not, to use the phrase, ratted on his colleagues, none of this would have happened. I asked in March that the House of travel allowances be tabled in the interests of consistency and fairnessfairness to Senator Colston and Senator Woods-and so they were at the end of May, disgracefully, for the very firsttime. I know there are many members on both sides of the House concerned at the looseness of the system and the lack of accountability. They feel they are being tarred with the same brush, and so we are. The public out there just becomes more and more cynical, especially when it appears no attempt has been made to explain that a repayment was made because a mistake occurred and an apology offered. No, like the child we are trying to impress with our leadership, we hide the error and hope we are not found out and, when we are inevitably found out, the damage is so much the worse for us all. It is not only the travel allowances that is of concern to the public, it is also the trips during a first term, the three-yearly junkets and the lack of public accountability for most of it which gets up the nose of the battlers out there that each party pretends to lay claim to. It just happens that one Ted Mack spoke at a dinner I held in Orange recently. Let the parliamentary ghost of the former parliament's conscience echo around this chamber tonight as I quote from that speech. Mr Mack said: In the last 10 years while calling for the community to reform, tighten their belts, to get rid of inefficient management and work practices, government has simultaneously expanded enormously as have the salaries, perks and lurks of politicians and senior bureaucrats. The expansion has almost been in proportion to rising unemployment and mirrored the increasing disparity between rich and poor. In the recent federal Budget most items were reduced or increased only slightly ... except for one item, the cost of running federal Parliament. It jumped by 12 per cent or 50 million dollars. Federal Parliament at a cost of over 3 million dollars a day is the most expensive and unwatched program in history. I . only wish, Mr Speaker, that parliament tonight had been the most watched in Australia. Then the battlers could have seen the sanctimonious self-justification on the one hand and the desperate avoidance of accountability on the other that passes for party politics in this country. Mother Teresa of Calcutta .Dh.ma, Princess of Wales",95
389,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to pay tribute to the lives of two remarkable women who passed away earlier this. month. The first was born on 27 August 1910 at Skopje in what was then Yugoslavia, now the capital of Macedonia. The youngest of three children to Albanian parents, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu was later to become Mother Teresa. At 12 she wanted to become a nun and at 18 she travelled to Ireland and joined the Order of Loreto. A year later she travelled from Ireland to India and joined a convent school in Calcutta, where she worked as a teacher, mainly of geography. In 1937 after taking her final vows she became headmistress of St Mary's School there. In 1948 after a calling two she elected to devote her life to the poor. She left her order, became an Indian citizen and in 1950, after receiving permission, founded the Missionaries of Charity. That became international in 1965. Today, 5,000 sisters, 500 brothers and four million lay workers continue her work throughout the world in 500 orphanages, in leprosy homes and in rescue centres in over 100 countries on five continents. She took the usual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, to which she added 'to put oneself entirely and wholeheartedly at the free service of the poor'. She became a living god to millions of Indians. In Calcutta alone her work feeds 500,000 families a year and her schools teach 20,000 slum children. Her clinics treat 90,000 lepers, and more than 27,000 people who might have died on the streets unnoticed have at least met a dignified end to their lives because of her work. She said that the 'worse poverty of all was to reject a human soul in need'. Most nights she went to sleep about midnight. She would rise at 4 a.m. to wash in a bucket in her small room before praying and having a meagre diet of dhal and rice. She gave away the habit for the sari and sandalsthe blue-bordered sari which became her trademark and the trademark of her order. She insisted that, of the moneys that were donated to her, not more than two per cent should be spent on administration. The sisters in her order could have only two saris-one to wear and one to wash. 'To be able to love the poor and know the poor we must be poor ourselves,' she said. Her work became a symbol for what the rest of us aspire to. The unexpected death of the other woman I wish to mention touched the hearts of many millions around the world. On her death the world displayed the most amazIng outpouring of sorrow on the death of an individual that possibly the world has ever seen. I talk, of course, of Diana, Princess of Wales. For all her faults and foibles-and, boy, she did have a lot of them, like most of the rest of us here-she was nevertheless a very modem woman who was very much in touch with, and she related to, all the strata of society, years earlier especially young women. Although she came from the opposite end of the social spectrum to Mother Teresa, Diana also embraced a number of unfashionable causes. She was genuinely interested in the poor and disadvantaged children, but she pioneered the acceptance by society of HIV victims, drug addicts and lepers and she took up the cause to rid the world of landmines. Because she was such a high profile person, her acceptance and championing of these causes gave them a respectability and a focus that nobody else could do. Her sincerity, genuine interest and love shone through in the attention she gave to the victims and unfortunates that she met when devoting her time to these causes. When you combine her caring with her much admired duties as a mother and the fact that she was arguably the most photogenic female the world has ever known, you have a recipe for a legend. Her life was one of a vividly coloured flower amongst a mass of late autumnal browns and greys. She was a comet in a sky of stationary stars. Onr hearts go out to her sons, William and Harry. The world has been enriched by the lives of both Diana and Mother Teresa, who became firm friends in the common cause that they had in so many of these issues. The world is impoverished by the passing of these two women, but the legacy of them will live on in their good works. (Time expired) Minister for Transport and Regional Development: Travelling Allowance",97
390,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this debate on the adjournment to object most strenuously to a statement that was tabled in this House at 8 p.m. tonight by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull). In that statement it was brought to the notice of this House that on 29 May the minister had tabled details of travelling allowances. Yet it took him from 29 May until 23 September to come in and say that two ministers had included corrections and now he was notifying the House. I believe that that is the most shameful, fraudulent way to cover up a minister or any other member-it does not matter on which side of the parliament he or she sits-taking money from this House. Can you tell me of any member of this House or of the general public that in the last 10 months had $900 extra in their bank account and said, 'Excuse me, dear, it's just $900 more I have taken from the government. Oops! I had better give itÂ· back' ? I ask this House, the Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Sharp (he may be Sharp by name but not sharp by nature): would Minister Sharp have brought this forward, would he have paid that back, if it had not been for the Bulletin story that is going to appear tomorrow under Laurie Oakes's headline? What is fact in that story is that $8,740 returned to this parliament. What is fact is that Minister Sharp claimed $29,205 for 144 l!ights. What is fact is that he had to shamefully reduce that to 97 nights and cut off the reminder. What is fact is that he received $900 extra a month over that 10-month period, and yet all of a sudden it was brought to his notice in May that maybe he had made a mistake. What is fact is that when all members of parliament were asked to have their accounts tabled in this House we were all shown copies. What is fact is that previous ministers of another government had asterisks next to their names where they were required to pay money back because they had inadvertently claimed it during an election period when it was not permitted. What is fact is that neither of these ministers- Mr Jull has named only one of them-has come into this House with any asterisk next to their name. What is fact is the shameful, fraudulent cover-up that this House has experienced in the debate and in the procedure tonight. All it required of Minister Sharp was an apology. All it required was for the man to be man enough to stand up in this House and say, 'I am sorry. It has been brought to my attention that I inadvertently overlooked 47 nights when I was sleeping in bed instead of being here in Canberra.' What is a fact is that he should have got up and been man enough to apologise and say on 29 May, when Minister Jull tabled those reports in this House, 'I have made an error. I have made a blue. I am now going to give you back nearly $9,000.' The way this House carried on tonight when we were debating a child-care bill was one of the most objectionable displays of a shameful lack of integrity by government that I have ever seen. I have been in all forms of government for 25 years and never have I seen anything so blatant as what happened tonight. We saw a minister sneak inhere tonight at 8 p.m. and put down one piece of paper, signed by Mr Jull and dated 23 September. Do you want to see it? I bet you have not even got a copy of it. That was what was slipped into this House tonight. That was was slipped into cover up the facts. The minister is really saying, 'Oops, sorry about that. I know I told you on 29 May that I tabled all the details of the travelling allowances made to ministers, parliamentary secretaries and opposition office holders. Oops, I now wish to advise this House that the statement in respect of two ministers' - one minister named, Minister Sharp; the other one we are running a book on, by the way'included corrections made by them to ensure the record accurately reflected travel undertaken.' He never even had the guts to read it out. He just came in and left it on the table and said, 'That's what we're doing.' Then we had a debate demanding that the minister come forward so we can clean this House up and see what is going on. That was not permitted. That was not allowed. Everyone ran for cover. It is about time that had some guts and stood up to be counted. It is true what the member for Calare (Mr Andren) said: we all get tarnished with the same brush. If we want to be respected in the community, we have to show respect to this parliament, we have to respect the laws of this parliament and we have to have ministers in executive government who are honest and scrupulous in their dealings. The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) talked about what Sharp is supposed to be doing with Badgerys Creek. God help the people of Western Sydney; he cannot even get his bookkeeping right. He cannot even pay and claim the money correctly, yet he is going to be directing Badgerys Creek airport and the EIS. All I can say is that no-one has ever experienced the sleazy, slimy way in which the Minister for Administrative Services put this to us, which, by the way, was only brought to his notice because probably the one DAS worker still left working in the public service put out a memo saying, 'Excuse me, we haven't been paid back the money from Minister Sharp. Is someone going to claim it back from him?' If it was not for that, we would not have even had this claim tonight. We would not have had this claim tonight if not for the fact that tomorrow in the Bulletin Laurie Oakes will state clear and wide how this member was such a fraud. (Time expired) Taxation: Exemptions for Charitable Organisations",98
391,Mr MUTCH,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise concern about the ability of people behind bogus organisations to utilise a major loophole in our laws to claim exemption from taxes and other charges on the basis of religious and/or charitable exemptions. There are many organisations pursuing altruistic activities which are to be applauded and encouraged. These include genuine religions which have been the driving force behind much beneficial and benevolent activity, including the propagation of values, the education of children, caring for the sick and elderly and other activities. In an academic paper published in 1990 entitled Leap of faith: religious freedom in you all Australia, the current Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Chris Sidoti, said: Religious organisations receive significant indirect financial support . . . through their tax exempt status worth tens of millions of dollars annually which represents subsidies by Australia's governments for religious activities provided to groups which meet the High Court's definition of religion. The High Court's definition of religion was set out in the case of the Church of the New Faith v. The Commissioner for Payroll Tax in Victoria. It is a very general definition referring to any belief in a supernatural being, thing or principle and the acceptance of canons of conduct to give effect to that belief. In 1984, in response to a question from Senator Hamer about the availability of tax benefits for religions, Senator Walsh answered that, legally, the advancement of religion is a charitable activity. A 1996 tax office document entitled The Club Pack states: The word charitable has a technical, legal meaning ... an organisation will be considered charitable only if it its main purpose falls within one of the following: 1. Relief of poverty; 2. The advancement of education; 3. The advancement of religion; and 4. Other purposes beneficial to the community. The same document states: Charitable institutions for the advancement of religion include: Organisations established to build and maintain a building of worship, and Organisations established to provide stipends to the clergy. These criteria for eligibility for tax benefits are both very general and easily satisfied. I am concerned that the Commonwealth is losing significant revenues and is, indeed, in some cases indirectly subsidising the activities of many dubious organisations with dubious offshoots that are, in fact, the antithesis of religion and are doing great harm. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) detailed one charlatan's financial manoeuvres in this place on 12 February this year, and I commend him for it. This was one Neil Thomas of the so-called Grace Church. Another example of this kind of fraud appeared in an extensive article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 24 December 1993 entitled 'Prophet and loss: how an Australian cult leader duped the faithful'. It concerned one William Kamm, who calls himself 'the Little Pebble' - a chip off the old block of St. Peter. The Herald detailed how Kamm's allegedly non-profit public company required members to hand over all their money and property, received donations from around the world channelled into numerous bank accounts and required members to make regular and onerous contributions to his cause out of their income. On 8 November 1983 Senator Zakharov referred to the decision of theÂ· Church of the New Faith and asked Senator Evans whether the judgment extended the ability of individuals or groups to claim religious status as a means of avoiding payment of rates and taxes as a means of circumventing legislation which otherwise would limit their activities. In his reply, Senator Evans said: It is clear from the ... judgment that bodies which are no more than hoaxes or parodies of religion will not be regarded as religious bodies. He went on to say: What exemptions from taxes should be granted to religious bodies is a matter for decisions by ments, both federal and state. The Neil Thomas and 'Little Pebble' examples demonstrate that no government has come to grips with this question of hoaxes and parodies of religion and, as a result, many people and organisations have been financially devastated. These frauds have found religion to be the perfect cloak for their activities. To my knowledge, this issue has not been canvassed in the parliament since Senator Evans replied to those questions in 1983. In the meantime, I believe that the number of bodies in Australia claiming to be religious has increased dramatically. I believe it is time to take stock of the situation to see whether the fairly relaxed position that was evidenced in the early 1980s can still be justified. If there is a way to distinguish these organisations whose principal aim is to make money by posing as a religion, we need to find it. If a tightening of the criteria for eligibility is a possible route, we need to explore that route. I call upon the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to cause these issues to be fully investigated. I will also refer this issue to the taxation task force.",99

Mr Costello--The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: . (1) Neither the Treasurer, the Prime Minister nor any other individual is able to grant a temporary tax exemption to individuals, businesses or organisations. The taxation legislation does not make any provision for temporary tax exemptions to be granted or contain any discretion regarding temporary tax exemptions. The sales tax law must be amended to grant further exemptions. (2) If the question is referring to temporary exemptions, then none were granted, given the answer to (1). (3) The sales tax law provides specific exemptions for certain goods, certain organisations and specific types of organisations. The sales tax system is one of self assessment. Detailed information about the use made of these exemptions is not readily available. The Government and the Australian Taxation Office also receive requests for the existing exemptions to be extended. These are generally considered by the Government as part of the Budgetary process and therefore this information is not available. Aboriginal Sites: Proposed Holsworthy (Question No. 1600)  representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 26 March 1997: (1) Is the area under consideration for an airport at Holsworthy, NSW, rich in Aboriginal archaeological sites; if so, what are the details of the sites.

Essendon Airport: Flight Path Changes (Question No. 1665) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Have changes been made to flight paths in the vicinity of (a) Tullamarine and (b) Essendon Airports since 1 January 1997; if so, (i) what are the details and (ii) why. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised by Airservices Australia that no changes have been made to flight paths for aircraft departing from and arriving at Essendon Airport this year. Increase in Gross PAYE Gross PAYE Gross PAYE Increase in revenue in revenue in as a proportion 1996-97 dol- 1996-97 dol- Total ATO of total ATO lars(4) lars(5) revenue(6) revenue(7) $m % $m % $m % 49,116 73,421 59.6 3.7 50,435 2.7 74,727 60.8 3.9 51,457 2.0 78,086 60.4 8.6 54,163 5.3 88,306 58.0 10.5 57,439 6.0 98,620 57.4 I am also advised by Airservices Australia that a number of modifications were made on 24 April 1997 to flight paths for aircraft departing from and arriving at Tullamarine Airport for safety and operational reasons. Details of the changes, and the reasons for them, are as follows. (1) Standard Instrument Departure (SID) for aircraft departing to the north from Runway 34 for Perth: Aircraft departing on this SID now tum left one nautical mile, rather than the previous five nautical miles, north of Tullamarine Airport and track south, rather than north, of Sunbury. The modification to the track was made for operational reasons to improve air traffic control coordination. (2) Standard Instrument Departure for aircraft departing to the north from Runway 34 for destinations to the north-east and south-east: From 24 April 1997 aircraft departing on this SID turned 30Â° to the right after passing 1,500 feet on climb and after passing the northern end of the runway. These aircraft previously maintained runway heading until approximately six nautical miles north of the airport. The modification to the track was made to enhance safety by minimising the potential for conflict between departing and arriving aircraft. A secondary benefit flowing from this change is an increase in the traffic handling capacity of the runway by allowing less distance between some consecutive departures. Airservices Australia has since introduced a further minor modification to this track to avoid overflight of Oaklands Junction by departing aircraft. Aircraft are now required to maintain runway heading until two nautical miles north of the airport before commencing the tum. (3) Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) for aircraft arriving from the north to land from the east on Runway 27: Aircraft arriving from the north on this STAR now tum onto an easterly heading approximately six nautical miles north of Tullamarine Airport. Previously aircraft arriving on this STAR turned onto a south-easterly heading approximately ten nautical miles north of the airport. The modification to the track was made to enhance safety by minimising the potential for conflict between aircraft tracking to join the final approach to runway 27 and aircraft already on the final landing approach. (4) Standard Terminal Arrival Route for aircraft arriving from the west to land from the east on Runway 27: Aircraft arriving from the west on this STAR previously took up an easterly heading from overhead Essendon Airport before turning left to intercept the approach path to runway 27. The modified track takes aircraft approximately 1.5 nautical miles south of Essendon Airport on an easterly heading before turning left onto a longer track to join the final landing approach to runway 27. The modification was made to allow aircraft to intercept the final approach path on a normal rate of tum compared with the previous, tighter tum. Public Hospitals: Victoria (Question No. 1669) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Year (at 30 June) 1997 1996 1995 1994 (1) Excludes day hospital facilities. (2) The Commonwealth does not hold this data. Responsibility for the planning and provision of public hospital services, including the staffing of public hospital facilities, Month and Year January 1997 January 1996 July 1995 July 1994 (1) Is he able to say how many beds were available in Victorian public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994. (2) Is he able to say how many staff were employed in Victorian public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994. (3) Is he also able to say how many persons were waiting for surgery in Victorian public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994. (4) Is the number of beds available in Victorian public hospitals at an acceptable level with regard to the Medicare agreement between the Federal and Victorian Governments. (5) How many beds does the Victorian Government need to make available for it not to be in breach of the Medicare agreement. (6) What are the minimum conditions that the Victorian Government must achieve with regard to the provision of public health services to meet the requirements of the Medicare agreement.",103
395,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Available bed numbers in recognised public hospitals under the Medicare Agreements are supplied to the Commonwealth by State and Territory health authorities. The following table shows bed numbers supplied by Victorian Department of Human Services. Available recognised public hospital beds (1) in Victoria not available 12,287 12,332 12,154 is vested in the State and Territory Governments. (3) The Victorian Department of Human Services publication the Hospital Services Report includes the following waiting list numbers for 1994 to 1997. Total number (1) of Patients on Victorian Waiting List (2) 29,291 29,656 28,187 24,271 (I) This includes patients in all three waiting list categories, urgent, semi urgent and non urgent. (2) The Victorian Hospital Services Report (1995-1997 editions) warns that the data needs to be interpreted with care and in the context of the complexity of the health care system. However, it should be noted that waiting lists are a poor indicator of hospital and health system performance which do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of problems relating to access to elective surgery. Many hospital admissions, including elective admissions, occur without the patient ever being on a waiting list. This is particularly the case in Victoria. Some period of waiting may be appropriate, depending on the clinical urgency of the case: As at: Number 1 July 1993 1 January 1996 1 January 1997 1 April 1997 (1) The Victorian Hospital Services Report (1995-97 editions) warn that the data needs to be interpreted with care and in the context of the health care system. On the basis of this information Victoria has effectively eliminated the need for anyone to wait longer than appropriate for 'urgent elective surgery' and has significantly reducing the need for patients requiring 'semi urgent elective surgery' to wait longer than ideal. (4-5) The Medicare Agreements do not stipulate public hospital beds numbers and do not link funding to the number of public hospital beds. Rather, funding is provided to the States who, under the terms of the Medicare Agreements, agree to ensure that eligible persons have access to a comprehensive range of inpatient, outpatient and accident and emergency services free of charge in both metropolitan and rural areas on the basis of clinical need. The only funding under the Agreements which is directly related to activity levels is, as previously mentioned, some bonus funding which is linked to: levels of public inpatient activity; waiting times for elective surgery; levels of outpatient activity; and waiting times for accident and emergency services. waiting lists provide a mechanism for scheduling admissions so that the most urgent cases are treated first; and the clinical urgency of cases on the waiting lists is therefore more critical than the number of cases. Because of these factors, it is accepted by both Commonwealth and State and Territory health authorities that it is more appropriate to focus on admitting people to hospital within clinically appropriate times than on the number of people waiting at any point in time. The Commonwealth, States and Territories have agreed a national definition for the clinically appropriate waiting time for elective surgery: 30 days for urgent cases (ie category 1) and 90 days for semi-urgent cases (ie category 2). The Victorian Department of Human Services publication the Hospital Services Report (1) includes the Number of People Who are on the Waiting List Who Wait Longer than the Ideal: Urgent Cases Waiting over 30 days Semi Urgent Cases Waiting over 90 days Percentage Number Percentage 911 67% 5569 48% 1 >1% 3860 40% 2 >1% 3598 41% 0 >1% 3083 38% (6) There is a range of other detailed provisions contained within the Medicare Agreements and a copy of the Agreement has been made available to the honourable member. Apart from the bonus funding arrangements mentioned in (3) above, the previous Government did not link funding to specific outcomes or performance targets. Proposed National Drug Summit (Question No. 1697) Mrs Crosio asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments made by the head of the NSW Royal Commission into the Police Service, Mr James Wood, that in order to combat the illicit drug trade and sever its corruptive power over police, a fresh, national and co-operative strategy was needed to devise innovative and far-reaching methods of dealing with the problem; if not, will he acquaint himself with the comments. (2) Will he discuss with the Prime Minister and Minister for Health and Family Services convening a National Drug Summit featuring State and Territory Health Ministers and Attorneys-General, police and judicial authorities, experts in the field of drug and heroin dependency, and representatives from social welfare and religious bodies in order to discuss new approaches to obtaining a national solution to the heroin problem; if not, why not. (3) Is he able to say whether the Federal Government would be required to withdraw from an international treaty prohibiting the legalisation of heroin if a State or Territory government was to legislate to allow for any degree of heroin legalisation; if so, (a) which treaty, (b) when did Australia become a signatory to the treaty and (c) what steps would the Federal Government have to take in order to withdraw the Commonwealth's participation in the treaty. (4) Is he able to provide an estimate of (a) how many and (b) what percentage of, persons currently incarcerated in Australian correctional facilities are imprisoned because they committed a crime which was in some way drug related. (5) Is he able to say what is the total estimated cost of keeping those persons referred to in part (4) incarcerated each year. (6) Is he also able to say when and why the (a) use, (b) possession and (c) trade of heroin was illegal is Australia. (7) Does the Federal Government condone the partial or full legalisation of heroin by State or Territory governments; if so, why; if not, why not. (8) Did the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in 1988 conclude that (a) Australian law enforcement agencies had not succeeded in preventing the supply of illicit drugs to Australian markets, and that it was unrealistic to expect them to do so and (b) considering the failure of policies regarding the prohibition of illicit drugs that it was time to give serious consideration to the alternatives, however radical they may seem; if so, does the Government support the conclusions; if not, why not. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows (1) Yes, my attention has been drawn to Mr Justice Wood's comments. (2) The Government has an open mind on the value of a national drug summit. There are a number of initiatives currently in hand including the recently announced Prime Minister's Task Force to review the problem of illicit drugs. The Task Force will examine both supply and control and demand reduction issues including better allocation of federal resources, border controls, domestic law enforcement, community drug education and programs for users. It will report to the Government in September. In addition, the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy agreed at its 31 July 1997 meeting at Cairns that it would hold an extraordinary meeting in November over two days to review, inter alia, the national drug strategic framework and the progress of the National Expert Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs. MCDS will receive a report on the development of a national heroin supply reduction strategy which is being prepared by the Senior Officers' Group of the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. In the course of this work, the members of that group will be consulting with appropriate agencies and groups including the National Drug Strategy Committee. All States and Territories have agreed that prior to the November meeting they will conduct consultations with key stakeholders and individual experts to allow them an opportunity to provide expert and community input to the meeting. I believe this process will provide an excellent opportunity for community groups to put forward their views, and to have those views presented to Ministers in a focused way in November. (3) (a) Any legislation relaxing the law concerning the use of heroin would need to come within the ""medical and scientific purposes"" exception in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 (the Convention). Article 4 of the Convention is the general obligations article and requires parties to take the necessary and administrative measures to give effect to the Convention. Article 4(c) requires parties to the Convention to limit the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs of drugs to medical and scientific purposes. (b) The Convention came into force for Australia on 8 August 1975. (c) Australia would not need to take any steps to withdraw. from the Convention so long as any relaxation of the law concerning the use of heroin complies with the ""medical and scientific purposes"" of the Convention. Denunciation is effected by notice to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and takes effect at a specified time thereafter. (4) This information is not available in precisely the form in which it is sought. A 1997 report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)' indicates that (a) of the 15,429 sentenced prisoners in prison throughout Australia on 30 June 1995 (National Prison Census Day-the latest data available), 1,694 were imprisoned for an offence or offences, the most serious of which related to illicit drugs 2 . (b) According to the same report, this represented 11.1 per cent of all sentenced prisoners on that day. (5) On the basis of an estimate by the Australian Institute of Criminology that it costs an average of $51,000 per year to maintain a prisoner in a penal institution in Australia, and assuming that the number of prisoners incarcerated for drug offences remains unchanged throughout the year,Â· it is possible to arrive at a total of $86,394,000 per year. It is not, however, known how representative the prisoner total may have been on Census Day 1995. (6) In response to international concerns regarding the high rates of importation of diacetylmorphine (heroin) into Australia3, the Commonwealth in 1953, by regulation, banned the importation of heroin. Within 12 months, all States had legislation to ban the possession, use, sale and manufacture of heroin. (7) The Government believes that Australia should conform to its treaty obligations. Any Federal, State or Territory. legislation relaxing the law concerning the use of heroin would need to come within the ""medical and scientific purposes"" exception in the Convention. (8) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. The Prime Minister's announcement of a Task Force of Commonwealth agencies to review the problem of illicit drugs will examine supply control and demand reduction issues. In addition, work is progressing in preparation for an extraordinary meeting of the MCDS in November, which will specifically focus on reviewing the national drug strategic framework and the progress of the National Expert Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs. These important initiatives were explained in detail in my answer to question two. I reiterate the words of the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on 25 August 1997, that this Government ""is determined to ensure that there is an effective national effort in combating the menace of illicit drugs"".

Melbourne, May 1997, p22. 2 PossessionlUse of Drugs (140), Dealffraffic in Drugs (1,351), Manufacture/Grow Drugs (194). 3 In 1951 Australia's consumption of diacetylmorphine, at 5,25 kg/million persons, was the highest in the world. Much of this was used in proprietary medicines. Australia's Promises to Children: Report (Question No. 1707) Mr Richard Evans asked the AttomeyGeneral and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) What criteria were used to select persons to prepare the report entitled Australia's promises to children in relation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. (2) What were the terms of reference for the report. (3) What sum did the report cost to prepare. (4) Was an inquiry conducted on the impact of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Australian community; if not, why not. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I understand that Defence for Children International, Australia, approached the previous Government with a request to fund a workshop with relevant non-government organisations and to prepare a non-government organisation report in response to Australia's First Report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.Â· This proposal was supported by a number of non-government organisations involved in children's rights and human rights. (2) I am not aware that there were specific terms of reference for the report. The conditions of the funding provided by the previous Government for the production of the report were to consult with relevant non-government organisations and to prepare a non-government organisation report responding to Australia's First Report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. (3) I am not in a position to detail the actual cost of the production of this report as the report was produced by Defence for Children International, Australia, and not the Government. However, I understand that the previous Government provided $12,000 to Defence for Children International, Australia, as a contribution to consulting with nongovernment organisations, co-ordinating the nongovernment organisation responses and preparing the report. (4) Australia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 17 December 1990 and the Convention entered into force for Australia on 16 January 1991. I am informed that there were consultations on the impact of the Convention with State and Territory Governments before the Convention was ratified. As the honourable member may be aware, the Convention is currently the subject of an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Second Sydney Airport (Question No. 1750) Mrs Vale asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) Is it proposed to locate the new Sydney international airport within the Sydney Basin region; if so, (a) why and (b) is it incongruous with international trends where movement is away from major centres when locating new airports. (2) Are many new airports being built as a necessity due in part to the location of existing airports close to built up regional centres; if so, why does the Government consider that the new airport should be located near a major built up area where it will have an adverse impact on the residents of the whole region. (3) Will the problems experienced at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (KSA) be duplicated when establishing another airport so close to the Sydney metropolitan area; if not, why not. (4) Will the introduction of another major airport within close proximity to large built up areas enhance (a) social and residential life styles and (b) safety both to the flying public and operators and Sydney residential communities; if so, how; if not, why does he advocate the development of the proposed new airport within the Sydney basin. (5) Will increased numbers of aircraft operating within the Sydney Basin area increase pollution levels in excess of international standards. (6) Would locating the next airport away from the SYGney Basin provide an opportunity to both reduce health problems associated with engine emissions and address regional development issues. (7) To what extent do the advent of autonomous approach, landing and departure capabilities, improved all-weather performance of modem aircraft and navigational aids impact upon concerns over adverse weather conditions being a consideration in the location of the new airport. (8) Will a second major airport within close proximity to Sydney residential areas impact directly on (a) air congestion and unrealistic holding times and (b) safety standards and operational tolerances. (9) Is it a fact that Sydney located airports may not always be considered as suitable alternatives for diverted inbound aircraft due to instrument flight rules requirements and changeable weather probabilities; if so, would the development of a regional airport at Goulburn and linking it with a fast train system similar to what has been adopted in Europe (a) address this issue and (b) impact on the heavy aircraft separation problems within the immediate Sydney Basin region. (10) Does he have remedial plans to share the noise around; if so, (a) what and (b) do they include changing flight paths, curfews and slot times. (11) Is it a fact that it is anticipated that year 2010 (a) the proposed new international airport will handle 360 000 aircraft movements per annum and will be encircled by residential development and (b) KSA will be increasing movements in line with international growth predictions; if so, what measures will be necessary to prevent the duplication of noise and air pollution problems currently being experienced at KSA. (12) Will the introduction of another major airport close to Sydney impact on residential suburbs and compound noise and air pollution problems which will need to be remedied within the next 20 to 30 years. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Possible sites for the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek .and the flolsworthy Military Reserve are being examined in the EIS process. (a) Major airports recently built or currently being built at major cities overseas are generally located no more than 50 kilometres from the central business district. (b) There are major disadvantages with locating a second airport at a site which is far removed from the centre of travel demand. The distance would have major adverse implications for travel times, cost and convenience, and connection with Sydney's existing airport. As a consequence, there would be a strong likelihood that passengers and airlines would be unwilling to use the secondÂ· airport thereby further increasing the pressures on Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. For some sites, there would also be very significant costs associated with providing suitable road and rail access and linkages to other support services (such as a fuel line). For these reasons the Government is not considering possible sites outside the Sydney Basin for the second major Sydney airport. (2) The choice of a site for a new airport involves an assessment of a wide range of complex technical, economic and environmental issues. Valuable lessons can be learnt from overseas experience but each city must develop its own solution to reflect the characteristics of the local demand Jor airports, the city's unique geographic circumstances and economic opportunities. (3) The potential environmental impacts of the second Sydney airport will be considered in detail in the EIS. (4) See answers to (1) and (3). (5) See answer to (3). (6) See answers to (1) and (3). (7) Meteorology and airspace management issues are being taken into account in the EIS and will be by the factored into the site selection decision. (8) (a) and (b) Safety standards will not be compromised by the development and operation of the second airport. Airspace management issues are being taken into account in the EIS. (9) (a) and (b) The probability of all airports in the Sydney Basin being closed by freak weather conditions is so low that it certainly could not justify the building of a second airport at Goulbum. In such extreme and unusual weather conditions, aircraft would generally either delay departure, wait in a holding pattern until the weather conditions abated or land at other regional or major airports. (10) (a) and (b) The impact of aircraft noise on the communities surrounding the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy sites will be examined in detail in the EIS. (11) (a) and (b) The proposal is to consider the construction and operation of a second major internationaIldomestic airport for Sydney at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy on a site large enough for future expansion of the airport if required. One option to be considered is the construction and operation of an airport based on two widely spaced parallel runways and supporting facilities capable of handling up to about 360,000 aircraft movements and 30 million passengers per year. A range of scenarios for the growth in patronage at the second airport will be considered in the EIS. (12) An assessment of the impacts of aircraft noise and emissions will be included in the EIS, together with a discussion of the measures which could be used to mitigate the impacts. Kabi Kabi Aboriginal Corporation (Question No. 1801) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 4 June 1997: (1) Is the Kabi Kabi Aboriginal Corporation funded (a) wholly or (b) partly by (i) the Government or (ii) ATSIC; if so, to what extent.

(3) For what purposes is funding used. (4) Are the books of the Corporation audited; if so, at what intervals; if not, why not. (5) Are audited accounts available for each year referred to in part (2). (6) Have all of the accounts been in order; if not, why not. (7) Has the Minister received a copy of a letter, dated 10 April 1997, to Mrs K Hicks, Manager of the Corporation, from me seeking copies of the annual reports of the corporation. (8) Is he able to say whether the Corporation responded by letter dated 14 April 1997 claiming that, in accordance with its constitution, annual reports are not available; if so, does the constitution of the Corporation preclude the availability of annual reports. (9) Are the constitutions of Aboriginal corporations able to preclude the availability of annual reports, if so, why. Dr WOOldridge-The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following information to the honourable member's question: The Kabi Kabi Aboriginal Corporation (the Corporation) is incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (the Act), which is administered by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations.

Further, given the numerous government bodies (at both a Federal and State level) which fund Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Corporations, Australia-Wide, it is not possible to answer this question. Black Economy (Question No. 1818) Mr Barry Jones asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (1) Is he able to provide the comparative estimated size of the black economy in (a) Australia, (b) the UK and (c) New Zealand. (2) Is he also able to say whether material has been published which indicates that the introduction of a goods and services tax has impacted upon the black economy; if so, what. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Estimates of the size of the black economy can vary greatly, depending upon the definition used, and the methodological approach taken. Any estimate is very reliant on the assumptions underlying the analysis. (1) (a) In a recent report from the Cash Economy Task Force it was noted that: ""Currently, there is no official or reliable estimate of the size of the Australian cash economy or the revenue foregone. Academic studies estimate the cash economy to be between 3.5 % and 13.4 % of GDP. Using 1995-96 GDP figures as a base and an effective average tax rate of 23%, these studies suggest that the annual amount of income tax revenue foregone could be between $3.9 billion and $15.1 billion."" (l)(b) Different methodological approaches for measuring the black economy for the UK, using 1970s data, have produced estimates ranging between 2 to 3 per cent of GDP. (l)(c) I am not aware of any published estimate of the size of the underground economy in New Zealand. (2) The extent of the black economy in any country is likely to reflect a number of factors, including the culture and attitude of the population towards paying tax, as well as the nature of the system itself. Addressing the impact of the black economy will involve a range of measures, including consideration of tax base issues. It is not sufficient to look at only one solution to the black economy because focusing on anyone area in isolation would give an incomplete picture. Empirical evidence on the impact of measures to deal with the black economy is subject to considerable uncertainty because of the practical difficulties associated with accurate measurement in this area. However, there are strong conceptual grounds to believe that a broad indirect tax would increase revenue collected from the proceeds of the black economy, compared to an indirect tax levied over a narrower base. International Labour Organisation: Representatives (Question No. 1871) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: On what occasions, in what circumstances and with what results have representations been made to the International Labour Organisation by industrial associations of employers or workers in Australia since 1987. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Since 1987, four formal complaints have been made by industrial associations concerning Australian industrial law and practice and considered by the International Labour Organisation (lLO). Details are set out below. Case No 1415 A complaint was made in 1987 by the Customs Officers' Association of Australia (COA) alleging interference in COA operations, following a restructure of the Australian Customs Service (ACS). This had resulted in the COA not being entitled to represent ACS employees it previously represented. The Committee found that there was no breach of freedom of association. Case No 1511 A complaint was made in 1989 by the International Federation of Airline Pilots Association (lFALPA) on behalf of its Australian affiliate, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP). It arose out of a dispute in the domestic airline industry. The Committee did not find that any breach of freedom of association had occurred. The Committee referred issues concerning the scope of common law liabilities in relation to industrial actionto the ILO' s Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations which sought tax further advice from the Australian Government. The Committee also requested that the then Government to persuade the Airlines involved not to enforce damages awarded against the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and six of its. officers by the Supreme Court of Victoria. No enforcement action has occurred. As requested by the Committee, the Government has kept it informed of developments. The Committee also requested that the then Government seek to persuade the Airlines involved not to enforce damages awarded against the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and six of its officers by the Supreme Court of Victoria. No enforcement action has occurred. As requested by the Committee, the Government has kept it informed of developments. Case No 1559 A complaint was made in 1990 by the then Confederation of Australian Industry about representation requirements under the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The Committee requested that a union not be required to have a minimum membership of 10,000 members or to demonstrate special circumstances to be registered under the federal system. The relevant legislation was amended to comply with the Committee's request. Case No 1774 A complaint was made in 1994 by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry which was withdrawn in March 1996 The details have not therefore been published. Other representations The ILO does not have any formal mechanism for notifying governments when informal representations are made by industrial associations of employers or workers. It is therefore not possible to advise how many such representations have been made. Details follow of those of which the Government is aware. The then Department of Industrial Relations received a letter dated 10 June 1997 from the International Labour Office advising of representations made by the ACTU concerning the Western Australian Labour Relations Legislation Amendment Bill and setting out some informal comments. The Department also received advice from the International Labour Office in a letter dated 27 August 1997 of representations made by the ACTU about certain provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. This matter is to be referred to the LO's Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. Reconciliation Convention (Question No. 1879) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide assistance for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne in May 1997; if so what. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No assistance was provided from my Department or agencies within my portfolio for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne. Fuel Oil: Definition (Question No. 1896) Mr Campbell asked the then Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: What are the specifications used in the definition of fuel oil that would be dutiable at 7.2 cents per litre. Mr MCGauran-The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: i) topical anti-inflammatories topical anti-fungals ii) antispasmodics iii) anti-diarrhoeals iv) anti-emetics (2) (a & b) Actual or projected The provisions covering the specifications of fuel oil are contained in subsections 3(4) and 3(5) of the Excise Tariff Act 1921.

Greenhouse Gases (Question No. 1966) Mr Barry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 June 1997: (1) Did he raise the issue of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions in his June 1997 discussions with Prime Minister Blair in London and President Clinton in Washington to seek support for a differential target. (2) Is the issue high on his political and economic agenda. (3) Was an international Earth Summit held in New York in June under the auspices of the UN to consider the issue of setting binding national targets for greenhouse gas emissions; if so, did more than 100 heads of government, including Prime Minister Blair and President Clinton, attend the Earth Summit. (4) Did his itinerary, after his commitments in London, mean that he arrived in the USA the day after the Earth Summit ended. (5) Did he give consideration to attending the Earth Summit to press his case; if not, why not.",115
398,Mr HOWARD,PSS BOARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. Card Holders by Age and Sex Gold Card White Card PCC Card Total Female Male Total Female Male Total 103 1 32 33 12 0 12 5,910 1,497 19,829 21,326 4,405 2,745 7,150 5,076 36 7,696 7,732 3,116 3,609 6,725 2,885 37 3,080 3,117 5,163 1,570 6,733 5,840 30 2,400 2,430 11,115 4,316 15,431 47 3,209 3,256 35,465 7,800 43,265 1,755 16,529 18,284 69,320 62,833 132,153 1,194 14,721 15,915 50,354 67,213 117,567 360 6,803 7,163 22,060 25,811 47,871 99 2,262 2,361 7,130 6,580 13,710 4,951 37 523 560 2,568 1,297 3,865 5,093 77,084 82,177 210,708 183,774 394,482 (3) (a) No. The United Nations General Assembly Special Session held in New York in June was not convened to consider the issue of setting binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions. The Special Session was called to consider progress in meeting the objectives established under Agenda 21, and broadly the Special Session did not consider matters of detail where they are being negotiated or dealt with through other forums or conventions. In regard to greenhouse issues the Assembly ultimately agreed that climate change is ""one of the biggest challenges facing the world in the next century"" but that it would be inappropriate for UNGASS 51 to ""seek to predetermine"" results prior to the Kyoto meeting in December. (3) (b) No. Australia's Mission to the United Nations advises that 24 Heads of Government attended the session along with 22 Heads of State and 178 Ministers.

I made the decision to focus my efforts on direct, personal representations at the highest levels-with Mr Blair, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Mr Clinton, the President of the United States of America, following earlier discussions with Mr Kohl, the Chancellor of Germany and Mr Hashimoto, the Prime Minister of Japan. Medicare Services: Victoria and Electoral Division of Scullin (Question No. 2002) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) How many Medicare services were provided in (a) Victoria and (b) the electoral division of Scullin during (i) 1995-96 and (ii) the period 1 July 1996 to 26 June 1997. (2) How many Medicare services per capita were provided in (a) Victoria and (b) the electoral division of Scullin during (i) 1995-96 and (ii) the period 1 July 1996 to 26 June 1997. (3) What proportion of Medicare services were direct billed in (a) Victoria and (b) the electoral division of Scullin during (i) 1995-96 and (ii) the period 1 July 1996 to 26 June 1997. (4) What proportion of Medicare services were provided at or below the schedule fee in (a) Victoria and (b) the electoral division of Scullin during (i) 1995-96 and (ii) the period 1 July 1996 to 26 June 1997.",122
399,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PSS BOARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The number of Medicare services provided in Victoria in 1995-96 and 1996-97 were 48,673,762 and 50,011,710, respectively. In 199596 and 1996-97, the number of Medicare services provided in the federal electoral division of Scullin were 907,376 and 936,973, respectively. (2) The number of per capita Medicare services provided in Victoria in 1995-96 and 1996-97 were Services Services per capita Direct billed (%) Services at or below schedule fee (%) These data was compiled from claims processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the respective periods in question. Medicare data can be compiled by servicing provider postcode or by enrolment postcode of patient. In aggregating data to electoral division, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing 1991, which are available at the postcode and electoral division level, were Ilsed to apportion Medicare data by postcode to electoral division, for postcodes overlapping electoral division boundaries. For example, if from the Census, 90 per cent of the population for a postcode was in the electoral division of Scullin, then 90 per cent of the 10.7 and 11, respectively. In the federal electoral division of Scullin in 1995-96 and 1996-97, the number of Medicare services per capita were 7.3 and 7.5, respectively. (3) The proportion of Medicare services direct billed in Victoria in 1995-96 and 1996-97 were 69 per cent and 70.3 per cent, respectively. In 1995-96 and 1996-97, the proportion of Medicare services direct billed in the federal electoral division of Scullin were 88 per cent and 88.3 per cent, respectively. (4) The proportion of services provided at or below the schedule fee in Victoria in 1995-96 and 1996-97 were 81 per cent and 81.6 per cent, respectively. In 1995-96 and 1996-97, the proportion of Medicare services provided at or below the schedule fee in the federal electoral division of Scullin were 90.8 per cent and 90.9 per cent, respectively. The above data were based on an analysis of Medicare claims processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the respective years. NA Details of Medicare services provided in Victoria, and in the electoral division of Scullin in 1995-96 and 1996-97, are as follows: Victoria Scullin 1995-96 1996-97 1995-96 1996-97 48,673,762 50,011,710 907,376 936,973 10.7 11.0 7.3 7.5 69.0 70.3 88.0 88.3 81.0 81.6 90.8 90.9 Medicare services for that postcode were included in the electoral division of Scullin. In accordance with the question, the above data relate to services rendered in Victoria and the electoral division of Scullin in the respective periods. In compiling per capita data, the latest population estimates from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for 1995-96, were used for both years. Population estimates for 1996-97 are not available. The standard electorate profiles produced by the Department of Health and Family Services contain data by electoral division of patient. Data for 199596, based on patient region, are as follows: Services Services per capita Direct billed (%) Services at or below schedule fee (%) Department of Finance: Staff (Question No. 2059) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) How many persons were employed on a (a) full-time, (b) part-time permanent and (c) casual basis in the Minister's Department at 30 June 1997. (2) What is the Minister's Department's estimated recruitment intake for 1997-98. (3) How many positions will be available for successful candidates from the recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance test. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the Department of Finance: (a) 641 persons were employed on a full-time basis; (b) 26 were employed on a part-time basis; and (c) none were employed on a casual basis. In the Office of Asset Sales: (a) 37 persons were employed on a full-time basis; (b) none were employed on a part-time basis; and (c) none were employed on a casual basis. In the Office of Government Information Technology: (a) 57 persons were employed on a full time basis; (b) none were employed on a part-time basis; and (c) none were employed on a casual basis. In Comsuper: (a) 325 persons were employed on a full-time basis; (b)25 persons were employed on a part-time basis; and (c) none were employed on a casual basis. In the Department of Finance, the recruitment intake for 1997-98 cannot be estimated until the outcomes of market testing, outsourcing and possible downsizing are known. The Department estimates a Graduate intake of approximately 20. The Office of Asset Sales presently expects to reduce staff resources during the second half of 1997-98, depending on workload at the time. The Office of Government Information Technology will undertake some recruitment activity during 1997-98, however levels have yet to be ascertained. Comsuper estimates a recruitment intake of 15 for 1997-98.(3) The Department of Finance does not expect to place any successful candidates from Victoria - Scullin 1995-96 1995-96 48,546,000 1,385,600 11 11 69.2 82.0 81.1 88.2 the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test during 1997-98.

Fremantle Region: RAAF Aircraft (Question No-. 2068) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Did RAAF F/A 18 aircraft fly over the Fremantle region on Wednesday, 18 June 1997; if so, what was the purpose of the flights. (2) What guidelines does the RAAF observe in order to consider the interests of residents affected by the noise generated by flights. (3) Who was charged with the responsibility of considering the impact on residents of the exercise of 18 June 1997. (4) How many complaints about the flights were received by RAAF Base Pearce or other agencies. (5) Why did the aircraft fly over a built up residential area. (6) At what altitude were the aircraft flying over the Fremantle region. (7) For what duration was the exercise or flight. (8) How many aircraft were involved. (9) Who approved the flight path and controlled the air traffic. (10) Why was the airspace over the south western suburbs of Perth chosen for the exercise. (11) To what extent were officers, including public relations officers, at RAAF Base Pearce briefed on the proposed aircraft movements. (12) What efforts were made to inform the public about the impending exercise. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes; to conduct a Rapid Deployment Exercise (RDEX) to RAAF Pearce to test No 81 Wing rapid deployment capabilities. While in Western Australia, the aircraft participated in urban counter-terrorist training exercises with the Perth-based Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), and training with the RAAF's flying school at Pearce. (2) Current Defence Instructions require aircraft captains, air traffic control and maintenance personnel to ensure that unnecessary aircraft noise nuisance to the public is avoided during the operation of aircraft. Wherever possible, each operation is conducted to avoid flying over livestock and populated areas. If, because of this requirement, the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation may be unduly prejudiced, aircraft are flown with appropriate vertical and horizontal separation to minimise noise levels, or at such times that noise nuisance is unlikely. (3) No 77 Squadron senior executives. (4) Twenty seven noise complaints were received by RAAF Pearce and one Ministerial representation on the matter was investigated by No 81 Wing RAAF Williamtown. (5) The flights involved air support for SASR urban counter-terrorist training involving the simulated delivery of precision weapons against targets in the Perth suburban area. (6) Aircraft generally flew at 15,000 feet altitude: However, on occasions aircraft were required to descend to a minimum of 3,500 feet altitude because of weather conditions. This altitude was in excess of the minimum allowable 1,500 feet altitude over built-up areas and the minimum safe altitude of 3,000 feet for the sector. (7) No 77 Squadron conducted three sorties on Wednesday 18 June 1997. The flight times were 2.00 pm, 6.00 pm and 7.00 pm. Each sortie lasted approximately one and a half hours. (8) Six aircraft. (9) The Perth Air Traffic Control agency of Airservices Australia and RAAF Pearce. (10) SASR conducted the ground activity of the exercise in the Fremantle Docks area, an ideal scenario for this type of training. The ground training area is close to Swanbourne, the location of the SASR. The airspace over the south-western suburbs of Perth was used in order to successfully support the SASR ground activity. (11) Essentially, only people with an operational role in the exercise were informed of the impending activity. This was due to the 'no notice' nature of the exercise. Prior knowledge of the deployment was limited to a need-to-know basis for personnel at RAAF Pearce. (12) The RAAF issued a press release to 22 media agencies on 17 June 1997, and a media opportunity day was held at RAAF Pearce on 18 June 1997. Wider dissemination of the impending exercise prior to the deployment would have jeopardised the purpose of the exercise. Drug Problem (Question No. 2079) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, 25 August 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments made by the Premier of Western Australia stating that Mr Court is in favour of him taking a leading role in forging new directions and developing new strategies over the illegal heroin problem, just as he did with the firearms debate and the national gun buy-back scheme; if so, what is his response to Mr Court's comments. (2) Will he take a leading role in improving the drug problem; if not, why not. (3) Has his attention also been drawn to comments made by the President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) calling on him to convene a national drug summit; if so, is the AMA's call for a summit appropriate.",123
400,Mr HOWARD,BACKGROUND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Yes. The Government is determined to ensure that there is anÂ· effective national effort to combat the menace of illicit drugs. I have therefore established a task force of Commonwealth agencies to prepare an urgent report on the Commonwealth's contribution to a national approach to illicit drugs and to the development of an agenda for national action. The task force is chaired by the Secretary of my department and includes the heads of all relevant Commonwealth agencies. The task force will look at current efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, including domestic law enforcement and border control; current efforts to reduce the demand for such drugs, including community education and community organisation support programs; and harm minimisation approaches for users. This work is being given high priority to enable the Government to formulate a broad strategy to put before the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy at its November meeting. (3) Yes. As I said in the House on 25 August 1997, the Government has an open mind on the question of a national drug summit. Live Sheep Transport Vessels (Question No. 2084) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Are there live sheep vessels which are not suitable to carry live animals from Australia; if what are the (a) names of the vessels, (b) names of the owners of the vessels and (c) destinations. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Vessels engaged in the live export trade are considered suitable to carry livestock from Australia. All vessels are subject to a variety of inspections. Under international maritime safety conventions, ships are required to be surveyed annually, by or on behalf of their Flag States, for compliance with certain structural and safety requirements. Under Port State Control arrangements, all ships can be subjected to a detailed inspection by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) every six months as a requirement of the Port State as distinct from the Flag State or country of registration. These inspections are undertaken in line with the authority contained within the InternaMay, tional Maritime Organisation conventions on ship safety and pollution as well as the provisions of the Australian Navigation Act and Marine Orders. If any significant problems of safety are revealed by the inspection, the deficiencies are required to be rectified before the ship is allowed to continue transporting Australian livestock. The ship can be detained if necessary. AMSA also undertakes inspections in relation to Marine Orders Part 43 which deals with the carriage and handling of livestock. Unless a vessel complies with these Orders it will not be issued an Australian Certificate for the Carriage of Livestock, effectively prohibiting the vessel from trading from Australian waters. AMSA has also introduced an enhanced inspection program aimed at ensuring that all livestock carriers continue to meet all the requirements relevant International Conventions and Australia's Marine Orders Part 43. Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation: Funding (Question No. 2097) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Has the Government reduced funding to the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation; if so (a) what has been the extent of the reduction and (b) from what date will the reduction apply.",125
401,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,BACKGROUND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Following a review of national secretariat funding under the Community Sector Support Scheme, the Government has decided that funding so, to the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation under the Scheme will be discontinued. (a) and (b) Funding to the AP&SF will cease on 30 September 1997. Charities: Government Funding (Question No. 2098) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 1657 (Hansard, 29 May 1997, page 4528), which Departments provided funding to charities in (a) 1995-96 and (b) 1996-97. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As outlined in my response to your question in I am not able to provide information in respect of other portfolios. Climate Change (Question No. 2110) MrBarry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the statement by 131 professional Australian economists on climate change, published by the Australia Institute on 23 June 1997. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to the argument in the statement signed in the US by almost 2500 economists, including six Nobel Laureates. (3) Does the statement challenge the intellectual basis of the Government's policy in resisting the of the adoption of binding targets for reductions in Greenhouse gases. (4) Is the Government working on the assumption that there will be a straight line projection increase in coal use worldwide, and that the use of alternative fuels, or adoption of significant energy saving strategies will be against Australia's economic interest. (5) Is the Government committed to the philosophy of comparative advantage and has it given consideration to the concept of competitive advantage. (6) What is his response to paragraph (3) of the Australian statement that the economic modelling studies on which the Government is relying to assess the impacts of reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits of reducing emissions.",126
402,Mr HOWARD,BACKGROUND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) No. (4) The answer to both questions is no. World growth rates in coal production and consumption will vary, although overall they are predicted to increase significantly-a 50% rise from 1992 levels by 2010 is predicted by this year's International Energy Agency's Coal Information Report. Much of this will be driven by demand for electricity in Asia. The government does not believe that alternative fuels or energy saving is against our national interest: Australia has significant areas such as an expanding LNG market, significant potential to increase uranium exports, and leading-edge renewable energy expertise and technologies. (5) The government's policy approach maximises our comparative advantage by efficiently taking advantage of our natural resources and economic base, and at the same time encouraging the development of a strong competitive advantage. (6) There have been several economic modelling studies that the government has consulted in the development of its climate change policy. Several studies have produced essentially similar results, indicating that Australia's costs in meeting uniform greenhouse targets are much higher than those of other Annex I countries. None of the current economic models estimates emission-reduction benefits, so the issue of such estimates as being too high or too low is not applicable. Employment Committee of Cabinet (Question No. 2120) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Which Cabinet Ministers are members of the special employment committee of Cabinet. (2) On how many occasions and on what dates has the employment committee of Cabinet met since 2 March 1996. (3) Which Ministers attended each meeting referred to in part (2).",127
403,Mr HOWARD,BACKGROUND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Committee comprises myself (Chairman), Mr Fischer, Mr Costello, Mr Reith, Senator Newman, Mr Moore, Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp. (2) Since the formation of the Employment Committee of Cabinet on 21 October 1996, the Committee has met on five occasions. (3) Other Ministers are co-opted to attend meetings of the Employment Committee of Cabinet as and when required. Consistent with long standing practice, I am not prepared to disclose the details of meetings of Cabinet or its Committees. Sole Parent Pension: Recipients (Question No. 2125) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) How many recipients were there of the sole parent pension (SPP) at 1 May 1997. (2) What proportion of the recipients are (a) male strengths in these and (b) female. (3) What is the total cost of SPP per annum. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department of Social Security provides data on pensions customers on a fortnightly basis. At 9 May 97 there was a total of 358,334 recorded recipients of Sole Parent Pension. (2) Of that total, 23,800 (6.6%) were male. The remaining 334,534 (93.3%) were female. (3) The cost of Sole Parent Pension over the 9697 financial year was $2,992,321,75l. Georges River: Pollution (Question No. 2139) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 1775 (Hansard, 25 August 1997, page 6775), will the Minister provide the requested information with respect to the (a) Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, (b) Department of Defence, (c) Federal Airports Corporation and (d) CSIRO. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The organisations that the honourable member has sought information on are not part of my portfolio responsibilities. I suggest the honourable member redirect his question to the relevant ministers who have portfolio responsibility for these organisations. (Question No. 2141) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Is he able to say (a) which Departments have engaged consultants since 2 March 1996 and (b) which consultants have been engaged. (2) If so, what has been the nature of the project or research undertaken by each consultant and what sum has been paid to each consultant. (3) What is the estimated cost of consultancy work presently in progress for which no payment has been made. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not able to provide information about the engagement of consultants, the nature of their work, the amounts paid or the work in progress costs, in respect to portfolios across the APS, except my own. (2) See above. (3) See above. Royal Australian Navy's Logistic Systems: Relocation (Question No. 2143) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 August 1997: Industry Textile, Clothing, Footwear Automobile Music Shipping Payments made in 1996/97 are primarily for claims of eligible expenditure incurred in 1995/96 but also relate to some claims submitted in respect of previous years.

Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The location of the JLSA has not yet been determined, and will involve consideration of its size, the identity and location of its customers and major stakeholders, and the availability of suitable accommodation. Export Market Development Grants Scheme (Question No. 2166) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice on 28 August 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 1029 (Hansard, 5 February 1997, page 281), what are the details of the Export Market Development Grants paid in 1996-97 to companies in the (a) textile, clothing and footwear, (b) automobile, (c) music and (d) shipping industries. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable members' question is as follows: $ Value of EMDG Grants Paid in 1996/97 Number of Companies $7,046,849 123 $2,120,471 45 $7,382,930 143 $1,167,146 21 purpose and (b) could the heroin be used in heroin trials in Australia or overseas. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government Analytical Laboratories does manufacture very small quantities of pure heroin. (a) The pure heroin is used as reference standards in the analysis of seized drugs by forensic laboratories. (b) AGAL is an analytical laboratory, not a pharmaceutical laboratory and does not have the necessary licences or facilities to manufacture restricted substances' for human consumption.",127
