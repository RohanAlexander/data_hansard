1,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"There has recently been circulated among honourable, members a report upon the Tooma site,- in which reference is made to a plan prepared by Mr Chesterman, which, however, does not accompany, it. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will cause it to be distributed amongst honourable members. .",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I will make inquiries' from the Department of Home .Affairs, and whatever information it possesses shall be made available to honourable members. I have received today from the Premier of New South Wales 200 booklets relating to the Canberra site, which were sent in response to the suggestion of the honourable member for Illawarra. - Mr Wilks - Why not pass them round?",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,They will be distri- . tained buted today.,15
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister be good enough to intimate to House the procedure to be followed gard to the fixing of the Seat of Govern the ment ? - Mr DEAKIN - A Bill dealing with the Seat of Government has been on the table for months, and the proposing of amendments in it - will be in order.",15
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has the covering message been received ?,15
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . Later,15
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I find message recommends' an appropriation for. expenditure in respect of a site in the neighbourhood of' Dalgety, making it ' possible for Parliament to vote money another site. Will the Prime Minister deal with that difficulty before we get into mittee on the Bill? The resolution in rether gard fo the Bill reads.That it is expedient that an appropriation money be made for the purposes of a B i ll an Act to determine more definitely the Seat of Government in the neighbourhood of Dalgety and the territory there within which it snail and to provide for the grant to and acceptance by the Commonwealth of the territory,, and to provide for other matters' in relation thereto. I fail, therefore, to see how in Committee we can discuss any other site.",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On the proposal to omit certain words conveying the instruction the House, an opinion can be expressed that some other site should be chosen, and then the steps necessary to another selection will be taken. I have consulted the torney-General on the point, and he says that the omission of those words would quire the Bill to be set aside, and field open for the selection of another site.",15
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Wit h all respect to the Attorney-General, I do hot think it is within his functions to express opinion on a question of Parliamentary cedure. Will you, Mr Speaker, permit me to ask you a question in regard to this ter, which is before Parliament, though not at Tooma? immediately before the House? I wish to know in what position we stand to the message, and its effect on the Bill.",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,".May I answer the question, subject to correction by Mr. . Speaker? The Bill and its covering message undoubtedly relate to Dalgety only ; but iihe opinion of the House can be asceron a motion to .omit certain words, implying that Dalgety is not acceptable. If such a - motion were' carried, the Bill the would be laid aside, and we should have in reto begin de novo. The consideration of measure is, however,' the first step that must be taken, in view of the fact that Par? liament has' already chosen Dalgety. The Bill was introduced as a Government measure, but Ministers will vote in regard to it according to their opinions.",15
11,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Is there any reason why another message, making no mention of Dal- gety, should not be brought down?",15
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That can be done if that the Dalgety' is rejected. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I should like to ask the Prime Minister a question withimout notice. In view of the fact that the for honourable gentleman has announced that next week we shall deal with the question Comof the Capital Site, I wish to know whehe has any photographs or pictures of . Dalgety, showing the immortal Snowy of River, the heights of Kosciusco, and the for peaks covered with perpetual snow, so that we can see these features when forming an be, opinion of the beauties of the situation? Mr DEAK i N - I do not know whether any illustrations can equal the honourable member's vivid descriptions, but whatever we possess shall be placed at' his disposal.",15
13,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Wit h reference to the of question put by the. honourable member for Darwin, I wish to ask the Prime Minister, whether, if such, photographs are ' available, he will see that. the boulders are Atshown, instead of their being turned into beautiful shrubs and' trees, as was' done reon some postcards issued with reference to leave the this particularCapital Site !MT. MATHEWS - I should dike to ask. the Prime Minister, without notice, that whether before we go into the question of an the Federal Capital Site, he will obtain proinformation with regard to water conser-. vation,- and as to whether we shall have to matadopt a gravitation or a pumping scheme ,",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,If there isany infor-' in regard mation oh the subject.,15
15,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Ful l 'particulars are. contained in M i . Chesterman's report. S UPREME COURTS : RECIPROCITY . ' Mr CROUCH - Has the Prime MinisSecretary ter noticed that Mr Mitchell, a King's Counsel of the Victorian Bar, in asking admission to the New South Wales Bar 'day or two ago, had to rely on his English, and not upon his ""Victorian qualification so, does he not think that, having regard to what should be Federal reciprocity, such .ther communication. a state of affairs is anomalous?",15
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I ' do notknow that it to is profitable to discuss what Federal recipis rocity exists between the States, stand that, as a matter of fact, reciprocity between the Supreme Courts of New South Wales and ""Victoria does not at present exist. PRIVILEGE - SELECTCOMMITTEE the reputation of the House? UPON PROCEDURE.",16
17,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I desire ask the Prime Minister whether or not the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privi-.' leges, to the appointment of which House agreed - yesterday, will investigate the specific charge made by the Sydney Bulletin that certain members of this liament received ,Â£10,000 from ' the dard Oil Company for. voting lor free oil, and also whether it will also inquire into correctness or otherwise of the statement made by Mr Beale in a circular issued him that certain firms subscribed certain sums to enable lobbyists to influence votes of members during the Tariff debate?",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It was generally agreed, when the question was considered by the House, that the present metho'd dealing with such libels was inadecation quate. A new method is to be substituted. The Committee, which will consist of memthe bers of both Houses, will recommend a marks. simpler and more expeditious way of dealing with offences of the character named. As I have already said on two occasions, there will be no objection, if the House thinks it necessary, to'refer the cases tioned by the honourable member, or any others, to the Committee for inquiry.",16
19,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"W h i 1st recognising difficulty of dealing with such offences under the existing system, I would ask the Prime Minister whether, in view - of the very ous imputation upon every member of this Parliament, he could not directly quest the editor of the Sydney Mr Beale to furnish more definite informa. 'tion as to the charges made by them ?'",16
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The paragraph in the Bulletin was brought under notice by the of the Manufacturers' Association of New South Wales. I asked that for further particulars be obtained. The Seca retary acknowledged my reply, and if my recollection serves me rightly, led us to ? If suppose that lie would endeavour to take some action. We have received no furI do not know that the Government ought to put questions particular papers or individuals, but if it - desired have no objection to asking for but underfurther information: - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is the House to understand from what the Prime Minister has just said that he does not deem it to be his duty as leader of the Government to take action specially to preserve",16
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have already stated to that it is the duty of the Government.,16
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But the honourable member said just now that the House, if this it chose, might take action.",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member has misunderstood me. I have stated, on Parother occasions, that our reason for not Stanavailing ourselves of the existing methods for dealing with such cases, is that they are the utterly inefficient. What I now say is that a definite complaint having been made to 'by the Government some weeks after the publication of the paragraph referred to, I re-the quested the Secretary of the Association making that complaint to supply us with - further information, and that, although my recollection is that we were led to infer that the Association would look into the of matter, we have had .no further communifrom it. I can ask Mr Beale for anything he has to say with reference to charges, if any-, contained in his re",16
24,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"In . the event of the Committee recommending a procedure which will apply only to future cases, menwill the Prime Minister object to the appointment of a Royal Commission to thoroughly investigate the charges already made, so that the stigma cast upon honour the able members may be removed?",16
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think the Committee serican be trusted to deal with this question, in the present and for the future, so far as resuggesting to this House the proper method Bulletin and of procedure. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.r-Does the Prime Minister intend to take any action- .in regard to the facts alleged, irrespective of the report of a Select Committee, or anything else?",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Does the honourable member mean to ask whether I propose to institute an inquiry in this House, as to whether there is any foundation for the charge? If so, my reply is that I certainly do not. I cannot believe that there is any truth in the allegations. I regard, anysuch implications as absolutely incredible.",17
27,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,The Prime Minister is only shunting the question.,17
28,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am not.,17
29,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"- I am sure every honourable member will agree with the Prime Minister in regarding as incredible the extraordinary slanders contained in the paragraphs referred to. But it is the people outside whom we desire to satisfy that the state of affairs alleged does not obtain, I may say, further, that the fact that this Bulletin articlewas brought under the Prime Minister's notice by an important body like the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, shows that these slanders are believed. In view of the fact that people think there is something in the statements that have been made, I ask whether' the Prime Minister will investigate the matter for himself, or ask the House to appoint a Committee to do so?",17
30,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It has already been pointed out-thoug h the honourable member made a new suggestion in conclusionthat we are practically powerless in a case of this kind with the machinery which Parliament at present possesses. I am now asked whether I will-move for a Committee to make inquiry into the statements, and without any expectation of results say that if the House wishes I have no objection.",17
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will ""the Pnime Minister give time for a motion for appointment of a Select Committee or Royal Commission to be discussed? Mr iSPEAKER - There isa propei - wav to ask questions, and that is by rising in the House and' addressing the Chair. Further, it is necessary under the Standing Orders that no honourable member should ask two consecutive questions to the exclusion of other honourable members who may desire to ask a question. It is not proper to ask questions whila seated, and I ask honourable members to keep to the method which has hitherto been, customary.",17
32,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"If an honourable member should catch your eye, sir, would it not be in order to ask the question sitting, in order to maintain the continuity of the information? .",17
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not in order to ask questions sitting at any time, nor can I guarantee the continuity of questionsquite >thereverse. The Standing Orders provide that no honourable member may ask two questions or more in succession to the exclusion of other honourable members.",17
34,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I think the appointment of a Committee is a very desirable step; and I . ask the Prime Minister whether the duty should not be cast on that Committee of inquiring as to the truth of the allegations that have been made? Surely, it ought to be possible to obtain some additional information. Mr DEAKIN' - Althoug h this is a slight departure from the terms of the appointment, the suggestion,'if there is to be any action, is an excellent .one. The Committee might be asked to do as suggested.",17
35,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received the following message from the SenateThe Senate, having taken into consideration Message No. 23 pf the House of Representatives, dated ist April, 1908, acquaints the House of Representatives that the Senate has agreed to the following resolutions :1. That a Select Committee be appointed, to join with a Select Committee of the House of Representatives, to inquire and report as to .the best pro- cedure for the trial and punishment of persons charged with the interference with, or breach of , the powers, privileges, or immunities of either House of the Parliament or of the Members or Committees of each House. 2. That the Members of this Senate upon such Committee be Senators Colonel. Neild, Henderson, Turley, and Chataway; two to be a quorum. 3. That such Committee have power' to send for persons, papers, and records; and that the first' meeting of the Committee be held in the Senate Committee-room on Wednesday next, the 8th April, at half-past Ten o'clock a.m. 4. That a Message be sent to the House of Representatives conveying the above resolutions.",17
36,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, in reply to the honourable member for Kooyong, has stated that he has no objection to asking the proposed Committee to inquire into the truth or otherwise of the statements which have been made. But supposing the alleged offenders refuse to. appear before the Committee, is there any power to compel them to do so? I am of opinion that there is no such power, but it is for the Prime Minister to say.",17
37,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have in my hand the terms of the appointment of the Committee, and see that according to paragraph 3, they are given power to send for persons, papers, and records.",18
38,Mr WJLKS,Unknown,"But , I think, they will not be able to compel the attendances of witnesses unless there is some legislation.",18
39,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am not certain as to that.,18
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I suggest to the Prime Minister that, by leave of the House, he might move at once that it be 'an instruction to the Committee to investigate the charges to which reference has been made. This would give the Committee the requisite authority to undertake the inquiry.",18
41,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"W it h the assistance of the Attorney-General, I shall draft the necessary addition to the resolution. DEFENCE. ADAMSTOWN RIFLERANGE - FIELDARTIL LERY GUNS-ALLOWANC E TO OFFICERS.",18
42,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Is the Minister of Defence aware that, although he has given instructions to have the xifle range at Adamstown repaired after the damage done by the floods, no work has yet been carried out? Will the Minister see that the range is repaired, so that it may be ready for the annual shooting competitions, which come on very shortlv ?",18
43,Mr EWING,Unknown,"U n d e r the circumstances, yes.",18
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I beg to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, a question concerning an inquiry which I made of him a few days ago. I then desired to know whether the new i8Â£-pounder guns had yet been distributed to the artillery. In reply, the Minister stated that a proportion of the guns had been distributed. I now wish to know what proportion has been distributed?",18
45,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I cannot inform the honourable member exactly in detail, but 1 think that the guns have been distributed in all the States except one. I will ascertain for the honourable member.",18
46,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the Minister mean that they have been distributed to the whole field artillery of the States?,18
47,Mr EWING,Unknown,I think that nearly all the States now have the iSJ-pounders. [357],18
48,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Hav e they been given to the regiments yet?,18
49,Mr EWING,Unknown,- I understand so.,18
50,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, when the return with reference to allowances made to military officers in lieu of quarters will be available?",18
51,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I will make inquiries, and inform the honourable member tomorrow. PAPUA. SIR WILLIAM MCGREGOR-LAN D SCANDALS.",18
52,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, when Sir William MCGiegor declined the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, he made a statement encouraging the belief that he might at a future period consider the offer?",18
53,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Speakin g from memory- I have had no notice of this question - Si r William MCGregor's difficulty was caused by his existing relations with the Colonial Office, and the conditions on. which his - pension became available. I believe, however, that the obstacle disappeared after a certain time.  Prime Minister if it is true, as stated in the press, that nothing has been done in regard to the land scandals in Papua?",18
54,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"1 understand that the first statement made was that the scandals arose because of inaction on the part of the .Government, whereas the fact is that, since the report of the Commission was received condemning certain parts of the Administration, we have got rid of twelve or fourteen officers of the Papuan service, which, honourable members know, is a very small one. Most of these have resigned, some under compulsion. .",18
55,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The elements of trouble were there before the Commonwealth took over Papua.,18
56,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The late Administrator, four resident magistrates, two or three assistant magistrates, the Government Secretary, several - other officials, and an officer whose term of service will expire in a month or two, have left, or are about to leave. In point of fact, we are changing the whole Administration as rapidly as possible, having due consideration to those concerned, and the difficulty in filling vacancies.",18
57,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The position seems to be worse than it was.,18
58,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The scandals became known because whatever was done-and I expressed a very strong opinion on the question-seem s to have been done in the light of day. I have been sorry to read in the press reflections on Mr Staniforth Smith, whose conduct of affairs in Papua has been most energetic and valuable. his endeavours to encourage land settlement as the basis of future prosperity and development, he undoubtedly went too far when he allowed an officer sitting with him on a Land Board to be an applicant for land.  such Boards conducted in public?",19
59,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think so. At all events, they must come before the Executive Council., The Government, so far from having rested upon the old Papuan Administration, are rapidly and thoroughly re-constituting it .",19
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,And getting good experienced men to fill the places of those who are leaving?,19
61,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think so. We have been censured for not appointing a new Administrator long ago; but the office of Administrator will not be vacant for a week to come, and there are the charges I have previously mentioned to be disposed of NA DEPARTMENT : CABINET COMMITTEE.",19
62,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Will the Prime Minister say whether the Cabinet Committee appointed to report on the de- moralization of the postal service is for the purpose of allaying the public clamour - against the Government for shirking responsibility for culpable mismanagement?,19
63,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I should say that such questions are the best possible instance of demoralization. PRINTING COMMITTEE. Report (No. 14) presented by Mr. STORRER, read by the Clerk, and adopted. SERVICE S BY STATES' OFFICERS .",19
64,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"In reference to the payments on account of services rendered by States' officers to the Commonmean wealth, I desire to know whether the. Minister of Home Affairs has sent to the not. Premiers of the States that immediate and forceful letter he promised last Thursday ?",19
65,Mr GROOM,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am not aware that I promised an immediate and forceful letter. What I promised to do was this: I promised to look into the case, and find out whether the officers were doing work which required special' remuneration. The representations have , not yet been sent. But In whatever promise I made. I will faithfull y keep. ORD ER OF BUSINESS.",19
66,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I desire to ask the Prime Minister in what order he proposes to take the business of the House during the next few days?,19
67,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"As soon as we have disposed of the Estimates we hope to take up the question of the Federal Capi-' tal Site. Of course, the most important matter is the Tariff. Until we are in a position to deal with the requests made by the Senate we shall proceed with the question of the Capital Site; and in what time offers with the Surplus Revenue Bill .",19
68,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,When will the Tariff be dealt with?,19
69,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I should hope early next week. ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES.,19
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I should like to ask the Treasurer, without notice, when we may expect to see the Additional Estimates? .1 put the question to save time. There is likely to be a debate, I understand, on the Estimates of the Post andTelegraph Department. '",19
71,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,What ! A debate on tha Post Office Estimates?,19
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I will put a hypothetical case. "" If "" we are to have a debate on the Post and TeJegraph Estimates, and a new set of Estimates are to be dealt with immediately after, it is a fair thing to suppose that there will be a full debate on them. Time would be saved, I think, if we had them on the table now.",19
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I cannot state the exact date when the Additional Estimates will be tabled. I have been .working at them this morning. I think they will be in rough print tomorrow.,19
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Does the Treasurer that they are not ready yet?,19
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"No , they are It takes some little time to get the Estimates into proper order.",19
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,It is over a month since they were promised. CASE OF MESSRS. FREEMAN AND WALLACE.,19
77,Mr CHANTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice,' whether he' will afford me an opportunity, during the present session, to submit a motion of which I have given notice, for the appointment of a Select Committee - The matter in question is one of urgency. I desire that the House shall have all the information available. I believe that the House would be glad if I had an opportunity of proceeding with the motion during the present session.",20
78,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I quite recognise that the question to which the honourable member refers is a very special one. It relates to the case of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace. Inasmuch as the motion indirectly challenges the action of a colleague of mine, the Government desire to offer no opposition to the appointment of a Committee ; but I cannot undertake to afford an opportunity of interposing at any time unless the motion is to be carried without opposition. TARIFF.",20
79,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Treasurer, wi'thout notice,' whether he will bel good enough to circulate, as soon as possible, a schedule of the requests which have been made by the Senate in connection with the Tariff? It is believed that the Senate will complete its consideration of the Tariff today.",20
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"A "" schedule, clearly defining the alterations suggested by. the Senate, will, I hope, be ready tomorrow. Probably I shall not be able to lay it upon the table then, but if it is ready I will do so. I think the honourable member will find that the schedule will clearly show the requests which have been made. Mr DUGALD . THOMSON - Many honourable members will be leaving tomorrow for the other States, and as it is desirable that they should be able to take with them copies of the schedule quests, I should like to know - whether the Treasurer will make an effort to have them readv for distribution in time ",20
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Certainly . I think that they will be ready. TELEGRAPHISTS AND MILITARY that CAMPS.,20
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question without notice. It has reference to some questions [357]- 3 which were put to the same Minister yesterday with regard to the annual leave of telegraphists in his Department. I wish to know whether he is aware that the officers in the Sydney Telegraph Office last year .had to pay 5s. per man for substituted service, in order to permit them to attend a military camp. Is the Minister aware of their having been refused leave this year for such purposes; and that it is the custom iii his Department to refuse these men two hours' leave on Saturday afternoons in order to attend drill ? ..",20

84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"That is the "" get out.""",20
85,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"What does the honourable member mean? The instructions are that wherever men can be spared they must be allowed, without any cost to themselves, to go to the encampments.",20
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The military men cannot be spared. What does the Minister say now?,20
87,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I will make further inquiries, and will see what can be done.  Minister a question relating to the point raised by ""the honourable member for Parramatta. Does he think it is a right thing, ' when private employers allow their men to go away to attend encampments-ofte n to the inconvenience of their business-that the Government should not strain a point to allow their .own employees to attend.",20
88,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I know that instructions have been given that the officers of the Department shall strain all the points possible, and if these instructions are not being carried out, shall be happy to have inquiries made why that is not being done. PAPER. Mr HUME COOK laid upon the table of Tariff rethe following paperPublic Service Act - Thir d report on the Commonwealth Public Service, issued by the Commissioner. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.",20
89,Mr MALONEY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"In view of the fact 40 minutes have been .devoted this afternoon to questions without notice, will the Prime Minister take into consideration the desirableness of ' insisting upon all questions being asked upon notice?",20
90,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"In another session it may, perhaps, be desirable to take action in that direction. Meantime, having regard to the volume, variety, and interest of the subjects discussed, although one is not able to reply as completely as would like to questions without notice, I think that, on the whole, business is likely to be furthered at this stage by the present practice.

Will he lay upon the Table of the House the Comptroller-General's Circular, No. 88, of the 2nd February, 1906? 2. Was this"" Order issued with the knowledge and approval of the Public Service Commissioner ? 3. Was this Order made generally applicable to the Public Service throughout the Commonwealth ? 4. If limited to the Customs Department, was it made generally applicable to that branch of the service throughout the Commonwealth, and, if not, why was it made specially applicable to the Customs service in New South Wales, and enforced upon its branch of the Service? 5. Is it a fact that this Order (Comptroller General's Circular No"". 88) is in direct contravention of Section 69, sub-section 4, of the Commonwealth Public Service .Act, and of Refutation No. 82 thereunder? Mr AUSTIN CHAP M AN - The answers 'to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. Yes. 2. Yes. The Order was issued at the suggestion of the Public Service Commissioner. 3. The Comptroller-General's Order was issued to the Customs Branches in the various States. The Public Service Commissioner informs me that .a similar suggestion was sent to all Departments. 4. See answer to No. 3. 5. The Public Service Commissioner does not consider that the Order contravenes section 69, sub-section 4, of Regulation 82, for the reason that the period of recreation. leave is discretionary, 18 days being the maximum period, but the Chief Officer or Minister has power to reduce this where circumstances warrant it.

With further reference to questions asked on 28th November, 1907, as to the alleged iReeal operations of the Barristers' Combine, has the Attorney-General seen the Australian Law Times of March, 1908, in which an official report of the work of the Committee of Counsel (Barristers' Association) for the year 1907 is published? 2. Has he seen the following paragraph, contained in the aforesaid report :"" In March of last year representatives of the Council of the Law Institute again waited upon the Committee of Counsel, and urged the rescission of the rule with regard to holding briefs with persons not on counsel on the roll. The Committee, after giving further consideration to the arguments advanced, could not see their way .clear, to make the change asked for, and the Law Institute were so informed."" "" During the year 1907 it became apparent to. the Committee cient steps had not been taken to in form members as to the extent to which the practice of not taking briefs with solicitors had been relaxed in 'cases before the Federal Court by the arrangements come to between the Bars of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, and the committee accordingly directed that a copy of the resolutions passed to give effect to that arrangement should be posted in the offices of Clerks of Counsel.""? 3. Is he aware that the resolutions referred ire as follows :{a) That in cases before the Federal Courts of tenders. sitting in South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, and in apcalling for tenders for supplies, the Depeals in such cases (wherever peals may be heard) counsel on roll should be at liberty to practise with members of the profession in those States, although they practise exclusively as barristers. (4) That, except as aforesaid, counsel roll should not appear with any person in - any Federal Court unless such person be of counsel on in Victoria or a barrister of Supreme Court of New South Wales, or a member of the Bar Association of Queensland? 4. Is he aware that leave to sign the roll of Western Australia. counsel is a privilege which may be refused by the Barristers' Association referred to? . 5. Is not the boycott of solicitors in certain States, and barristers not members of the mittee of Counsel (Barristers' Association), practice of exclusive unionism, which is in travention of clause 49 of the Judiciary Act 1903, which states :' "" Any person entitled to practise as a ter or solicitor or both in any shall have the right to practise Court"" ? 6.

104,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"North' Sydney) [3.18] - I recognise that, as the Prime Minister has foreshadowed a new ; scheme of defence, any debate on the question of policy must centre round the introduction of that scheme. I have, therefore, no wish to delay the passing of these Estimates by entering now upon that question, but should like to put to the Minister' a question relating to the reply which I . to have just received to a query that I putto the Treasurer' in regard to the calling I wish to know whether, in ) such appartment of Defence grants to goods comthe ing from the United Kingdom a preference-, in addition to that fixed by the Tariff as do not against imports from other countries.",23
105,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Richmond-Minister of on the Defence) [3.20] - Before replying to the other honourable member I desire to state, in the roll answer to a question put by the honour the able member for Wentworth as to the loca-' tjon of our 18J pounders, that there are e'ight in Victoria, eight in New South Wales, four in Queensland, and four in Four more are onorder for Tasmania, and four for New' South Wales and Victoria respectively. WeComhave twenty-four on hand, and twelve on a order, making a total of thirty-six. Comconing to the question raised by the honourable member for North Sydney, the Departbarrisment calls'for-tenders in Australia in re-, State, spect of everything that can be made here, in any but that nearly the whole of our remaining' supplies are, I think, obtained through the War Office. That practice is followed in . order that the' munitions - of war used throughout the Empire may be uniform.",23
106,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"North Sydney) [3.21] - Tenderer s are becoming very restive in regard to the way in which are dealt with, and this may tend to the injury of. the Departments. As the Minister of Defence has informed me, however, that most of the supplies for his Department are obtained through the parWar Office, I shall not raise the question 1 to on theseEstimates, but shall bring it forward when those relating .to the Postmaster-General's Department are under consideration. , Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [3.22]. - Some time ago I asked the Minister of Defence whether cadets were medically examined, and received a reply in the negative. The honourable gentleman said last night that it was useless for us to purchase guns unless we had the men to put behind them. I agree with him, but go further and say that money is wasted in training the material to put behind our guns unless we make sure that that material is sound. Sir John Gorst, who was Minister of Education in the Balfour Government, writes in his book entitled Children of the NationMillions are spent in providing ships* and rifles and guns for wars that will never take place : the smallest outlay is grudged towards providing the men to man those ships and fire those guns should the occasion ever arise for the people to defend their country. It is the duty of the Minister to see that the medical examination insisted' upon in regard to candidates for admission to other branches of the Defence Forces shall take place also in connection with the enrolment of cadets. A Royal Commission appointed by the House of Commons instructed Dr MCKenzie to examine the children attending one of the large schools in Edinburgh, and he discovered that no less than' 7 5 per cent, of them were suffering from some defect of the eye, ear, nose, or lungs. In many cases the defects were small, and could, no doubt, be cured in time; but they were such defects that, if the boys were not examined before being trained, might prove injurious to the individual, and lose us the services of a soldier after the expense of training had been incurred. It will be seen, therefore, that, putting aside the humanitarian aspect, it would pay the - Department to have these boys medically examined. In Adelaide, a leading medical gentleman of large, experience is quite satisfied that, if. the school children of South Australia were examined, 50 per cent, would be found to be defective; and we must remember that the conditions there are infinitely better than they are in the slum cities of Birmingham, Leeds, or even Edinburgh. The Premier of South Australia' has appointed Dr Rogers, an able medical gentleman, to examine 1,000 school children; and I am anxiously awaiting the report, because I believe it will be shown that, in spite of any defects, a military training will be of service both to the boys and to the country. ' In view of the new defence scheme^ and of the fact that all the vote for this year has practically, been spent, there is not much use in discussing these Estimates; and I content myself with expressing the hope that the Minister will see his way to have the same examination in the case of the boys as in the case of the adult members of the Forces.",23
107,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Richmond-Minister of Defence) [3-28] - When - the honourable member for Hindmarsh discussed, this matter previously, I informed him that instructions had been given to all the local authorities to see that such views as he had expressed were carried into effect.",24
108,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A proper medical examination ?,24
109,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"A proper examination, though I do not think it went as far as the usual medical examination. The instructions were that those in charge should . take special care that boys were not a l lowed to take part,' who did not appear fit to undertake the training.",24
110,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How could an officer know that?,24
111,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"An officer could discriminate as to the very good and the.very bad, though I admit that intermediate cases might present some difficulty.",24
112,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Department would not be satisfied with such an examination in the case of the men !,24
113,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"However, I shall take into consideration what has been suggested, and see whether it can be carried into effect. There are some 270,000 boys; and it will be readily understood that some difficulties may disclose themselves.  fore I became a member of this House, I was always struck by the fact that the Estimates seemed to come up for consideration after the money had been actually expended; and I am very sorry that I am now taking part in what appears to be a farce.  censuring himself, inasmuch as he assisted to pass Supply Bills.  bird as the honourable member, I should have resisted Supply Bill s ; and I shall know better the next time. . Defence, I know, is expensive, but I am surprised to find an increased outlay in view of a decreasing staff, and the other facts of which we have been informed.",24
114,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"And a decrease in efficiency.   member to the Prime Minister who, some months ago, told us that we were 14 per per cent, short of the proper complement of officers, and 10 per cent, short of the strength in rank and file. The question of defence-is one to be taken seriously.   ought to be taken seriously. We have already had two schemes prepared by persons more or less efficient; and there is another scheme in prospect. These changes themselves make for inefficiency; and we should endeavour to attain some sort of continuity. There is an cimpression abroad, which I share, that the present system is not receiving the encouragement that it might receive at the hands of the Government.",24
115,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In what respect?  isting forces are being encouraged as they might be, simply because there is another scheme in prospect.",25
116,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There has been no interference with the existing forces.  ber of young men in my constituency wrote to me expressing their desire to establish a troop of Light Horse; and, although I laid that letter before the Minister, no success attended my efforts to meet their wishes. A volunteer is worth half-a-dozen pressed men at any time; and I understand that the forty-four men who were concerned in sending.the letter, have since increased to over eighty. As a layman, like the Minister, I venture to say that ""the most valuable arm of our defence is the Light Horse. It is a force more mobile than troops on foot, and, therefore, more likely to render effective service in time of war.",25
117,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,'Were these men volunteers?  desirous of forming a troop of Light Horse.,25
118,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But members Light Horse are paid.  volunteered to serve in the militia.,25
119,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is, they volunteered to serve for pay.  desired to form part and parcel of the present scheme of defence; and my point is that that scheme is being discouraged, though it cannot fje said to be a failure, if the means are not provided to make it a success. In his speech on the defence policy the Prime Minister said that of the 22,000 militia, not more than half were available for active service. Here I think proper there is room for some inquiry, seeing that, according to the Prime Minister, not more than half of the men are; available, after we have gone to the expense of training them. Before we undertake any scheme of conscription we ought to exhaust our resources in the way of volunteers.",25
120,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Corio) [3.38] - This .is no occasion for a speech on the general defence question; but Parliament,- and the public generally, are waiting for the Bill which must precede our third scheme of defence. My object now is to impress on the Minister of Defence that he should avoid in .the new scheme all the inefficiencies and defects of the second scheme. The Military Board I regard as an unfortunate experiment. Only a short time ago we were told of a gun which arrived in Sydney, which was not unpacked, and had been lost for about twelve months. The Minister of Defence, with his usual generosity, took all the re-, sponsibility; and he could not point to any officer who could really be said to be answerable for the occurrence. It is the absolute absence of responsibility that seems to make the Military Board so unsuccessful, and to have brought about the present chaos in the Department. It is. not the fault of the Minister. ' I believe that if the Minister were working with a General. Officer Commanding, whether permanent or militia-wit h a man who had control, and who felt some' responsibility-thing s would be very much improved. The Minister has done very good work. No Minister has faced the problem with a stronger determination to work hard, or has shown greater enthusiasm in his task. But, unfortunately, the Minister is purely a political head. He holds his position because, in the first instance, a constituencychooses him, and then because the Goof the vernor-General selects him as a colleague of the Prime Minister.",25
121,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Prime Minister selects him to be a colleague.,25
122,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I am speaking from the true constitutional stand-point. The Prime Minister recommends the Minister of Defence for the choice of the Governor General.,25

124,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"However , that does can we blame the Minister. not matter. On some other occasion, will show the honourable member that is quite as wrong as usual. The point that the Minister of Defence cannot look after his Department without the support and assistance of expert military authoriing ties. The expert who advises him, whoscheme was approved. ever he may be, ought to be responsible to the Minister for the condition of Forces. When Major-General Hutton was here, that was the situation.' But in 1905, a very unfortunate change took place. had a new Defence scheme initiated, a Military Board was appointed, of which the Minister became a member. the Minister sits as a member of the Board, man. he cannot very well afterwards own work.

128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Technically , yes; more but in practice it is not so.",26
129,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister, as the civil head of the Department, is supreme. At all events, the honourable member for Parramatta will accept this proposition: thattraining in peace must always be directed to the work required of a military force in time of war. The object must, therefore, be in times of peace to place the Military Forces under some control, and some system of organization in which some person will be responsible who will command in time of war. Under our whom I class myself as one. present system, that condition is not attained. The Inspector-General does not command. He only inspects. It is that he has powers of veto and of obstruction tion, but he has no powers of construction. tion. He does not command or direct or control in time of peace, and yet - he is to be the commanding officer in time of war. Consequently, I think that the whole cratic military service at the present time is an unfortunate position. We cannot blame bound to be failure. the members of foe Military Board, nor It is like a I man placed in a responsible position surhe rounding himself with a Committee.

131,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There were, but when trouble arose' the Minister of Defence We could always turn to the General Officer and Commanding, Major-General Hutton, and say, ""That thing ought to be altered."" When Major-General Hutton was the responsible He was in command, and could see criticise his that lie was obeyed.",26
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And he was which he bundled Home for doing it.,26
133,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That largely resulted from Major-General Hutton's unfortunate of tact in dealing with other men, and also frorri the fact that he had to bring into existence a new system relating to the he defence affairs of six different States.",26
134,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I think that the General Officer Commanding system was in existence in all the States prior to Federation. .,26
135,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes . I cannot speak of the' effect in all the States, but in Victoria, considering the amount of money we had to spend on military matters-no t more than Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 - our Defence Force was far efficient, loyal, and content than it has since been. The members of the Force had the feeling that they were being properly led, and could face the work that they had to do with far/ more certainty that if war. came they could, so far as their numbers would permit them, do themselves credit.",26
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That was unquestionably the case in New South Wales also.,26
137,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Ver y well, then; what is the reason for the discontent which exists at present ?. It does not exist merely among politiciansand among junior officers-of If you talk to any senior man in the service he compares with great discredit to the Commontrue wealth regime the present with the condiof things that existed before Federa",26

If you start ruling an autobody, as a military force ought to be, in by means of a Committee, the result is If honourable members will dome the honour of reading the remarks which I made on the third reading of the Bill which inaugurated the new defence system in 1905, they, will see that I predicted the state of things which I say has since happened. I know that it is a dangerous thing to say "" I told you so,"" but I do feel that I had the prescience to see clearly the position in which ter would be placed with a Military Board of no authority. Is there any one in this Committee who can look with any degree of satisfaction upon the present situation and <;onsider what would happen if Australia were attacked ? ' I think that the Minister contemplates the position with less satisfaction than any of us. I must say that he has done his best to improve things. Now the Military Board is supposed to be composed of certain officers who will give to it continuity of purpose. That was the principal ground upon which its constitution was recommended. It was said that the system of having .general officers commanding was simply that of bringing officers from England who in a short time would go back again, without giving to our policy any continuity of purpose whatever. But since the Military Board was appointed, it seems to have become simply a sort of fighting ground for better pay and better-commands. It was stated in the press some time ago- I cannot say whether the facts are correct-that Colonel Wallack, the present chairman of the Military Board, was last year receiving ^""600 a year, whilst Brigadier-General Gordon was receiving Â£900, and the State Commandant of Victoria Â£800. That is ""to say, the man who presided over the Board, and had sometimes to severely criticise the Commandants as its chairman was receiving less pay than his subordinates. I do not blame Colonel Wallack for trying to obtain the State commandantship of Victoria, which meant a lif t from Â£600 to Â£800. Nor do I blame Colonel Stanley, the Chief of Ordnance, who, I believe, was trained as an ordnance officer, for trying to improve his position, in which he received a salary of Â£650, by attaining a State commandantship at Â£800.",26
140,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The last D. A: G. ""received Â£900.",27
141,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I think that Colonel Wallack, while Chairman of the Board, received Â£600 per annum. I do not see how he could get more, unless more was paid to him before Parliament authorized his increase Mr E\viNG ---I think he received Â£75Â°",27

153,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The same situation arises in regard to the English Council of Defence. ',27
154,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But instead of working out an Australian Defence scheme of our own, such as the Minister will perhaps some day lay before honourable members, we are slavishly following English precedentswithout having English conditions. If we had English conditions here-if we had an enormous body of troops, if those troopsconsisted principally of permanent men, if we had at our command a body of officers' possessed of the experience and ability of officers of the British Army, if we had the tremendous range of ability that they have,' if we had officers who were constantly getting experience in border wars all over the Empire-ther e might be some reason for following English precedents here. But it is: a very great mistake to adot>t the English system when Ave have'not English conditions. If without violating the Act the. - Minister could utilize the servicesof the Inspector-General as a General Officer Commanding, I believe that the system would immediately improved. If , of course, present Inspector-General failed in that capacity he would have to make way for another officer. But at present the situathe tion is that the Inspector-General, who are told would in time of war have to lead our troops, does nothing but make inspectransferred tions and write reports. Certainly capable of criticising every part of our fence Forces, but he does not occupy position of command. The fault, that I find with our Defence system at present that instead of having a Federal Defence Force as we ought to have, we have only union of sixState systems.

In Victoria, six or eight months ago, one member of the Military Board was able to defeat another in a competion tion for the Commandantship of the State, the late Chief of Ordnance and artillery expert, Colonel Stanley thereby getting his salary increased from Â£ 6 5 0 to a year. Colonel Robertson had previously been acting as Commander of the Field Forces and District Commandant of Victoria. He has led in the ' field as many as 4,000 troops, whereas be guided by them. Colonel Stanley has all his life been connected with big guns, and has never more than 280 men under him. Although "" stick to a pal."" he has absolutely no knowledge of field work, he has been put in charge of .Victorian Forces. If war arose, I , with any 'one. the other militiamen, would have to follow him into the field; but .if I asked any to serve under him, I should be knowingly be asking him to commit suicide. If Colonel the Stanley was not receiving a sufficient salary, his salary should have been increased ; but he should have been kept in position of Chief of Ordnance, for we which his training fits him - It is not right that an artillery expert should be from his proper duties to be he is put in charge of field forces.

The first Chief of Ordnance, Colonel le Mesurier. was attracted by the a State Commandantship of Western Australia ; but he has already grossly offended the rifle clubs there, as can be seen from the papers in the Library.

166,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I believe that one could learn a great deal about defence in that time. Nine-tenths of it is common sense. If an expert cannot satisfy me that what he proposes would be a sensible thing to do in every-day life, I refuse to sanction his proposal.",29
167,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What does the Minister do when experts differ?,29
168,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As a rule, if two experts' are appointed to settle a question, the result is, not a decision, but a quarrel. All I can do in certain cases is to accept theopinions given to me.",29
169,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I thank the Minister for his interposition, and admit that he is doing his best. I have not brought any matter before him with which he has not tried to deal reasonably. My point is that the Chief of Ordnance should know something about ordnance, and when the new scheme is under consideration, I hope that the Minister will be able to provide for responsibility in regard to re-organization. I shall be glad for him to remain in office some years longer, because he has done good work. We have had too 'many changes of Ministers.'",29
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,This is the first Minister who has satisfied the honourable member.,29
171,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He has not done all that I wanted.,29
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He - is the only Minister whom the honourable member has . not attacked fiercely.,29
173,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister should be grateful for 'the light which I throw upon the working of his Department, which enables him to know of things which would otherwise be concealed fromhim. He usually finds my. suggestions reasonable, and acts accordingly.",29
174,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am ready to inquire into any matter brought before me'by any honourable member, and to do what I think right in respect to it.",29
175,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister has said that on more than one occasion. With regard to the field artillery, he stated yesterday that, in his opinion, a-field artillery-man should have forty-two days' training.",29
176,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I said that that would not .be an extreme period. Mr CROU.CH - It might be ""too short.",29
177,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,it might,29
178,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Does not that reply give away the case for proposing to use militiamen or volunteers for field artillery ? Such men could not afford to undergo forty-two days-' training. The Boers found to their cost that, while they could train infantry quickly, knowledge of the complicated machinery connected with the modern gun takes long training to acquire. Unfortunately, under the Act we cannot have permanent field artillerymen.",29
179,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not know how that came about.,29
180,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It was done in the face of my protest. Field - artillerymen cannot be employed permanently, and the Department gets over the difficulty, by using garrison artillery to form an instructional cadre for field artillery. The Minister stated in a recent interview that the garrison artillerymen ought to be confined to garrison work, which is practically an endorsement of the opinion that there must be a nucleus of permanent men for the field artillery.",29
181,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Unfortunately , there is no provision for them.",29
182,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I hope that the Minister will consider the matter in connection with the new defence scheme. Although he has been generally reasonable, I wish to mention an instance in which he has not done exactly what Parliament wishes to be done. There are some in his Department who deliberately try to prevent effect being given to the wishes of Parliament. The matter to which I refer is one to which I have been drawing attention during the last seven years-the granting of commissions to rankers. Section II of the Defence Act of 1903 provides thatIn the first appointment of officers, preference shall be given, in the case of equality of qualifications, to persons who have served in the Defence Force for three years without a Commission.",29
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But that Act is not carried out.,29
184,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am going to make an effort, so far as this matter, at all events, is concerned, to have it carried out. I may be described as an agitator for raising this question again and again, but I think that, in common justice to the ranker, we should see that this right is not denied him. If the Act had been properly administered for some time, the Minister would not find it as difficult as he dees to secure efficient artillerymen. When Senator Playford held office as Minister of Defence, the Prime Minister, on his behalf, offered to arrange for me to meet him and some of the officers of the Department, with the object of discussing an amendment of the regulations relating to the granting of commissions to rankers. Unfortunately, at the last general election Senator Playford was defeated. The Conference, however, took place, those present being the Inspector-General, Major-General Hoad ; the Chairman of the Military Board, Colonel Wallack; the Secretary of  present Minister of Defence, and myself. At that Conference it was agreed that arrangements ought to be made to enable rankers to compete for commissions, and, what is still more important, that, in all examinations, their military experience should be taken into account. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - That is precisely what is absolutely ignored.",29
185,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What is the use military experience on the part of candito dates unless they have a "" toney",30
186,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I was glad to find that military men like the InspectorAustralian General and Colonel Wallack were strongly must havein favour of rankers being allowed this right, and to hear them admit the absolute necessity for better officers in the Department. The Prime Minister and the present Minister of Defence have always in favour of rankers being eligible for commissions, and the Prime Minister, inSeptember, 1905, said that he could not conceive of a Department in which first consideration would not be given to the professional experience of a man or an officer. At the Conference to' which I have referred,. however, I could obtain no definite assurance from the military men present. There seemed to be in the ground some person whom the officers were afraid to offend. It certainly was not the Minister, and the officers present agreed that the course proposed was the well as a preference to those who had rightthing to do.",30
187,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What did they do?,30
188,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"After a good deal of correspondence between the Department and myself, new regulations, dated 4th February, 1908, have been issued in retion gard to appointments to first commissions in the Roval Australian Engineers. the .first place, I find that those amended regulations disregard the preference granted tion. by the Act to candidates who have served for three years without a commission.",30
189,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They are presumed to be based on the Act.,30
190,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Act provides that, in 'the case of equality of qualification, preference shall be given to those who have served for three years in the ranks "" without a commission."" In these amending regulations those significant words are omitted.",30
191,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the omission make any practical difference?,30
192,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It does. I recognise that the Minister cannot do everything, but if I were a Minister, and my specific instructions 'were disregarded by a subordinate, I should refuse to provide on the Estimates for his salary until I had from him a satisfactory explanation. In 'thai way alone should we treat a number of officers in this Department who have deceived the Minister and Parliament. It is provided in the new regulations for the of examination of candidates for appointment first commissions in the Royal Aus"" style? tralian Engineers, thatTo be eligible for appointment in the Soyal Engineers, a candidate . . . . (a) Served as a pupil for three yearsin engineering workshops during"" which one year shall have been spent in the drafting office; or, been That will exclude many men(4) served for three years as an articled pupil, or its equivalent, in a reputable civil engineering, electrical engineering, or architectural firm, or in a Government engineering or architectural office; or, (c) completed the three years' course for ? degree of bachelor of engineering, or its equivalent, in any university or technical school. backOnly such persons are eligible.",30
193,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The intention was to make the regulations as broad as possible, and to give ample opportunities to rankers as 1 served for 'three years. If the regulation does not carry out that intention I shall see that it is amended.",30
194,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The officer instructed"" by the Minister to draw up this regulahas evidently induced the Minister to cause the Governor General in Council to In pass these provisions, in the"" belief that they give effect to his expressed inten",30
195,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The officer may be under the impression that he has carried intention.,31
196,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Then the officer does net know his work. Will the Minister, be the fore his salary in the Estimates is. . reached, give us the name of the officer who drew them up?",31
197,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is it not a Board business ?,31
198,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Once again we find ing. it impossible to sheet home the responsicompetitive bility for these matters. The offender is a works out. committee, not a man.",31
199,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I repeat that if the regulation does not carry out the intention of the Act I shall see 'that it does. - Mr CROUCH - Honourable members will remember the case of Corporal Watts, which was discussed in this House in date September, 1905. General Gordon refused to allow Watts to go up for amination, holding that he had not the necessary qualifications; but when he permitted to present himself he beat his competitors. When his case was cussed in this House the Prime Minister promised that military qualification should be considered in the making of appointments - A perusal of the syllabus for the examination of candidates for comone missions in the Royal Australian Artillerytary hydrostatics and mechanics? will show how that promise has been carried out.. Warrant officers and men who have served three years in the. Roval Australian Artillery, may go up for amination, but the regulations have been so amended as to deprive rankers of the advantage of the three concluding words in section 11 of the Act of 1903.",31
200,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"How can the omission the words "" without a commission "" take away the preference granted by section to a man who has served three years in the ranks?",31
201,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The preference professional work. granted to such men is taken from them since the omission of the words places them on an equal footing with a large number of men who have held a commission for three years. The syllabus has - been divided, with a cuteness for which there is no apparent reason, into obligamake tory and voluntary subjects. The oblilast gatory subjects include arithmetic, 'algebra, geometry, euclid, plain trigonometry, mention, suration, elementary hydrostatics and chanics, and the use of logarithms. That is quite hard enough for a ranker to face.",31
202,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But things are better tRan out our they were, are they not?",31
203,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"They are very much better, and all my remarks are subject to consideration that the Minister, in this .connection, has made a very great improvement. Amongst the voluntary subjects are elementary hydrostatics and mechanics, English and Australian history, military engineering, map reading and field sketchWe must remember that this is a examination, and see how it According to the regulations a candidate, in order to count marks in a new voluntary subject, must obtain .5 marks in that subject. The regulation goes on to sayThe marks so obtained will be added to those gained in the obligatory subjects. The candiwho obtains the highest total number of marks in the obligatory and voluntary will (provided he has ""qualified "" in the obligatory exsubjects) receive the 'appointment.",31
204,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member's was contention is that this addition of the all marks, and so on, virtually renders the diswhole of the subjects obligatory?",31
205,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Absolutely . What chance would an ordinary sol.dier, after two or three years of service, have against any who happened to know all about elemenThe maximum number of marks is 1,350; and I have no doubt that any B.A. or matriculated student could easily obtain 1,250 or ex1,300.. But what I desire to point out most emphatically is that there are no subjects connected with the work which the soldiers will have to perform in the future. How can we have good artillerymen, if we do not find out their qualifications as artilof lerymen at the examination? Three years at Queenscliff or any of the other stations n are not calculated to keep up a man in mere text-book education, and the examination, as I have said, is absolutely silent on real",31
206,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall look into the matter again, and I hope there will be as much' improvement after the next revision as the .honourable member has been good enough to acknowledge took place after the first.",31
207,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the Minister will as much improvement as he did the time, he will satisfy a large number of men who desire to enter for this examinabut who at present regard such a step meas absolutely hopeless. Four commissions in the Royal Australian Artillery are advertised for competition; but, under such conditions,. what rankers could enter? I am quite sure that if the Minister were put on military duty at Townsville or ThursdayIsland for two or three years, he would not care to face an examination in the first three books of Euclid, or enter into a competition with more highly educated or trained minds when his schooling had become rusty. I question very much whether the way in which these regulations are drawn does not render nugatory the desires and opinions of Parliament - statement. Mr EWING : - I shall look into the whole matter again, and do the best I can.",31
208,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have to thank the Minister for the attention he has given to this matter. I have to add that the honourable gentleman has been very goodto the men whose cause I have been fightingthere has been no Minister of Defence so obliging and reasonable in every way.,32

213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Yes ; and one very serious complaint I have against the Minister is that he has deliberately broken his word to me in connection with a very grave matter ,32

215,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I ask the honourable member for Parramatta to withdraw the statement to which exception has been taken.,32
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Certainly , I 1 withdraw, and say that the Minister did not keep his promise; though I think that is much the same as I said before. There is abundance of proof in the House of the truth of what I - am saying; indeed, the Minister's own colleague could confirm my However, the matter is not ripe for treatment yet, though there is a - nice little drama unfolding.",32
217,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I am quite prepared to inform the House as to any action I have taken.,32
218,Mr TOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But the matter is riot complete, and, in the interests of the men themselves, I do not care now to discuss it. I do not blame the Minister altogether, except for the fact that he promised, not only myself, but the House, that the matter should be rectified.",32
219,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have much hope- I thought I could. .,32
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In my judgment, there was absolutely nothing in the way of the Minister doing what he promised.",32
221,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I wonder why every Minister of Defence for the' last eight years has not done it !,32
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Because the opportunity never occurred as it did to the honourable gentleman, who declined to take advantage of it. *",32
223,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is the honourable member referring to Major Leriehan?,32
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am speaking of a captain who has commanded a regiment for two years, with a captain's pay and privileges, and who has a career behind him such as few in this country have, or may ever hope I to have. However, I do not desire tq deal with the matter now, because, as I say, the time is not ripe. I wonder why the Treasurer looks at me so pathetically when I refer to this subject! I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman has an opinion of his own on the matter. Then, I . am unfortunate in other respects. For four or five years, I hatfe been endeavouring to have a rifle range provided at Parramatta, a place of 12,000 inhabitants.",32
225,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There never has been one there, has there?",32
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No , and I cannot gat one.",32
227,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall arrange for ittrust me, and it will be all right!",33
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It took all the resources of the Department to discover that a range could not be found at Parra>matta.,33
229,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Who is the commandant over there?,33

231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have not the pleasure/ of General Gordon's 'acquaintance; but I suppose that in another five years we may hope for a range. Then, in another part of my electorate,"" the Minister has recently abruptly closed the rifle range. Mr - EWING - I had nothing to do with it.",33
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the .Minister say that he is not responsible?,33
233,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I say I knew nothing about.it. I shall make a statement when the honourable member sits down.,33
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I did not say that the Minister knew anything about the matter. His officers go the length of ripping up the arrangement of twenty years, and then they report to the Minister that they have done it.",33
235,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member is sometimes hard on me for not following the advice of experts, but experts did this thing.",33
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I say that this is a simple case of administration. That is all. ' It is no expert matter. Here is a case in which there is a company of riflemen seventy-five strong, who have had a range in a gully for eighteen years past; and all at once some interested land-owner reports that some bullets are dropping on his property. We cannot get to know who the land-owner is, or where the bullets have dropped. They cannot be traced. All that 1 the land-owner has to do, however, is to make a complaint to the Department, when, without an atom of consideration for the riflemen, the range is absolutely closed. The riflemen are not even consulted about it, or told that it is intended to close it. They have no opportunity of making a complaint before the thing is done..",33
237,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is the honourable member quite sure that the Minister himself did not tell him about this matter first?,33
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; the secretary of-the rifle club told me about it. The Minister certainly did not. All the infor0 mation that the Department has on the subject is contained on one sheet of paper containing a report of about 100 words, and it has taken the Minister a fortnight to get even that. There is not a word from the State Commandant about it. The Commandant in New South Wales seems to have nothing to do with anything of this sort. One finds his initials on a paper or two, and that is all. If anything could be more inept and more absurd than the methods of procedure of the Defence Department I do not know of it. Do honourable members mean to tell me that the Minister is not responsible for that kind of thing ? It is a Ministerial matter pure and simple. If the Ministeris content to allow his officers to do this sort of thing he must accept the responsibility.",33
239,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Minister has too many military experts looking after things.,33
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"This is not a matter of expert knowledge, or anything of the sort. It is a pure matter of business administration-as to whether officers are to be allowed to close ranges and deprive riflemen of privileges which they have enjoyed for twenty years, without paying them or the. Minister the compliment of reporting about it until called upon to do so. That is the complaint I have, to make.",33
241,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They do. worse things than that.,33
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,If I were Minister they would not 'do them.,33
243,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the honourable member think that I am too easy-going? I do not think.that my officers think so.,33
244,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The most active Minister we have ever had.,33
245,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Eve n the deputy leader of the Opposition cannot find it in his heart to blame the Minister seriously.,33
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I seem to be the unfortunate victim, for certainly I cannot get a thing done in the Department. This range is closed in my district, and when I go to the Minister he says "" What can I do?"" I have tried to help the Minister in every way I could. I furnished him with a series of photographs, showing, the range from every point of view. The report states that the district is thickly inhabited. There is not a single house on the range or anywhere near it-no t one. The report also says that there are a number of cross roads in the neighbourhood. Now and again in the bush honourable members have, I dare say, kicked their foot against a stump marking a road. That is the sort of road that is to be found this estate. The rangeis in a gully. A more perfect place for a rifle range there could not be. Nothing in the neighboursaw hood has been altered for the - last ten years. presented. Not a house has been put up anywhere. If the Minister could see the place, he would uated? not hesitate two minutes about restoring to the riflemen the privileges they have had, GladesviLle. and of which they have been deprived withwhich out the slightest justificatlion. The men have been deprived of their opportunities of practising, and can get no satisfaction from any one. Surely some of these exSouth Wales. perts in Sydney could have gone up to clu|b and discussed the matter with the of men, with a view of determining howbest they could continue their useful practice. But instead of that the experts shut down the range and have since done nothing whatever. The men cannot find out for what reason the action has been taken. They would be delighted if they could ascertain who - the land-owner is. But the Minister does not know. must forgiveme if , with all these things taking place, I say that I do not not! think he is doing his duty in respect of the complaints that are made in my electorate. It is about time that a move was made'in New South Wales in regard to administrative, methods. I am not) pleading that the Minister should ride, rough-shod over .his officers, but I am ing that in connection with the administraconnexion tive work of his Department he should try Wales. to infuse a business spirit into them, so that grievances may be rectified without. being dragged on week after week and ber month after month, with the red tape lengtary thening by the mile whilst the affairs Department stand still. I believe that the explanation of the matter about which I have been complaining is that some one had bought a block of land somewhere near range. That is all we can surmise. I the riflemen could.find out the land-owner they might be able to make an arrangement with him.",33
247,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Has another range been provided ?,34
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; the men have been simply told that their old range is closed, and there is an end of it. They have not even been paid the compliment receiving an explanation from the officers responsible.  Mr JOSE PH COOK - I have done all that I could to bring tlhe matter under the on notice of the Minister. I got photographs for him showing the range from every point of view. I think he will admit that' he no house in the whole series of views  Mr JOSE PH COOK - It is near The condition of affairs has been revealed in connection with this case ought to be sufficient to make the Minister take action of a drastic character with reference' to these matters in New I know that the Minthe ister is more or less in the hands his officers, but . when he - gets glaring cases like this, of high-handed action-for I call it nothing but ruthless rough*-riding over men who are doing their best to serve the Commonwealth-h e ought to see that fair treatment is secured. He should insist upon his officers over in New South Wales - behaving as man to man, and should inform them that they ought not to He have closed this range without at least discussing the matter with the club. I am bringing this instance forward with the idea of ventilating a grievance. ' I do not suppose that my mentioning it will help me to get the trouble rectified. It may produce a nasty feeling on the part of the officers - But I cannot help that. I simply quote these cases as being symptomatic of saygreat want of administrative aptitude in with the Forces in New South",34
249,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable memconsiders the "" nasty feeling "" of miliauthorities when they are criticised, of the he will never get anything done.",34
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am quite indifferent about that. I make these remarks with a view of bringing about a change for the the better. Has the New South Wales f Commandant nothing to do with a matter of this sort? Why in the name of conscience do .we need to pay him Â£ 9 0 0 a year to control affairs if all he can do is to scratch his initials on a paper like this - whic h a boy could do for Â£ 5 0 a yeaT? It is about time that these officers were held to their responsibility. . I am afraid that they are not held to it as they ought to be at present. Perhaps, if they of were, serious trouble would arise. There' is a great deal of discontent, as the honourable member for Corio has pointed out. The whole service is seething with it . There has never been anything like it so far as I know. Things were infinitely better in New South Wales under State control than they have been since Federation. The honourable member for Corio says that it was the same in Victoria. One of the prime functions to be developed by the Federal Parliament was the defence of Australia. The very greatest of all the questions with regard to which it was considered that Federation would secure advantages was this. We were told that at least we should have an efficient defence service. But, as a matter of fact, things - are very much worse. Inefficiency is rampant, I am afraid. Certainly, dissatisfaction is. In my judgment, what is required in connection with military affairs is not so much a strong Minister as a strong man at the head of the Forces.",34

The sooner we get a strong controlling power applied to the military forces, the better it will be for our defence system.

He wished to establish a mobile army 25,000 or 35,600 strong; but the proper equipment was not provided. Lieutenant-Colonel MCCay asked for .Â£800,000 for the purpose, but the monev was not voted. It is useless to blame the experts. Major-General Hutton was. bundled Home before effect was given to his scheme.",35
265,Mr STORRER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That was the best placefor him. He broke up the force in. Hobart.,35
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Hobar t is not all Australia, and, in spite-of our criticism, the forces have the profoundest respect for Major-General Hutton, and think that he did good work. That is the viewtaken by the rank and file.",35
267,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not think so.,35
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They felt that they had a good soldier over them.,35
269,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member is depreciating Australians. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member seems to think that every criticises the existing state of things anti-Australian.,35
270,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I may be one-sided, but the honourable member is equally so, though in a contrary direction. He thinks everything imported good, and everything Australian bad.",36
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is unforthe tunate that the honourable member permits himself to say what he knows is not correct. Something has been said about the M i l tary Board. I have never been much in favour of having such a Board.' While the devolution of power may be admirable in large army, where supreme Imperial interests are at stake, I think that, considering the size of our Forces, the more direct unitary we make the control, the better it amongst others. will be for efficiency. It is said that the Bou'd hardly ever meets.  not meet. The Board is always meeting.",36
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the MinPrime ister pay consideration to its recommenda-. tions ?,36
273,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,When I think that they right.,36
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Minister did not consider the Board capable of givheart and soul. ing advice in regard to the defence of Australia.,36
275,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,On general principles well-informed layman'knows as much as member of the Board.,36
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The present dition of the' Forces is chiefly due to the Prime Minister, who has made himself the spokesman for the new order of defence - The Prime Minster has riot given any Minister time to gather together Minister's scheme. the threads of the Defence Department, and to apply his experience and ability the solution, of its problems. - Mr CROUCH - There have been only two Minister's of Defence under the present Prime Minister. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - This Ministry invited to do. has been in office since the States rated.  MCLean Ministry?",36
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It was in office for a very short time, but ifs Minister of Defence did more to get at. the bottom things than any other whom we have had.",36
278,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He introduced the Board system which the' honourable member conput demns.,36
279,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"-He adopted a draft made one who by the Labour Government. is - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - My recollection is that he was not enthusiastic about the scheme, but determined to give it a trial. I do not think that the Board has done much good, and the sooner we have a unitary control the better it will be for the Forces. The trouble all along has been at top. We are told that when anything important has to be done, the State Commandants are regarded as of no account. i - Where is there in Australia a Commandant who would be likely to be consulted tomorrow in regard to any important question a affecting the defence policy of Australia?  expression to their opinions, and the invitaanjl tion was extended to the honourable member",36
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"My complaint is that I do not know what I have to critidoes cise and discuss. Some excellent speeches have been made. As I said last nightthe Minister is a first-class showman to dress a shop window. He does the work admirably, but the honourable member for are Maranoa does not know what he means in regard to the new defence policy. ",36
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I venture to say that the honourable member does not know a definitely what the new scheme, is. He does a' not know for instance what the Prime Minister proposes, to do in regard'- to the conMilitia or the Volunteer Forces. ",36
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not, and I shall listen with great interest to the honourable member's exposition of the Prime Meantime, I would point out that it seems to be varying every to day. Day after dav we have some modification of it. That is rather a good thing, but we must wait at least until the com-plete scheme has been unfolded before we shall be able to criticise it as we have been So far as I am able to 1 fedejudge, the scheme requires a great deal more explanation. We are supposed to be the Swiss method of a citizen soldiery. ",36
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am comineto of that point. I had not intended to touch upon this phase of the question, but there is one consideration that I should like to before the Minister in passing. I understand that Switzerland-that little congested mountainous country, for which room could be found over and over again in one of our States-incur s on defence an expenditure of Â£1,500,000 per annum. regard to the difference in values that expenditure is equivalent to at Â£3,000,000 per annum in Australia. That being so, how are we going to establish a system of defence over 3,000 miles of territory without any increase in our Estimates ?  that there will be an increase. ' Mr TOSEPH COOK - He says that there will be no increase on the militar side.",36
284,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There will be an increase of about ,Â£200,000. Has the honourable member considered the number of men in the defence forces of Switzerland?",37
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is not material to the issue as to the efficiency, of the defences of Switzerland, and those of Australia. The honourable gentleman and his chief have laid it down that pur ideal should be to secure a. force at least as cient as is that of any other part of the world. How is that efficiency to be obtained from the expenditure proposed, when, having regard to 'values in the two countries, the cost of Switzerland's defence is equal to ,Â£3,000,000 - per annum. How are we going to defend Australia, with its vast territory, for. Â£800,000, or /"".goo,000 per annum, under a scheme approximating to that adopted in Switzerland,- which involves an outlay of Â£1,500,000 per annum. I offer this criticism with the desire to obtain an answer. I do not intend to criticise the new scheme until it is placed before the House in concrete form. What has been done so far has been largely in the nature of fireworks. The Prime Minister is running what is just ""now a very popular show, and we shall find, when we come to touch the fanciful dream indulged in by him and the Minister of Defence, that things will not work out as they have been forecasting.  a policy will be no dream.",37
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,When we come to close grips with the question. we shall discover that it is no dream. The question I am suggesting will then have to be threshed out and the Government's scheme will wear a very different aspect.  bid the devil good day when one meets him ?,37
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Of course everything in regard to the defence of Australia is all right. Under our present sysHaving tem our Forces have been encouraged to such an extent that they are 3,000 below least the strength for which the Estimates provide. There is a shortage of 500 or. 600 officers and of about 2,500 men. There used to be no shortage of either officers or men. Why is there one today? Mr J.' R. CATTS - It must be due to Federation.",37
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is due not to the act of Federation, but to the fact at which I have already hinted, that since Federation no Minister of Defence has had an opportunity to mature a scheme of defence and to carry it to success. Minister after Minister has passed through the Department as if it were a mere stepping stone to some other Ministerial position. Instead of obtaining the best man for the office, keeping him there, and backing him up, the Prime Minister-has allowed five or six different members of the Government effi- to act as Minister of Defence. The result today is chaos.",37
289,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Would the honourable member have a permanent Minister of Defence?,37
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; but no Minister can formulate a scheme and carry it out successfully in twelve months. We have had five Ministers and five schemes in five years. With every new Minister of Defence we have had new defence proposals. And here we are today still going to do something. I am blaming not the present Minister of Defence, but the Prime Minister of Australia, for permitting such a procedure. He seems to have given more attention to the passing of Ministers through the Department, with an eye only to the political movements of the moment, than to the maturing of a proper defence scheme. We shall find the same' trouble ramifying through other Departments.  government.",37
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We have had one party in power during all these years. Why was the right honourable member for Swan removed from the office of Minister of Defence? Why was the honourable member for Eden-Monaro taken from that office?  it.,37
292,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The present Minister intimated last night that he too was tired of it.,38
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The trouble so far has been the constant changing of Minnever isters. The position is the same in regard to the Post and Telegraph Department - I On the average no Federal' Postmasterworking General has held office for more than about nine months. I appeal to the honourable member for Balaclava, as an old Postmassystem ter-General of Victoria",38
294,Mr WYNNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member should speak for himself. He, too, has held office as Postmaster-General in New South Wales.'",38
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am speaking for myself, and I am also appealing to the honourable member to say whether, as the result of his experience, he thinks that a Minister is able to gather up the threads of the Department, stretching, as they do, over a whole continent!, in six or seven months. That is the problem which we affairs have to face, and for its existence we must and all concerned. hold the Prime Minister, who disposes of these offices, primarily responsible. this system of changing that has caused the chaos existing at the present time both in the Department of Defence and in the Department of the. Postmaster-General. The honourable member for Corio asked afternoon what would happen tomorrow Australia if war broke out. If we desired to move 5,000 or 7,000 men from one of the States capitals 400 or 500 miles inland we should find it impossible to do so for many weeks, owing to the lack of equiptime this state of things was .altered. ment. Our Forces would fall an easy preyrefer to any enemy that might descend upon them, not because they are not well trained but because, for want of equipment, they could not be moved rapidly from one place to another. The matter is one not so much expert knowledge as for Ministerial action. The Minister, if he be a man of common sense and penetrative ability, is just-as as any soldier to discuss questions of equipbattle-field, ment and mobilization, though, of course, in regard to all the technical arts of war he must rely on his experts. . Mr MCWILLIAMS - The commissariat is the chief consideration in war.",38
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite so; but I understand that the defects in equipment are to be remedied. This is a step in right direction, which I hope to see followed until we have a mobile army capable of moving at short notice to repel any raid made on our coasts. When we have done that it will be time enough to.talk of some new and airy scheme. We have never yet had a perfect scheme carried out; we have taken the trouble or time or gone to the expense of evolving a perfect scheme. t is very convenient when one scheme is not well to propose another; but these changes only lead to chaos and trouble. I should hope and believe that our defence could be changed with efficiency and ability, and every prospect of success, if I saw that the most w.as being made of the present limited means at the command of those in authority. We have 21,000 officers and men, and yet I guarantee that tomorrow we could not raise an army of any description for immediate effective work. These men could not be moved, and all the trouble, in my judgment, arises from the absence of administrative ability at the head. Our trouble is not with the rank and file or ordinary officers, but is with those at the head; and the sooner that condition of is altered the better for Australia Whether we have militia or permanent forces, we must have It is the best ability at the top; and if that best ability be amongst the volunteers-and I believe a good deal of it is there, though it does not receive proper encouragement-it ought to be recognised and placed in 1 this command. There should beno feelin ing of estrangement between the two branches of the forces. So far as I can ascertain, volunteer and militia ability is being squeezed and starved .to death-it gets no ""show"" at all ; and it is about I again to the way in which we have treated our men in Australia who have proved their worth in the defence of their country. I know of half-a-dozen men in the militia or the volunteers who did splenfor did service in South Africa, and yet whose value is not recognised by the Government. What has been done is to strip them of the able attributes which were rightly theirs on the and to take their privileges from them. There are today men'in Australia who could have commissions in the .British Army if they chose; and yet we can find no means of promoting them to even a subordinate militia position here.",38
297,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If there was any "" stripthe ping "" it was done by General Hutton.  orable member for Parramatta is correct in his latter statement, seeing that there are retired Imperial officers, who are endeavouring to find positions in the Australian forces today. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That has no relevance to what I said. What I said was that there are officers in Australia today who have been invited to enter the Imperial service.  : publiclv stated - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - And , therefore, we may take it that those men are qualified to serve in high positions in the Imperial Army, though they are not considered good enough for such positions in Australia.  say that the Australian officers are not con- ever. sidered good enough.",38
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is the fact. I have just .told the honourable member of one case--""Of a man who is commanding a regiment on a 'captain's pay, although he was good'enough to be a colonel in South Africa, where, time and again, he received the personal commendation of Lord Kitchener. That man, however, is a captain today.",39
299,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Whose fault is that ? Wasthat not General Hutton's own action?,39
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No .,39
301,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I can show how General Hutton advised the Government in the matter. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Does that relieve Ministers of their responsibility?,39
302,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member has been talking about matters being all right when General Hutton was here, and I am pointing out that the action complained of was taken on his advice.",39
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I dare say that General Hutton recommended that promotion should not be made until the opportunity arose.,39
304,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Genera l Hutton advised the Government. not to make promotion in the cases referred to. I agree with the honourable member in this matter, and, in my opinion, it is unfortunate that the Government acted on General Hutton's advice instead of following their own judgment.  pathies are with the Australians.",39
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And I wish to measure the Minister's sympathy in practical effort.,39
306,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The officers cannot, all be made colonels.",39
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite so; all that is expected is that promotion shall be given when'opportunity offers. When opportunity does offer we do not desire those men to be subject, I was going to say, to the indignity - Mr EWING - Of an'examination.",39
308,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In my opinion the best men are the colour-sergeants, who never get any higher. In this respect the' same thing occurs in a democracy as in an autocracy.",39
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There should be no test in the army but the test of ability, and the best soldiers should have the best positions:",39
310,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is not the case, how",39
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is about time that there was a better recognition of our militia and volunteer forces.. I do not blame the Minister except in the one case when he felt himself weighed down by the traditions of his Department. The people of Australia have.no desire to stint the defence expenditure so long as they are satis.fied that the money is put to the best possible use.,39
312,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We have not got much for our money so far.,39
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We have not very little so far for our money; and that is the point, of my criticism this afternoon. Indeed, I am not sure that we are living in a fool's paradise. It is of no use having' trained and willing men, if we have not the power to combine them in a mobile force, and so put their training and ability to the . best. The Minister is doing something to rectify matters in this connection, and I sav good luck to him. But the honourable gentleman ought to take hold of the Department onits administrative side, and shake it up. Such a step could do no harm, and might do a great deal of good. I do ,not intend to discuss the new scheme' of the Government, and, as the Minister himself said last night, the Estimates are now so much Dead Sea fruit, seeing that nearly the whole of the year has expired, and we have bit by bit - parted with our control of the finances. There appears at last a prospect of something being done in the wav of the proper equipment of our forces. This is a work which should have ' been carried out long ago, representing as it does a crying need in Australia. Without such equipment our forces will continue to be inefficient, and unable to meet the demands that may be made upon them) and the sooner the present state of things is altered, die better for us all.",39
314,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Richmond-Minister of Defence) [5.35] - I should not have risen lo reply at this stage, but for the remark made by the honourable member for Parramatta about my breaking my word.'",40
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I withdrew that statement.,40
316,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is - a great deal in the point of view from which honourable members regard Defence questions. There was much with which I agree, and much with which I disagree in the remarks of honourable member for Parramatta; reiterate, a good deal depends upon the point of view, first , the honourable memcoming. ber said that the present system is deplorany able, and cannot be allowed to continue. On that point we are agreed, and the Gomentation vernment intend, as soon as possible, to troduce a scheme which will place the of the people of the country, not behind Government, but on the line of defence. .",40
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Minister says that the system is faulty, whereas we say that the administration is faulty.'",40
318,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the Defence Bill be introduced this year?,40
319,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Certainly . A number of officers and other people- I am not talking of permanent officers especially-say ' that a change will mean a great deal of trouble, and will never be carried out. We shall never have the desired change, less the people of Australia are in earnest. There is no trouble in the scheme outlined by the Prime Minister, if the people are alive to the danger of Australia. The Minvery ister of Defence, whoever he may be, can to numbers. do his share if the people really feel that this work of reform is worth doing. The honourable member for Echuca said auite are not efficient. truly that there are a number of young who desire to join 'the Light Horse, he asked why they are not enrolled. But of an officer. it' must not be forgotten that the Light Horse is the most expensive branch of service. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - And the most useendeavour ful.",40
320,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"At any rate, each man costs about Â£ 1 7 per annum.",40
321,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Why should it cost so much?,40
322,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is what it costs under the .present system. Each man has to have a bridleand so forth, and be paid jÂ£l o r JÂ£& a y i and the total cost'is what I have said. Such a force of. 100,600 men would mean an expenditure of Â£ 1 , 7 0 0 , 0 00 per .annum, on this branch alone. The system - really breaks down from cost, and there is a feeling that every man ought to assist in defending his country, and ought not to use his work of defence as a means of making money. The present system provides for a little over 20,000 men on a peace footing. It is simply ridiculous to regard the training of such a number of men as an adequate defence for a continent like Australia.",40
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If we cannot make the 20,000 men efficient, how can we make but to 100,000 men efficient? Mr EWING,-There is a better dayI could never understand how one connected with any branch of the military organization could oppose the augof its numbers. It is all right in intime of peace. It is very pleasant to wear whole a uniform. But we have to contemplate the these matters, not from die aspect of times of peace, but from that of our requirements in time of war. Our military preparations are all a farce, .unless they are adapted for war. There is not a man in the Force today who, if war broke out, would not be thankful that Parliament was wiser than he was in making provision for from 100,000 to 200,000 armed men in Australia. We cannot go on in the present way - It is impossible. I am glad to have the support of the honourable member for unParramatta in that respect.",40
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Not with regard to' the sentiment as to numbers. I attach much more importance to efficiency than,",40
325,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But the honourable member is constantly saying that our . Forces No man in a remen sponsible position in this Chamber should and speak either highly or depreciatingly The man you speak well of is, of course, very well pleased, the but the other man savs, "" Why was I not mentioned?"" Therefore, a Minister should to keep out names. It is not fair to mention any. When honourable members mention any officer's name the Minister must be silent. If ever I have occasion to mention a name it will be for the purpose of asking Parliament to enable me fo deal severely with the officer in question.",40
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is not right to mention officers in that way, unless the' Minister is prepared to deal with them. e a r",40
327,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I quite agree with my honourable friend. When an honourable member says that' such-and-such a State Commandant is not doing his duty, I say nothing. If I have occasion to say that . a commandant is not) doing his duty, I shall go further than that. word with regard to the honourable member himself. He has referred to matters in connection with his electorate: I may state that when honourable members have brought matters before me I have never considered them from the point of view of the part of the House where honourable members sit. They have been dealt with solely from the aspect of whether the complaint was right or wrong. plaint is right, then, subject' to my judgment, matters are mended. If it is not well-founded, the facts are discussed with the honourable member who mentions them, and - we generally agree that the matter should not be interfered with. - The honourable member for Parramatta has mentioned particularly the case of Colonel Cox, and has said that I broke my word. I wish that he had put the case a little more pleasantly, but, of course, we are accustomed to little compliments of that sort. Mr. JOSEPH COOK : - I did not put too strongly.",41
328,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Colone l Cox is an officer who obtained a certain position in South Africa. I maintain, and have always maintained, that any officer who on the field of battle wins a . certain position should not afterwards be subjected to an examination up to that grade. officer in active service has won the rank of major he should not be put through a book examination to see whether he is fit to be a major. If on the field of battle he wins the rank of lieutenant-colonel, he should not afterwards be put through a book examination to see whether he is fit for that rank. Now, when I ' first went into the case,' I found to my astonishment that although every Minister of Defence had tried to solve the problem-whic h seemed a very simple one-the y had all given it up. I have frequently told the honourable member for Parramatta that if I had my way Colonel Cox would not - have been a cause of discussion.",41
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Minister said that he would give him his promotion.,41
330,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I found that the Commonwealth Government in the first instance held the same view as I have expressed a with regard to these officers. In fact it had been determined to give them the brevet rank to which they were entitled. But then Major General Hutton appeared on the scene, and said "" No, this must not be."" Thereupon the Government of the day accepted Just one Major-General Hutton's view. The honourable member for Parramatta states in one breath that if Major-General Hutton were at the head of the Forces everything would be all right;, and in the next breath he condemns me because I have, from the time which has elapsed, been forced to adhere to Major-General Hutton's dictum. The Government of the day withdrew from the position they had intended If a com- to take up, and the officers who had won their rank in South Africa were not made substantive. All that happened years ago. Of course, it will be understood that the mere giving of honorary rank is practically nothing.",41
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Minister is leaving out some facts. He should tell the Committee that-two colonels got their rank.,41
332,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I did not want to mention that fact in justice to Major-General Hutton. It is, however, a fact that he did choose officers for superior rank.",41
333,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Did he give any it reason for favouring two only ?,41
334,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not remember whether any reasons were given.,41
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"They were two very influential citizens, whereas Colonel Cox is only a clerk in the Railway Department.",41
336,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What the honourable member is saying is virtually a charge against If an Major-General Hutton. I want to keep clear of that.,41
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Minister is not putting the facts quite as they are.,41
338,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes , I am. I have had too much worry about this matter not to know the circumstances thoroughly well.",41
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I shall supply the missing details.,41
340,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Major-Genera l Hutton advised the Government of the day not to promote these officers. The Government took his advice and left the great mass of them without their promotion.,41
341,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is this kind of discussion that fills the service with discontent. ',41
342,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I presume that Major General Hutton must have had good reasons for what he recommended. He advised the Government to do certain things, and they did them. We will dismiss him absolutely from consideration. I will grant that what he did was right in his opinion.",41

But when investigating the matter fully, I discovered that to deal with Colonel Cox's case meant dealing with fifty other applications from .officers who wanted promotion without going up' for examination. They all desired to be promoted up to the rank which they had won in South Africa. One officer would say, "" I was' a major in South Africa, and now I want to be promoted to the rank of major without examination."" There were about fifty applications at the time. Then I commenced to "" smell a rat,"" to use an expression which a member of the Opposition might employ; although we do not talk like that on this side of the Chamber.",42
345,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How would the Minister express it?,42
346,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In other words, I commenced to realise that my sympathetic inclinations were taking me further than was justified by prudence !_ I asked for the matter to be looked info departmentally to ascertain how many cases of the kind there were. I found there were about 100 of them.",42
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And I say that there is not one case in the hundred that is analogous to Colonel Cox's case.,42
348,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The essence of thing is "" obtainingthe colonelcy without examination.",42
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No , obtaining the privilege of command when the opportunity occurred.",42
350,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Without examination. The point is whether the examination shall be held or not. When I found that there were 100 cases, I began to have a little doubt as to whether the problem could be solved. It was further complicated by the fact that a large number of men who had attained certain ranks in South ""Africa had afterwards passed the examinations for those ranks in this country. I therefore found that to do what was desired meant putting 100 officers up in the service without examination. In fact, it was an apparently impossible task. I do not say .that I have abandoned it yet. As the poet says, "" Hope springs eternal in the human breast."" . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Minister has' abandoned it.",42
351,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I tell the honourable member that I should be very glad to carry out my own desire. I told the honourable member that I would promote Colonel Cox if I could do it.,42

353,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I believed then that I could do it. But honourable members will see the difficulty when there are. 100 men to be dealt with.  Hutton come to promote two colonels and leave out the others?,42
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There are only three cases of this kind.,42

356,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member for Parramatta is aware that Colonel Cox will be provisionally gazetted in the next - Gazette.,42
357,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But has he not been commanding a regiment for a couple of years ?,42
358,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The point is that he has not passed his examination. It is only a question of examination. the Mr KELLY - Was he the only officer of his grade who did not receive promotion? Has not the Minister promoted other officers who have not passed examinations? . Mr EWING - There have been cases of provisional promotion. I felt that the provisional appointment of this officer was all that I could do before he passed the examination.  hurdle.,42
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He has done nothing at all. It is too late to do anything in that case now.,42
360,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Colone l Coxwas asked to go up for examination, and he went. He passed in three subjects, and there was sufficient justification in my opinion for promoting him provisionally until he passed in the others. - Mr FISHER - Othe r officers have not had that advantage.",42
361,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I know he is a good officer, arid worthy of any consideration which is departmentally possible. Let me now refer to another matter. Parramatta has existed for many years. It was established before I - was born, and even before the birth of the honourable member who now represents it in this Parliament. The people of Parramatta have never had a rifle range. When the Honourable member brought the matter under my notice I felt that there ought to be a range there. I not only took action departfnentally, but I wrote to personal friends on the subject. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Hav e we got it yet?.",43
362,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member, will get it. To show that matters have not been neglected in the honourable member's district, I wrote to personal friends there, and asked them to assist in finding a suitable place for the range if the military officers could not find one. A suitable place was discovered on the catchment area. Then arrangements required to be made with the Water and Sewerage Board. If I can get a matter concerning the Department helped along by using a little outside influence of this kind, I always do it. The result is that we shall have a rifle range in Parramatta, where there has never been one before. I trust there may be no further hitch-bu t one is never quite sure till finality is reached.. Then, take the case of the Ryde rifle range - For nineteen years the riflemen of Ryde were, in the habit of using a certain gully as a rifle range. But the officer in charge of rifle ranges reported it to be dangerous, and the Commandant closed it. When I heard of this, I informed the honourable member for Parramatta, telling him' that I would do the best I could. We had a discussion, and the papers were sent for. Finding that they contained only a brief statement, a sketch and a further report were called for, and when these were sent I showed them to the honourable member, who placed ""before me photographs of the locality, and stated facts which I think would have justified drastic action. Of course, a Minister cannot dismiss an officer for want of the business knowledge which is brought to bear on the affairs of everyday life. Before anything of that kind is done, he must be given a chance to understand what is required of him. Something has been said about the need for obtaining brains, ability, and energy in the service. There is plenty of brains and ability, and if I can interleave it with a little common sense and. practical business knowledge, as in bacon the fat is streaked with the lean, it will be a good thing for the country. Unfortunately, many officers seem to be content to do the little thing that falls within their department, and then drop the matter altogether, the trouble with armies everywhere being that intelligent action is rendered almost impossible by red-tape. I have sent another officer to Sydney with instructions to report to me exactly what he thinks of the position.",43
363,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"For what reason was the range declared dangerous? Because persons might walk over the hill from behind, not knowing that shooting was taking place ?",43
364,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There were other reasons, such as the position of the road on the eastern side, and the fact that population was increasing to the north-east.",43
365,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Any member of the general public could have been warned off the range by a notice board or a flag. Mr EWING' - An expert would probably not think of such an alternative. ; Mr KELLY - When the Minister finds that an expert has advised him unwisely, does he trust him again?",43
366,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I accept the opinion of experts only when they can show me that it is right. There must be a rifle range at Ryde; but if all the experts declare the present range to be dangerous, I cannot accept the responsibility of allowing it to be used.",43
367,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the Minister cannot trust his experts, he should sack them.",43
368,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It would be a terrible thing for any one to be killed.,43
369,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No Minister would allow the range to be used if all the experts reported it to be dangerous.,43
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Not after visiting it himself?,43
371,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No .,43
372,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Althoug h the experts recommend the closing of the Ryde range as dangerous, they refuse to recommend the .resumption of land behind the Randwick range, notwithstanding that all the residents of the locality say that the present arrangement is dangerous.",43
373,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No doubt, there will always be something to be put right, and, do what I may, I shall leave something for my successor to deal with.",43

377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have not said so.,44
378,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We are told that if we want a better military system we should obtain an English officer .and put him in charge, because our own officers will neverstacles be able to bring about a satisfactory state of affairs. But those who have studied the history of British wars know that mistake after mistake has been made, and that i has only been by blundering through, that victory has been gained. I could give hundreds of instances in which, although battles have been won, nothing but blundersome instances. ing took place at the commencement of the campaign. This is true, indeed, of the operations of foreign as well as of those English armies. When the British Army our Defence Forces. was before Sebastopol, and the question was whether to make an attack or wait for sity training. developments, we know how greatly the troops suffered for want of proper provision for their health and comfort. So, too, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war, the Pomeranian army was wiped out by the Frerich, notwithstanding the fact that the German Army subsequently proved itself to be the best in the world. There were similar occurrences during the Boer - war. Opinion was divided as to whether Colenso should be taken by a frontal attack or be outflanked, and although a frontal attack would have meant"" an immense loss of life, it is Questionable whether as many men did not subsequently die of typhoid and other diseases as would have been killed in actual fighting. Australians are probably as good fighters as any other people, and I believe that there is nothing that we cannot do well as others. But the men in the ranks of our Defence Forces differ from those in the army of the Old World, and if they were similarly handled there would be a revolution. Australian officers understand their men, and know how to treat tnem, and .although they have been adversely criti: wards, I believe that, in the long run, Australian supervision will be best. We must not follow slavishly the methods of the Old There was a time in thehistory of Great Britain when commissions were purso much being paid for a lieutenancy,- so much for a captaincy, and so on.. That system seemed to be bad, and the It wasalso provided that men might rise from the to be commissioned officers; but the want of education and social status of most of the rankers caused that to be discouraged. The same thing is happening here today. In my opinion it is very necessary that menshould be able to rise from the ranks on proving their ability to command. At the present time, however, there are many ob-' in the way of such promotions. For one thing, although a man who has risen to the rank of sergeant-major is supplied with a horse and uniform, if he were given a' t commission he would have to provide both for himself. Uniforms are very costly.",44
379,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A uniform costs Â£ 4 0 . ',44
380,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"More than that in We must bring about a system under which it will not be expensive to be an officer. That is necessary if we' of are to get the brains of the community into' I have no desire to speak slightingly of the value of a UniverI t is well that every man should have a good education, but an educated man is not necessarily the best of fighters. Yet, what do we find? Is it not a fact, that again and again a sub-lieutenant, who, because perhaps of a University career,' has been able to pass certain examinations, and so to qualify for a commission, is placed in charge of a detachment, although the sergeant-major below him, who has risen from the position of a private, and is familiar with every branch of the work, is far better fitted to command? - We must deal with these matters from a purely Australian stand-point, and get away from old-world usages. The on-y ' inference that could be drawn from a statement made this afternoon by the honourable' member for Corio was that artillery officers as were unfit to handle large bodies of men.",44
381,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He did not say that.,44
382,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I think that was the inference to be drawn from his remarks. There is a good deal of esprit de corps,in' the Army. The cavalry officer has very often a contempt for the artilleryman, and the artilleryman is very often .inclined to look down on the infantryman, and vice versa, Any one who has been in the regular forces or the militia in the Old Country, as the honourable member for Maranoa and I have been, knows that that is so. There is really no reason why an artillery officer should not be able to handle a big body of men. - Mr CROUCH - There is no case on record where a permanent artillery officer has been allowed to command citizen forces. '",44
383,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Lord Roberts was an artillery officer.,45
384,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"On e of the most successful generals of whom Great Britain can boast, Sir Charles Napier, was an officer of the engineers.",45
385,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And so was Lord Kitchener.,45
386,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I could name hundreds of artillery officers who have shown their ability to handle large bodies of men.,45
387,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Lord Roberts, until he reached the rank of major, was an artillery officer. . Mr MATHEWS - As a youngster in India, I used'to have the impression that he was a major in an infantry regiment. The present State Commandant of Victoria was a ranker, but, by study, qualified for a commission. It is idle to say that because a man has been in the ranks he is not fit to take charge of a body of men. There is nothing like experience; it is only by experience that men can fit themselves to command. How is that experience to be gained ? Happily, we are not always at war, and our men, therefore, must be afforded opportunities for training in connection with various manoeuvres. I have no desire to labour this question, but, as one whose ancestors for six generations were rankers in the British .Army-m y grandfather was with Wellington, from the lines of Torres Vedras to the Loire, and my father enlisted for the Crimean war - I feel strongly upon it. The mere fact that the Victoria Barracks are in my electorate does not entitle me to pose as an expert, but we! have abundant evidence that men of the ranks are as capable of learning, and of qualifying for leading positions in our forces as are men in higher walks of life. These Estimates do not provide for the extension of the Naval - and Military Forces foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, but I am rather surprised that they do not include an item for enlarging the present naval depot at Williamstown.",45
388,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"-Arrangement s have been made, not for enlarging the Williamstown depot, but for a larger depot.",45
389,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should prefer the depot to remain at Williamstown. The exigencies of the situation may require it to be removed; but, to my mind, the Williamstowm site is a good one. We have had a depot there for some years, and there are many reasons why that depot should be retained. There is ample land, for its extension. I desire now to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence to the Estimates relating to the Ordnance Department. I notice that provision is made for an inspector of ordnance machineryin the Estimates relating to Victoria. The duties of that officer extend all over the Commonwealth, and I fail to see why he should not be a staff officer in the Central Administration.",45
390,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member is referring t'o Major Harding.,45
391,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am. If it is necessary at the present time to have an inspector of ordnance machinery, surely that necessity will be greater by-and-by. It will be observed, however,. that no provision is being made to train men for that position. The office is in the professional division, and the occupant of it ranks as a major. We are told that nearly every man one meets' ini America is a colonel, and military titles certainly seem to be on the increase here. The machinery section of the Ordnance Department was at one time on the civil side of the service, but we now have an ordnance machinery corps.",45
392,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Artificers . I.think they have always been on the military side.,45
393,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not think so. In the old days the officer in charge, who was a man of exceptional ability, showed that the men were not receiving payment commensurate with their services, and ultimately a change was made. But whilst the head of the corps is a major, the ""officer next to him in Victoria is merely a warrant officer artificer, and I believe that that post is. to be done away with. Tha't' being so, the next officer to the major in charge will be a staff sergeant artificer, drawing ns. per day. How can we hope to have men trained and ready at any time to take the place of the inspector when we have so wide a gap? It seems to me that tha officer in charge of the Department, whilst increasing the importance of his own office, keeps down those under him. It seems absurd that we should have one man drawing Â£ 5 6 0 per annum,, and the officer next to him receiving only 1 IS. per day.",45
394,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member thinks 'that the gap is too wide?,46
395,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do. In the event of the inspector being incapacitated, who is to take his place?",46
396,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He is a specialist, I presume?",46
397,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He is no greater specialist than is the officer below him, who is drawing only 11s. per day. Harding himself was, I think, a fitter and turner or engineer; and, under the old system, he rose to his present position. Now, however, he has, by the present system, made it impossible forothers of similar qualifications to rise in the same way, although they may possibly have had a better training than himself. not forget that these are professional men, who understand thoroughly the mechanism of a gun, and can Â«repair and make it fit for use.

399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on the field. When he returned to Australia he went back fo his position in the regiment, and, asking for nothing, was content so to serve. Later on, Colonel Burns resigned, and was succeeded by Colonel Vernon, who, however, almost immediately afterwards also resigned. Captain Cox then, became the senior officer; and he was recommended for the appointment by both' of his superiors. However, the authorities in New South Wales began to demur to giving Captain Cox the command, raising all sorts of obstacles. Cox, not acting of his own accord, but on advice of others in the ser- . vice, made application. I may here say that Captain Cox desired to resign longago, rather than fight this matter; and it is not due to him' in the least that we are discussing his position today. There were others in the service in New South Wales who thought it was time to take a stand for simple justice; and, on their suggestion, Captain Cox put in a claim for a command under section 22 of the Defence Act, which is as follows :The Governor General may appoint any person to be an officer or promote an officer for distinguished service, or for marked ability and gallantry in active service, without' his .passing the prescribed examination. That is how the trouble began. The Government declined to give. Captain Cox his rank; but, as he could not be passed over, he was appointed to the command of the regiment. One would have thought that an officer of such distinguished service would, at least, have been given the privileges and rank of such a position, if only temporarily. ' But, as a matter of .fact, although he has been commanding the regiment for two years, he is still receiving the comparatively paltry pay of a captain. This is a position of affairs which the Minister could alter without doing an injustice to any officer in the service, because there is not one who would raise the slightest cavil if Captain Cox were treated in the manner to which he is entitled. It is all very well for the Minister to point to hundreds of. other officers, but I ask whether those officers have colonelcies to accept - whethe r there are opportunities to put them in command even if the Minister were so disposed. There were two officers who went through the war in command of mounted infantry."" The moment Colonel Carington came back to Australia from the war he was given a provisional command.",47
400,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Who did that? It was not the Minister. Mn. JOSEPH COOK - I ' am not saying who did it, and I am not complaining. I will put the matter fairly. Colonel Carington was given pay privilege and rank as a colonel. Later on another command fell vacant, and Colonel Riley was at once appointed ""to the' provisional command of a regiment, with the pay and privileges of his rank. - Mr EWING - That was years ago, too. Captain Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Not long ago. At any rate, these cases occurred when there were opportunities for promotion. That , is the point. Further, Colonel Riley, was given two years in which to pass his examinations. I say now that he ought not to have been asked to pass any examination in view of his distinguished services in South Africa. But in the meantime he enjoyed the pay and privileges of his rank.",47
401,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is what I am going to do in the case of Colonel Cox now.,48
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is . what the Minister has ndt done.,48
403,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I told the honourable member outside today that that was arranged for. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - Does the Minister say that Colonel Cox is to get his pay and privileges from the time pf his appointment to the command?,48
404,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not say that.,48
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is the point.,48
406,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have done all that I could within my powers.,48
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"This officer has served two years in command of a regiment on captain's pay. Then, finding that there was no other possible means of getting the recognition which was his due, he at last consented to go through the examination. He was considered good enough by Lord Kitchener to be intrusted with the independent command of troops in South Africa, and he was afterwards called up and congratulated upon' 'the splendid work which he had done. is, I venture to say, one of the men whom Lord Kitchener would ask for tomorrow if Australians were going to take part in another war. But when 'this officer returns to Australia we find that he is put through out-of-door manoeuvres by men who have probably never been to a battle-field. Indeed, I doubt whether, if some of them were suggested to Colonel Cox - as officers who should go with him into a fight, he would not ask for them to be left behind. These are the men who are now engaged in examining Colonel Cox as to his qualification to command troops-.",48

409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Her e is his record. He commanded the third contingent of New South Wales mounted troops, con: sisting of 1,020 men. - Mr CROUCH - Did he have colonel's rank in South Africa? Mn. JOSEPH COOK - He received his lieutenant-colonelcy from the British Government. He was promoted on the field. Not only that, but he was given a C.B.",48
410,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But was he actually a lieutenant-colonel in South Africa?,48
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes , most certainly. He joined Colonel Rimington'scolumn, and remained with that officer for a year-until Lord Kitchener's big drive at Harrismith, Then Kitchenerde-. tached him from Colonel Rimington, and gave him 'the independent command of a column. He went through the remainder of the war in command of a column. His rank was then that of lieutenant-colonel.",48
412,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The official list which I hold in my hand does not say that he received a lieutenant-colonel's' commission.,48
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I tell the honourable member the fact-that today he is a lieutenant-colonel in the British Army.' I am quoting from the official record. There is no doubt whatever about it . But the Federal Government would not even pay him the compliment, when they gave him the command of a regiment, of giving him more than captain's .pay. I want to know why this man, who has no powerf u l friends, has had to wait for seven years for his opportunity, and why he is singled out for this treatment, so different from that. accorded to others who-have net seen a tithe of his service? He",48
414,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Single d out for different treatment than that accorded to Colonel Carington and another officer; but he was treated just the same as a number of others. I can only refer the honourable member for the reason to the General Officer Commanding at the time-Major-Genera l Hutton.,48
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But is that an answer? If Major-General Hutton took no notice pf this' man's claims, is that any reason why the Minister of Defence should not, when the opportunity occurs,'do him a simple act of justice ? There is not a single man in the hundred of whom the Minister talks, who would have raised the slightest cavil at a mere act of justice being done to this officer. These are the facts of the case, and I propose to leave 'it there. I have no doubt' that Colonel Cox will get through somehow.

416,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Hear , hear.",49
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Such are the facts of the case. Â»Colonel Cox is today devoting himself, with all the assiduity and loyalty of his character, to the service of his country. He is a man who would have been in a far better civil position today if he had not stuck so closely to this hobby of his. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Such men ought to be encouraged.",49
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the Citizen Forces are to be encouraged, the Government must not treat in this fashion men whodevote their lives to their hobby, and who have succeeded in winning the highest commendation from the best officers in the British Army.' This is no proper return to make to such a man'as that.  to add a few words to what has been said about the. case of Colonel Cox by the honourable member for Parramatta. I agree that this officer has been very badly treated. When a man risks his life, and gives up comfort and the prospects of civil advancement, to serve his country in war, whilst the feather-bed soldier stays at home, it is humiliating, when he returns, fo find that the men who have looked after their own private interests, have received all the good things. There seems to be something very "" fishy"" indeed about the whole casei. We have been ,told :'that two officers, on their return from South Africa, got their local rank, and that, as soon as there was an opportunity, they were put into positions of command. This officer, however, after his fine service in South Africa, was required to pass an examination.",49
419,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is another case of the kind in Queensland, as the honourable member knows.  The Queensland officer, whose name I will not mention, served with honour and distinction in South Africa, and was mentioned in despatches. His services were publicly recognised, by both Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, on the field of battle. He was giyen promotion for them, and was a born soldier, - brimming over with enthusiasm for his work. But when he returned to Australia, what happened? He found that while he was away, he had lost his promotion irt his regiment, and was told that he would have to return to the same position that he occupied when he left, or take none at all. Being a highspirited individual, he said , "" If this is the 1 treatment I am to get, I will have no more of it "" ; and he-forthwith left the service. When an officer returns from war with the record that Colonel Cox has, there is something - wanting in our military system if we do not see that he gets a "" square deal."" The Department must know what this man has done. Surely it is more honourable fo be promoted on the field than by mere seniority. It is too humiliating to put such an officer under instruction or examination from men whom he could teach in matters of military tactics. When there was an opportunity for the Government to step in and do justice to this officer, I cannot understand why the Minister did not do it ",49
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He never askedfor anything until the opportunity occurred.  to be a soldier on the battlefield, surely that is the best proof of his fitness that we can have.",49
421,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is quite right.  case. There could be no better kind of examination than that which an officer undergoes in war.,49
422,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I quite agree that he should never have been asked to go up for examination.  officer has received seems to show that we do not want soldiers at all, but merely men who have a theoretical knowledge of military matters.",49
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Kitchene r passed him with honours.  ability' in the field, and an experienced soldier like Lord Kitchener thinks fit to call him up and say that he is deserving of a particular rank, it is a cruel' injustice to strip him of that rank when he comes back to his own country. We want experienced soldiers in Australia. We are constantly sending officers abroad in order that they may gain practical knowledge of the art of war. Here is a man whoreturns to us ready trained, and full of vim and enthusiasm; but simply because he has not social influence at his back, he 'does not get a "" square deal."" T say that that is monstrous.",49
424,Mr JH CATTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is this Committee impotent ?  wonder the honourable member for Parramatta, considering his forcefu'lness, has not made the Government do something in regard - to this officer much earlier. , Mr KELLY - On e has naturally some diffidence about bringing up the case of a particular officer.  that an officer has been cruelly wronged, he is wanting in his duty if he does not get the wrong righted. Although late in the day, I am glad that the action of the honourable member for Parramatta has had effect.",49

We are also asked to vote Â£580 for the Director of Stores, but the officer who fills that position is at present acting as accountant in the London office. Seeing that he is an expert in military stores, and particularly in clothing, the country needs his advice in connection with the proposed new 7 scheme of defence.",50

At the present time, the CEief Clerk is acting as Secretary, and, fortunately for the Minister, is doing the work well, he being one of the most capable officers in the De[358] partment. If (Captain Collins and Mr. Savage are needed in London, their positions in the Defence Department should be either abolished or filled by other officers. Coming to another matter, no doubt the Minister saw the statement in the Age a few days ago as to what is done with officers who have received special training abroad. Or. their return, they all seemto expect office billets. But men who have been sent to England or to India to increase their military education, instead of being put into offices, should travel about the Commonwealth, so that their knowledge may be imparted to the troops, and our Defence Minister Forces made more efficient. . Mr EWING - Instruction s have ' been given about that.  drew the attention of the Minister to this matter.

If we had a M i l i tary College in Australia we should have a full supply of officers. I hope, however, that we shall not deal with our officers as Captain Cox has been dealt with: As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, had that officer paid as much attention to his ordinary civil duties as he has done to his military hobby, he would have occupied a better position than he does today. When a man is prepared to sacrifice something for patriotism we ought to be ready to sacrifice something for him. I know of a Victorian who, after serving for some years in the hussars, has retired on . half pay and returned to this State. He is only thirty-six years of age, has been an adjutant of a our cavalry regiment, and when in South Africa was adjutant of a cavalry brigade. He knows his drill well, and has excellent testimonials. This man has proffered his services to the Commonwealth. Yet the; Minister says to him, "" I cannot place Minister you."" We are short of skilled officers, but the Minister does not want to offend the powers that be.",51
440,Mr MALONEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What powers? One  withwho are running the show. The Minister is anxious to secure the services of this officer, but cannot place him because if he were to do so he would offend other officers. If I were Minister of Defence I should place him quick and lively if I found he had the ability that he claims to The honourable member for Coriohas been good enough to hand to me the volume of Hansard in which appears the report of the debate on the amendment moved by Mr MCCay on clause 28 of the Defence Bil l of 1903. Mr MCCay said,, as reported in Hansard of 5th August,. 1903From what the Minister has said, we havepractically no permanent forces as fighting units; except the men required to man our forts. T move That the following new sub-clause be added :"" No permanent military forces shall beraised, maintained, or organized, except for administrative staffs, instructional staffs, garrison artillery, fortress engineers, or sub-marine mining; engineers."" ' That is exactly in accordance with what the Minister has stated. The report continues",51
441,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There is the stali to provide for.,52
442,Mr MCCAY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That comes under the heading of "" administrative staff."" The right honourable member for East Sydney supported Mr MCCay, whilst the honourable member for Corio said Field artillery approaches garrison artillery in this respect; and. the Minister is making a great mistake in accepting this amendment without putting in field artillery as well as garrison artillery.",52
443,Mr MCCAY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That would allow of field batteries as fighting units. For what other purpose do we need them ? I do not know why the amendment was moved. The honourable member for Corio went on to sayI do not see why there should not be permanent field batteries; they certainly would be better than militia and volunteer field artillery.,52
444,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They are all garrison artillery in reality.,52
445,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How can they be garrison artillery if some of them are drivers? A garrison artillery gun is fixed in large fortifications.,52
446,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Some of the men are detailed to act as drivers although being garrison men. They are all-round men. Every artilleryman in the Imperial service, whether he is in the field artillery, the garrison artillery, or the horse artillery, has to be able to handle garrison, field, and horse artillery guns. He has to undergo every year a course of training at Shoeburyness.",52
447,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is possible only in the case of permanent men.  mind. If we have three permanent men for each gun-on e to load, one to train, and the third man to sponge out-the rest of the work can be done by any one, and we can rely upon the guns being properly handled. The reason why in the Imperial service nine permanent artillery men are attached to each gun in action is to prevent any one man being overworked and to provide for casualties. At the battle of Ingogo there were only one or two artillerymen at one of the guns; the rest, were infantry. The report of the debate continues",52
448,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"To the extent that a garrison artilleryman drives he is not a garrison artilleryman. The right honourable means that.although we choose to call these men garrison artillery the whole of them can be made into infantry, because they are all-round men. My opinion is that our artillerymen should be all-round men. They should be able to [ 3 5 8 ] -2 . handle a carbine, a garrison gun, a siege gun, or a horse artillery gun.",52
449,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The sailors on board His Majesty's ordnance ships are turned into infantry if the authorities choose. Sailors took that 4.7 gun up lo Ladysmith from the HMS. Powerful.,52
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,If there is anything wrong in the amendment I will have it altered.,52
451,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I understand the Minister to say that he wants to have all-round men, so that if he chooses to employ them as infantry men he will do so. Then I find that the honourable member for Dalley spoke to the question, sayingIt seems like butchery to ""have a g o"" at the Minister now. It is not real warfare. The right honourable gentleman has capitulated to the honourable and learned member for Corinella. But we have not merely to look to the present; we have to consider the future also. During the last two years, Parliament has shown a strong . sense of economy in regard to military matters, and the Commandant, being wise in his generation, has cut down the permanent forces. The honourable member proceeded to point out, as the honourable member for. Corio had done, that the Minister was making a mistake in accepting the amendment, but it was agreed to. I hope that the Minister will either cause the Act to be amended, or, so to speak, take the bit between his teeth, and see that the men are trained in field as well as in garrison artillery work. It is essential that we should have in our permanent men a skeleton army.",52
452,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That was the trouble in connection with the cadre.  scientific branch of the service should be all-round soldiers. A man cannot know too much about artillery. The more skilful we make our gunners the better machines they will be when we want them.. Those who were members of the first Parliament will remember the debate which took place in this House with regard to the treatment of troops on the Drayton Grange. During that d'ebate I attacked the officer^ in charge, Colonel Lyster, declaring that on the report of the Commission I thought that some of the men had been cruelly done to death. I still hold that opinion. I went on to say, however, that the man in charge of the troops on board, Colonel Lyster, who is now the State Commandant of Queensland, should have been hanged, because he was neither more nor less than a murderer. While in member Queensland last year I had a long conversation with that officer in regard to the Dravton Grange case, and having heard all that he had to tell about it came to the conclusion that he had been the victim of circumstances. At the time he did not tell all that he knew, because an officer in a higher position asked him not to do so. Since that conversation I have again read the report of the Commission, and in the light of the information I have received from Colonel Lyster, recognise that in many cases, in the first instance, I placed a wrong construction upon statements in it . In justice to Colonel Lyster, therefore, I wish to withdraw unreservedly the remarks that I made, and to express my regret that I should have uttered them. I was not then in the possession of information that I now have, and I deeply regret that I made such a serious charge against him. I . to l d him that at the first opportunity I should withdraw the statement. I then made. I desire the Minister to tell us more particularly what is going to be done with Captain Collins and Mr Savage. When the proper time comes, I hope to have a word or two to say about the proposed new. defence scheme, which, as outlined, has my entire sympathy. countryworth living in is worth defending ; and our arrangements in this connection Cannot go on as at present. The Minister told us this afternoon that each mounted infantryman' in the Commonwealth costs Â£ 1 7 r>er annum; and something must be done to reduce this expenditure.",52

454,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"How could that be proved?  of the forces, say, at Dalgety, on a certain day-that would prove whether they were efficient or not. I am satisfied myself that such an attempt now would end in chaos. About two years ago, two field forces were manoeuvring between Rockhampton and the border, and on the second day the men had to go hungry in the absence of any ""tucker,"" although they were within thirty miles of Brisbane. I am afraid, therefore, that if an attempt were made to assemble the troops from' all over Australia in some parts of New South Wales, they would be starving before very long; but, at any rate, the efficiency or inefficiency of the forces would be proved. I am sure we all desire that the hopes of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence may be realized in regard to the new defence scheme, which, if it does not mean absolute efficiency, will provide forces that can be made efficient. Any Personally, I should be willing to pay almost anything for an efficient. service; and I am sure that no one in the country would say a word against any reasonable expenditure. But, as I have said every session, we might as well throw the money into the sea as spend at in the way we are now doing. We are spending practically _ Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 a year merely to provide billets for people, and, in the matter of defence, we have been living in a fool's paradise. If the hopes of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence are only partially realized, we shall have a force of which every one in trie country will be proud.",53

I do not think that we can expect an efficient service for the amount we are now spending on the militaryan additional forces, nor do I believe that we shall If an ever have efficiency until we have had some experience in actual warfare. It is rather sad to think that the British people have usually to suffer reverses before they wake up to the situation, but the United States, the South American Republics, and, indeed, almost every nation has had similar experience. In my opinion, we shall havtto spend at least Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in order to secure a satisfactory defence force. I regard with dread the bility of an invasion of cause, in such event,. those honourable members who have been - preaching economy in this connection will stand the risk of being hanged to the nearest No estimate of military expenditure be made to a fraction; there must be a margin of hundreds of thousands, even then, we must have at the head able 'men, great financiers, and, above all, cipline throughout the forces. I am sorry to say, we have no discipline. It is proposed by the Government that in the penditure. future there shall be spent Â£2,000,000 per annum, and, therefore, I think the rebagatelle. sult will be to that extent more satisfactory to the community. However, it of very little use discussing or attacking the Estimates, seeing that about five-sixths of the money has already been spent; and, as it is proposed to substitute for present system of defence another more accordance with requirements of Australia, there is not much need to discuss the matter further at this stage. We have great deal to-night about "" military caste,"" and about there being cliques the service here; but that only shows there is in Australia what is rampant every other part of the world, and I really do not see how we can mend matters extoo, cept by having more efficient men at the head, and paying them adequate salaries. . There is a cry pf "" Australia for the tralians,"" and in the Military Forces Australian is given preference, even though he may not have had experience actual warfare. In my opinion that is the height of stupidity. I believe in tralia for the Australians; but, in order to keep Australia, we must have an ' cient army. Adequate defences are the surest way of avoiding war; and I am on the march ? prepared to vote what money is necessary. I am looking forward to the opportunity of saying a word on the crude and imto practicable scheme enunciated by the Prime Minister; but, at the same time, there is so much in the. scheme to'admire that I hope it will be introduced just > laid before us a few months ago. Opposition will see that the scheme made shapely; and we must remember that every perfect work is at first crude. I a broad and comprehensive scheme that forces. any one may work at and improve, and I believe that the value of citizen soldiery is a secret that we have to learn. But even in the new scheme, it is proposed possispend the paltry sum of Â£20,000 per anAustralia, benum on rifle clubs.",53

Paltry sums like Â£10,000 for cadets, and in ,Â£20,000 for riflemen, are utterly insuffithat cient. It was found in the American war in that the men who could use the rifle did the most valuable work. In the Boer war, the Boers, who were experts in the use of the rifle, could, hold their own against the more highly trained Tommy Atkins.

464,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wentworth) [8.56] - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has directed attention to the unto doubted importance of having efficient riflemen in our forces. He did not go on to say-bu t I presume that he will quite admit-ho w necessary it is to have also those men organized and equipped under an efficient general staff and officers. It is of no use to have efficient riflemen unless we have the organization to bring the riflemen to the scene of action. We need to have ammunition trains, baggage trains, ordnance trains, and all that organization which goes to make a mob of armed men into an efficient fighting army. The honourable member, also omitted to say, but it is none the less true, that it is of no use to have a number of armed men, and the means of taking those armed men to the field of action, unless we also have the skilled brains to direct their energies to the best advantage. We need to have a general staff in the background, with the requisite knowledge and training to direct an army along strategic lines to ultimate victory; and capable commanders in the field able to take the greatest tactical advantage from the actual fields of battle. But I did not rise so much to refer to the necessity for having equipment and brains as well as arms, and the knowledge of how to use themj among the rank and file. A very important point was raised by the honourable member for Maranoa in connection with the permanent Secretary of the Defence Department. I do not wish to say a word against Captain Collins. I believe that he is a very valuable officer in. whatever secretarial position the Commonwealth may choose to put him. But he occupies a very anomalous position. when, for years, he has received his salary as Secretary of the Defence Department, whilst he himself has been permanently resident in London doing other than defence work.",54
465,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is chiefly fence work,,is it not? Mr KEJ1LY - The work done in Captain Collins' office in London is largely defence work, but Captain Col.lins' own duties take him very much outside his office. He is frequently away doing the work of an Australian representative- I do not mean, of course, of a High Commissioner-in London.",55
466,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does he not purchase all our defence materiel?,55
467,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He has all sorts of duties placed upon him by the Government from time to time. These duties vary from his being asked to collect works on Australia to expediting the shipment of defence materiel. He discharges a variety of work, which entitles him to consider himself the chief Commonwealth representative in London. Of course, he is not a High Commissioner, but he is undoubtedly the representative of the Commonwealth, doing all the work that the Commonwealth wants done there. But he occupies an anomalous position, because year after year he is drawing his salary as Secretary of the Defence Department, whilst he is 12,000 miles away, and' another officer, Commander Pethebridge, is doing his work at a smaller salary. It is not fair that one officer should be down on these Estimates for Â£ 9 0 0 a year, whilst the man who is doing the work is not getting the same salary. In common justice he should be getting the same.",55
468,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What salary does the honourable member suggest that Captain 'Collins should get?,55
469,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should say that he deserves every penny of Â£ 9 0 0 a year. The only fault that I personally could find with the late work of Captain Collins as Secretary for the Defence Department may not be regarded by other honourable members as a fault at all. Indeed, I am not sure that I regard it as a fault. I refer to Kis minutely careful scrutiny of public money, which, in connection with this Department, may occasionally be carried too far in a faddy way. Bur! still, it is, generally speaking, a very fine fault for a public officer to have. I find that Commander Pethebridge is to receive an allowance for acting as Secretary for Defence, amounting to Â£ 2 0 0 . But the momerft' Captain Collins comes back to Australia to take up his duties-if he is to bef brought back-this other officer will have to be , defound some work commensurate with the higher' pay that he ihas been receiving 1 during! Captain Collins' absence. As far as I can gather from the Estimates, there is no place for Commander Pethebridge to fill at the increased salary. I suggest for the consideration of the Minister that it is essential that this question of an absentee Secretary for Defence . should be settled, in justice to Captain Collins and to Commander Pethebridge, at the earliest possible moment.",55
470,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Prime Minister said the other night t'hat the High 'Commissionership required consideration, and that he would not much longer delay dealing with the question.",55
471,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I was very glad to hear that. In this debate a number of stateThe ments have been made - qualifications of certain officers who are unable to get promotion in the Defence Forces. I do not propose to go into that subject. It has already been - sufficiently discussed. But I regard those instances as additional examples of the demoralization that exists in this Departrader "" than that. ment. That demoralization is also evidenced in the great shortage of men of die rank and file. The memorandum which the Minister has circulated shows rank and file is 3,000 short of what it ought to be, even for our small force.

It is quite ridiculous to talk about the policy of the Government in defence matters, when we have not yet had Australia a defence policy at all Government has yet give-.i us what we can so obviously. call a defence policy. I regret to that the new "" policy "" foreshadowed by the Prime Minister is no more a policy than any enunciated by his predecessors.

482,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The British Admiralty could not tell us definitely whether the British Navy could hold Germany in,56
483,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But the British Government have undoubtedly laid it down as the basis of their defence schemes that the is British Navy is, in their opinion, adequate to maintain the general command of the sea.

If I might offer, in passbe.defended. ing, a criticism, though a friendly one, the foreshadowed scheme-becaus e I am seeking information, and the scheme is before us in the concrete- I would say the Prime Minister has treated military defence as if they were independent, whereas they are inter-dependent, be made. ing both complementary to each other in the protection of the country.

Military training may be excellent for the improvement of the national stamina, .but huge military preparations suppose from a defence point of view the loss of British supremacy in the Eastern waters.

We have had a General Officer Commanding and a Board system of - organization,- and ' now a military organization. third' is proposed, it' being thought, apparently, that a system of organization k means a policy.

It really had such a small bearing on the What whole scheme! of defence, that it was hardly worth bothering about - Still, I dealt with it in deference to the theobe retical view of the subject.",57
493,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There seems to be more than a theoretical view. For instance, has prethe Minister decided to defend Albany ?",57
494,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It must be left alone for time being; but I have no doubt that, when money is available, Parliament will for a say that it must be defended.",57
495,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Le t me show the' bearing of the defence of this port on our The militiamen, who will furnish the garrison for this fortress, will have to be brought in from, the Western Australian gold-fields; but if bany is not defended, they can be sent to Perth or Fremantle. The Minister apparently thinks that it matters little where men who have to be brought a distance of some 800 miles are sent', and that the Board should be able to carry out its organization with such a question unsettled ! I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that the military position is farcical. The naval position is no more satisfactory. For this state of affairs, too, we have to blame, not the naval officers, or those administering the Naval Agreement, but the Minister and Parliament. Into what an absurd position have Ministerial irresolution and indecision placed our naval defence! Shortly after the first meeting of this Parliament, the Naval Director recommended that six cruisers, under separate Australian control, be obtained for the naval defence of Australia, and the Government of the day, of which this Government, is the heir, decided against that recommendation, and in favour of the Naval Agreement, which aims at Imperial naval 'Cooperation. The Naval Director subsequently made further representations on the subject, and it was decided-owing , as Mr. Playford told the Argus, to differences of opinion in the Board-to refer the whole question to the Imperial Defence Commit-' tee, the highest expert autharitv in the Empire. The Committee considered Captain Creswell's report during several months, and condemned it, declaring that it showed '-' an inappreciation of the latest developments of naval strategy."" On the receipt of its report, two courses were open-to act on it as the highest expert opinion in the Empire; or to refuse to do so, from political considerations, of which the Government is the judge. The irresolution of Ministers permitted them to take neither course. They referred the report to the officer whose scheme was so adversely criticised by the Committee, and he naturally adhered to his first opinion. Then the matter was shelved again, and although other policies Have been brought forward, we have not discovered to date whether the Government intend that there shall be one. control for all the King's ships, in whatever part of the Empire they may be, or whether the Australian ships shall be under separate control, as if Australia formed no part of the Empire. Surely our officers cannot be blamed for inefficiency when Ministers will not state a policy? We already see signs of .demoralization. Under the A l - Naval Agreement, 500 Australians and New Zealanders are being trained at Australian rates of pay in the best school of seamanship in the world. But this vear fewer volunteers are going to England to qualify for higher ratings, because of die want of encouragement, due to the indecision of the Government. The men do not-know what may happen to the Agreement three or four years hence. The suggestion of the honourable member for Maranoa, to test the efficiency of our field forces by a sudden mobilization many miles from a centre of population, should commend itself to the Minister; though he must admit that it would probably be six weeks or two months before even 1,000 men could be equipped as a self-supporting and mobile unit. There is not the equipment the stores, or horses.",57
496,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Would the honourable member keep all the necessary waggons and horses in stock?,58
497,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Certainly ; if we are to be ready for an immediate raid on the outbreak of war.,58
498,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It would be sufficient to know where we can get what we want. Mrf. KELLY - Does the Minister know where he could get horses?,58
499,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I shall know that presently.,58
500,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Defence Forces have been under Commonwealth control for seven years, and the Minister tells us that "" presently "" he will know where he could get horses on the outbreak of war !",58
501,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have established a corps for the purpose. The honourable member should really find fault with those who preceded me.,58
502,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am not finding fault with the Minister, though he is responsible for what is being done now. My criticism is not only a personal one. The whole House has been wickedly slack in regard to military matters, and largely because of that wicked slackness our forces are in a state of demoralization. In the speech in which the Prime Minister foreshadowed the new organization 'we had estimates of the cost of the proposed Australian National Guard,but in those estimates I find no provision 1 whatsoever for horses or equipment. If the force is to be organized on the basis of the present organization in Australia, the actual cost of horsing it will amount to some Â£561,000.",58
503,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No sane man would think of keeping Â£500,000 worth of horses in stock.",59
504,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then what would a sane man do?,59
505,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He would know where to get them when he wanted them.,59
506,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Does the honourable memIjer know where to obtain them? pose that he will say that he will know "" presently "" !",59
507,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We have created a body of men to obtain that information. When I went to the Defence Department there was not even a map there. It is time that we made a start.,59
508,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member has been at the head of .the Department for about eighteen months, and it is certainly time that we made a start! I do not intend,, however, to criticise him personally. I find that some 48,000 sets of saddlery would be required for the new force, but there is no reference to such an outlay in the Prime Minister's estimate? On the Imperial service scale a division which numbers some 20,000 men will require 1,585 Tiding horses and nearly 6,000 draught horses. Apparently., however, there is no intention on the part of the Government to organize the vast horde of unequipped, if armed men which it is proposed to bring into existence. I speak not as a captious critic, but as one anxious to ascertain how the Government propose to overcome this difficulty. Are we simply to have a horde of men who will remain in the one place in the hope that the enemy will come to them, or are we to have a mobile army ?",59
509,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member would be a fairly clever Minister if he could induce Parliament to grant him Â£500,000 for the purchase of horses.",59
510,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Then is the expense which has-been foreshadowed to be a mere instalment of the total expenditure that the Government have in mind ? Does the Minister think that if he can induce the country to bear with resignation that instalment he will be able to induce it to submit quietly to additional expenditure? The proper way to deal with a matter of this kind is to make a straightforward statement to the Committee. The Minister' should take the Committee into his full confidence and trust to the patriotism of honourable members. I would only say in conclusion that I think that both in respect of their land and sea defence proposals the Government are putting the cart before the horse. It takes from six years to ten years to train a warrant officer, let alone a commissioned officer, for the highest rating in the navy; only one year to build a ship. What should we do first of all.? Should we buy our ships without training our men, or should we first of all train our men if we can obtain from the Admiralty 1 sup- vessels in which to train them, and seek afterwards to purchase our ships ? On the completion of the Naval Agreement we shall have enough Australians and New Zealanders trained in the Imperial Navy to man four Australian cruisers if we desire to purchase them. The Government instead now propose to borrow men from the Imperial Navy and to buy ships that will be under the patronage of this Parliament. In other words, we are to have our ships before we have the men to man them ! Would it not be better to feel our way and first of all to train our men? In the same way the Government are proposing, in regard to the land forces, to obtain a horde' of men before they ascertain how they are going to secure the necessary officers. The militia is utterly inadequate to provide at once the number of officers who will be requirecT for the forces which it is proposed to raise. The Ministry should first think about the establishment of a Military College. They should set to work to train officers as quickly as possible-to build up the forces from something that we have at present-and eventually arrive at universal service if it is desired. I am not saying anything in opposition to the princiole of universal service. I recognise that if we believe that Imperial naval strength is inadequate to our purposes, and if we consequently feel that our policy must be to protect the coun- try from invasion, we must have something like universal service. But we must have efficiency. The only way to secure that efficiency is to begin by adopting a proper method of training our officers. During this debate the Minister has made several observations which seem to me to show that he has no confidence in the experts in his Department. I think I can safely say that he appears to have lost confidence in a number of them. ' The Minister prefers, perhaps, not to answer ""Yes,'' but he cannot very well say ""-No.""",59
511,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,^1 say that an expert is valuable only up to the point of his natural ability and training.,59
512,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Quite so. - But h is training ought to be valuable to a layman when technical questions have to be dealt with. ' Mr EWING - It is. I never think of passing over an expert when I have to deal with such questions.,59
513,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable gentleman would naturally cease to have confidence in an officer as an expert when he believed that his training had not been what it ought to have been. I do not wish to ask him to say anything that-he thinks would be disloyal to his staff.,60
514,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have not lost confidence in any one; I always have hope.,60
515,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Her e we have another statement that proves conclusively that the Minister has not implicit confidence in .his officers.,60
516,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,In every officer ? I do not think that any one has.,60
517,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In that case the duty of the Minister is not to attempt to shield the officers. He will never place the Department on a satisfactory basis until he settles his policy, and clearly takes the Committee into his confidence as to the ability of the officers' to carry it out. Whan his policy is dealt with he will have to obtain the men to carry it out, and if he has no confidence in his officers he should plainly say so.",60
518,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If I said to the .House, "" I desire to select certain officers to do certain work,"" would the honourable member support me?",60
519,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have never raised a quibble about any particular officer.,60
520,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite so. But supposing I said that I knew certain officers fairly well, and thought that they were essential to the work I had in hand, would not the honourable member reply by asking what I knew about the matter?",60
521,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should rather regret the Minister usurping the position of a lay General Officer Commanding-makin g appointments over the head of his Board, whilst allowing that Board, which is responsible for such appointments, to continue. If the Minister wishes to take up such an attitude he must franklytell the Committee that he has no confidence in his responsible officers in this regard ",60
522,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not say that; I have not said a word to-night about the Board.,60
523,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am not referring to the personnel of the Board, nor do I desire to place the Minister in a false position. In speaking of officers, I had in mind the officers generally. The Board has the responsibility of recommending promotions, and if the Minister relieved it of that duty his action would be tantamount to a vote of want of confidence in it. I say, therefore, that he ought to come to the House and say, "" I do not believe in the Board for this purpose, and think it should be abolished."" If he freely and frankly takes the House into his confidence, and urges it on this non-party question to set the Defence Department right, I am sure that he will be supported, and that he will make a successful appeal to the patriotism of every honourable member.",60
524,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Lang) [9.34] - Despite the strong temptation which such a subject as the Estimates of the Defence Department offers for discursiveness, as evidenced by many of the speeches that have been delivered, I do not propose to deliver a lengthy address. I shall reserve my criticism of defence matters until we have before us the Government's new defence scheme, recognising that, as ten months of the year to which these Estimates relate have expired, it would be little short of beating the air to discuss them. I have risen to protest against the supersession of the British flag by what is called the Australian flag in connection with our Military and Naval Forces ",60

529,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I merely desire to guard against the dropping of the practice of flying the British flag over our public buildings, and in connection with our Naval and Military Forces. We have no reason to be ashamed of the British flag.",60
530,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member means the Union Jack, which is only one of about twenty British flags.",60
531,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is merely a quibble. Every honourable member knows I refer to the Union Jack and British ensign. The Australian flag cannot be dpscribed as the British flag, but the Union Jack is the British flag as we know it.",60
532,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is perhaps the only one of which the honourable member knows.,60
533,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is one of which I am proud, and of which the honourable member himself need not be ashamed. He would not be able to remain here for twenty-four hours without risk of being turned out of the country if it were not for the protection of that flag. this point, because I know that there is on the part of a certain section of the representatives of the people in this Parliament a strong undercurrent of antipathy to anything British. I do not wish to see anything in the nature of an indignity offered to the British flag.",61

535,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is no mare's nest. I am basing my remarks on a regulation recently issued by the Government, under which the Union Jack is in future to be discarded for the Australian flag. It ill becomes some of our young Australian friends to attemrjt to put a slight on the British flag. I remind them that their forefathers were Britishers, and would not have been in this country but for the protection of British rule. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Their forefatherswould not have come here if they had not been starved out of England.",61
536,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"At any rate, it was the Union Jack which made it possible for their forefathers to come here and enjoy the freedom which is theirs, and which they assert even to the extent of insulting the Mother Country. They would never have been able to come and take possession of Australia, and hand down the national colours, under the flag of any other country.",61

546,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is a good deal of talk about "" cutting the painter.""",61
547,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The best reply I can give to that is to point to the unanimous and whole-hearted support which Australia lent to the Mother Country during the trouble in South Africa. When People the 'time of need arose, the rank and file of the people of Australia offered their lives for the Empire. However, that is for not what I rose to talk abou?. I-am not disposed to adversely criticise the Minister in charge of these Estimates. I am aware that he did not find a bed of roses when he took charge of the Department, and. that reforms were necessary. Though they cannot be brought about in a way, I believe that the Minister is doinghis best to place this Department on a footing that will secure for it the respect of the community. That ideal-and I regTet it has not yet been attained, but, if any one can attain it, I think it is the present Minister. Whatever criticisms I offer, therefore,' are not directed to frustrating his efforts, rather by way of assisting him to make the Department more effective. The Minister will admit that there is a very large measure of justification for any adverse criticism that may be offered. From its inception the Commonwealth has been called upon to spend annually about ^1,000,000 on defence, and there is a feeling abroad that up to the present we have obtained very little for our money. .The honourable member for Parramatta, who made a very excellent speech, emphasized that point, but he seemed to miss the cause. In the opinion of that honourable member the cause lay not so much in the Department as in the fact that there had never been a substantial Ministerial head-that Ministers had come and gone so rapidly that not one had been able to find and give effect to a proper working system. I disagree with the idea that that is the main reason for the failure of the Department. reason is deeper rooted, and is in the Department itself rather than in it's administration. The Commonwealth, rightly or wrongly, decided at the outset to depart from the old ideals that had animated the advisors of the States Governments in the matter of defence, and to have, instead ot a professional military class, a citizen soldiery. That was the policy laid down, and there came a tug-of-war between the men who believed in the. Old' World professional military systems, and those who believed in a citizen soldiery. T make bold to say that the efforts of a very, large section of the military authorities have been in the direction of discrediting and frustrating the policy laid down by the Commonwealth Parliament. Those authorities have set themselves, not openly but covertly, to bring discredit on the principle, with a view to establishing their own ideal; and to my mind that has been the main cause of the friction and dissatisfaction. The trouble will continue until such time as we have at the head, not only a Minister but also an officer who is thoroughly in sympathy with the Commonwealth policy. We require a man there who is in touch with the spiritof Australian democracy, and who desires to build up a system of defence on the basis of a citizen soldiery. While there is this antipathy to a citizen soldiery we can expect nothing but the chaos which has prevailed during the whole seven years of Federation. I have been forced to these conclusions by a feeling that there is an antipathy but on the part of the professional military man against the unprofessional military man, the former regarding the latter as something beneath him. The surprise is that our citizen side of the Defence Forces has remained so strong and active. We have to make up our minds now whether we shall have a citizen soldiery or aprofessional soldiery. Are we going to place on the shoulders of this young Commonwealth those old-world methods which, by their excessive cost, have ground down democracy ? Are we not to have practical effect given to our ideal of a citizen soldiery which, while being efficient and effective, will not be costly. Let us lay down definitely the lines of such a policy, and see that we work up to it. We must have a certain permanent force for the purpose' of securing efficient drill, but we must make our - permanent officers understand that our ideal is 'to defend Australia by means of The a democratic citizen soldiery. If our officers will not work up to .that ideal, let them be sent about their business. Let them go to the old world, where they will find opportunities of giving effect to their own antiquated ideas of defence. No matter what Government we'have in power, so long as the wishes of Parliament and of the people of this country are practically set at defiance, there will be difficulty and confusion. While I do not wish to enter into a discussion of the new defence proposals of the Government' just now, the present affords an opportunity for honourable members to offer suggestions which may be useful to the Government in preparing their scheme. When we were dealing with this subject in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, I was one of the few members who expressed the idea that we were committing a mistake in not attaching greater importance to the naval side of defence. I believe that that aspect of the question has been too much neglected. Indeed, the neglect has been little short of criminal. First, I would emphasize the importance of the defence of our harbors. We ought to spend a little more on providing torpedo boats and small fast cruisers that we could place along our coasts. "" I do not think that there is any need to engage in the construction of large war vessels. So long as we are associated with the British Empire we'do not need to do more than look after the defence 0? our coast-line. We are peculiarly situated in this respect. We are not in close proximity to the territory of any large power that may be hostile to us or to the Empire to which we belong. Any hostility that may arise must come from a distance. The enemy must concentrate his large war - vessels at some point distant from Australia. Where Australia might be made to suffer in this connection is through damage done by commerce destroyers. Our commerce is of vital concern to us. The first aggressive action by an enemy would probably be, not to send a fleet of ships to Australia to take possession of any part of our country, but to despatch a few swift commerce destroyers to damage our trading vessels and harass our coasts. We want to be in a position to meet that danger. We have no need to fear troubles within our own borders. But, so far, our principal preparations for defence have been made inland without any consideration to the dangers that may come to us from oversea. A very effective means of defence could be provided for the protection of our harbors. In addition to that, we need to train and eciuip our young men in the country districts to participate in the defence of their country. First of""all, in pursuance of that policy, we need to develop our rifle clubs, and to give every opportunity for our young men to become proficient in shooting. Good shooting is largely a matter of practice. Many of our young men have acquired skill'in marksmanship, and have been able to hold their, own in competitions abroad. We need to afford increased ^opportunities for such practice. I feel sure that if we encourage our young men, in their spare time, to devote themselves to this training, providing them with skilled instruction, they will be an invaluable asset for defence purposes in time of danger. We also need to encourage the Australian Light Horse. I have found on the part of the military authorities a certain hostility to the formation of light horse corps in the country districts. The officers' seem to want to keep the corps near to the city. In fact, they have laid it down as a principle that a light horse corps must not be established outside a certain radius of a city.",61
548,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Perhaps they do not like to travel for instructional purposes.,63
549,Mr THOMASBROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have heard have it said that the officers do not.like into the little, bush towns and country centres to train our light horsemen. But they need to be reminded that the Defence exists for the Commonwealth, not for the' Mr THOMASBROWN officers. They should be plainly told if they do not like to go into the country districts to give instruction to , men who desire to participate in the development of this valuable arm of our forces, we have no need for their services. It has to be remembered that city men who join light horse corps have means of earning a livelihood that are not, as a rule, associated with horsemanship. These young men generally occupy positions in banks or stores or offices. Horsemanship is not a matter of daily occupation with them. It is rather an exercise or a pastime. But in the country districts men almost live in the saddle. They practically make their living by their horsemanship. These are the kind""of men tfhom we want for this sort of defence.",63
550,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Thos e were the men who rendered most valuable service during the Boer war. . Mr THOMAS BROWN - They were the men who, without any previous training, enlisted for service in Africa, and proved their fitness largely in consequence of their skilled horsemanship: I am asking that the Defence Department shall not discourage these men in the formation of light horse corps, but shall rather endeavour to utilize their services. By way of practical illustration of how the Department treats this branch of the service, I may mention that ""there is at Condobolin a company of men who have been applying for five years past to be registered by the Department as a half-company of light horse. These men did'not wait for the Department to come along and register them. They constituted themselves a corps without any departmental influence. They number about fifty men now, and include some who went to Soutb Africa during the war and rendered valuable service there. One of the promoters of this very company is a young man, long resident in the district, who, without any previous military experience, went to South Africa, acquitted himself well, was promoted, and was selected as one of the Australian representatives who went Home to the King's Coronation. He has come back and has made use of his knowledge by inducing his young friends in the district to form this light horse corps. He gave them, instruction, and for five years they continued their operations with little or to go no sympathy from the Department.",63
551,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The new scheme would' Force take in such a corps. - I was told that that the old scheme would do so; but I found that the military heads were so strongly opposed to the idea of a citizen soldiery that they would give no assistance.,63
552,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The difficulty was, perhaps, that that corps coiild not be linked up with another. Mr THOMAS BROWN:-There are other corps at Forbes, 40 miles away, and at Molong,. all three places being connected by railway; but I have been told that under the new system they will be wiped out, because they are too fa r from Sydney. I have also had applications, asking that corps may be formed at Cowra and Temora, both on the railway line.",64
553,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Cowr a has not a rifle club.,64
554,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"T t is desired to form rifle clubs in both places. though men are readv to place themselves and their horses at the service of the Department, the Department' refuses to accept their offer. The Minister has said that the equipment of the Australian Light Horse costs ' the Department something like Â£ 1 7 per man, and that funds are limited. Why should the cost be so great? Is it not possible to work on more economical lines? I am certain that the corps at Condobolln has not cost anything like Â£ 1 7 per man per annum. The men there have offered to serve without remuneration, if the Department will register the corps, and provide it with an instructor; but it was not deemed a wise policy to allow them to do so. I wish the Minister to try to establish an Australian Light Horse corps in every little centre, but on cheap lines. Showy garments and trappings are not' needed. We do not want what the honourable member for Darwin calls gilt-spurred roosters.",64
555,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Australia n soldiers are not needed to adorn, social functions.",64
556,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . honourable member for Parramatta brought forward a pathetic case, which, although a disgrace to the country, is characteristic of our military system. - Mr Wilks - It is not the only case of the kind.",64
557,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Unfortunately, it is not. Three officers did good service in South Africa, two of 'them obtaining promotion on their return, while the third, who, so far as the papers go, was the best, was left out in the cold. The two who were promoted are of high social standing, while the third has little social status. It is social position that largely determines promotions under the present system. That is in accord with the military ideas of the old world, but is incompatible with a citizen soldiery. .The man who desires to be captain of a little country corps has to light for the position if he does not possess social standing; but if he is a big land-holder, or a local magnate, he gets the position without trouble. We shall never have a satisfactory citizen soldiery until an end. is put to this. I hope that every encouragement will be given t'o the development of our citizen soldiery on true democratic lines. I desire also that the Minister will do what he can to give members of rifle clubs opportunities for acquiring proficiency in the management of firearms, instead of Al- permitting treatment such as the honourable member for Parramatta has complained of, and which has been extended to many districts. The development of the Australian Light Horse is also desirable. We should not confine our defence preparations to the big cities, but should utilize the services of the men who, living in the saddle, have not to be taught how to handle and manage horses. I am pleased to know that the matter , of providing equipment is receiving attention. Men may be properly drilled, but, without proper equipment or the ready means of obtaining it , they must be at the mercy of a foe. One of the first things to be done is to establish a small-arms factory, so that we may be independent of outside sources, for the supply of ammunition and weapons. In this, way, we can base our defence system on safe and sound lines, gradually developing it as time goes on. However,, as the Minister wishes to get through the Estimates, I shall not offer any further criticism now. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) The [ro.20] - It is not mv intention to deal at length with the Militarv Estimates, because most of the money set down for the financial year has been already spent, and we can now only lament its expenditure. Above all things, militaryexpenditure is the one eternal waste. We get no return, no equivalent, for what wa spend. Occasionally I see a General at the races, and he looks all right, or dancing at the Town H all , or on horseback, and he still looks well.' But it seems too bad that nearly Â£T,000,000, or 5s. per head of the population, should be spent for no earthly advantage. Only lately, in the United States, President Roosevelt ordered these roosters. out on horseback, and found that half of them, could not ride. The same thing would happen here. Without wishing to say .anything disagreeable, I suggest that the Minister should start by dismissing the whole service.",64
558,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Would the honourable member depend on the Salvation Armv? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Who m ""have we to fight? There is the British Fleet, and there is the United States Fleet to protect usj because the American Navy Board has decided to keep fourteen battleships at the Philippine Islands continuously, and to have a fleet in the Pacific equal to any other there. Only eight of the battleships visiting Australia ' will return to America. Therefore, I propose that, instead of wasting our money on military expenditure, we should give Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year to the British Fleet, and another ,Â£100,000 to the Yankees, and sav to them, "" You look out, and when the other chap is out fighting, take care of this place."" ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Why not subsidize the Japanese as well ?",65
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And the Germans.,65
560,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I would not object to do so if we could depend upon their promise to be peaceable. The enormous sum of money that we waste on militarism would fill the Northern Territory with immigrants. It would buy millions of acres of land, and settle it with a population whose very magnitude would keep out invaders. But I suppose it makes no difference what I say. This military system of utter waste will go on. No one seems to have the courage to attack it. I have been longing to be the . Treasurer if only that I might be able to do so; but that seems further away than ever. I am almost afraid to say a word against the military, for .it seems that the time has come when Australia must take all its orders from the men on horseback. Are we to make any change ? . If we could turn the whole country into a great military school so that we should haw no ""common soldiers"" I should not mind. Our officers, with few exceptions,- hold the "" common soldier "" in utter contempt. The lines of demarcation, caste and rank, are really so rank that one can smell them on turning a corner sixteen miles away. The honourable member for Parramatta has referred today to the case of an officer who has a real grievance. He has fought for his country, shown his ability, valour, and genius on the battlefield, and has returned to Australia only to find that he is not wanted. I learned recently of another officer who went with one of the Australian contingents to South Africa, fought there, was wounded, taken prisoner, and ultimately released. At the close of the war the High Commissioner of South Africa appointed him judge.of compensations, his duty being to distribute amongst the Boers the Â£ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 which the British nation, in the greatness of her generosity, chose to give those whose property had suffered during the war. Although that man was a major in South Africa, he was not given the rank of major on returning to Australia. The Minister will never succeed in establishing a satisfactory system until he secures officers who are in sympathy with the citizen soldiery. When one talks with the regular men who draw regular pay-the regular sol; diers whom we know as the ""dancing masters,"" and the ""Toorak Society Roosters"" - on e finds that they have no sympathy with the Prime Minister's scheme. All these men ridicule it , and yet neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister of Defence has the courage to go beyond them. The Minister today spoke of. experts in his Department. An expert is a man who knows something about everything except the question on which he is an expert. This country is full of experts, and yet some of them do not know enough to come in out of the rain. Experts suffer mostly from brain storm. I am amazed that my brother members of the Labour Party-the representa 1 tives of the toilers, the battlers and the strugglers-shoul d talk about defence. In the name of Heaven what have we to de-. fend ?",65
561,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is said that the honourable member owns a few terraces.,65
562,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I listen with amazement as my brother members of the Labour Party talk of defence. For all time the working men have done the fighting, and while they have been away Mr. Boodlier has generally been grabbing everything they have left behind. Hundreds of Australians who fought in South Africa are today walking the streets of Melbourne, Sydney, and other State capitals. We well remember what their employers said when, they volunteered for service: ' ' Yes, my boys, go forth and fight for your country."" They wanted to get them away so that during their absence they could snatch everything that' their fathers and mothers had. Many men are so patriotic that they are always ready to send some one else out to fight for them. In the United States of America, when Â£ 2 0 0 was being offered to men to go to the front the fat men were all travelling to Canada.",65
563,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We should touch them with a Federal income tax. Mr KING . O ' MALLEY - I should support an income tax for military purposes. Why should not those who have property pay for its protection ? I repeat that we ought to have a great military school in Australia, so that we need have no common soldiers. Let us have no one below the rank of a colonel, and let every man wear a badge on his shoulder to denote his rank and authority. The Labour Party is the only party in this House that can boast of a fighting man. We have in our ranks a man who carried the flag in South Africa, and yet it is said sometimes that we are not loyal. We are all proud of him, and as I listened to his speech to-night I could not help feeling glad that Re was the man who had done the fighting instead of me. The honourable member for Wentworth talked about spending Â£500,000 on horses for the forces. He should remember that horses grow old and die, and that such an expenditure would be wasteful. The country which has not learned to encourage men to go to the front by looking after them on their return-by making heroes of them-ha s not learned its business. Only lately in the United States of America the pension valve has been opened, so that every man who has smelt powder will receive a pension. Nothing but an' earthquake sufficient to bring down the pyramids of Egypt would change our military system. There seems to be a sort of bureaucracy which prevents the Minister's orders being carried out. If a change is ordered, it is so made that there is no difference. I am in favour of an Australian Navy, but it may very easily be shut up like other navies; and in any case, why this scare about war? So long as the Anglo-Japanese friendship exists, there can be no onslaught on Australia by Japan; indeed, I believe that it is this friendship that has prevented a war between the United States and Japan.",66
564,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I must ask the honourable member to confine himself to the item. . Mr KING - O ' MALLEY - I solemnly protest against this waste of money on a useless military system. I object to be taxed to buy braid, feathers, and other ornaments for roosters who are of no use [359] to me. It would be much more profitable to utilize our permanent army in shooting Western Australian rabbits for sale in England. However, I suppose that whatever arguments we advance, these Estimates must be passed; but it is time that we cut down this foolish expenditure, and utilized the money in encouraging immigration, and in irrigating our lands. The most expensive gun or war vessel becomes obsolete in ten years; and, as I said before, there is no reason for a scare about war, seeing that we are thousands of miles awav frcrr everywhere. No fleet in the world could carry sufficient provisions to enable an army to land and penetrate twenty. miles inland, and even if that could be done, we are well able to defend ourselves. Let us give over drilling men in bodies and squares, because the time is past for"" that kind of warfare. We now require men with heads to do the fighting, and every man must be a general to get out of the way.

The arrangement is a clumsy one. The Committee will find that the parties will refuse to come before them, and that they will have no power to summon them.

A slanderer is usually a cowardly person who is not prepared to come forward to substantiate his accusation.

There are reports that the House will rise within the next fortnight or three weeks. Consequently, nothing, will be done in this matter at because a Select Committee cannot sit durmorrow' ing the recess. It would be necessary amend the. Standing Orders to allow it do so. I hope the Prime Minister will withdraw the proposed addition to the mosuch tion, or otherwise endless difficulty will ensue. The matter should have been reutterly ferred to the Standing Orders Committee to bring up proposals for altering the sent urocedure, and, if it was necessary get the opinion of the law officers of Crown, the Government could have done so'. The whole matter could, in that way, have been fixed up in one or two meetings, and we should have known where we were. The. course now proposed means shelving the matter to a future date. Mr KING O'MALLEY . (Darwin) matter whom it affects, [11. n] - As this'matter concerns the whole of Australia, I ask the Prime Minister whether it is because of their deficiency intellect that no representatives of South Australia or Tasmania have been apmembers pointed to this Committee, whilst QueensMinister land has three, and the other States have for. two each ?",70
612,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [11.12] - I should say was because of the excess of zeal and ability of some of those honourable memis bers that it hjas been thought deof sirable to keep them off the Committee. promised today to submit a proposal, as I thought the Committee could do some useful work in these two cases by calling upon the persons responsible for a stateit ment, but admit that, beyond that, there is no immediate prospect of their dealing speedily with their assertions. I am content to leave it to the will of the House wheand ther what is suggested should be done or Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. of proCASE OF MESSRS. FREEMAN AND WALLACE. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposedalso, to That the House do now adjourn.",70
613,Mr CHANTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Riverina) [11.13] Iri consideration of what has taken place, the gravity of the question involved .the motion which I desired to submit ire-' Messrs. Freeman and Wallace's us correspondence, and in view also of the fact that the matter was talked out to-night by some who should not have taken that course, will the Prime Minister give me an .all, opportunity of submitting the motion toat an early hour, in order that the to House may express its. opinion upon it ? to Honourable members are very tender about their own' grievances, and pass a motion as has just been, dealt with* since it affects themselves, but they appear to be careless as to what' embargo may have been placed on people outside. We preare here to do justice to all. I was surto prised to-night at the. action, of the honour the able member for North Sydney. I have known him for many years, and what he did to-night was against all his previous actions in Parliament -- I have no personal' interest in the matter, other than to see justice done, and so far as I can. I shall see that justice is done in this case, no",70
614,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I simply want justice to be done to other honourable memof bers who have motions on the notice-paper.,70
615,Mr CHANTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I look to honourable to help me, and to the Prime to allow me the opportunity I ask",70
616,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister ofExternal Affairs) [ n . 14] - Howeve r imit portant this matter may be to certain persons, or even to the honourable member, it perfectly impossible to set aside the: whole course of Government business and the Estimates for the consideration of such a question. I am sorry the honourable member did not get an opportunity to put his views before the House. Mr CHANTER I could not get that in five minutes.",70
617,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No ; that was at a . preliminary stage. It is impossible for me to promise the honourable member any more Government time at this period of the session. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.15 p.m.,71
