The circumstances under which the' resignations were made and subsequent steps taken by His Excellency to form a Government - have already ibeen made public, and'it is not .my present intention to refer to them any further than to lay upon the .table a memorandum by His Excellency setting out the views of the Governor General. <, His Excellency has been pleased to entrust ine with a commission to form a new Government, and I ha-^e now to announce its personnel:Prime Minister and Attorney-General - The Right Honourable William Morris Hughes, P.C.

Supply for public and war services is urgent, and you will be asked to authorize the necessary provision. My experience in the government of this country leads me to the conclusion that certain changes in the Government must be made in the near future with a view to strengthening it and making it more efficient to meet the increasing pressure of war duties and those economic and-other conditions arising out ef thewar. The Government's one desire is tobend all its energies to enabling Australia to do its duty in this great war,, and to grapple with those infinitely complex and difficult domestic problems that now confront TIS, and it earnestly invitesthe co-operation and assistance of the Parliament and the people. - The Government intends to meet Parr liament. before the expiration of the proposed Supply, when the Government proposals, together with its immediatepolicy, will be submitted. .His Excellency the Governor General has placed in my hands, and requested me 'to present to the House, a memorandum, to .which I have already referred, and which I now desire to place before, the House. It readsCOMMONWEALT H OF AUSTRALIA . Governor General, -9th January, 1918. On the Sth of January the Prime Minister waited on the GovernoivGerieral and tendered to him his resignation.. In doing so Mr Hughes offered no ad'viee as to who should be asked to form, an Administration. The Governor General considered that. it was his paramount duty (a) to make provision for carrying >on the business' of the country in accordance with> the principles of parliamentary government, -(&) to avoid a - situation arising which must lead to a further appeal to the country within twelve months of an election resulting in the return of tw,o< Houses of .similar political complexion, ' - which are still working in unisom The Governor General was also of the opinion that in .granting a .commission for .the formation of a new Administration: his .choice must be determined solely by the parliamentary situation. Any other course would be a departure from constitutional practice, and an infringement of the rights of Parliament. In the absence of such parliamentary indications as are given by a defeat of the Go\ ernr ment in Parliament,' the Governor General endeavoured to ascertain what the situation was by seeking information from representatives of - all sections of the House with a view to determining where the majority lay, and what prospects there were of forming an alternative Government. As a result of these interviews, in which the knowledge and views of all those he consulted were most freely and generously placed at his service, the Governor General was of opinion that the majority of the National party was likely to .retain its cohesion, and that therefore a Government having the promise of stability could only be formed from that section of the House. In vestigations ""failed to elicit proof of sufficient strength in any quarter. It also became clear to him that the leader in the National party, , who had the best prospect of securing unity among his followers and of therefore being able to form a Government having,those elements of permanence so essential to the conduct of affairs during war, was the Right Honourable' W. M . Hughes, whom the Governor General therefore commissioned to form an Administration. MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE.",20

WHEAT CROP. PAYMENTS:'SUPPLY OE SACKS: THROUGH PESTS . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Has the Prime Minister had any consultation with the Governments of the wheat-growing States recently in regard to the question of the first payments for the crop of"" 1917-18 ?",22
6,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA NNATIONAL WAR,I understand that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is now in Melbourne with a view to making such arrangements as will enable an early payment to be made to the holders of the 1917-18 crop.,22
7,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA NNATIONAL WAR,"Is the Prime Minister aware that there has been a lamentable failure on the part»of many vendors of substantial parcels of cornsacks to supply orders and complete arrangeother ments made as far back as June last? 0 This failure has necessitated, in many cases, the complete cessation of harvesting operations; in other cases, the duplication of orders necessitating the purchase of second-hand sacks, and the dumping of wheat on the earth. If the Prime Minister is aware of the fact, will he take steps to investigate the matter by aft. inquiry, and arrange for farmers' representatives to be on the committee of investigation?",22
8,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA NNATIONAL WAR,"The honourable member will, perhaps, realise that I am hardly in a position now to speak with any degree of certitude as to details, but if the honourable member will give notice'of his question for tomorrow, I shall, in the meantime, make' inquiries, to enable me to supply an answer.

9,Mr NICHOLLS,AUSTRALIA NNATIONAL WAR,"Is it the intention of the Government to* refund to the wheat producers of Australia the amount of money deducted for loss of wheat through mice, rats, and other plagues?",22
10,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA NNATIONAL WAR,"I do not exactly grasp the question. The honourable member will understand that the principle of the Wheat Pool is that all the farmers pool their wheat, and share the profits and losses. Por instance, if a farmer has 10,000 bags, and 1,000 of these are eaten by mice, it is the Pool, and not the farmer, that bears the loss. There is no other way of meeting the circumstances that I know of, beLoss cause the Pool has the whole of the responsibility.",22

Speaking - from memory, think the rule is to keep the ballot-papers yard, and so forth? for twelve months, and then destroy them.

28,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF POSTAL PARCELS A T,I have already stated to the House that the intention of the Government is to ask for Supply.

35,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I have not the papers before me, and I can only speak from memory. There was such a n urgent demand for shipping by the Imperial authorities, that the late Government's matured opinion was that all .other things must stand aside in order that that need might be satisfied as far as was humanly possible.. Accordingly, instructions were given to the Shipping Board to endeavour to .comply with the request of 'the I m perial Goveniment; but I was not awaneI think I ' to l d Mr Lefroy, the Premier of Western Australia-that steps had been taken to attach or commandeer thes.s.

However, I shall make further inquiries, and if my statement today requires supplementing in'any way, I shall supplement it. In the meantime I will see how far it is possible to meet the requirement of the State Government. NAVA L GUARDS ON WHARFS..

In the month of October the decrease was £225,893, while in November the falling off was only £ 2 , 0 8 2 ; in December the Though the is the position of the Customs and Excise rethus appears to be unsatisfactory, an improvement is indicated in that the in falling off latterly has been much less In the Budget submitted on the 8th August,' 1917, it was estimated that the Customs receipts for the current financial year would be £1,976,441 less than those of the preceding financial year. Already the decrease amounts to £1,468,631'. The total estimated Customs and Excise revenue, is £13,630,000, so that the amount received for the half year is a little less than half of the estimate. In view of the unsettled state of shipping, it is difficult to foresee exactly what our Customs and Excise revenue in the future will be, but it seems possible that the estimate for the year will nbt.be quite realized. The total revenue estimated to be received in 1917-18 was £35,181,655 ; the revenue received for the half year ended 31st December is £5,344,000 less than one half of the estimate. This disparity is explained by the fact that almost the whole of the revenue from direct taxation is received in the latter half of the year. The expenditure payable but of revenue for the current financial year was estimated on the 8th August last as £37,283,832. One half of this estimate is £18,641,916. The expenditure for the first six months of the year was £15,788,600, which is £2,853,316 less than one half of the estimate. must be remembered, however, that the expenditure in the latter half of the year is much ' heavier than that in the earlier months, and the interest and sinking f u n d on war loans yet to be paid during the year will be much heavier than that paid in the previous half year. From present indications, it would appear that the expenditure for the full year will be within the estimate. The most notable increases in the expenditure are in connection with pensions and interest and sinking f u n d on war loans. The increases in invalid and old age pensions total £317,118 . Apar t from the additions to the number of pensioners, the increased expenditure is caused by the increase of the pension by 2s. 6d. per week, and the payment of 2s. to in mates of asylums, which operated only for three months in the half year ended 31st December, 1916. In addition, the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in regard to the calculation of income were liberalized by providing that allotments of naval and military pay, war pensions, and separation allowances were not to be calculated as part of the income of the applicant. [106] The increase in war pensions is £662,023. The reasons for this increase are, unfortunately, obvious. The interest falling due on war loans in - Australia on 15th December, . 1916, was not brought into the' accounts in the Treasury until January of the following year. This amount was, approximately, £1,200,000, so that the expenditure for interest and sinking f u n d - on war loans for the half year ended 31st December, 1916, was £2;368,937, and the expenditure for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, was £3,482,200, or an in crease of £1,113,263. The expenditure for additions, new works and buildings for the half year' .ended 31st December, 1917, was£299,900; but, in addition, expenditure out of Loan Fund was made, totalling £948,000, thus .giving a total expenditure for the half year on these new works of £1,247,900. These figures show a decrease of £1,040,850 on the expenditure for the corresponding period of the previous year. The war loan expenditure for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, is £27,326,000, as compared , with £20,939,331 for the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase of £6,387,669 in the current year is' partly It accounted for by a payment of £3,500,000 to the Imperial"" Government for the upkeep of troops. No corresponding payment was made during the first half of the last financial year. In addition, £1,940,686 has been advanced for the purchase of foodstuffs for the I m perial Government and the Government of India. The amount of these advances will, of course, be recovered. Cash balance. The cash balance at 31st December, 1917,, was as follows: Held in banks in Australia on current account .. ' .. £13,767,871 Commonwealth Bank, Australia - Fixe d deposit .. .. 2,000,000 Short dated loans to market, London, and cash held in Commonwealth Bank, London, on current account .. .. 417,573 Surplus funds lent to the Govern- ment of the United Kingdom 3,900,000 £20,0S5,444 Deduct overdraft as followsr-r.

Under an agree-ment made on the 5th November, 1915, and modified at the Premiers' Conference in January, 1917, the Commonwealth undertook to raise oversea's for the States (except New South Wales) the following amounts': For 1916 .. .. £8,940,000 For 1917 .. .. Total ' .. .. £14,340,000 In pursuance of this agreement ,the Commonwealth has raised the following loans: In June, 1916 .. In April. 1917 . . .. In August, 1917 Total .. £12,000,000 The Commonwealth has still to raise £2,340,000 to meet the requirements for 1917, - and has agreed to advance amount to the States in anticipation of the issue of a further loan. Some of the States have already been paid their proportions of this £2,340,000, and the money is available for the other States on application A portion of the amount of £18,000,000 loaned to the States (except Queensland) out of the Notes Fund in 1914-15 has already matured, and the balance will mature during 1918. The States desire that the loans, totalling £18,000,000, be £3,926,880. renewed. The Commonwealth has proposed that the agreement of the 5th vember, 1915, be further amended by ducing the £2,700,000, the amount raised by the Commonwealth for the States i i i 1918. In the event proposal being agreed to, the Commonwhich wealth will be in a position to give newals to the States of their several portions of the £18,000,000 until one year after the termination of the war. War Loans. On the last, subscriptions were invited to the fifth Commonwealth war loan-styled ""Liberty Loan."" The conditions of the issue were similar to those .of the earlier war loans, except that the date of maturity was fixed as the 15th December, 1927, in lieu^of the 15th December, 1925. The amount subscribed up to the closing date-2nd November-w-as In addition, £609,129 was invested in war savings certificates during the period for which the loan was open for subscription. The total amount subscribed for Sir John Forrest. war purposes while the loan was open was thus £21,041,719. To meet the wishes of many people who will be receiving payment for their wool 'and desire to invest in the war loan, it has been decided to accept further .sub-. scriptions to the Liberty Loan during the 5,400,000 continuance of the wool appraisements. The subscriptions to war loans raised within the Commonwealth amount to £100,486,200, made up as follows :First issue .. . . £13,389,440 Second issue .. . . 21,655,680 Third issue . . . . .. .23,587,420 £4,000,000 Fourth issue .. .. 21,421,070 3,500,000 Fifth issue .. . . 20,432,590 4,500,000 £100,486,200 In addition, up to 5th January, £3,373,637 has been raised by means of war savings certificates, making a grand this total of £103,859,837. As I stated previously, the Supply now asked for is for three-months, and covers the ordinary services df ""the Government"" and war services payable out of revenue. The total amount . of the schedule is £3,449,972. Omitting refunds of revenue -£100,000-the.tota l is £3,349,972. The - amount thus asked for is considerably less than one-fourth of the total estimated expenditure under annual votes, viz., Supply has already been granted up to. No31st December, 1917. The amount pro^revided, omitting Treasurer's advance and to be refunds of revenue, is £6,913,386. Excluding Treasurer's advance and reof this funds of revenue, the total provision will be available to meet expendireture to 31st March, 1918, is £10,263,358. The total provision in the Estimates of 1917-18 for the ordinary services of the Government and war services payable out 15th September of revenue is :Annual votes, not including war £11,059,371 the Annual votes, war services . . 4,648,151 £15,707,522 Deduct large sums for which no provision has been made in o Supply:Interest on transferred properties .. . . £377,670 Remission of Customs £20,432,590. duties ... .. 200,000 Eepatriation of soldiers 1,000,000 1,577,670 £14,129,852 Three-fourths of this amount is 1 £10,597,389, and as the total provision in Supply to 31st March, 1918, is £10,263,358, it will he seen that the proposed expenditure for the nine months is less than three-fourths of the estimated expenditure. ' No provision has been made in the Bill for any service which has not previously been approved by Parliament. In connection with increases to salaries, provision has only been made for such increases as fall due under Arbitration Court awards or are. automatic under the Public Service Act. Provision has not been made for increases to salaries in the higher divisions of the Service. These increases will not be paid until the Estimates are passed hy Parliament.",25
45,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Yarra) [5.30] - The Government are taking up a most extraordinary attitude. Three months ago they brought forward a Bill providing for three months' Supply, and three months prior to that they introduced a Bill covering a like period. I then said that some of their supporters would vote, without comment, any amount for which they asked,- being prepared to swallow anything that the Government chose to throw to them.",29
46,Sir JOHN PORREST,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Do not sav that.,29
47,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I absolutely believe it to be true. The honourable member for Flinders, who, until a month ago, carried some weight in this'country, but who, unfortunately, does not carry so much weieht today",29
48,Mr SAMPSON,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Why these personal attacks so early in the honourable member's address ?,29
49,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"We are not to be permitted to openly discuss the conduct of the Government. Some of the Government claqueurs are prepared to howl a man down in this House, just as their pets outside tried to howl us down during the recent referendum campaign. I warn honourable members, opposite, however, that they are not going to howl me down, either in the House or outside of it. I am going to say what I think of the present Government.",29
50,Mr WATT,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Hear , hear! Who is trying to howl down the honourable member?",29
51,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"An honourable member who was after the Minister's job. When last the Government asked forthree months' Supply, the honourable [106]- 2 member for Flinders said that no doubt before another Supply Bill was submitted the Government would come down with a definite statement as to their financial policy. What is the statement we have had today ? The Prime Minister has told us that the Government intend to obtain three months' Supply, and that we shall then adjourn over' practically the whole of that period. That means that we shall re-assemble about the 1st Aprila fitting date for the present Government' to meet Parliament. The Government are fooling the people, and, what is worse, they are fooling themselves. They seem tb think that by. shelving the notice of motion of want of confidence which I gave this afternoon they will be able to stifle criticism. I deliberately said that I was prepared to move that motion' at the earliest opportunity; and while I do not desire to delay the granting of Supply, I am prepared to proceed at - once with"" the notice of motion I have given. The Prime Minister, in his wisdom, however, has decided that that shall be placed at the bottom, I presume, of the notice-paper, so that we shall have no opportunity to discuss it. The right honourable member will recollect a similar action taken in this House. I refer to the occasion when the Cook Government were hanging on to ofiice by one vote. They were clinging to office just as the present limpet-like Adminis- > tration are holding on. They would rather anything happen than that they should be compelled to leave the Treasury bench. The Cook Government, on the occasion to which I refer, ignored, just as the present Government are doing, a noticeof motion of want of confidence. They also set at the bottom of the business paper a notice of motion disagreeing with a ruling of the then Speaker. In the same way, the Prime Minister will not give this House an opportunity to discuss the policy of the Government, nor the country a chance to learn the views of honourable members concerning his Cabinet. Might I'remind him of the fate of the Cook Government? Need I remind him that when they went to the polls' they were swept out of office? Although the Government are fooling themselves by thinking they are cunning and clever in thwarting discussion in this way, they will probably meet with a similar fate. I would describe the present Government as "" the P.B. Administration."" 1 do not suggest by the use of tbose initials that they are a pawn-broking Governwith ment, although it is quite possible they have put their political consciences in pawn; indeed, their political conduring sciences should be in excellent repair since they make no use of them.",29

55,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"That is not correct, but, even if it is, that is. no reason why a badexample should be followed. I repeat, however, that, the honourable ber's statement is not correct. In ten or - eleven of. the fourteen pre-war years this Parliament we prorogued always in or before December. That so, the Budget proposals and the Estiment mates must have been dealt with in the first half of each financial year. only exceptions to j j i at practice occurred during the first session of the first liament, when owing to the Tariff bates we sat for twenty months, and, thing. again, in one of the sessions of the second Commonwealth Parliament. - Sir JOHN FOBBEST - I do not think ever passed an Appropriation Bill before Christmas.",30
56,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"We must have done, since in pre-war sessions Ave nearly always prorogued before Christmas. The extraordinary attitude assumed by the Government in regard to the want-ofconfidence motion is really in accordance a line of conduct suggested by the that Minister for Trade and Customs. The honourable gentleman, speaking at Burnie the recent referendum campaign, is reported to have said, when referring to the numerous "" comparatively unknown persons "" who addressed meetings, that "" If he had his way he would prevent them from speaking against the referendum proposals."" "" He would not' inallow 'adverse criticism of the Governt . ment."" Apparently he has succeeded in round to his way of thinking the of his colleagues, for the Government seem to be prepared to use the - Standing Orders to prevent criticism of their actions in Parliament, and to avail prethemselves of the War Precautions Act - to prevent criticism of them outside. The anyPostmaster-General, who says he has been sitting up writing letters morning after morning until 3 o'clock, is reported to have said - of the conscription proposals, "" If these proposals are turned down this Government will not remain in ofiice al-twenty-four hours.""

They were certainly anxious to tighten up the machinery of the War Precautions Act in order that they might launch a' few more pros3cutionls.

He is undoubtedly in the wrong, and that is why he and his party want to cover up their true position. I do not say that the Government should have resigned merely because the majority of the people voted against their conscription referendum proposals, but I do say that, in view of the pledge given by the Prime Minister, they should have done so. They thought that by giving such a pledge they could so load the political dice as to be sure of a majority.",31

As a matter of fact, a report of 1 one of my speeches, which appeared in the Daily Telegraph, was not permitted to appear.in The Worker. The editor of the Sydney Worker was fined because he did not submit to the censor matter which he published, and which had already appeared in other newspapers. The Prime Minister went to Adelaide, where he was photographed with some of his supporters. The nearest man to him in the group was the censor for South Australia - Majo r Smeaton- a political partisan, who should have had the common decency to stand out of that picture. By being photographed with the Prime Minister he showed himself to be an absolute partisan. I have'proof galleys from an Adelaide daily newspaper office showing that the censor deleted certain statements attributed by me to Senator Pearce-state ments which had actually been made by Senator Pearce, and had already appeared in the press. But because I said during the referendum campaign that these statements had been made by Senator Pearce, that portion of the report of my speech was censored. As a matter I of fact, Senator Pearce made the . statements in question before theconscription referendum was thought of that - befor e the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) Compelled the Government to take the referendum. .1 do not intend to' place myself in the position of thanking honourable members opposite for any courtesy - Compelled as I am to have this discussion on Supply, I am confined to half an hour, but I shall avail myself of all the forms of the House in order to place my views before the country. Had it been possible, I should have notified the Prime Minister that it was my intention to submit a motion of want of confidence. As honourable members know, I have never contemplated .moving the adjournment of the House, or taking any similar step, without notifying the - Government of my intention, and certainly on an occasion such as this I should have let the Leader of the Government know what I intended, to do. Had I been permitted to discuss these matters on the motion of which I have given notice, I should have been allowed either one hour and five minutes or one * hour and thirty-five minutes; bu t as things are I find it utterly impossible to deal with my material in the time at my disposal. We find supporters of the Government quite prepared to quietly see their leader ignore the notice of motion , I have given. As I said before, I do not look for, nor intend to accept, any courtesy from the Government; I desire nothing bu t fair play, and I shall take all the advantage to which I am entitled under the Standing Orders.

Throughout the whole of recent campaign the censorship was used in the same way in regard to every memthe ber of the' Government exactly as on the previous occasion. The Government, after having used the censorship and the War Precautions Act regulations in this way outside the House, are now prepared,' inside the House, to use the Standing Orders and their majority to prevent discussion on any motion that ,may be moved against them. When I gave notice of motion today, the Prime Minister said, in effect, No, I shall not accept it ; you can debate the matter on Supply."" Does the Prime Minister think that such a move as that will help him to get supply?

Had any such publication been issued by the other side,, there would, undoubtedly, say have been a prosecution; indeed, on the 1 anti-conscriptionist side no man dare his mouth, whereas those in favour of - the affirmative vote could say what to they liked. There was no regard for the truth at all in what the newspapers pub- lished throughout the Commonwealth in the favour of conscription; and still the other side won. It is a great tribute to Democracy of Australia that it should win this fight in spite of press, purse, and pulpit, or, at any rate, a great part of the pulpit. Amongst the Congregationalists, the Baptists, the Church Christ, and other denominations, were Orders found men to stand out in opposition the Government proposals; but, - speaking generally, the affirmative side had the be no longer' heard. support, as I say, of press, purse, pulpit. And still the people won. In spite of the defeat of the referento dum, the Government hang on to office, liament. and we find honourable members like the honourable member for Dampier (Mr .

Amongst those honourable members we have the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), who professed to opposed to the Government, and used harsh and hard words concerning them.

Whilst I agree that, the removaT'of the time l i m it on. speeches in Supply, would afford us opportunity enough to discuss a censure motion, I would remind the Committee that if we are to pass Supplv in order to pay the Public Service tomorrow the Supply Bill must necessarily be disposed of to-night, and honourable members will not have an I opportunity in Supply of recording a direct vote upon the motion of no confidence. The Government are not acting fairly in asking us to grant three months' Supply before launching our motion of censure. Of course, it is entirely for the Government and the party supporting them to decide what treatment shall be meted out to the minority in the House; but it is well within the constitutional rights of Parliament for an Opposition to move a no-confidence motion, and that motion can be placed in whatever position on the notice-paper the Government choose. Usually it is taken as the first business. If the Opposition agree to grant Supplv for one month in order that the services may be carried on they will be acting very fairly. If the Government will not accept that offer we as an Opposition cannot make any further concession. I offer the Government Supply for one month, and then the no-confidence motion can be dealt with. To ask for three months' Supply whilst' the no-confidence motion is hanging over the Government's head is a proposition which is not fair to honourable members on this side.",35
102,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [7.55] - We desire to give members of the Opposition' every opportunity of discussing the motion of censure; but as a Government and a party with a preponderance of members in this House, we cannot admit the right of the minority to dictate as to how much Supply we shall have. °Such a decision is the .right of the majority. Supply for two months would carry us only as far as Easter. Honourable members must' recollect that Supply is already a fortnight in arrears, therefore a grant of supply for one month would only make provision for a fortnight ahead. honourable member for Y a r ra offers to grant a month's Supply, to then deal with ,the no-confidence motion, and when that is disposed of, to grant a further two months' Supply. I ask him what is the difference in essence between that, offer and the proposition I have put forward?",36
103,Mr WEST,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,If we grant three months' Supply the Government will tell us to go home and mind the babies.,36
104,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"If honourable members opposite take that view, what is the use of discussing any arrangement at all ? I )say - distinctly that honourable members shall have reasonable time for the discussion of their, motion, but I do not think that the debate should last beyond next week. Mr J. H. CATTS - Is not tion entitled, under circumstances such' as those now existing, to challenge the Government on a direct motion 1",36
105,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Of course it is, but - at the same time are not the Government entitled to decide what Supply they shall have? Are the Opposition to be allowed to take the business out of our hands ?",36
106,Mr JH CATTS,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,No other Government would attempt to get Supply with a motion of no confidence tabled against them ,36
107,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"That is a matter which can be discussed either on Supply or on the motion of no confidence. The Opposition say that we are asking for too .much Supply, but their Leader offers no opposition to Supply for one month, and will grant a further two months' Supply if the no-confidence motion is defeated.",36
108,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I did not say that. I said that the Government may have Supply for one month, but I do not think they should ask for. three months' Supply when a no-confidence motion has been moved. When that motion is disposed of, if the Government are successful, they can do what fjhey .like in regard to f u r ther Supply. ,",36
109,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I see no fundamental difference between that statement and the offer I make. The Opposition are trying to dictate to the Government as to what Supply is to be asked for. Mr J. H. CATTS - Apparentl y the Ministerial party have decided the matter outside the'chamber, and we are to have no say. The Mr TUDOH - No Opposition ever offered even a month's Supply when a no-confidence motion was on the paper.",36
110,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Will not the honors able member admit that the reason he is offering Supply for one month is that he dare not refuse it ? I am willing to meet 'honourable members to any reasonable extent. If the Leader of the Opposition will agree to grant a month's Supply, pro formd Mr TUDOR. - I agreed to that before dinner.",36
111,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,If the honourable gentleman will say that after the no-cohfidence motion is disposed of he will grant a further two months' Supply,36
112,Mr FENTON,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,No .,36
113,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Honourable members an Opposi- cannot have it both ways. If honourable members say that after the no-confidence motion has been settled we are to have another wrangle over Supply, I am opposed to that course. If they will agree to allow a month's Supply pro formd, and then deal with the no-confidence motion upon the condition that it be decided next week-'- ",36
114,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,I do not specify any time within which the motion shall be decided.,36
115,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I do specify a time ; otherwise we might be discussing it for a month. Will not the honourable member see that whilst on the one hand he says we are denying him an opportunity to state 'his case, on the other hand, when we offer him five days in which to challenge the Government, he says the time is not enough.",36
116,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,There are only three sitting days in the week.,36
117,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Tlier e is tomorrow, and, if honourable members choose, we shall sit on Saturday.",37
118,Mr BOYD,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Unde r the Standing Orders, the whole of the members of the present Opposition could not occupy more than twenty-seven hours in debating the no confidence motion. /. Mr HUGHES' - Le t us strip the mask off this pretence of being denied an opportunity to ventilate grievances. I offer the Opposition all that it is entitled to. If members opposite cannot in five days say all that they have to say, they must have a great deal to talk about.",37
119,Mr FENTON,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Will Government members remain absolutely silent?,37
120,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I , for one, shall not. Already I have had .to listen to more than I have cared to hear, and I am certain that honourable members opposite will not remain silent when I have spoken; I shall make some of them sit up. My proposal is that a Bill granting a month's Supply be passed now as a formal measure, that there be a ful l debate on the no-confidence motion, and that the discussion on a Bill to grant Supply for two months more shall be confined to financial matters.",37
121,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,We ought not fettered in the discussion of Supply beyond the limitation on speeches imposed by the Standing Orders.,37
122,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Le t me remind the lionorable member of the action taken by a Government, of which he and I were Ministers, whose leader moved, "" That the question be .now put.""",37
123,Mr TUDOR,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,After there had been a continuous discussion of forty-eight hours.,37
124,Mr HUGHES,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I offer more than that; I am willing to allow the debate on the no-confidence motion to continue day and night. But members of the Opposition desire, not to state a case against the Government, but to pose as persons suffering a grievance. I offer a greater 'opportunity for debate than has ever before been offered to members in the position of the present Opposition. When I sat in opposition alongside the honourable - member for Yarra, we never got the that I am now offering, and when he I sat together as Ministers, the GovernSupply Bill. ment of which we were members never gave its opponents such a show - I 2911 willing to allow the whole of next week for the debate on the no-confidence motion; from Monday morning until midnight on Saturday.

How long the discussion of that motion shall last is a matter within the determination of the Government, which has a majority* and can closure the debate at any time. The no-confidence motion having been disposed of, Ministers can say what business shall be taken. Apart from the referendum and the things that were done in / connection with it, honourable members may desire to criticise the conduct of various Departments. I have heard dissatisfaction expressed regarding the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department, the Defence Department, and other Departments.

He was interrupted, and evidently changed his mind as to the statement he was about to make. Is it the intention of the Government when we re-assemble at that time to submit a Bill .providing for conscription? The Prime Minister may laugh, but a mere guffaw does not dispose of the question. I desire an answer - I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government then to bring in such a Bill ; and, if so, whether on its introduction they intend to dissolve Parliament and have a general election on it? W i ll the Prime Minister answer?",38
135,Mr WALLACE,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"West Sydney) [8.22] - I desire tp revert to the question that I put to the Prime Minister this afternoon as to certain evictions which are taking place in Sydney. I have here a copy of the notice of eviction. It SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST. Sydney, 4th January, 1918. The Sydney Harbor Trust Commissioners do hereby give you notice that they require you to quit and peaceably deliver up possession of the premises with the appurtenances situate at No. High-street, in the city of Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, which you hold of the Commissioners as tenant thereof, at the expiration of the week of your tenancy which expire next after the expiration of one week from the serviee of this notice. Over 200 copies of this notice to quit have been issued to citizens in one area of West Sydney. They are the outcome of the late strike. After that strike the Federal Government created a Coal Board, which allocated the work on the water frontage in this area. Old members of the Coal Lumpers Union, which is now non-existent, have been debarred, under that arrangement, from obtaining employment. I understand that the Coal Board has issued instructions to the Contractors that they are not to employ any ex-inembers of the Coal Lumpers Union. In consequence of this instruction 800 men, women, and children at Miller's Point are practically starving. They have been obliged to seek for bread at the benevolent asylums. While that is so, the Government are employing over 400 volunteer workers-youn g men without families.",38
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Who is employing them?,38
137,Mr WALLACE,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"You are employing them, under the Coal Board.",38
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,I am not. I know nothing about the matter.,38
139,Mr WALLACE,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"This sort of thing is a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth. Many of the men who have received - notice to quit have been living in the same area for t h i r ty and for t y years. They have worked all their lives on the water front, and are not in a position to leave it to seek employment in the country. During the late strike, volunteers were brought down from country districts to work on the wharfs - They bave no fixed place of abode; they are young men, and many of them are without dependants; but they are being kept in employment. In this way an effort is being made to starve out old residents on the water front-the coal-lumpers and others who have been forced to. seek relief. Now we have the threat that they are fo be turned into the streets in order that the houses occupied by"" them may be handed over to the volunteer labourers. This action is being taken by the Government of New South Wales. Surely the Commonwealth Government should step in at this juncture and in struct the Coal Board to. give employment to those to whom the employment on the wharfs legitimately belongs, and to send the so-called volunteers either upcountry again, or where an attempt is being made to force the coal-lumpers to go? Over 300 sons of these very coal-lumpers have enlisted, and are at the Pront. Over 600 sonsof water-frontage workers living at Miller's Point alone are at the Front. Is not this action of which I complain likely to prove of service to the Germans ? Would not thisnotice to quit prove excellent propaganda for the Germans to use in the trenches? "" Evictions in Australia! "" Imagine such a notice as this being thrown by the Germans into our trenches'. If it were, it would soon end the war, so far as our boys were concerned. It is a disgrace to the administration of the Federal Government that such a thing should take place. .. Mr JH CATTS - And this is the Government that professes todesire unity and harmony 1",38
140,Mr WALLACE,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"They profess a sire for unity and harmony in the comthe munity, and this is how they are trying to ' secure it . When the censure motion is under discussion, I shall have more to say on this subject. It is a very urgent matter, however, and should at once be taken into consideration. These people are threatened with eviction by next Saturday.",39
141,Mr BOYD,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Do they all live together?,39
142,Mr WALLACE,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,They all live in the one area. Mr BoYD.^-May I ask whether the (notice to' quit issued by the Sydney Harbor Trust relates to part of the area which the Trust is going to resume ?,39
143,Mr WALLACE,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"The Harbor Trust resumed - this particular area some fifteen, years ago,, and has held it since then. Another area affected is under the control of the Bocks Resumption Board, which' is under the direction of the State Treasurer. At one time, it was supposed to be a slum area, but it has been rebuilt. It was'the intention of the Harbor Trust that only those who worked on the water front should be allowed to occupy these houses, and that is the excuse offered for these threatened evictions. It is said that there is no work on the water fron t for the men now living in these houses. They cannot obtain work owing to the action of certain people, and they are to be turned out of their houses, so that the volunteer workers may occupy them. \ i Mr Fenton - I dare say that many of these men have paid by way of rental more than the value of the houses they occupy.",39
144,Mr WALLACE,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Yes , they have lived there for many years I myself lived in the district for practically thirty-seven years, and there are some who have resided - there for forty and fifty years. These are the people, who are to be turned out. In one case, a woman with eight children, whose husband has gone upcountry to seek employment, has received notice to quit. A few days ago I saw a soldier assisting his married sister to shift her furniture from a house in the area. He told me he was going to the F r o n t ; that his sister's husband was up-country, and that he did not want to see her turned out of her home - He was, therefore, placing her in another house, and intended, while away at the Front, to pay for her keep. He will be going to the deFront with a very sad heart,- in view of treatment meted out to his sister. - This sort of thing should not be tolerated in Australia. Evictions on such a wholesale scale are a reflection on the Commonwealth. If they were attempted . by a private landlord, action would, no doubt, be taken; and since a State Government is responsible for them, the Commonwealth should intervene. The War Precautions Ac t seems to be sufficiently elastic to enable the Commonwealth Government to do anything they please, it is nearly time that they got into munication with the New South Wales Government and prevented these tions. If work were found for these men, they would soon be able to pay off the arrears of rent which have been accumuI lating owing io their wa'nt pf employmediately, '.ment. I hope that the ""new"" Commonwealth Government will at once take this matter, and deal with it as be dealt with.",39

I have in my hand here the notice which the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Wallace) has read, rather, indicated without reading. What the honourable member did not tell us that the notice relates to some action the State Government, and has nothing front. whatever to do with any action of the Federal Government.",40

It is true that, owing to the late unfortunate the rtrike, there are many hundreds of men n it ^out of employment-the employment is not there for them at the present time. I am-speaking now only of my own operations ; I have nothing to do with what the State Government is doing. I have done something already in the direction of f acili fating the employment of these men, who are so unfortunately placed owing to their recent unwise action. There is no intention or desire on the part of the Commonwealth Government to victimize anybody. I have but one feeling in the matter, and that is to heal up the tfld breaches.",40
165,Mr BRENNAN,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"That is something like the Government's assurance about the censorship. You give an assurance, but others take no notice!",41
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"In view of such an interjection, I had perhaps better say nothing further. Whatever one may attempt to say, some unworthy imputation is made immediately. As to my opinion about the honourable member's conduct and his interjection, it appears to me that he is a great deal more anxious to make' political capital out of the misfortunes of these men than to help them.",41
167,Mr HIGGS,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,That is &n old gag!,41
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"What can be thought of a mau who makes an unworthy imputation when I honestly promise to have the fullest inquiry made? Why should a man be subject to such imputations from honourable members opposite in relation to a matter which has no party or political bearing ? These unfortunate men are out of work, and I will do anything I can to help them. I again promise that I shall have the fullest possible inquiry made, in order to ascertain exactly what is the relation of the Commonwealth Government to the coal-lumping industry. My own impression is that we have nothing whatever to do with it. Mr MAHONY"" (Dalley) [8.35] - I am pleased to hear that the Minister for the. Navy, proposes to have an inquiry, but I trust 'that in this inquiry he will not rely exclusively on his own departmental officers for information. I suggest that he should give the secretary and the president of the Lumpers Union an opportunity to produce first-hand evidence of what the Coal Board has actually done.",41
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I can tell the honourable member what I propose to do. I shall inquire as to the relation of the Navy Department to the Coal Board, and not as to the conduct of the Coal Board as a whole. That is a State matter, and I do not propose to interfere in State affairs.",41
170,Mr MAHONY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"If that be so, the inquiry will be a sham and a farce; it will not be an inquiry into the grievances of the men, but a side-stepping of the issue. The Coal Board controls the whole of the coal output, and nobody can get one ounce of coal witnout its permission. I have it on the authority of the union officials that when some of the men were successful in obtaining work from stevedores, the Coal Board .intimated that if their employment was persisted in the stevedores would get no more coal. The result was that the stevedores had to discharge the members of the union, though many of them expressed regret at having to take this step. However, they had no choice in the matter, inasmuch as otherwise they would not get any further coal.",41
171,Mr CHARLTON,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Is not the present position-also delaying shipping?,41
172,Mr MAHONY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Yes , that is so. Nobody knows better than the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), for instance, the trouble there is today in the coal trade owing to the inexperience of the men employed in loading. As a matter of fact, the stevedores would not employ these men for five minutes if they had.any option in the matter.",41

174,Mr MAHONY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"I do - not wish to enter into any criticism of Captain Glossop at this particular stage, but he is the same gentleman who made those impudent remarks at a public gathering in Sydney the other day.",41
175,Mr JENSEN,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Do not forget that he had charge of the Sydney when it sent the Emden to the bottom.,41
176,Mr MAHONY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"All I have to say to the Minister is that the least said about that episode the better it will be for the 1 reputation of Captain Glossop; but I do not wish to be dragged away from the actual question about which I rose to say a word or two. I urge the Minister to give the matter consideration, and when he is inquiring into it, to remember that it is the Coal Board that controls 1 the whole of the output of coal, and in the final analysis is responsible for this thing occurring - I want Ministers, who pride themselves upon being a win-the-war Government-it seems to me that they are better at - winning Ministerial office-to remember that there are hundreds of the sons of these fathers mothers who are fighting in the trenches today. As the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Wallace) has said, would be a very poor advertisement for Australia if the Germans could shove a placard in their trench bearing the words, "" Australians, while you are fightresting ing here your fathers and mothers Australia are being evicted."" . Dr MALONEY (Melbourne^ [8.43]. - I would like to ask the Minister repredesire senting the Minister for Defence if his attention has been called to various ports in the press that agents representWannon ing landlords have given evidence i Courts on oath that many women will not pay their rent because they are soldiers' wives. I wish him to see whether steps' canuot be taken by his Department, or, if necessary, whether they cannot taken under the War Precautions Act, 1 to compel every agent who makes such a statement to give the names and addresses of the. women who, he says, will not pay rent because they are soldiers' wives. I do not believe those statements. There are good and bad among all classes, but it is an infamy that our law Courts should be used for the purpose of slandering the wives and relatives of men are fighting at the Pront, not only for but for the very landlords whose houses are occupied. It is only justice to loss. our soldiers that these agents should compelled to give names and addresses so that inquiries may be made.by the Department into the truth or falsity of their statements. In one Court I instructed a gentleman to ask the question, but the agent would not give any names. .Many returned soldiers have spoken to me this matter, saying that the statements these agents are a slur on their brothersorable at the Front. I wish to, p ut a question to the Prime Minister in all good temper. W i exception of the Canadian election, Austhe tralian soldiers have been the only soldiers empowered, to vote in any election for their, country. The soldiers of no other participant in the war have had that honour or that power. Now, as an Auswill tralian, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will have the ballot-papers that are Australian property, having been voted on by Australian soldiers, returned to Australia ? If they are sent out here recounted, and the numbers tally with what were given out last year and this and year I will be content, to accept them; ; ' but if the papers are destroyed in England, or wherever they are plalced,' the it Prime. Minister will agree with me that 1 the outside public will have very serious up differences of opinion on the matter. I merely ask, as an Australian, that. the place for Australian ballot-papers in should be in Australia.",41
177,Mr BLAKELEY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"Darling) [8.47] - I to speak on a matter which was referred to 'this afternoon in a question subremitted by the honourable member for (Mr Rodgers), namely, the supn the ply of cornsacks. If the Government ' have shown incapacity, it is in regard to the question of arranging for the supply of cornsacks to the farmers of Australia. Long months have passed, and be the Win-the-war Government have endeavoured vainly to get sufficient bags in order to supply Australian farmers, but evidently through the manipulation of those who deal in these articles the Government, wittingly or unwittingly, has become merely the creature of circumstances. As a result, serious loss has been occasioned, not only to our farmers, but ' also to the people of Australia, because who every bushel of wheat which is wasted us, through incompetency - or incapacity - to deal with the wheat is a national In answer to a question subbe mitted on the 26th July of last year ' by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston), the-Prime M in -' ister said that he was making all arrangements for the supply of Cornsacks for the Australian farmers. The matter was on not allowed to drop, because questions of were submitted subsequently by the honmember for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers),' by the - honourable member for Barker, by myself, and by other honourable members; but, notwithstanding that t h the the matter was continually kept under notice of. the Prime Minister and the Win-the-war Government, today wheat is spread out on dunnage all through the Darling electorate and the wheat-growing areas of Australia, and a great deal of it be wasted. It is a costly process to tip wheat out on to dunnage and the different receptacles where it is stored and rebag it . I have always approved of a Government dealing with these matters, and but had the Win-the-war Government not decided to take action to supply cornsacks to the farmers, our - wheat-growers - would have got sufficient cornsacks themselves. However, the Government decided that in the interests of the primary producers of Australia they would get the cornsacks, and not less than six mouths .ago they started to get them. They have not, procured them. Mr BopoERS - The honourable member's statement is not quite a correct one. The Government announced, in the first place, that the cornBacks would be purchased in the ordinary way, but that they would fliVfli 1 S'blo",42
178,Mr BLAKELEY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,I have said that the Government said they guarantee that the Australian would have sufficient cornsacks. I refer the honourable member to pages 522 onwards'in the last volume of. Hansard.,43
179,Mr RODGERB,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,I have watched every detail.,43
180,Mr BLAKELEY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"So have I . I have been interested in the matter. Notwithstanding the fact that many of us have been taking action in. the matter of the supply of these sacks during the past six months, the Government have not kept their promise to the wheat-growers of this country.' Even today there are. no cornsacks for distribution in Australia.",43
181,Mr CORSER,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,Owing to the lack of ships.,43
182,Mr BLAKELEY,OFFER OF STATE VESSEL TO,"It is not owing to the lack of ships, but to the lack of foresight and organization and to the incapacity of the Win-the-war Government. I have nothing further to say, but I protest agaiust the incapacity displayed'by the Win-the-war Government in dealing with this very small matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8.52 p.m. ' would be would farmer",43
