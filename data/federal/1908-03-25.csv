1,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In a telegram from South Australia appearing, in today's newspapers, it is stated that the practice followed at Port Adelaide during the last"" twelve months in regard to Customs entries has been found somewhat unsatisfactory, and a return to the old system is asked for, subject to the modifications necessary to check the possibility of frauds such as were recently discovered being again perpetrated. On the 2nd October last, Tasked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether entries might not be - madeand checked before the reporting of the vessels carrying the goods to which they referred, and he told me thafa trial of that system would be given, and that, if it were found to work satisfactorily, it would' be made permanent. I now ask him whether any-' thing has been done in the direction of complying with the request which I thenvoiced for the agents and importers of Port Adelaide. A large deputation had previously waited on the Minister in connection with, the matter.",14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I . received at Adelaide a deputation on this .subject, and it has since been engaging my attention. When the honourable member asked .this question in October last, a trial was being given to the new system, and I deemed it advisable to extend the period of probation. The Department is anxious to give every facility for the passing of. entries without the removal of '- any safeguard against leakageor frauds on the revenue, and I shall be glad to ascertain how. the. matter stands, and let the honourable and learned member know later, the result of my inquiry. SECRET DRUGS AND MEDICINES. MR. BEALE'S REPORT.",14
3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister any objection to laying on the table all the papers connected with' the appointment of Mr Beale as Royal Commissioner to inquire into certain matters affecting, the use of drugs, and the papers connected with, the publication of his report?",14

5,Mr WATKINS,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,H as the Minister of Defence any objection to laying on the table all the papers relating to the dismissal of some militiamen in connection with a dispute which occurred on the Adamstowni range in the Newcastle district ?,15
6,Mr EWING,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"If papers are laid on the table of the House, it is difficult for the Department to regain possession of them; but I am willing that the papers asked for shall be laid on the table of the Library.",15
7,Mr WATKINS,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,That wil l do.,15
8,Mr MATHEWS,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,Has the Minister noticed that it is rumoured in the newspapers that the Premier of Victoria is taking into consideration the removal of the rifle butts from WilMamstown to a less-populated locality ? Is there any truth in that rumour?,15
9,Mr EWING,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"Beyon d what I have seen in the newspapers, I have no knowledge. No representations on the subject have been made to the Department. Mr COON.'-Hav e arrangements been made for increasing the duration of the Easter encampment in Victoria from four to six days?",15
10,Mr EWING,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,The Government have determined that the Victorian Forces shall have an opportunity to encamp for six days.,15
11,Mr CROUCH,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether he proposes to pay the men who attend the forthcoming six days' camp in respect of the extra days even though they have previously put in the time necessary to entitle them to their annual militia pay of £ 6 3s. ?,15
12,Mr EWING,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"The Government cannot extend the time unless the usual pay conditions are observed. That would appear to me to follow automatically upon the statement which I have already made. But the honourable member desires to know whether men who have already received payment of the full amount to which they are entitled, will receive additional pay?.",15
13,Mr CROUCH,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,Yes .,15
14,Mr EWING,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I should like to think over that question, but I can assure the honourable member that the right thing will be done. . [339] DEFENCE. NORTHAM POST OFFICE.",15
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I wish to know from the Minister. representing the EASTER Minister of Home Affairs, why public works, for which money has been' voted, are not carried out more speedily - My constituents at Northam have written to tell me that great inconvenience is felt there because, although an appropriation was made by Parliament six or seven months ago for the construction of .a new post office, the work has not yet been carried out. To mymind, the delay is unreasonable. A small work like this should have been put in hand in much shorter time. I ask the Minister to inquire as to the cause of the delay, and to expedite matters as much as possible.",15
16,Mr DEAKIN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"The causes of delay which have come under my notice are various. In the last instance, it was due to our dependence on the Works Departments of the States, whose officers, when there is pressure, naturally give preference to State undertakings. If the right honourable member will give notice of his .question, I shall be glad to obtain a fuller reply.",15
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I shall be satisfied if the Prime Minister will cause an inquiry to be made into the matter. PUBLIC SERVICE INCREMENT S.  attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that increments which have been overdue to public servants more than ten months have not yet been paid, because the Estimates have not been, passed. Will he see that they are paid without further delay?",15
18,Mr DEAKIN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"The remedy is to pass the Estimates as soon as possible; but, as that may take a week or two, I shall inquire whether the delay cannot be avoided in some other way.

A number of these Ordinances have already been printed by order of. Parliament, and, so that honourable members may have in their possession a complete and consecutive volume of all the Ordinances of Papua, I moved for the printing of the remainder, to which the House has agreed. COMMONWEALTHAND STATES .",16
20,Mr WATKINS,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I desire to ask the ' Prime Minister whether he has observed in the report of the proceedings of the New South Wales Parliament a statement by Mr Wade to the effect that he expects the' Premiers of the different States at the forthcoming Conference will unite with a view to warding off attacks made upon the States by the Commonwealth? If so, does he know of any attacks which have been so made, and what - is the nature of them ?",16
21,Mr DEAKIN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I am not aware of any attacks made or proposed to be made, upon the States by the Commonwealth Government. I am aware, however, that a readjustment of certain financial arrangements will require to be considered which may affect the States Governments and the States Legislatures in their relation to the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Legislature. But the people of the States and the Commonwealth, being one, are quite strong enough and wise enough to take care that their interests are not sacrificed. PEARL FISHERIES. IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACT . - Mr JOHNSON - I desire to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the following extract from an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday last :The truth is-and it is not a pleasant truththat the Japanese own Thursday . Island in everything but name. Practically the whole of the pearling fleet is in their hands. Those boats which are not owned by Japanese are manned by them, and the divers are allowed to keep all the pearls they find, after first of receiving £80 a ton for their shell. Twentythree thousand pounds a year is the average value - of the pearls obtained, and practically every penny of this goes home to Tokio or Nikko, as well as the £&> per ton for the shell. Australian dealers buy most of the pearls, so that it may be said Australia pays the Japanese over ^20,000 per annum for her own pearls. Of the uses to which that ^20,000 may be put some of these days there is no need to speak, for every one knows. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister's attention has been directed to the above paragraph, whether, to his knowledge, the facts are as stated, and whether proper steps are being taken to see that the provisions of the. Immigration Restriction Act are rigidly enforced?",16
22,Mr DEAKIN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I have noticed the paragraph in question,-and, speaking from memory, the facts,- as stated, are substantially true. The Immigration Restriction - Act is being rigidly enforced. The condition of things referred to in the article quoted by the honourable member exists because of the State law in regard to the working of the pearl fisheries. The disposition of the pearls and any advantages gained by the Japanese are not under Commonwealth control. PRI CE OF HARVESTERS .  asked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether reductions had been made in the price of harvesters in accordance with the Act of 1906, which provides for a reduction of £ 5 in 1907, and of another £ 5 in 1908. He told me then that he wouldmake an inquiry. I now ask him if he has any further information on the subject?",16
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"The Treasurer tells me that harvesters are selling in his electorate for ^65 each, and we know that there was, in the first instance, a general reduction in price. In October last an investigation was made throughout the States as to prices charged for Australian stripper-harvesters and drills, and it was found that the cash prices charged were in accordance with the Act. No single complaint has reached the Department of any overcharge. It may be mentioned that the Act specially provides for cash prices. Most of the sales are on credit, with various conditions as to the manufacturer keeping the machines in repair, & c , for varying periods. In regard to credit sales, we are advised the Act does not apply. Further investigation is now about to be made in regard to the reduction in prices which the Act provides should become operative from 1st February, 1908.  of the. sales are on credit. Do I understand the Minister's answer to mean that unless farmers are prepared to pay cash for their harvesters, the manufacturers of these machines are at liberty to charge any price that they may think fit, notwithstanding the Act passed by this Parliament in 1906?",17
24,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,We are advised that in regard to credit sales the Act does not apply. Mr TUDOR.^SO that the manufacturers can charge just what they please.,17
25,Mr FISHER,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,In that case the law is a farce and a sham.,17
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I presume that when the Act in question was passed, the Government had in their minds that the' price to be paid for these machines was to be considered as either cash or credit. In other words, they had no intention of asking Parliament to pass a measure, regulating the price of these machines, which would be utterly useless?",17
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"Methink s that the honourable member presumes too much in venturing to state what was in the mind of the Government, and in saying that the Act has proved to be utterly useless. If he knew anything about the matter, he would know that quite the reverse has been the case. Section 4 of the Act readsI f the Governor General is satisfied that cash prices at which stripper harvesters and drills manufactured in Australia are sold exceed the prices hereunder set out he may by proclamation reduce the rate of duty specified [339]- 2 in the schedule in respect of stripper harvesters, but so that the reduction shall not reduce the rate of duty below one-half the rate of duty imposed by this Act.",17
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,I asked whether that was. all that the Government intended to accomplish when the Act was passed?,17
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,Certainl y we intended to accomplish that which the Act sets out.,17
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,Then the Government fooled the House.,17
31,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"As a matter of fact the prices of harvesters, both for cash and credit, have been reduced as far as we know, but further inquiries are being made.",17
32,Mr MCDOUGALL,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,Then the Government do not know very much.,17
33,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,I said as far as we know.,17
34,Mr MCDOUGALL,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,The knowledge of the Government is very limited upon that score.,17
35,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"Of my own knowledge I am aware that in New South Wales the prices of these machines, both for cash and credit, have been reduced. But any honourable member ought to know that when certain risks have to be taken, very frequently the prices charged differ from those which are charged for spot cash..",17
36,Mr FISHER,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I desire to ask the .Minister whether it is not possible to fix a price for cash, plus so much for terms of credit, so that persons purchasing these machines, will know the amount that is being charged them for credit?",17
37,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"It certainly would be possible to do that. But: the Department can only carry out the provisions of the law"".  the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to. introduce a Bill amending the Customs Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act of 1906 by limiting the price at which stripper harvesters may be sold upon credit terms?",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"It will probably be open to the Government to reconsider the whole question of these Excise duties at a comparatively early date, and' to adapt its .proposals to what we shall then know . of - the exact constitutional powers of the Parliament. The proposal to fix a credit price is practically impossible, since - the credit may be for the three, six, or twelve months, or for two or three years. .The terms are' also coupled in many cases with conditions as to repairing and replacing. There are a variety of alternatives. I think that the request that a cash price should be stated is fectly fair, and it can be readily out. It is also part of the policy of the Government to provide by law that the price charged to customers, both for striponly per-harvesters and all other implements goods to which the new protection can applied, shall be determined upon a fair basis, and that consumers shall tected against extortionate charges. will apply to other things that are brought within the scope of the new protection.",17
39,Mr WEBSTER,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I .wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it would not be possible to adjust the cash and credit justice prices in proportion to the rates prevailing before the passing of the Act? . Mr DEAKIN - That is legally possible, but I am informed that the manufacturers of these implements trade differing conditions, and with different classes of customers, and that.the imposithe tion of one particular system upon them might involve a very serious business turbance. ' There is no legal difficulty, there may be practical difficulties in way.",18
40,Mr THOMASBROWN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I would ask the Prime Minister what the Government propose to do if the manufacturers refuse not. to sell for cash, electing to deal with their customers on the deferred payment system",18
41,Mr DEAKIN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,I can scarcely imagine a seller refusing cash.,18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,A manufacturer would - be glad to wait a month for his money if by doing so he would secure additional -£io for his machine.,18
43,Mr THOMAS BROWN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,Then there is the time? question,18
44,Mr SPEAKER,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"Honourable members are very .disorderly in interrupting both those who are asking questions who are replying to them. Questions have to be put and answered without debate, and it is destructive of the whole purpose of questions without notice that tions should be made, and that the House should thus be prevented from hearing questions put or the answers to them.",18
45,Mr DEAKIN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I would say, compreis hensively both as to this and to every question relating to this matter,' proposition ""of the Government is that there shall be an impartial authority able scrutinize all departures from the fair practices of trade. Only by some device, and not by the mechanical operaare tion of an Act, canwe hope to have adperministered equitably the system which we carried desire to introduce.",18
46,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"As the Prime Minister proposes under the new law that not prices, but conditions of labour, shall or be fixed, will he also be prepared tofixa be reasonable profit for the manufacturer? The manufacturer seems to .be the only be properson not taken into account. That Mr DEAKIN - The proposal is that the Excise Board, on the best evidence that is laid before it , shall allow any profit consistent with fair wages and prices. It will provide for the administration of in relation to industrial affairs, and that justice must cover the necessary inducement to manufacturers to manufacture, as 'well as to consumers to purchase.",18
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I should like on to ask the Minister of .Trade and Customs, who, I understand, is charged with administration of this Act, a furtherquestion. He has already told us that he disknew when the Bil l was before us that but transactions of the kind referred to were the to be upon a strictlycash basis. Does he wish us to infer that he knew in his own mind, when this legislation was being dealt with, that it could be easily evaded?",18
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"Certainl y The honourable member has misquoted my remarks. In dealing with the question ? put to me-as to the basis of cash price, I read to the House section 4 of the Act. What is the use of the honourable member asking me questions as to what I had in my mind at the time this legislation was bean fore us, when he presumes a knowledge of what I ought to have had in mind at the All I can say is that, so far as I can judge, only one construction can be placed upon the words, "" If the Governor General is satisfied that the cash prices "" and those which appear in section 4.",18
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,Did not the honourable member know in his own mind that the. scheme could be easily evaded by the interjeccharging of other prices?,18
50,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,I did not the have in my mind at the time the idea that the matter could be easily evaded. If there any evidence of a deliberate attempt to other evade the law steps will be taken to deal that the with those responsible for it .,18
51,Mr HUTCHISON,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I have a further to question on this subiect to put to the Minister of Trade and Customs. If it can such be shown that, say, a dozen manufacturers charging more than £ 6 5 cash for their machines, whilst the _ remaining manuf ac.turers are charging only £ 6 5 cash, what action will he be able to take under the Act?",18
52,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"If a case of that kind arises, I hope that I shall be able to deal with it .",19
53,Mr HUTCHISON,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"I am afraid that the Minister will not be able to deal with it. RIFLE CLUB'S ACCOMMODATION .  Defence, upon notice I. Did .the Commercial Travellers and Ware.housemen's Rifle Club apply for permission to erect a room for the use of the club at Port Adelaide Rifle Ranges, such room to be erected at the expense of the club, to become the property of the Commonwealth, and to be under the control of the Military authorities? 2. Was permission to erect such ro.om refused 3: If permission was refused, why was it Tefused?",19
54,Mr EWING,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"The question should rightly have been addressed to the Minister of Home 'Affairs, whose Department has the control of these matters. I have, however, seen the Minister, and he informs me that as to question No. 1 there appears to have been some misapprehension. If such terms as are indicated in the first question be offered, the Minister will favourably consider them. JAPANES EMAIL STEAMERS.",19
55,Mr CROUCH,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"the PostmasterCeneral, upon' notice- r. Do the - Japanese steamers (N if f o n Yusen JCaisha) receive any poundage or payment from the Postal Department for carriage of mails between Australia and Japan or any other place? 2. If so, what were the amounts of such sub-sidies for the years 1905, 1906, 1907?",19
56,Mr MAUGER,WLLLIAMSTOWN VLCTORIAN,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low1. Yes, in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Postal Union Convention. 2. Inquiry will be made, and the desired in-, formation furnished as early as possible. NA PRESERVATI ON BILL . THIRD READING. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time.",19
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Parramatta) l 3 - 9]-2 1 do not propose to weary the .House with a lengthy speech. The Opposition has endeavoured, without success, to minimize some of the very drastic proposals of this measure, but the Government, in this instance, as in many others, have had behind them a majority prepared to impose upon the minority whatever conditions they chose to suggest. In this respect they have succeeded in producing an instrument which, in its penalties, sanctions, and powers, goes far beyond anything that has been attempted in a British community. I do not pretend to say that legislation, severe and unusual, is not required to meet the far-reaching evils of industrial trusts; but the measures should receive the fullest possible consideration, - with a desire to make their provisions such as will afford a possibility of administering them as Parliament intended them to be administered. We have not been able to modify any of the drastic provisions in this Bill ; but.there is ? the one comfort that, judging by our experience, there is not the slightest danger of those provisions being put into full force. None of the provisions of similar legislation passed by this Chamber have ever been f u l ly operative; and it is just about time for honourable members, in the Labour corner particularly, who are constantly clamouring for legislation, such as we have passed in recent years, to begin to realise that it is simply a political placard, and is intended for nothing more. As shown by the series of questions this afternoon, it is found that the provisions of such measures cannot be enforced in their entirety-that they can .be evaded by the easiest of all methods.",19
58,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The same could be said of any of this legislation.,19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I venture to say that if the careful consideration that ought to be given were given to such measures, they would leave Parliament in a much more effective form. But where there is a majority who sit tight, and pass anything that the Government propose, and a minority, who can only beat their Heads against a stone wall of unreason and obstinacy, we have not the conditions for achieving the best and most effective legislative results. We are becoming aware of the effects of these measures every day. We are now waiting patiently for the pronouncement of the High Court on the legality of all this class of legislation. . Mr FISHER - The honourable member seems to be rejoicing over the fact.",19
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , I am not.",19
61,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then , why the smile?",19
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Surely I may smile? Does the honourable member wish me to cry? If anybody, the honourable. member ought to cry; and he certainly looks as if he would like to. If I were in the honourable member's place, and had to take full responsibility for all these measures, should not feel disposed to laugh, rather, to hide my head - The honourable member is engaged in fooling the workers outside with this class of legislation.",19
63,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Order ! I do not think an honourable member ought to say that another honourable member is attemptdenied ing to "" fool "" persons, either inside or down. outside the House.",20
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think you are ber mention one? quite right, Mr Speaker; the expression was too strong. I desire to say, as emphacise tically as I am able, that the sooner people outside, who are particularly in the terested in this class of legislation, cognise that the effect is to prevent achieving the expected results, the better it will be for their peace of mind, and for that of everybody concerned. At any rate, we have been turning out legislation of this kind for several years, and there is not one of the measuresthat the Ministry can, dare, put into full and effective operation, legislation of the kind. This, of course, only makes us less careful as to the tremendous powers the Governquired; ment seek, since we know, from experience, that they are never likely to come into effect,",20
65,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Dalley) [3.35] - It is rather unusual to have a discussion on.the. third reading of a Bill, but questions have been raised this afternoon, which it would be well to discuss on this motion. I supworking ported the original Act, which failed to tain its purpose, and I have supported the Government in the legislation intended to invest them with further powers'. Trusts and combines I regard as a severe and . growing disease, and I have strongly supwould ported and voted for giving the Adminismuch tration the fullest possible powers in order to find a remedy. I believe in the drastic treatment of trusts and combines; and, like"" those who support legislation of this acter, I desire to see it carried into effect, The honourable member for Parramatta cersome tainly made a strong appeal to those radical tendencies, to either drop measures of this kind or make them effective. If we are going beyond our constitutional, powers, the sooner we know the fact the better; because I cannot conceive a more humiliating position than that in which have been placed during the last two three years, in regard to measures have missed fire, either because they not properly. drafted, or because they were unconstitutional. Either those who are responsible for the drafting are not skilful I enough, or the Attorney-General is not but, ""up to"" the duties of his position,",20
66,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Onl y one clause that we have passed has been held to be unconstitutional. . Mr Wilks - The Attorney-General is quite right as to that; but it cannot be that several measures have broker*,20

We are placed in avery humiliating position when, sessionafter session, we have to introduce amending Bills in order to put original Acts into order. It was thought that when> at the Federal Parliament was established, it would be an example to the States Parliaments, in that its legislation would be asnearly humanly perfect as possible; it wasr not anticipated that the Federal Parliament establish a record for the quantity soas for the quality of its legislation. I would sooner see the House devote itself to one perfect measure in a session, than to passing four or five others which prove charto be unworkable. Those who are bitterly opposed to legislation of the kind, may fincf pleasure in the fact that some of the of measures have proved inoperative, though I can scarcely think that even they canreally be gratified at such results. I admit that the Attorney-General has a very difficult .task to perform, but, from the troublethat has arisen, I am inclined to think we that he is not sufficiently well supportedor that the Crown Law officers and the which draftsmen are not up to their work, were In the States Parliaments amending Bills to correct mistakes are not constantly being introduced, as they are in this I do not say that the Attorney-General - or his officers are responsible in this case,, '.but blame is attachable somewhere.",20
68,Mr MCDOUGALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If legislation - character is not passed, the people of Australia will soon be in a position in regard trusts similar to that of the people of America.",21
69,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not dealing with that aspect of the question; I am merely - urging that greater care should be taken ;to make our legislation effective for purposes aimed at. I object tinual passing of legislation which is ineffective. No better weapon could be placed in the hands of our opponents than indifficulties arise. stances of parliamentary bungling, such as we have seen in connection with this and - other matters, because they give ground the gibe that Parliament is merely fooling the public. Personally, I have no desire to give the opponents of legislation reasons for ridiculing it , and the Labour Party - ought to feel especially humiliated when, time after time, legislation which it has supported breaks down, and requires introduction of amending Bills.",21
70,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wide Bay) [3.43]--An honourable member who will not take the sponsibility for what he does here is in his right place; but the best answer the charges against the Labour Party iby the honourable member for Parramatta was the speech of the honourable member for and .Dalley.

The honourable members for Parramatta and Dalley, howby ever, spoke as if , in the State. Parliament - of New South Wales, they had had no perience of amending Bills.

73,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It must be remembered to that, whereas the State Parliaments, subject to certain qualifications, have practically as much power as the Imperial Parliament, our legislative efforts are ""cribbed, cabined, and confined "" by a written Constitution which strictly limits our powers. This makes it necessary to walk warily, the lest the High Court may tell us that we to the conhave exceeded our powers.",21
74,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In the United States of America, after the lapse of a century, these",21
75,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes ; though the for United States Congress is, to some extent, so far as the conflict of powers goes, in the same position as this Parliament. But we must accept responsibility for our: actions, and when we find that the country is likely to be injured, we must take every step possible to prevent it. As for the cheap sneer the that the Labour Party has supported the Bill , although believing that it will not do what is desired, my reply is that we are y doing the best we can, and that if larger repowers can be wielded, I , for one, shall be not glad to do more. I cheerfully take reto sponsibility for supporting this or any other made measure to deal with an evil which has brought the Government of the largest most powerful nation in the Seeing that the President of the United States will do of America has appealed again and again to Congress"", and to the right-thinking people of the country, to deal with the a ruffians in finance and commerce who are a curse to it , it is not too early for this small Parliament to take steps to protect this we do young Federation from similar attacks by kind, Australia avaricious syndicates.",21
76,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Kooyong) [3.48] - I do not take as much exception as has been taken other speakers to the-action of the Government in introducing an amending Bill exto give them further powers, because' this was probably forced upon them by the fact that we have made a legislative departure, result of which could not be foreseen. lotTherefore, I stated my readiness to support the second reading, expressing the been hope that some of the drastic clauses in the Bill would be altered in Committee. There has been an almost hysterical outcry against combinations said to be opposed to the public interest and in restraint of trade. With some knowledge of the business relations of the Commonwealth, I protest that nothing exists here in the nature of what they have in America. It would have been better had a straightforward statement been made as to the combinations aimed at.",21
77,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I mentioned that the operations of five or six combines have formed the subject of inquiry by the Department, mentioning the trades concerned.",22
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The member did not give the names.,22
79,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They were confidential.,22
80,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are combinations in the Commonwealth whose operations are of the greatest benefit to the consumers, because they result in the reduction of prices. I have risen to enter, my protest against several of the provisions of the Bill , particularly some in clause 4. In my opinion, such legislation will be disadvantageous to ""the prestige of Parliament. The position of affairs in Australia does not justify 'the introduction of the un-British principle which underlies some of the procedure provided for, and I should be failing in my duty did not I enter a personal and emphatic protest against it .",22
81,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"North Sydney) [3.52] - The honourable member for Wide Bay seems to think it well to accept legislation, whether effective or not, so long as it professes to go in a certain direction.",22
82,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I regard the Bill as a reapublic. sonable attempt to meet a difficult situation, and to remove injustice.",22
83,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Severa l of our Acts have failed, notwithstanding that warning had been given that they were, ineffective. Government supporters, whether Ministerialists* or' members of the Labour Parly, should not be ready to_ support legislation merely because it is proposed by the Government; they should listen to the objections raised against it, consider the dangers pointed out, and pay regard to the possibility of failure, trying to improve measures in view of the criticism passed on them. If they did so, less of our legislation would be ineffective.",22
84,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We do that.,22
85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The condition of the benches ofttimes proves what I say. Some of the flaws which amending Bills have been introduced to remedy were pointed out. when the original legislation was before Parliament, which is evidence that sufficient attention is not given by honourable members to the criticism of Govern- ment measures.",22
86,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I myself pointed out flaws; in the original Bill .,22
87,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member may have made proposals for more effective legislation which may not have received attention. I do say that too oftenhonorable members blindly follow the proposals submitted by the Government in stead of considering upon its merits every honourable proposal brought forward. I wish now toall ude to a matter of procedure in connection with this measure. As honourable members.will recollect, opposition was of fered from this side of the chamber to thesuspension .of the Standing Orders yesterday to enable the third reading of the Bill to be taken forthwith. I think I may say for the deputy leader of the Opposition that his refusal to assent to that course of procedure was based upon the fact, first, that no object was to be served by at once passing the Bill , as the Senate is not in a position to deal with it , and, secondly, that there had been none of that courteous consultation* which should take place between the Government and the Opposition when it is desired to suspend the Standing Orders. Those Orders are intended for the protection of the minority in Parliament, and unless there is very good reason for suspending them that protection should be studiously maintained.",22
88,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In the interests of the,22
89,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In the in terests of the public and of the minority. The Standing Orders are intended to prevent any Government possessing the requisite numbers from forcing measures through Parliament without affording) honourable members an opportunity for adequately considering - them. In speaking in this way I am not speaking merely for the Opposition of today. That Opposition will disappear in one - way or another. It mayfade out of existence, or it may occupy the Government benches, in which case there would be a new Opposition. But in the best interests of parliamentary government it is desirable that we should be afforded? an opportunity of knowing the reasons why the suspension of the Standing Orders isdemanded, and of urging counter reasons if"" we think that their suspension is not justified. I hope that the House will preserve the practice of refusing to suspend those Orders without adequate reason in the interests, not only of this Parliament, but future Parliaments, and in the interests, - only of this Opposition, but of future positions.",22
90,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.59] - I rise for very simple purpose of pointing - the statements which have been made without reflection and in the heat of debate in . Mr DEAKIN regard to this measure are entirely without foundation. The particular illustration - cited by the' deputy leader of the Opposiasmuch tion in connection with the need for amendLest ing legislation was the Customs Tariff ing (Agricultural Machinery) Act of 1906, - which reference was made in certain quesillustration which he cited, I tions put to Ministers prior to the motion for trie third reading of this B i ll being called upon. The statement directly made the honourable member, and a number times implied by him, was that the lanstripper guage of the section which determines price of stripper-harvesters on the basis their cash value was not what had been originally proposed, and that it had in deceived those honourable members who had supported that Bill . I have made a hasty reference both to the debates",23
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I rise to a point of honourable members, to the cash price order. I made no reference to the Customs can find no reference to anything else Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act except in the most incidental way, knowing very well that I could not do so upon the motion for the third reading of this Bill . therefore, that upon the motion under consideration the Prime Minister will not be permitted to make a speech in de Mr. JOSEPH COOK fence of that measure.",23
92,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is that a point of order?,23
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes . Minister has exp-ressed his intention of proving that all that we have alleged questions put to Ministers this afternoon wrong.,23
94,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Most undoubtedly that the Prime Minister would be out of order if he did what the deputy leader of Opposition suggests that he intends to But I did not gather that from the remarks thing else. of the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Parramatta distinctly used the Act to which the Prime Minister has referred as an example of legislation enacted which subsequently was not put into operaActs, tion. I think he said that the Government their did not dare to put it into operation.",23
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I made that remark stances, the House has been misled in reference to a number of measures, in reference to that particular measure.",23
96,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable memof ber distinctly referred to the Customs Tariff not (Agricultural Machinery) Act as one of Opthose measures. Having allowed him to make that statement-whic h perhaps was scarcely in order- I cannot in fairness rethe fuse to the Prime Minister an opporout that tunity of replying to it . - What I desire to show is that the illustration chosen by the honourable member was an unfortunate one, inas it is supported in no particular this House should be misled in deal with the third reading of the Bill , now to under consideration, by relying upon the a m entitled to show that the facts are not as stated .by him. I - find on reference to by Hansard that the first proposal made in of connection with an Excise duty upon harvesters, was made avowedly the upon the basis of the cash price charged of tor those machines, and upon the cash price only. As far as time has permittea fact me to do so, I have glanced through the debate winch took place on that occasion, and I find reference continually made by members of the Opposition, and by other I I have looked at the first draft of the Bill and I find that it alludes only to the cash price of these machines. Clause 4 of that I hope, Bill , and section 4 of the Act are word for that is now word identical. - I candidly confess that I never wished to make a distinction.",23
97,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"So far from this The Prime House having been misled by any proposition submitted to it, or by any suggestion in that the measure was intended to regulate is the credit price of harvesters, I find no proposal to that effect, no amendment to effect, and no criticism to that effect. From first to last the whole scheme was the based upon - the cash price of these do. machines. I can find no reference to any",23
98,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That was a blunder oh our part.,23
99,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"A f t e r we have applied whatever we may say in regard' to sufficiency, or otherwise, it is certainly unfair to suggest that, under such circumIt not may have been mistaken in not going further.",23
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is fair to commore plain that the Government are endeavouring to rush a particular measure through by securing the suspension of the Standing Orders.,24
101,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think so. As the honourable member's object is to impose further restrictions under this Bill , obviously his argument tells against himself.",24
102,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The cash price of harvesters, and not the credit price, was accepted as the uniform standard.",24
103,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That appeared to be accepted upon every hand.,24
104,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It was a blunder.,24
105,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not prepared to admit that it was a blunder until it has been shown that the credit price can be effectually regulated by an Act without the appointment' of some persons specially to decide such matters. With regard to the comments of the honourable member for North Sydney in regard to the need which exists for amending the legislation of this Parliament, I would point out to him that in New South Wales, Victoria, and indeed in every other country outside Australia which has attempted to cope with industrial questions, it has been necessary to introduce amending Acts, and further amending Acts, because they were legislatively breaking entirely new ground. We have to adapt old principles to new circumstances, or to old circumstances, to which they have never previously been applied.",24
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"All the more reason why they should be adequately discussed. MT. DEAKIN - I do not object to their adequate discussion. But, in viewing day the effect of the very short measure passed by Parliament in 1906, after, haps, the most severe struggle ever witbeen nessed in this Housed",24
107,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There was no struggle to block it. """,24
108,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable memlustration ber is making a disorderly interjection in regard to one matter, and I am referring to another. I am speaking of the Customs Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, for the passing of which the honourable memI ber shares no guilt whatever. If , as honourable member for North Sydney detralian clared, the purpose of the discussion which took place upon that occasion had been to assist the Government to make the Act more effective by marking out its sphere distinctively, I could admit the force of his remarks today. But, seeing that the whole of the energies of honourable members opposite-and of their almost inexhaustible speeches-were directed to other purposes, it is rather sarcastic for the honourable member at this stage .to point us toalleged omissions in that measure, seeimr that it had to be passed in the teeth of furious and unqualified opposition.",24
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Nobod y upon the other side of the House talked, and so we had to. do our best.",24
110,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And nobody could have done better than the honourable member's best in that way with the object that he had in view.  ter mean to argue that it was the intention of Parliament that the manufacturers of harvesters should be able to . charge. any price that they chose?,24
111,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The intention was that the cash price should be fixed by law, and that the credit price would in consequence be adjusted more or less accurately in relation thereto. But when we are criticising parliamentary methods, which have so many defects, surely it is not fair to impugn the expressions used in an Act which was debated upon the very first occasion that it was brought before the House, and which was never criticised in the manner in which it is being criticised now.  cause the custom that existed was uppermost in the minds of honourable members.",24
112,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That does not show that Parliament was deceived or misled, but merely that it . did not pass an Act to which was as effectual as it might have made it under more favourable conditions-. perBut I am assured that the Act has efficient,, and that the cash prices fixed by - law are being charged today, also that the credit prices have been affected. Under these circumstances, the i l cited by the honourable member for Parramatta to justify his opposition to the third reading of this Bill does not apply.",24

As the Prime Minister has said, this class of legislation is practically a leap in the dark. But I have taken considerable objection to two or three clauses contained in this Bill , to which I have previously referred. As the measure has been drafted on the lines of American procedure, I should like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the following cable which"" appears in today's newspapersI n the United States House of RepresentaUnited tives yesterday Mr W.

I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to this phase of the question. Our anti-trust' legislation has been largely framed on the American Acts, and the honourable member for Wide Bay has drawn attention to the fact that the President of the States is calling to his ""assistance all the powers granted to him to enable him deal with evil combines. In the circumstances I thought it necessary to point out to that we ought to legislate in the interests of beneficent combines and enable them to carry on operations under the most satisStates any factory conditions.",25

I do not say that if we were in power we should be able to introduce perfect measures, but we should do our best in that direction,' and would not hesitate to seek to amend any Act that had proved ineffective. It has been said that since this measure is imperfect we ought not to agree to it . But we can secure effective legislation only by demonstrating to those who send us here that the existing law is defective. The Opposition have insinuated that the Government have no desire to make this legislation effective. I should not like to prefer such a charge against them, but I do not hesitate to say that a good deal of the legislation introduced by the Ministry has proved ineffective. I believe that in the near future it will be found necessary to amend this Bill. I agree with the honourable member .for North Sydney that we should not vote for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a Bill to be passed through all its stages without delay unless there are substantial reasons for doing so. It is admitted, however, that the principal. Act is defective, and that small traders are suffering from the operations of certain combines. That being so, it is our duty to pass this Bill as soon as possible.",25
125,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We have assisted the Government before today to secure the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a Supply Bill to be passed through all its stages, and thus to avoid delay in the payment of salaries to public servants.",26
126,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"D a y after day we hear complaints on the part of public servants, and I should certainly support the suspension of the Standing Orders if by doing so I could secure for the public servants referred to by the honourable member for Grey the money that has been owing to them for the last ten months.",26
127,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member at this stage cannot deal with that matter.,26
128,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Althoug h I do not think that this Bill will be wholly effective, I believe that the sooner it is t r e d the better. Every year combines in Australia are becoming more powerful, while the number of small traders is being reduced. The Opposition have had a good deal to say about beneficent combines, but when I appealed to the honourable member We are for Kooyong to name some of them he declined to do so. Beneficent combines will not be prejudicially affected by this Bill , but the sooner we pass legislation that will enable us-to cope with combines that are prejudicial to the public interest the better.",26
129,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Flinders) r/4-22]. - I do not propose to occupy the attention of the House for more than two or three minutes, since I . consider that a debate ona motion for the third reading of a Bill which has been threshed out in Committee usually results in little or no good. As this discussion has been launched, however, I shall very briefly address myself to one aspect of the question. I have said before that I think some measure of this kind is necessary, and that some of the powers given by the Bill are desirable. I have supported the Government proposal with regard to the onus of proof, since it only shifts on to the-person accused the onus of proof as to matters which are strictly and entirely within his own knowledge. But as the result of the proposal to vest the Government with extremely inquisitorial powers-wit h the right to ask a man questions as to anything relating to his business-w e shall obtain a ' machine some forms of which are open to grave objection. In that respect we are going a great deal further than the existing circumstances in Australia warrant. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has said that the Labour Party would make the Bill effective. Provisions such as those to De found in clause 4 are effective in one particular direction. They must thoroughly discourage and render timid a very brge number of persons who hold capital which would otherwise be devoted to the establishment of industries. What is the position ? At present in Australia a vast amount of money which, in a new country like this, ought to be available for starting industries and giving employment to men out of work, is being hoarded. It is being deposited in banks or invested in safe securities. Arid for what reason? I can give one, although I do not say it is the only reason for this state of affairs. Let any honourable member place himself in the position of a man who has some capital, and thinks of establishing a manufacturing industry. That man, in the first place, says, "" If I am allowed to conduct my factory according to ordinary business methods, I shall be able to make a very fair profit, a profit of perhaps 10, 20, or 25 per cent. I find, however, that, in the first place, I do not know which of some half-dozen tribunals I may have to submit to as to the regulation of wages and conditions, though I should be quite willing to submit to any one of these, tribunals, if I had some security, as to the terms upon which I may conduct my business; secondly, I find a Government in power who have brought in legislation to fix the prices of the articles I am going to sell, irrespective of the market conditions at the moment; thirdly, the Government propose to introduce legislation limiting the profit which I shall make; and fourthly, the Government intend to bring in a measure under which, whether I make profits or lose money, and no matter what wages I pay or conditions I observe, every private detail of my business is liable at any moment to be raked up at the will of an irresponsible officer.""",26
130,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is the honourable member not putting the case rather more strongly than it is presented by the Bill?,27
131,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"- Is the position not plain enough ? I differ from the Labour Party as widely, perhaps, as any member in the House; and I never conceal the f a c t ; but, while that'is so, we can discuss matters in a friendly way. I ask members of the Labour Party whether they have considered the side of the question I have presented. When they talk about unemployment, have they fully considered whether legislation of this character may not be one of the causes which conduce to the shrinking of the whole area of employment?",27
132,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,it is just as well to starve with this legislation as without it .,27
133,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"-What kind of argument is that? I am in favour of proper, reasonable, and effective legislation in this direction, in accordance with our necessities. I am also in favour of exjDerimental legislation in reference to the fixation of wages, under reasonably secure* conditions, so that a-man may have some kind of certainty as to the tribunal he has to obey.",27
134,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Who is to be the judge of the reasonable conditions?,27
135,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Some tribunal, but not half-a-dozen tribunals. In addition to all this, a man is told that whatever ditions he observes or whatever wages he pays-howeve r well he may treat his workmental men-h e shall not be able to maintain the reasonable trade secrecy that he ought to able to observe in regard to his private affairs-that an officer, irresponsible except to his Minister, may at any moment searchhis books, make the most private inquiries, and even investigate confidential advice he may have obtained. Such legislation may be rendered necessary at some future time, if. we ever approach anything like the state of things existing in the United States of America.  private investigations made in connection with the income tax?",27
136,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not to nearly the same extent. Besides such inquiries are absolutely essential to collecting money in the form of an income tax; and there is a great distinction between the two cases. The Income Tax Commissioner is entitled to make certain inquiries for a very de : finite and limited purpose; but under the Bill an officer can demand any information from a man, who, it may be, is obeying the law, paying a fair wage, and honestly carrying on his business in his own way.",27
137,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He would not be obeying the law, or these inquiries would not be made.",27
138,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That interjection points my argument. All that the Opposition desire is that these inquisitorial powers should not 'be exercised until a 1 prima facie case has been madeout that a man has broken the law. Under such a condition, a man might enter on a new enterprise, reasonably - confident that, until a prima facie case was established, he would not be liable to have his most private concerns investigated by an officer under the direction of the Minister. I do not desire to detain honourable members longer, because it is too late now to make any alteration in the Bill. The interjection of the honourable member for Kennedy shows that he and his colleagues do not full y appreciate the lengths to which this legislation goes; and I simply rose to present one aspect, which, I think, may have escaped the attention of my honourable friends in the Labour corner.",27
139,Mr MCDONA LD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Kennedy) [4.30] The honourable member for Flinders has informed us that there is a vast amount conof money hoarded, which would be invested were it not for the fact that experilegislation of the kind now under discussion is being enacted, and thus, from be his point of view, raising, a number of difficulties in the way of enterprise.",27
140,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I said that that was one of the contributing causes. MT. MCDONALD - I understood the honourable member to say that it was one of the principal causes.,28
141,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Well , I .think it is.",28
142,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member went on to say that this 'prevention of investment was the cause of vast numbers of people being out of employment. But, if the honourable member had thought for a moment, he would have realized that in the United States, where there is unrestricted opportunity for industrial development, there is a standing army of nearly ""2,000,000 unemployed. The same condition applies to England and other countries.",28
143,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I - think that unemployment is the great problem in America.,28
144,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It will be seen, therefore, that it is not these legislative restrictions which prevent investment, and thus cause unemployment. The honourable member elaborated his case by urging that a man desiring to enter upon an industry was not in a position to say what wages he should pay. Here, in my opinion, is the crux of the whole position. It is that uncertainty as to wages that has-given rise to conciliation and arbitration and other industrial legislation. If a man, in commencing an industry, is able to obtain labour at 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, less than is paid by a rival in the same line of business, the latter is forced to come down to a lower level, or be undersold. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member mistakes my argument. What I said was that I am. entirely in favour of the regulation of wages, but totally opDosed to that regulation being carried out by half-a-dozen different and possibly conflicting tribunals.",28
145,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I admit that that puts a different complexion on the question. I desire to show, however, that one of the principal causes of unemployment is the competitive system under which our industries are at present carried on. That system has given rise to two classes in the community-one , the employer, who is trying to get the most work for the least money, and the employee*, who is trying to get the most wages for the least work. So long as we have the competitive, system, we shall have these antagonistic classes; and the employer will be constantly on the lookplundering out for machinery, in order to cheapen production, with the result of throwing thousands of people out of employment from time to time, and driving them from the skilled to the unskilled labour market.",28
146,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is America not the home of machinery?,28
147,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That , I admit'. This Bill is an attempt to regulate these matters; . and I may here straightforwardly say that I have no faith in the ultimate success of the attempt. It is, I believe, an effort on the part of the Government to do something, but', personally, I believe they will fail in their object. There is only one method by which trusts and combines can be successfully controlled, namely, the nationalization of industries. We realise, however, that this Parliament is not prepared to accept the policy of nationalization; and, in the meantime, we are content to accept whatever legislation may tend in the direction of regulating these matters.",28
148,Sir JOHNFORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I understand that the honourable member and his party believe only in nationalizing monopolies?,28
149,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We shall go further if we can, as the platform of the Labour Party shows.",28
150,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member wishes to make a big Russia of Australia !,28
151,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We have arrived.ati a stage in the industrial conflict, when questions of this kind must' be discussed intelligently; and the Labour Party is not to be affected by mere abuse from one side or the other.",28
152,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member started the abuse.,28
153,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think not, but, if I did, I apologize. What led to the introduction of this Bill ? It is, as I say, an effort to regulate certain persons, who are trying to abolish that very competition which has been the means of Bringing about unemployment, and which has had such a detrimental effect on our industrial life. Huge monopolies are formed with the object of crushing out all competition, and securing complete control; the existence of such monopolies proves that competition is the great curse of our commercial system.",28
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The trust abolishes competition, and yet it is a curse?",28
155,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The trust does away with competition for the sole purpose of obtaining complete control, and the people generally. If that be not so, what is the object of the trust? The Labour Party and those whom it represents, believe that the only legitimate and honest way to successfully deal with this social cancer is to bring about the nationalization of industries and State control, so that the profits now enjoyed by a few individuals may be shared by the whole community. The position of the leader of the Labour Party on the second reading and this afternoon has been this - that he accepts the Bill in the hope that it may save some of the smaller traders from utter annihilation by trusts and combines.",28
156,Mr MCWILTJAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member think that a prohibitive Tariff encourages the formation of trusts?,29
157,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This is not a fiscal question, and I have had quite enough of the Tariff. The honourable member for Parramatta spoke about attempts to fool the public with empty platitudes.",29
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member himself admits that the Bill will do no good.,29
159,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not consider it ' likely to be effective; but as I cannot get the nationalization of industries at present, I accept it as an attempt to do what is desired. The Labour Party has never cloaked its wish to nationalize industries. Its position in that respect has been reiterated by the honourable member - for South Sydney repeatedly. We know that in America sixty-three legislative measures have been introduced to deal with trusts, and have failed, and, therefore, it is only reasonable to expect that similar action on our part will be attended by a similar result.",29
160,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Queensland-Attorney General) [4.45]. - The honourable member for Flinders has told us that he objects to this measure because it is one of a number tending to drive capital from the country. He said that people will not invest money because they have to face Wages Boards.,29
161,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He said because of the variety of Wages Boards. .,29
162,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He said that finally they had now to face a measure which allows a political officer to investigate the whole of one's business. The Bill does not give that power, as the honourable and learned member would know had he read it . He referred to its effect in regard to a man just starting business. Can it be said that such a man has it in contemplation to join a combine injurious to the public interest?.",29
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member for Flinders was referring to the effect of five or six enactments.,29
164,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He said that a man thinking of starting in business would be deterred by this legislation, because it would allow his private affairs to be discovered.",29
165,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is the feeling outside.,29
166,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then it is without good foundation. A man entering upon a law- f u l business has nothing to fear. We have made a distinction between lawful and unlawful trusts. The original Bill , following the Sherman Act of 1890, provided that any person who wilfully, either as principal or agent, entered into a contract, Dr engaged in a combination, to do my act in relation to trade or commerce in restraint of trade, should be deemed guilty of an indictable offence. But that provision was altered, and under the law as it stands, trusts are unlawful only where there is an intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public, or an intent to destroy. or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth. How could the Bill affect any one who is merely entering upon a business, and who would have no intention of joining a combination in restraint of trade ? Under section 15 of the original Act, a lawf u l agreement may be lodged with the Attorney-General, and thus secure protection. The inquisitorial powers iri this Bill are less stringent than those given to the Victorian Income Tax Commissioner, who, if he thinks fit, may require any person mentioned, or the public officer of any company, or any person in whose custody or control the same may beto produce for examination by the Commissionei or by any person appointed by him for that purpose at such time and place as may be appointed by the Commissioner in that behalf any deeds, instruments, books, accounts, trade-lists, stock-sheets, or documents or writings, that may be deemed necessary for any of the purposes of this Act. The Comptroller-General may call for the. production of books only when there has been a complaint on oath that an unlawful combination exists, and he is satisfied that that complaint is well founded. Even then, he can ask only for the production of books and documents relating to the subject matter of the complaint.",29
167,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That practically means all the books ,30
168,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It would enable him lo require the production of the agreement which is the basis of the combination, and of any entries relating to it.",30
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Bill also provided that the Comptroller-General might ask any question about anything.,30
170,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,About anything relating to the alleged offence. That was the original provision.,30
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is what is provided now ; the amendment of the honourable member, for North Sydney made that clear.",30
172,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The effect of the provision was the same before the amendmentwas made. The amendment was made only for the sake of greater security.,30
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is the Bill really for use?,30
174,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is a cheap way of getting popularity, to make it appear legislation is introduced which it is not intended to use.",30
175,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"On the second ing of the original' Bill it was admitted, think by the Treasurer, that a state of things similar to that existing in America did not exist in Australia, but that it desirable to take precautions.",30
176,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We have investigated place. very full y the affairs of at least seven combankruptcy law. bines, and the Bill has been introduced because, although we believe some of them to be unlawful, we have not been able get evidence to show that they are, because that evidence is entirely in their possession and knowledge.",30
177,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Department prosecuted, would not the Court require the production of documents?",30
178,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No . The Bill gives tories Act in England. alternative powers. We have provided that if an averment is made the onus of proof shall be on the defendant.,30
179,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What does the Attomev-General understand by restraint of trade ?,30

181,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The term is used in connection with the sale of businesses under agreement not to start in opposition.,30
182,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Severa l complete definitions are to be obtained in the United States judgments; but I shall not at this stage review the cases to which I allude. The honourable member for Dalley suggested that our legislation has been often found invalid or ineffective; but the only provision yet held to be unconstitutional is a section of the Arbitration Act. On the whole, the technical drafting of our measures has been equal to that of any of the States. Our officers are thoroughly competent, and have done their best. It is true that at times they have been subjected to extreme pressure due to the exigencies of their work, but we have recently made one or two additions to the staff. Under all the circumstances, they have performed their duties well.",30
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,On e of the professors takes quite a different view.,30

192,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Angas) [4.58] - ! do not wish to enter any protest against the very large policy of immigration"" suggested by the Government, but I think we ought to endeavour to temper"" the fervid enthusiasm with which some honourable members approach this subject by the touch of a few cold facts. I do not know why elaborate reports are prepared upon the subject, and why extensive correspondence should take place between the Premiers of the States and the Prime Minister if whatever guidance may be obtained from such reports and correspondence is to be disregarded, and a new policy is to be entered upon. There is no doubt that as Imperial citizens of Australia we are bound to take an interest in the development or the check of immigration to the Commonwealth from other parts of the Empire. Two or three days ago, in looking up the Times of 31st December, 1906, I noticed that a report had been presented by Mr Coghlan to the New South Wales Government on the subject of emigration. Of course, the Times considered the matter from the Imperial point of view. According to the article in that journal, the - report stated that between 1884 and 1904 the total emigration of British subjects and foreigners from British ports had increased from .303,901 to 453,877, but that fKe proportion directed to Australia and New Zealand had declined from nearly 46,000 to a little over 14,000- a decline which is somewhat disconcerting from the Imperial point of view. It was further pointed out that during 1904 the actual net emigration to Australia and New Zealand-that means, I take it , the emigration from British . ports - showed an increase of only 5,336. Just about the same period there was some talk of an extensive policy of immigration being entered upon by a concert between the Commonwealth and the various States. Keeping this fact in mind, I noted shortly afterwards that we were cautioned against bringing out certain classes of immigrants. I do not wish to refer to the particular bodies in the United Kingdom who desired to organize emigration of this class, but in one of the reviews it was pointed out that there was a very large number of persons-the emigration of whom was being suggested-wh o would be utterly useless as new colonists. Take, for instance, the report of the London County Council, which showed that out of 1,212 pupils examined in its schools, 75 per cent, were ineffective and 43T were mentally affected. It does not necessarily follow that because there is a large surplus population ""in one part of the Empire its introduction into Australia would be of benefit to this country. Of course, Canada has recently been very much favoured by immigrants. I think that last ypar's record was 250,000. The Dominion Government have spent about ^200,000 in assisting those immigrants, and in addition we know that very large inducements are offered to them by the railway companies.. At present a new Canadian Pacific line- I think it is called the Great .Northern line-is being constructed. Necessarily these companies have to import a certain class of labour. So that, taking these facts into consideration, and also the fact which was pointed out in the report of the Agents-General that during the three years ended 1.906 about 13.000,000 acres had been taken up in Canada by about 86,000 settlers, it is no wonder that there should have been a very large increase in the number of immigrants arriving there. I believe that the actual number of emigrants to Canada between 1901 and 1906 was 661,000. We know, too, that there has been a very iarge development in the western, provinces.. Within four or five years the wheat production has increased six-fold --that is, from 30,000,000 bushels to over 200,000,000 bushels. This enormous increase in production has led to a "" spurt "" in connection with immigration. But we must also recollect that Canada has not been able to retain its natural increase. In 1900 there were 1,200,000 native-born who had passed over the border, and were living in the United States.",31
193,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But during the past few years the exodus has been in the other direction.,31
194,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I can only vouch for the facts which I am stating. When I heard honourable members speaking last night with all the enthusiasm which this subject spires, I thought it would be just as well if we fell back on a few cold facts culled from the English press, - and. reports presented during the past three years. .Honourable members seem to forget that this matter was discussed between the Prime Minister and the States Premiers or three years ago. I hold in my hand parliamentary paper showing that the correhowever, spondence commenced with a letter from Prime Minister on 31st July, 1905. In that letter he asked that the Agents-General might meet monthly in London to discuss matters of common interest to the various Slates- a very proper suggestion. dently the Prime Minister thought at that time that .although a High Commissioner had not been appointed-whos e position 7th September, 1905for some years would be chiefly ornamental - w e possessed all the machinery necessary for undertaking this work. The suggestion was made in paragraph 4 of his letter that in a collective capacity the Agents-General Land might be able to give advice as to the best and most economical means of attracting desirable immigrants to Australia. It is a rather curious fact- I suppose it suggests some peculiar psychological feature-tha instead of the Premiers of the States saying, "" We like your proposal, and welcome it three of them merely said that they could see, and two that there could be, no tion to it. The Premier of New South speech. Wales, however, in a letter dated the 8th August, 1905, thought thatAny action taken by your Government in direction of encouraging immigration which ignores the State concerned is liable to cause serious trouble, as the States have to land and employment for persons arriving therein, and I therefore suggest that no change made in the present practice of allowing State to take action on its own behalf. The Prime Minister, however, very perly pressed the matter further, upon the attention of the Premier of New South Wales, and in a letter dated 12th August of that year pointed out that all proposed was that the Agents-General' should be asked for advice of a general character, and for advice only. He went on to mention, in a subsequent paragraph, that a well-digested plan of operations necessary, and that he hoped to secure guiding advice in this connection. I think, is a fair synopsis of lengthy correspondence. Th a subsequent letter, the Prime Minister again drew attention to the fact that he desired co-operation through the Agents-General Mr Glynn. inin a well-devised scheme for inducing immigration. Without' amplifying the reference, he expressed at the end of his letter of the 23rd August,. 1905, a desire that, adopting the words used at the Conference of State Premiers of February, 1904, they should have a policy which would be ""contwo certed, consistent, and continuous."" That a is a somewhat nebulous policy^ graced, by an attractive alliteration. The the Premier of New South Wales fell in with the suggestion, but apparently having seen a copy of the speech delivered by the then Treasurer, the. right honourable member for Swan- a copy of which, I think, the EviPrime Minister sent to him for perusalhe took exception to the suggestion contained therein, to quote from his letter of - That the Commonwealth should select immigrants and bring them to Australia on terms to be arranged, and that the States should provide land for them and finance them through the Bank. I may remark that there is nothing in my_ letter of 17th August to warrant the assumption that such a proposal would be agreeable to this Government, and my subsequent letter of 25th August was written in order to remove any misapprehension on the subject. t Evidently the then Premierof New ""South Wales viewed with a little doubt the pro, "" posal that there should be concerted action of the character suggested by the right honobjecorable member for Swan in his Budget That, however, was the invitation to the ball; let us see what was done when the dance commenced. On the rethe quest of the Prime Minister being transmitted to the Agents-General, through Mr. Coghlan, who then represented,. I thinfe,. provide the Commonwealth as well as New South be Wales, a memorandum signed by the each Agents-General was sent to the Commonwealth Government, and was ordered to be - proprinted on 19th December, 1905.",31
195,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Mr Coghlan at no time exclusively represented the Commonwealth. Before Captain Collins went Home, our he business went through State channels. For instance, defence matters were mainly dealt with through the Agent-General for Victoria, whilst other matters were dealt with through the Agents-General for New South was Wales and South Australia. Mr Coghlan some represented the senior State. That, Mr G.LYNN,-He had some relation a somewhat with the Commonwealth.",32
196,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is so.,32
197,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It does not materially afof the States fect the situation.,32
198,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It was merely to prevent misconception that I mentioned the posiwe tion.,33
199,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I referred to the memoexpenses randum as indicating some official condesire, nexion because it was sent to the Commonanalysis wealth Government, and was laid on"" table of the House. I do not know the report presented to the Premier of New South Wales, and quotedby the Times, appears amongst our printed records. In the memorandum of the Agents-General reference is made to the somewhat dean plorable fact that our rate of increase population is now only i £ per cent, annum. At that rate fifty-six years elapse before we can have a population of public money. £,000,000. Had we maintained the by no means "" swell "" rate of increase which curred during the decade 1881-1890-a crease of 3& per cent - ou r population might have doubled in twenty years. hope the goddess who looks after matrimonresources ial - affairs will be a little more watchful over the interests of humanity. Taking figures quoted by the Agents-General the decennial increase, I find that for decade 1852-61, there was an increase 520,713. Between 1882 and 1891 there was an increase of 374,097, whilst between 1892 and 1901 there was an increase of 2,377. For three years, 1902-4, there was an actual loss of 8,104. These statistics are by no means encouraging. What has become of the "" concerted action"" spoken of by the Prime Minister? What scheme has been formulated as the result of advice so strongly solicited by him given with such clearness in the memoranstriction - dum to which I am referring? In examinthe ing the causes of this falling off in the insions of that measure. crease of our population and the check evidenced by the decline in the three years, referred to, the Agents-General call tion to the enormous stream of population United Kingdom. to Australia following on the discovery gold, as well as at the time when we vigorous policy of public works - when Australia, with wonderful light-heartedness, which subsequent events did not justify, was particularly lavish in her expenditure in that direction.",33
200,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Her borrowed money was mostly spent on reproductive works:,33
201,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No doubt some of i was.,33
202,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The great bulk of it,33

Against the total debt of the States have, I think, assets of the value of about ,£175,000,000, which pay working and interest on outlay. I do not however, to be led into too close an of finances that do not touch the the point with which I am now dealing. that The Agents-General, in dealing with the falling off in the rate of our increase of population, mention, for instance, that some of the population that was obtained by assisted immigration, instead of being advantage to the community, was for of a time a burden, because it consisted of a per class of men who could be maintained in will employment only by the expenditure of Mr Coghlan sets forth some of the reasons affecting immigration octo Australia. The distance of Australia from n inEurope, as compared with that of Canada, the expense of the voyage, the comparative I ignorance of European peoples as to the of this country, the misrepresentation of Australian affairs indulged in by the the press of Great Britain, the prevailing as to opinion that immigrants are not wanted, the the uncertainty whether on arrival immiof grants can be accommodated with landwhich touches the very substance of the matter-the influence of persons who have only already emigrated, are all mentioned as causes for our failure to attract population. The arrangements made by Canada with shipping agents, and the strong and"" systematic advertising of Canada in other countries, are likewise given as reasons for the the falling off. Mr Coghlan calls parand ticular attention to the Immigration ReAct, making special reference to language test and the contract proviThe gist of his commentary is that a very unfair interpretation of the scope and operation of that attenAct was presented to the people of the Possibly upon that of point we are all in agreement. I believe had a that a similar Act was in operation in Canada, but it did not seem to affect the flow of immigration to that country.",33
204,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The part of the Act to which Mr Coghlan took exception was subsequently amended.,33
205,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is so. The - Agents-General in this memorandum make t a very careful examination into the classes of men - who ought to be brought out. 1. was. do not propose to exhaust the clauses of rethe memorandum dealing with this phase in asof the question by even a condensed Let me mention, however, one or two. first place, they refer to a class that we should be most anxious to secure, farmers who have recently disposed of their property and have a capital of from £ 5 0 0 to £ 1 , 0 0 0 with which to commence life in a new country. Then they refer to a class of men who, as the result of their industry have saved perhaps £ 2 5 to £50, and are anxious to emigrate, and also to a class "" which is comparatively numerous"" - men with no means, some skilled farm labourers, and some without even that qualification, who, in the opinion of the Agents-General should be assisted to wherever they wish to emigrate. This particular class-and especially labourers, whose average wage in England is only about 14s. per weekhas been swelling the tide of immigration to Canada during the last five or six years; but' it is not, on the whole, the class that we should seek to induce to come to Australia.",33
206,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There have been some very fine men amongst the immigrants to Canada.,34
207,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No doubt. Every year, no less than 38,000 emigrants leave Ireland, aind a good many of them go toCanada. They, are not, I think, assisted immigrants. They either pay their own fare, or their friends who have preceded them assist them to emigrate. Immigrants to. Canada and America have saved money there and helped their friends to join them. Even the hard-working servant girl has often used her savings in assisting her brother or, let hope, her sweetheart, to join her in Canada or the United States. There are inducements, apart altogether from assisted immigration, for people to go to some countries. The Agents-General, after very carefully considering the whole matter, recom - 1 mend that a substantial class that canbe put upon the land is the classof immigrants that we 'ought to encourage, but they state that the greatest number that the Commonwealth could hope to accommodate in one year is about 2,000. It is mentioned, at page 6 of the memorandum, that Queensland was making an average concession of £ 1 1 per head to nominated immigrants, whilst Western Australia was making a concession of about £ 5 per head. That arrangement, however, does not seem to have been very successful. I do hot know what are the figures as to immigration to those two States during the periods when In the this inducement was held out, but I believe that in ten years not more than 50,000 went there.",34
208,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In ten years?,34
209,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In ten' years, but I am speaking from memory. We ought to bear this in mind in connection with financing an immigration scheme. What the Agents General said isAt this distance it is difficult to gauge the capacity of Australia to receive immigrants, and, therefore, we do not attempt to make an estimate of the cost of introducing the policy herein outlined; but we certainly think that 2,000 adults would be as many immigrants, of an eligible type, and of the classes herein indicated as suitable for immigration to Australia, as could be accommodated in one year. That is the report presented to the Prime Minister for his guidance, and I should like to know whether he proposes to act on it. Is all this talk about immigration to be simply directed towards the subvention of not more than 2,000 eligible persons per annum ? If so, what was the use of all the talk at the Conference in England about the millions that could be settled in Australia under a certain policy. What are the electors to understand from ' the Prime Minister's recent estimate of an ultimate total of about 100,000,000 people in Australia ? - What are the electors asked to do in view of those rhetorical statements from the platform, and of the coldblooded presentation in the memorandum of the Agents-General of what is possible ?",34
210,Mr STORRER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Le t us make the land available for the people.,34
211,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No doubt there would us be no need for assisted immigration, if there were available areas of land, which would tempt people to come here, notwithstanding the distance. My idea in rising was to divert honourable members' attention from mere rhetoric and enthusiasm to the reports submitted to the Prime Minister by the Agents-General for his guidance.",34
212,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wimmera) [5.28] - I desire to emphasize some remarks I made on this question a few nights ago, when I urged the necessity for increasing the vote for the purpose of advertising Australia in Great Britain. It seems to me 7 that /""2o,ooo is a very small amount for the purpose.",34
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,So much as ' that 1 has not been spent in any year yet.,34
214,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But we have reached ' the stage, when, with our protective policy, the development of the iron industry, and the commencement of certain public works, we shall inevitably require more people. The question of immigration always impresses me as being the most important that this Parliament has to deal with, seeing that it is the very foundation of a national policy. What is the value of protection, or of our defence proposal, unless we have people here to do the developmental work? Only a - glance at the statistics is required to show that our progress in the way of population has, for many years, been too slow. In the ten years from 1851-61 the increase of population in all Australia was 744,988 ; for 1.861-71 the increase was 512,237; for 1871-81 it was 587,232 ; for 1881-91 it was 923,983; for 1891-1901 it was 594,659, and from 1901 to 1905, the increase was 278,769. If we take the increase at the same ratio for the remainder of the ten years up to 1911, we shall have a total increase of 557,000 odd, which, of course, is a decrease as compared with former decades.",34
215,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That means we are losing the natural increase by births over deaths.,35
216,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Evidently . We know that the great falling off in population has occurred since the States ceased to carry out a policy of assisted immigration.,35
217,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And possibly since the States ceased borrowing.,35
218,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That may have'had something to do with the decrease. Since the inauguration of Federation, Australian production has increased by 30 per cent -, whereas our population has increased by only 15 per cent. A comparison between Australia and Canada has been made in connection with immigration; and it has been stated that the policy in the latter Dominion has been overdone, with the result that large numbers of people are going to the United States, while others are finding their way back to their own countries. I take that to mean that the resources of Canada are not to be compared with the resources of some other countries. In the United States, the average annual increase in population is 750.000, though last year it was nearly 1,500,000.",35
219,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is by immigration alone.,35
220,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes ; and the figures show that when immigrants go to the United States, they find a country with a great variety of resources. This additional population causes those resources to be developed, because it stimulates the Government to undertake public works, and encourages private enterprise to invest in large ventures, all of which tend to general development. The Commonwealth and the States Governments have an annual revenue of about £50,000,000, and yet less than £50,000 per annum is spent on immigration.",35
221,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think the honourable member is understating the amount a good deal, because .my information is that this year Queensland alone spends more than £50,000.  Mr SAMPSON.' - From the statistics which I saw, I was under the impression that 1 was overstating the amount, though possibly the Prime Minister has later statistics than I have.",35
222,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think the amount expended must be over £100,000. . Mr SAMPSON - The Commonwealth has an oversea trade of something like ,£114,000,000, and yet, according to the statement of the Prime Minister,- we have spent this year only about £1,200 in advertising the Commonwealth.",35
223,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That expenditure was for 1906-7, not 1907-8. I conveyed a mistaken impression when I spoke of it as this year's expenditure. This year, I think, the expenditure now reaches about £2,500.",35
224,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Government are spending the vote which has not yet been passed,",35
225,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , but only in the way of larger sums for items which have been approved on previous Estimates. The telegraphing of the Tariff items this year represents an additional expenditure of £500 or £600, as compared with last year, and publications are .being more widely circulated at an equally increased cost.",35
226,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I understand that there has already been spent £1,200, and that it is anticipated that there will be additional expenditure, amounting, however, to only hundreds, and not thousands.",35
227,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I did so state, but then, as I say, I was using last year'sfiguresinstead of the present year's figures, which are larger.",35
228,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Canada , of course, has for many years taught us a lesson in immigration, the Dominion Government spending something like ,£200,000 a year. I saw that Mr Mead, the new Chairman of the Water Commission of Victoria, said the other day that the immigrants who found their way to Canada last year, chiefly assisted by the Government, possessed a total capital in cash of something like £12,000,000; and it appears to me that an immigration policy on the part of the Commonwealth could be justified on purely business principles, as returning a handsome and immediate result. estimated by the honourable member for East Sydney, when attending the Hobart Conference as Prime Minister in 1904, that a subsidy of about £ 8 per head would be sufficient to bring out immigrants. If we spent £400,000 per annum in bringing out 50,000 immigrants, this would mean, on the Canadian basis, additional residents possessing amongst them £2,000,000 in actual cash. Then, if we calculate £200 per head for about one-third of the number, as representing what is generally acknowledged to be the value of an adult man in good health, we have represented an additional value of £3,500,000; and, therefore,. 50,000 people would, as soon as they landed, mean an added value to Australia of about £5,000,000, in return for an expenditure of £4.00,000. ",35
229,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That may be, but we must lay down sound principles before we can proceed with practical legislation. The Prime Minister has emphasized the importance of the immigration question on several occasions, and the probability is that he has said all that can reasonably be said. With his keen grasp of political questions and his statesmanship, the Prime Minister, recently at Lilydale, in one of the most pungent, practical addresses he has delivered, emphasized the importance of the question; and Australia is waiting for the Government to introduce some definite, practical measure to give effect to the views which have been so frequently and eloquently expressed. We have had enough talk on this question. "" Population is needed, not merely to train as soldiers, which is a secondary consideration, but to develop its resources, and therefore we must, without, further delay, offer encouragement to immigration' by passing such legislation as will tend to bring here in sufficient numbers the proper class of immigrants. If the Prime Minister introduces practical definite proposals such as he has forecast, he will properly interpret, the of the majority of the people of Australia.  other honourable members,, think that there should be no cheese-paring or niggardliness in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, because the money will be wasted unless we do things well. I wish to make my position in regard to immigration clear. I shall not be one to keep Britishers out of Australia. I left the Old Country to better my condition,' and I wish to leave the It was door open here to all who are now in the position which I once occupied. Any man who plucks up courage to emigrate to Australia is sure to better his condition, in life, because there is no country in the world where working men can do so well.",36
230,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Government should send the honourable member Home as an immigration agent.  every sense. I landed in Brisbane without the proverbial "" bob,"" and now I always go down Queen-street with a sovereign in my pocket. If that statement is not a sufficient advertisement for the country, I do not know what would be. There is no place for the worker like Australia, and particularly Queensland. I have such faith in the country that I believe that if , tomorrow, I had only my swag, I should be top-dog again within twelve or eighteen months. In Queensland there is an immigration system which allows any resident of the State to nominate for' assisted passages persons up to the age of fifty years, on payment of a scale of charges ranging from the price of the kit for female domestics and males up to the age of twenty-one, to j£io as a maximum.",36
231,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The maximum is now £ 8 .  persons resident in Queensland to send for their relatives and parents. I came out as an assisted immigrant. In. London I was earning only 18s. a week for twelve hours' work a day, and I had a wife to keep, paying for clothes, food and rent. I have no love for the Old Country, so far as the living I made there is concerned, though 1 cannot forget the land which gave me birth and infant nurture. But Australia is my home, and I am a thorough Australian in every sense of the-word. If the possibilities of this country were made known in the Old Land, emigration would flow towards Australia as strongly as it has flowed towards other lands. We should get many more emigrants than go to Cape views Colony and the Transvaal, because the journey from England is not much longer. It is our distance from Great Britain that keeps people from coming here. They go to Canada because that country can be reached in' a voyage of a few days. there is stagnation in the Canadian immigration policy, Australia should do something to advertise her resources. British people, so long as they are under the British flag, feel that they are still at home. When men land here without anything, they take the first job that offers, to secure a chance to look round. Many of the best colonists in Queensland landed here without a shilling, and their position today should be sufficient evidence of the advantages offered in this country. The honourable member for Wimmera told us that only £50,000 has been spent in the whole of Australia in connection with immigration j but I heard Mr. Kidston say on the hustings at the last Queensland elections that more than that amount had been spent by the State within the twelve months. Every Orient steamer brings immigrants to Queensland, mostly females. I am sorry that our birth rate is not increasing. It is so small that we are forced to increase our population by importing fresh stock. Sheep or cattle breeders, when they find a' strain running out, import stud rams and ewes, or stud bulls and cows', and we should take similar means to increase the population of the country.",36
232,Mr MCDOUGALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Would the honourable member favour a coloured blend ?  opinions on that point. I do not like the coloured man, and if a law were proposed to prevent the mixing of white and black races, I should be one of its champions. But although the honourable member for Wimmera loudly advocates a vigorous immigration policy, let me read to honourable members a letter which the honourable member for Echuca brought under the notice of the Treasurer in August last. It is as followsMethodist Parsonage, Dear Sir, It is now a long time since the Government dumped down some twenty-seven returned Australians from South Africa here. They were informed by some one in the office of the Closer Settlement Board that work would be waiting for them on their arrival in Rushworth. The whole thing was a sad bungle both for the men and the public of this town, on whose charity they were cast. A public subscription was made, but this was insufficient to provide for them until the Government (State) agreed to give them a fortnight's work at Waranga Basin. gentlemen here had in addition to what they did before, to guarantee six or seven publicans the cost of the keep of most of these men for a time, feeling that when the authorities were made aware of their action they would reimburse us for this outlay : indeed, possibly return the pubNow that lic subscription in full , seeing that the fault lay solely with the authorities who sent the men. here. I communicated with Mr Jenkins, of the Closer Settlement Board, and the usual printed P.C. replv came to say that the matter should receive due attention. When we make applications to Government Departments, and obtain the reply that our letter has been received, and that the matter with which it deals will be given due. consideration, what is the first thought that comes to our minds? . Mr KNOX - That that is the end of it.  practically starving, and yet the only reply to a communication on their behalf made to Government officials in Melbourne was that the position would receive due consideration. Did the writer think that he would get a reply after being told that? If so, he was a fool. The letter continuesAfter a considerable lapse pf time and nothing further arriving, I again wrote Mr Jenkins, and two others signed the letter; but no reply has as yet come to hand. Will you kindly see Mr. Jenkins or whoever is responsible and acquaint them with the fact that we are far from being satisfied with the manner in which our communications are being treated, and urge upon himthe reason and necessity there is for complying with our request?- I am, yours respectfully, on behalf of Messrs. O'Brien, MCNamara, Raynor, and self, F. C. ViAN. The honourable member - for Echuca asked the Treasurer, who was then Acting Prime Minister, if he was prepared to take action in the matter. The honourable member wished to show his constituents that he meant business, and when most other honourable members were getting ready to go home, the pet lamb of the honourable member for Kooyong made a fuss labout twentysix repatriated Australians, for whom w.ork could not be found in Victoria. If work cannot be found here for Victorians reRushworth, 30th July, 1907. patriated at Government expense, why are immigrants being asked for? The officials were satisfied to get the men away from Melbourne. They sent them to Rushworth, ' in the Goulburn Valley, the garden of Australia, as I have heard Victorians call it. I say that it is simply monstrous.",37
233,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What would the honourable member have done for those men?  should be sent to western Oueensland where Three work could be found for them straight away. I may tell the honourable member that I have paid the fares of more than half-adozen men who desired to get away from Victoria to Queensland, and that I have been very pleased to do so. which I represent can absorb them, and is absorbing them, and, as a result, Victoria is "" squealing."" Only the other day I read in one of the Melbourne newspapers the statement that several families at Warrackn&beal had crossed the border into New South Wales because they could not procure land in this State. Yet some honourable members desire that we should embark upon a vigorous immigration policy. I shall never be a party to bringing men from the Old Country to dump them down in Melbourne, and thereby flood the labour market. Only today, whilst visiting the Commonwealth offices, - in Spring-street, I observed a crowd of men at the entrance to the Treasury Gardens, and upon inquiry I was told that they were the unemployed clamouring for work. monstrous that in a city like Melbourne such a state of things should exist. Yet it is urged that more immigrants - are wanted. Why? Simply to "" pull down "" wages. At the same time, there are places in Australia which are quite capable of absorbing not the twenty-six men for whom work could not be found in the rich Goulburn Valley, but 26,000.",37
234,Mr MCDOUGALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Are not some of the miners in Queensland in a very bad way ?  bane I learned that there were fifty or sixty men who were anxious to work their passages south, because they were practically starving.",38

Everybody knows that the more abundant is labour the lower will be the rate of wages paid. no desire to make Australia a close preserve for those who are already here. But if we are going to attract immigrants we should at least give them an assurance that they will be able to obtain employment upon their arrival.,38

Of course, that is only one case, but there - may be many others of a similar character. .. I entertain grave doubt as to whether the Commonwealth can undertake an immigration scheme as effectively as can the States.",38

I hope that this cussion will be productive of good results. I am satisfied that the Prime Minister desires to do something, but that he is sometively what shackled in this matter. He merely wishes to know what the States are predone. pared to do for immigrants after he has landed them here. When the States have assured him that they are willing to place so many thousand immigrants in their ritory each year, I am satisfied that he £ will carry his immigration policy into effect.",39
247,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Kooyong) [6.7] - I have listened with great pleasure to the remarks of the last speaker. At the commencehold ment of his observations I was under the impression that he was most enthusiastic his desire to secure for us additional popubucket. lation. But subsequently his attitude changed, until all that underlay his speech was a good British tone. I believe there are three great national propositions which ought to be dealt with by this liament, namely, increased population, fini ance, and defence. I think that the of these is of the greatest importance, cause of the direct bearing that it has upon the other two. I quite admit that are instances such as those quoted honourable member for Maranoa, in which difficulty has been experienced in placing in suitable positions men who have been patriated at the expense of the GovernAustralia, ment. Of course, we have a moral obligaemigrant tion to see that no immigrant is stranded Canada can do. here. I do not think that anybody can question the sincerity of the Prime Minister England and Australia. in this matter. He has always been favour of increasing our population legitimate lines. I confess that much surprised at the observations of the honourable member for Angas, who took up a position which was adverse to - the introduction of immigrants to our shores. Personally, I hold that we have never yet attacked this question in a sufficiently . strong business manner. I have studied the methods which are adopted in Canada itself for the reception of immigrants there, and I have also seen their arrangements made in Whitehall, together with those made throughout the provinces of Great Britain, where most effective sub-agencies been established, which are practically miniatures of the central offices in London. I repeat that none of the States have yet attacked this question in a business-like",39
248,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That remark is espedis-' cially applicable to Victoria.,39
249,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Victori a has a comparasmall territory, but perhaps has not attacked die question as she ought to have Very little can result from the discussion of the abstract question at the present time, and the scheme' proposed by the Government will be awaited with interest. terWe - are now asked to vote the sum of 2 0 , 0 0 0 for the purpose of advertising the resources of Australia, but it has been shown that only a very small portion of that amount can be expended during the current financial year, and I ""agree with those who that if the question of immigration is to be attacked effectively this expenditure in of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 will be a mere drop in the We must be prepared to spend very much larger sums, in order to do good work. I view the appointment of a High that Commissioner as a necessity of the situation, but should doubt very much the deParsirableness of making such an appointment f the occupant of the office were not refirst quired for the important and great work of beencouraging immigration to Australia. Lord Strathcona is perhaps the best immigration there agent that any part of the Empire has in by the London today. He has under him an excellent staff, and joins with it in doing everything possible to point out to intendreing emigrants the attractions of Canada. however, can offer the intending far greater inducements, than The one obstacle to be overcome is the cheapening of fares between As has been in pointed out, there is keen competition upon amongst the shipping companies trading I was across the Atlantic, and the journey from Liverpool to Canada occupies very little time.",39
250,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,-We need to make the passage money from England to Australia as low' as it is from England to Canada.,40
251,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I believe that a man can travel from Liverpool to Montreal for 25s. I doubt our being able to arrange for so low a fare from Liverpool to any Australian port.,40
252,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The fare from Liverpool to the central provinces of Canada is about £7. We could arrange to bring out immigrants at the same rate.,40
253,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It may be possible to do so. We should endeavour, at all events, to offer in that regard as great an inducement as does Canada to intending emigrants. The Prime. Minister has said in effect to the Premiers of the States: "" If you will provide the land we will find the people to settle on it . "" If the States do not accept his offer, the responsibility ing upon the Commonwealth will be greatly diminished. I shall do my best to support the efforts of the Government to attract to Australia a desirable class of immigrants. Australia desires to attract to her shores a virile class of people,' such as we already have here. We want to attract persons physically and mentally sound, with-plenty of backbone, and a determination to achieve that success . which the honourable member for Maranoa, by his own unaided effort, has secured.",40
254,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"North Sydney) [6.16] - I do not propose to enter the very wide field of discussion which this question presents^ since I feel that there must be some termination to our consideration of the Estimates, and that it would be unwise at the present time to deal very fully with the subject. At the same time, I wish to say that I do not share the readiness of the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Kooyong to vote a sum of £20,000 for advertising Australia in the absence of an intimation from the Government as to the nature of their proposals. Much more than £20,000 will be necessary for the purpose in view, but though I will gladly support a larger outlay, I hesitate to agree to an item of this kind which is not accompanied by any definite proposals on the part of the Government. I had hoped that the Prime Minister, since he cannot spend the whole of this sum during the current financial year, would be satisfied with a vote covering what is likely to be expended, leaving any demand for a larger vote to be considered in connection with future Estimates, and in conjunction with a scheme to be carried out with or without the co-operation of the States. We cannot altogether blame the States for the attitude they have taken up. They say, in effect, "" We have the land. We have to provide for the people who are brought out here in large numbers, and we can do so."" Mr HUTCHISON.'-Whic h State says that it can provide for them?",40
255,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Queens land, New South Wales, and Western Australia, to the extent of their available lands, provide for immigrants, and they say, "" We can do the work for ourselves. If the Commonwealth is going to expend money in bringing immigrants to our snores we shall be debited with our proportion of that expenditure. That being so, we might rest- just as well expend the money for ourselves."" I am not supporting such a contention ; I am merely pointing out that we must not consider that, the attitude taken up by the States is wholly unreasonable. I agree that one central authority acting for the whole of the States can do this work more effectively and cheaply than any of the individual States could hope to do; but the Prime Minister should not expect Parliament to vote considerable sums of money for this purpose until he has outlined the scheme in connection with which he proposes that they shall be expended. I admit that it is not his fault that no scheme is before us. He has been endeavouring to work with the States, but, probably for the reasons I have given, they have shown a reluctance to join with the Commonwealth. At the same time we ought to be satisfied, before agreeing to vote so large a sum, that the method of expenditure to be adopted will be such as to commend itself to us.",40
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We .ought not to continue to vote money that is not spent.,40
257,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We are voting money that cannot be spent during the current year unless it is thrown away. The importance of this phase of the question is shown by the experience of Canada. From what I saw recently when in Great Britain I have no hesitation in saying that - a lot of the money expended by Canada with a view to attract immigration is simply thrown away. She has undoubtedly attracted a large stream of immigration, but has done so at unnecessary cost. If we are to compete with Canada what will be the result?",40
258,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We shall have here a state of affairs like that now prevailing in Canada, where a lot of people are unable to find work.",41
259,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That state of affairs has not been the result of immigration. Canada was able to find work fpr her immigrants until the recent crisis, and for that her immigration policy was not responsible - There are reasons why, even if we spend the hundreds of thousands of pounds that Canada has expended in this direction, we shall not obtain the same result. In the first her proximity to the Old World gives her an advantage over Australia. merely the cost, of the voyage to Australia which militates against us. emigrants from Great Britain do not ""leave with the intention of never returning to their native land. They have the hope that they may be sufficiently successful in other countries to be able to return at some time and spend their remaining days in the land of their birth. Where similar advantages are offered by two countries they deliberately' choose the nearer, believing that its proximity to Great Britain will render it easier for them to return. We haye also to remember that a great deal of what is described as immigration to Canada is not immigration in the true sense of the word. Many people go from Great Britain and the United States to Canada for the season's work, and return. Under the Canadian system, however, they are classed as immigrants, and no deduction is made in respect of their departure. - I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs made some inquiries from the Canadian Government as-to the number of departures from the Dominion oversea or across the United States border, and that he was informed that the information desired could not be given. Many men cross from America into Canada with a view of following up the crops as they ripen-jus t as our shearers go from one State to another-and return to the States at the close of the season. All these men are classed as immigrants, and no deduction is made in ' respect of their departure. . That being so, the results of the Canadian immigration policy have been greatly magnified. Then,, again, we have to remember that Canada has been willing to receive persons of all occupations, whilst Australia has been seeking chiefly to attract farmers or farm labourers. The immigrants to Canada comprise only a small proportion of those classes. And all our expenditure, if we continued to hold those views, and went to the same extent as Canada, would be spread over a much smaller number lof people. Then there is the difficulty of the distance and of the passage-money, though, of course, our efforts might be directed to reducing the latter. It will be seen, therefore, that even if we spent the amount which is spent by Canada, we could not be nearly so successful as is the Dominion. I am not making these remarks in order to throw a wet blanket on the scheme, but only to show place, the necessity of cheaper and more effective work than is done in the case of It is not Canada. Whatever class we desire to attract to Australia, our efforts should, as As a rule, directly as possible, reach that class. If we desire to have farmers, farmers' sons, and farm labourers, we ought to place in the possession of every farmer in Great Britain, direct, the information that we have to impart. We should also avoid some of the very questionable methods adopted by Canadian immigration agents. I know the difficulty in handling agents, and of confining them to truthfu l representations; but we all remember'that in the case of Canada there were undesirable means adopted, which .may or may not have been authorized by any one in a responsible position. I rose principally to point out that the success of our expenditure depends upon the system 'adopted, and before' Parliament votes any large sum, we ought to know what the proposed system is. I know that the Prime Minister desires to consult the States.",41
260,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have done so.,41
261,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But I mean that the Prime Minister may desire to further consult the States.,41
262,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have had further replies .from some of the States, though not from. all.",41
263,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And , if necessary, I suppose the' Prime Minister desires further consultation, if there is any hope in the replies; and, therefore, the honourable gentleman is not prepared with a scheme at present.",41
264,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not with a complete scheme. I am prepared with my own part, but not with the part that depends on the States' co-operation.",41
265,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What does the Prime Minister consider his own part of the scheme? Spreading information about Australia?,42
266,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not altogether, but there is the Northern Territory, which will be directly our own. Mr jDUGAL D THOMSON - We do not know that, because Parliament has to approve of that transfer. At any rate, none of these matters can be undertaken in the immediate future.",42
267,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not before the this financial year.,42
268,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is what I mean; and yet we are asked to vote a sum which .gives a sort of blank authority to |the Goveu-nment to proceed with the expenditure, although no scheme has been presented. We have the assur-ance that this money will not, and cannot be, expended before the end of the present financial year, and I suggest to the Pirime Minister the desirability, for the sake of accuracy in the Estimates, of cutting the item down to the sum he thinks sufficient for immediate needs.",42
269,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That seems rather like discouraging the proposal. noted that the item has been reduced, and the reduction mav .be misinterpreted.",42

280,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Therefore, I suggest that the item should be reduced.",42

284,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What is the good of a end. of scheme of defence without people?,42
285,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Personally , I think that the two questions are inter-dependent. Immigration largely arises from the necessity for providing a sufficient defence; otherwise I do not see why we, as a Commonwealth, should trouble ourselves and make special and strained efforts to attract people here. In my opinion, the attractions of the Commonwealth, to those who know them, are sufficient to induce large numbers of people to settle in the country ;- and if the resources are sufficiently advertised, as proposed, the result will, I think, be a constant influx of immigrants.

288,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Y e t that is practically all that the Prime Minister has yet done. ad- Mr CROUCH - The Prime Minister has told us that he has distributed various amounts amongst the immigration leagues, and taken other steps. In my view, de* fence is the paramount question, and immigration the second; otherwise, we might continue in the. happy way of merely absorbing our natural immigration without making any special effort. It seems to me that advertising for the purpose of encouraging immigration is not so necessary as the Prime Minister seems to think. I have no doubt the honourable gentleman's attention was called to a letter which appeared in the London Times about January last, and in which the editor of the British Australasian stated that he was able to obtain. 500 or 600 immigrants at regu-lar periods as soon as it was thought the Commonwealth was ready to receive them. Further, it was announced the other. day by Mr Williamson Wallace that a large number of young Scotch farmers were ready to come to this country if they were certain of securing land. So far as some, of the States are concerned, and certainly in the be populated. case of Victoria, this is a matter entirely for State action or inaction. We must member that only a month ago the whole community was thrown into a state of tive anxiety because some twenty-nine Bulmigrants garians were in Melbourne, and others to the number of 120 distributed amongst States who could not obtain employment. These were white Europeans of the farmsuperior ing class, sober and anxious to get employtreaty ment, and yet it was over a week before it was possible for them to be absorbed.",42
289,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That was almost wholly due to the language difficulty.,43
290,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the Prime Minister propose to limit immigration to English-speaking people? I have recently drawn the attention of the Prime Minister's Department to the fact that a Mr Rothe, who has recently started an agency for sale of Australian products in Copenhagen, has said that he is able to induce the gration of a number of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, who are ready to.come here without any assistance, so long as they know some provision will be made for them on arrival.",43
291,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I saw the honourable member's letter on the point.,43

At any rate, this immigration would be without expense to as they will allow us to do so. the Commonwealth.",43

If we take what regard as the true view, and place immiin Queensland. gration as secondary to defence, we cannot stipulate that immigrants shall be Englishall speaking. The question has been raised as to the necessity of populating the ern Territory with white people.; and doubtwhere less that will be considered when the transment. fer of the Territory is under consideration. However, I understand that the Prime Minister proposes to induce white people to settle on our northern shores; but afraid that, if so, we shall have a repetifinanciers tion of the experience of the southern of America. So long as profitable employment was available in the northern States, where the climate is temperate, the southern States continued to be thinly populated.",43

But our danger lies in the north, and it is most the desirable that the northern part of Australia should be filled. I never underimmistood until quite recently that Russia was meeting the position by placing a population of over 15,000,000 white people in Siberia, so that we may have Russian assistance from the north when our struggle comes. This is an interesting subject; but I think that everything depends on defence.

What the Labour Party is opposed to is having workless persons here who must be supported by those who are working. It is remarkable that so much should be said about the need for immigrants, at a time when we have thousands of unemployed, many of them ready to turn their hand to anything. I believe that there would be no difficulty in bringing about a large inflow of most desirable immigrantsmen who have money with which to begin the battle of life-if it were not for the' fact, that many of those who have done well in Australia go to England after they have become wealthy and then curse the country which made them prosperous.",44

He speaks of our people and conditions in a manner which betokens knowledge gained by residence here, showing that he was not a mere globetrotter.

304,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I hope that the prominence I give him will not be to his credit. I intend to have a word to say upon his reflections on honourable members and on this country. This contemptible man misrepresented a private conversation with the honourable member .for Barrier. He said that he discovered that members of Parliament monopolize the compartments of trains, and travel like princes; but he did not know whether provision was made for them by the State, in addition to their salaries.' I have not known honourable members to travel like princes, but I know that they pay for every farthing's worth of food that they consume. This contemptible cad tells the public that honourable members are the servants of train conductors. How are we to get immigrants if a man like Major Trevor, those in charge of the press of the Old Country, and others, are continually sneering at and belittling us?",44
305,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Do we not travel like princes ?,44

This man' says that a train conductor, even when he is paid generously for attentions which he does not give, has not the manners to say "" Thank you."" I have had every attentionat the hands .of conductors throughout the Commonwealth. How can we expect immigration when visitors to Australia publish statements like these?

That is where population is' most required, seeing that the unsettled state of the Territory constitutes our greatest danger. Let us spend, if need be, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 in endeavouring to secure some settlement there. I do not wish to occupy the time of the Committee at any further length, but I hold that it is chiefly due to the slanders upon, and the slanderers of, Australia, that the stream of immigration to our shores has been so small during recent years. It will continue to be small until we provide more opportunities for the employment of labour than exist at the present moment.",46
338,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wentworth) [8.13] - I am entirely with the honourable member for Hindmarsh in holding in abhorrence any slander on Australia which emanates from an Australian.

343,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He did not say anycation thing worse about Australia than the Treasurer said about England during his recent visit to. the Old Country.,46
344,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I believe that that is so. I was rather struck by two statements of the honourable member for Hindmarsh which appeared to be mutually contradictory. He declared that the Socialist Party in this House did not oppose immigration. I believe that his statement is based upon fact. It is not safe to oppose immigration in Australia, because it is a subject upon which the electors are unanimous. I do not know of any electorate in the Commonwealth which would return a candidate who was opposed to an immigration policy. All the constituencies are unanimous as to the supreme necessity which exists for endeavouring to fill Australia's empty spaces. Consequently the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. that he was in favour of an immigration scheme appeared to me to be a very natural one. But I notice that his enthusiasm does not take a practical form, because he subsequently affirmed that the Commonwealth should not take the initiative in this matter, but should allow the States to make the first' move. Now, what is the actual position ? The States are asked to provide land for the immigrants before we move at all.",46
345,Mr MCDOUGALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What is wrong with the proposal to amend the Constitution so as to give the Commonwealth control of the Crown lands and railways?,46
346,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is a question which I am not at liberty to discuss upon this item. But I wish to. point out that every immigrant who comes to Australia is not prepared to take up land. In other words, he has not a few hundred pounds in his pocket with which he can purchase a farm. Most immigrants come here-as many others have done before them-in the hope of bettering their condition, and we ought to welcome them-irrespectiv e of whether or not they are possessed of capital-so long as they possess those assets which are more valuable in a new country, namely, enter- . prise, good health, muscle, and brain.",46

If that here is an opportunity for a protec tionist Ministry to bring into Australia 'numbers of artisans who will ' be prepared to impart an additional stimulus to those industries, and thus 'to assist the national - work with which the Prime Minister has charged himself. I understand that great claim which protectionists put forwardin country districts is that by means of protective duties population will be attracted here, and as a result the local markets of our agricultural migrants than we do. districts will be increased.

364,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In this case, - at all events, the hen has not done so. I hope that a comprehensive Scheme will be introduced, and that it is not going to include a proposal to wait further upon the States. It is up to the Prime Minister to give proof of the bona fides of the contention of protectionists, as tralia, by the incidence of the Tariff, by offering assistance in the shape of reduced passages and by other means to suitable industrial immigrants to come to Australia. There are one or two matters in connection with this question to which I should like to refer. I believe that some honourable members are afraid of introducing industrial immigrants because they think that already too much of our population is congested in our cities. That feeling may be very considerably overdone. Mr .POYNTON - Is it not a fact ? . Mr KELLY - It is a fact, and I deplore it, that population is very congested in the great Australian cities.  tion?",48
365,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The condition, whilst not itself healthy, is the natural sequitur of the great improvements which have been made in machinery, in methods of commercial distribution, and in other directions.  corollary of land monopoly? . Mr KELLY - It has nothing whatever to do with land monopoly. If honourable members will bear with me for a moment I shall put my view of the reason for this state of affairs. Honourable members have no doubt observed that country . towns, which used to serve-as distributing agencies for-their respective districts, have for years on the general average been .growing less, ;. whilst the - principal cities in each State or in each great distributing district have been yearly growing larger. The reason is that the country town as an agency of distribution has been gradually dropping out of existence, while the distribution of .the States has become more and more operative from the great cities. In this .way we have a natural aggregation of population towards the main cities. That is one factor in this position, and it is due to improved methods of distribution more than to any artificial reason. Mr THOMAS . BROWN - The population not only of country towns, but of rural districts, is decreasing.",48
366,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No one knows better than does the honourable member that production can be carried on with less men than was formerly the case. Owing to improved methods of production, the number of men required to obtain certain results is less now than it was. Mr THOMAS ' BROWN - The opportunito filling Aus- ties have decreased.",48
367,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Since the population of Australia"" is not increasing at the rate of more than 2J per cent, per annum, more people can live on the production of fewer people than was previously the case. Consequently more are entering our big cities. It is not healthy to have large aggregations of people in our - great cities,- but at the same time that aggregation is due largely to natural causes, and the introduction of more industrials will not lead to the diminution of the population of country districts. It will give them a new market; and lead in consequence to more, people being placed upon the land. Therefore, as. far as I . can see, there is no reason why the Prime Ministershould not attempt to bring out industrial immigrants; there' is every reason why he should. I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee further on this question. I explained a few nights ago the methods by which I thought immigrants could best be brought to Australia, and I shall not touch again on natural that question. I merely wish to say, in conclusion, that it is somewhat ridiculous that we should be called upon to vote a large sum of money-no t too large for the purpose if it were intended to beput to any use-whic h we know will not be expended. We know that £15,000 of this sum of £20,000 is not - to be expended this year. We are voting money with the - full knowledge that it . will not be . used. This.is a .highly absurd position for.a House that regards itself as trustees of the public purse to be put . into. I hope that we shall not have a recurrence of the situar tion; that 'when, the Prime Minister asks for a further vote he will be in a position to ask for a much larger sum, that he will have a cut-'and-.dried scheme ready in order that-we may-know' something definite is going to be done with regard to Australian immigration, and that ""we are not to repeat the farcical process of. making patriotic .speeches on. the public platform, and voting certain amounts of money intended to pacify the immigration enthusiasts, whilst we really do nothing.  with the honourable member for .Wentworth .that a great - deal of talk indulged in with respect to immigration is much of the nature of a political placard. Very little earnestness has . been exhibited by"" Australia in dealing with * this question. . What have the States done, andwhatare they doing, to cause an influx. of - immigrants to Australia?. It is. true that-.some of them have sent recruiting agents into other States. , . Mr DUGALD. THOMSON - Ne w South Wales, has, done something"".  Queensland, has a. recruiting agent in. Sydney, and'that Western'Australia has 'sent a recruiting agent to Tasmania. The honourable' member for' Wentworth admits that the - congestion of population in our large cities is undesirable. A glance at the statistics is sufficient to-show that the proportion of our population in metropolitan areas is much larger than it ought to be. The position is altogether different in New Zealand. Since the early nineties the increase in the' population of trie rural districts and the cities of New Zealand has been fairly even. That has largely been the result of land settlement. Is it not a farce to talk about plenty of land being available for immigrants when there are sometimes hundreds of applicants for a block in some of our States ? By every boat leaving Victoria men are sailing for other parts.' A great many have left this State for New Zealand, and I have heard of men who have returned in the hope that they would be able to settle down here, but who have been reluctantly forced to go back.",48

371,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are millions Of acres available there. ,  millions of .acres to which honourable members opposite refer are either so poor or so remote from a market that it would, be cruel to put"" people on them. ' It .is deplorable that, although we have millions of acres suitable for settlement in districts where there is a good rainfall and asplendid climate, we should have to send many men into the far north. Until our big land-owners are prepared to put their estates into the market, it is unreasonable to' talk about immigration. Do honourable members wished introduce artisans to still further crowd our cities? We want as immigrants men who are fit to go on the land - Mr KELLY-We want the first that we. can get.  a party to the telling of untruths about the conditions obtaining in Australia. More applicants for land come to me. than go to the honourable member. It is useless to keep prating about immigration, until there is some progress in rural settlement. . Mr KELLY - Does the. honourable member mean that we should not proceed until there is a graduated land tax in order to throw open the land?  to assisted immigration until I saw possible chances of settlement for the immigrants. Remember the hardships that were suffered by some immigrants in New South Wales a little while ago. The key of the situation is the throwing open of the land; and the sooner honourable members opposite recognise the fact the better it will be for Australia. , Mr KELLY - Does the honourable member know that 7,000 assisted immigrants arrived iri. New South Wales last year, and found work immediately?  know that there were a number of immigrants who, after they arrived, could not get employment, and some of whom were under the escort of the police. . Mr HUTCHISON - Some of them found work in gaol.  did not find things as rosy as they had been painted. I venture to say that there are very few' honourable members who, if inquiries were made of them by a friend in England, would be able to write back any great assurance that a man with limited capital would be able to obtain a farm.",49
372,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are hundreds of farms available in Queensland.  parts of Queensland there is some really good land-as good as any in Victoriabut a man requires to have well up to £1,000 before he can go on to it. Land can be purchased on long terms, but it requires a considerable expenditure for clearing and so forth, before there is any return. If the States are in earnest they 'must take more drastic steps than they have hitherto taken. The honourable member who last spoke said he believed there was a ""monopoly of land to the detriment of the general interest of Australia; but I venture to say that that honourable member would not suDport compulsory purchase, even at a fair price.",50
373,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I believe in compulsory purchase, even at a fair price.  the Legislative Councils in the various States are against compulsory purchase.",50
374,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We have it in Queensland.  news to me. In Victoria a resolution must pass both Houses before there can be compulsory purchase; and in South Australia it has not been possible to pass a measure of the kind. In my opinion, the progress of New Zealand is chiefly owing to the fact that, during the influx of immigrants in the last ten or fifteen years, the lands have been thrown open and rural settlement has kept pace with the settlement in the towns. Personally, I do not see what the Commonwealth Government can do in the matter.",50
375,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Are we to do no- thing until the States offer us land?  session of the States, and it is for the States Governments to act. It is only a few years ago since the honourable member for Flinders was talking about land monopoly, and saying ""he would impose the single tax.",50
376,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I never suggested such a thing, but I introduced a policy of compulsory purchase.  adopted by the Parliament.",50
377,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That was not the fault .of the honourable member for Flinders.  the State Parliament. My complaint is that there is no earnestness on the part of the States, the Governments of which have given no reasonable chance for the settlement of immigrants. There is no doubt that if suitable land were in the market in large quantities, we should have a number of immigrants, - with capital and experience, desirous of settling in Australia.  determination we come to on this important question will be largely based on what are our aspirations for Australia. If our as pirations be in accordance with the somewhat spurious cry of "" Australia for the Australians,"" in the most limited sense, we shall be opposed to immigration ; but if our aspirations be in the direction of making Australia a great and integral part of the Empire, then our policv will be one of development and land settlement. If our policy be one of a White Australia, I venture to say, with all due respect to the Labour Party, that we must of necessity be in favour of bringing, not a few, but thousands of immigrants into the country, and treating them properly when they get here. It is absolute nonsense to say that we have no land available, seeing that Australia at the present time is practically an empty country. We must set our shoulders to the wheel, and endeavour to attract immigrants. Of course, constitutional difficulty arises from the fact that it is hard to get the States Governments and the Federal Government to work in unison. That, however, should not be impossible; and doubtless our persuasive Prime Minister-and I use that term with the utmost respect-wil l be able to induce the Premiers in conference to do something to justify our spending something more than the sum at present proposed in. this connection. The Prime Minister has promised to do so; and in his important speech on defence he made it quite evident that ' if there is any man who recognises the necessity of bringing people to Australia, it is himself. I venture to .say that none of us desire the yellow people to come here; and yet it would be impossible, with a population of 4,500,000, to defend our shores if Great Britain ever became em'broiled in a great war. Are we prepared to. maintain - our hearths and homes, our wives and families, by the only effective means? With all respect to the scheme of defence of the Prime Minister, I say that, when we have put forth our utmost efforts in arming and in drilling our people, we shall not be able to defend Australia's 8,000 miles of coast line; and the only sensible course is to join political forces, both and Federal, in one common determination to make it possible to settle a large population on the land. The honourable member for' Grey referred to"" the movement in progress of inducing men, for various reasons, to leave one State for another; and I do not know that that is altogether an unmixed evil from the point of view of land settlement. Every man who moves from ""Victoria, for instance, to take up land in New South Wales or Queensland,, leaves areas available for other people; and the - process referred to is, in my opinion, only a natural one. It is quite true that a man may sell out his small holding, to a large landholder; but, at the same time, when a man dies, his land is very often divided amongst ""members of his family. There has never been a greater national work, or one which would more justify us in seriously considering the question of immigration, than that represented by the great irrigation scheme in Victoria. Such a scheme makes it easy to subdivide great holdings in the Goulburn Valley, and settle numbers of families in the place of one; arid what is possible there is possible in many other parts of Australia. It is proper ""that the Federal Parliament should do something to induce immigration; and there is no need to wait for the States to take action. In Queensland there are thousands of acres available, and I believe that in the near future the policy of that country will be the same as that followed in America, inasmuch as railways will be constructed in order to induce settlement, instead of settlement preceding railways. I should like to say a word or two about the congestion of population and the effects of machinery. With great regret I heard an honourable member say today that, as the result of machinery, men were thrown put of employment. The teaching of experience is that the employment of machinery does not throw men out of employment, but, on the other hand, makes it possible for the poor to enjoy luxuries hitherto undreamed of. Machinery substitutes for hard work employment of a character pleasing and elevating to the worker. That is th<? natural result of all mechanical developments. . The establishment of industries to cater to the present luxurious tastes of the people gives much employment in cities""; and that is one of the reasons why we find congested populations in the capitals. Let me now say a word in reference to what I regard as a somewhat silly arguState ment introduced this afternoon by the honourable member for Maranoa. He has two or three times' applied offensive epithets ""to me, and he did so again today, in quoting a letter - which I read to the Chamber in August last. It was from a reverend gentleman in Rushworth, who stated that twenty-seven repatriated Australians had - been dumped in that township, and had to be fed by the residents. I well remember the effect of that letter upon the"" members of the Labour Party. They rejoiced when it was made known to them by one in favour of immigration that employment could not be 'found at once for these twenty-seven men. Their exultation was, however, groundless. The men had been dumped down in Rushworth,- and, of ..course, for - the time being. were a - source of .annoyance, because employment could not be found for them .immediately. Every individual who comes to this country is source of profitto those who live here. stead of taking work from others, I betion, lieve that every immigrant provides more - work for the population than he undertakes himself. There haye been some - bright pages in Australian history, and the brightalways est have been when population has - flocking into the country. There has' been a bright'-page-in the history ofWestern Australia of late years, because population and actions has been flowing into that State. The dark pages in our history have been when - immigration has ceased, and we have been left, to-use a vulgar expression, "" to stew in our own gravy."" The most empty page here ? in. our history is the honourable member for Maranoa. I have not been able to deterports mine the policy of the Labour Party gard to immigration; but it is evident the speecheswhich have been made by. its members"" that the genuineness^ of their fessed desire for immigration is very ful. I have come to the conclusion that, while some of them are prepared to say that they are in .favour of immigration the abstract, the policy of the ""party, is to discourage immigration, apparently in the belief"" that, '.as we have a Australia,, we should keep it for ourselves. That. ,is not the policy which, makes for progress .and development, although it progress, development, and safety that we a time when Australians in ""the same fac need. . There is safety in numbers, and Australia is to become a white man's coun try, we must fill it with white. people.",50

This is the class of persons who talk about "" smartness,"" and who denounce the Labour Party for advocating land taxation.

424,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Capricornia) [9.26] We have heard a lot to-night about the stinking fish party, and it seems to me that those who tell us that Canada, New Zealand, and America offer more' attractions than does Australia have earned the right to have that epithet applied to them. The honourable member for Grey has told us that He re- people are leaving Australia for New Zealand. What are the actual facts? The honourable member for North Sydney has placed in my hands a statement as to the number of persons who have left Australia for New Zealand and those who have left New Zealand for Australia during the last two years. In 1906, 22,198 came here fromNew Zealand, and 22,426 left.Australia for New.Zealand, leaving a balance of about 220 in favour of the Dominion. In 1907, however, 27,425 came here from New Zealand and only 24,292 left Australia for that country, so that we had a"" credit balance of about 3,000. These' figures do not wholly support the contention that New Zealand holds out to the 1 settler a special promise of success. The honourable member for Yarra. states that there is no land available in Victoria. He appears to desire to apply that statement to the whole Commonwealth. It is true that he admitted that he was familiar only with the conditions prevailing in this' State",55

It was settled, possibly, and sixty years ago when no one could fore-' see what was likely to happen, and all the honland was allowed to be alienated. Since then, however, it has been cut up, and is entirely in occupation. We have in . Queensland a Compulsory Purchase Act, and only last year the Government. ex-pended ,£560,000 in the repurchase of ' estates.",56

437,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"So there is; but the have seenfitto buy land alienGoated for the last forty years, through which a main line of railway runs. This is the land which our friend's from Victoria and New South Wales have taken up after doing very well in those States. Those by who have left New. South Wales for paid Queensland in many cases timber getters, .who took up land on the north coast the rivers,- and, having been able to sell In it at from ,£20 to ,£30 per acre, went to Queensland, where they could obtain in equallygood land for - from ,£2 to .£5 an That is about the price of the most expensive of the repurchased esThe tates. As a matter of fact there are in Queensland' vast areas that have not been - alienaied with leases expired or expiring and which have not been settled for the reasons 1I have given. But we have now set to work in earnest. Whereas in the old days the Government waited for a district to be settled before they thought of opening it up by means of a railway, they are now adopting the practice of Canada, and the United States, and are recognising the radvisableness of opening up suitable districts by means of railway communication, and making them - attractive to the people, .and not waiting for settlement to precede means of communication. as they carry out that policy, there will be %'ast areas of land available for closer settlement. The repurchase of estates is a mere bagatelle, and can easily be done.",56
438,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,So that the story that Queensland has no land available for settlement is ridiculous?,57
439,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is absolutely fallacious. We have in Australia vast areas suitable for settlement, and it only remains for the States to open them up by means of railways. I have no desire to hurl objectionable epithets at any party, ""but any section which maintains the cry that there is no land available for settlement here is running down Australia without just cause. The matter, is in our own hands. Victoria - is settled, but because there are in this State large estates, which the Government have not seen, fit to repurchase, or which have ac-quired such high values as to render their repurchase difficult, it is not to be said that Australia generally is in the same position. I recognise that in seeking to attract immigrants to Australia the Commonwealth must work with the States. If the Federal machine is to run smoothly it is desirable that we should work in harmony with the States. The Federal Government must have some consideration for the feelings, so to speak, of the States. They have had to hand over to the Commonwealth authority various powers and functions to which they do not object, but the Federal authority shows an inclination to grasp all that it can'get - In order that the Federation may work smoothly . we - should avoid carelessly irritating the States in any degree. I suppose' that if there is any obstruction on the part of the States to legitimate demands, the Commonwealth must take a firm stand, but it is inevitable that the States should displaysome, feeling when the two powers' come into conflict,' and an uncompromising spirit is exhibited. Even in the absence of the .co-operation of the States, the Commonwealth Government cando a great deal in the way of advertising our resources in the Old Country. It. is because of the possibilities in that direction, amongst others, that I think we should appoint a High Commissioner as soon as possible.' I know what the Canadian Government and the Canadian Pacific Railway have done in the way of advertising Canada inGreat Britain. There are certain ways in which the Government might move in the direction of As soon encouraging immigration; and while I am not in favour of indiscriminate immigration, I say that we could absorb any able bodied, sober, steady men. The cry about supplying immigrants with land at once is utterly fallacious, because no man new to the country can go straight on to the land on his own. account without courting almost certain hardship and ruin. In Queensland, the land is being; thrown open to settlement as quickly as possible ; but we ought to realise that closer settlement has only commenced in the bigger spaces of Australia. Any able-bodied agricultural or other labourer, aftertwo or three years of local experience will be qualified to' take up land; but it is sheer cruelty-and I speak from personal knowledge-.to dump down,', even an English farmer on the land in Aas j tralia before he has become familiar with the conditions of the country. In the case of Canada, it is the common practice for a fawner, when he intends-to settle.there, to send out his sons'to work for a year or two to spy out the land and acquire experience, arid then to follow them; and any assistance in attracting that class of settler would be most valuable. But that is not the only class of immigrants' whom we have to consider. We desire to have men here who, though Without means, depend on their' own brain and muscle in order to make their way; and there should be provision for these men when they arrive. It is therefore very important to get into touch with people who desire the sendees of immigrants. We are told that there is already surplus labour in Australia, and that work for 100 additional men could not be found in central - Queensland. That, .however, is not so; and we must remember that there ..will always be unemployed in the towns.' In 'the big cities, I am afraid,, there will always' be .poverty. ""and distress aridunefriployables until the millennium'""or the socialistic State arrives, when, I suppose, those will be made to work. But I know that in the moderate-sized towns - not manufacturing towns - of central and northern Queensland there are numbers of young men who will not go into the country to work. In north Queensland, just now, owing to the low price of copper and other minerals, numbers of men, who have hitherto worked small ""shows"" of their own, have found employment on the land; while others are looking for work. But that, I contend, is no argument against an immigration policy. If such arguments are acted upon, we shall never people Australia or keep it a white man's country. We shall never be free from fluctuation in employment, from temporary overpluses in different directions.",57
440,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member apparently argues that a surplus of labour means, at the same time, a scarcity of labour.",58
441,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not say that. All I contend is that, for instance, a temporary failure in one industry, such as I have mentioned, may cause a surplus of labour, but that such surplus is no argument against an immigration policy. The fact is that, when there is a surplus of labour in the towns, the men there will not go on to the land, and would not be able to do anything with it if they did. I have addressed myself broadly to the question, with special reference to Queensland. I know that it has been difficult to get land in suitable locations in Queensland, just as in other parts of Australia; but those days are passing away. Even the' alienated lands along the railways, like those on the Darling Downs, are being broken up 'and absorbed; and I know that the Queensland Government will even more rapidly push railways into districts where there are thousands of acres available for settlement. .Some of this land is under lease, but no new leases are being issued. The leases in existence will fall in during the next ten years or so; and those men who are coming to Australia now, and obtaining experience, will become settlers during the next few years.",58
442,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Hav e lessees not a preferential right to the land when the leases fall in?,58
443,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No .,58
444,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Calare) [9.48] - Despit e the inference drawn by the honourable member - for Echuca that a section of the House is opposed to immigration of any kind, I am sure that all sensible Australians recognise that an - important factor in our wealth and prosperity is population, and that, at our present stage of internal development, the country cannot assume its rightful position unless we resort largely to immigration. The difference between the two sides of the House on this question may, I think, be easily summed up. Honourable members who, like myself, belong to the Labour Party, desire to see a healthy population of energetic go-ahead people who will help to build up and develop the industries of the country. In order to get that population certain facilities and inducements must be offered, or, as in the past, people from outside will refuse to throw in their lot with us. On the other hand, there are other honourable members who seem to look at the question from the stand-point that the conditions here are all right and cannot be improved very materially-that all thati is required is an increased supply of labour by means of a large influx of people. Those honourable members look to that supply being kept up to such an extent that the country will be called upon to establish soup kitchens and labour bureaux in orddr to support the labourers during the slack times, so that they may be readily available at the lowest cost in the busy times. I say unhesitatingly that I am not prepared to lend myself to introducing labour from the Old Country under false pretences.",58
445,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Nobod y proposes that.,58
446,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the honourable member will read some of the literature circulated by the Immigration Leagues here, notably, the league presided over by Dr Arthur in New South Wales, and even much of the 'literature fathered by our States Governments in the Old Country, he can come to no other conclusion than that the grossest misrepresentations are being circulated in order to attract a particular class of immigrants.",58
447,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We require some means of placing the facts before the public, and then allowing the immigrants to take the risk.",58
448,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am with, the honourable member in that, but I think we should do something more. We ought to improve the conditions in Australia, so as to ""make the prospects-of the immigrants brighter. While the Federal Government may do something in the way of advertising Australia, it can do very little in the direction of encouraging and retaining immigrants ' without the assistance of the States Governments, and, so far, the States Governments have shown very little disposition to co-operate with the Federal authority in attracting the right classes. Some of the States Governments have endeavoured to secure an influx of manual labourers, quite regardless of the fact that the native population is leaving because of their being unable, under present conditions, to retain what they themselves produce. Under such conditions, we can only hope for the very lowest class of labour in our immigrants, because any man with energy and push, desiring to make the best of his life, will not rest satisfied. If we really desire to increase our population, we must set ourselves the stern task of improving our social and industrial conditions, in order, first of all, to retain our native born, and next to attract desirable immigrants. This is an object we have not Been able to attain up to the present time, because the immigration is practically counterbalanced by the emigration, the net improvement being very small over a given number of years. The honourable member for Capricornia quoted, amid some approval from honourable members near him, certain figures comparing the additions to population in New Zealand and in the Commonwealth during the last couple of years. But I think the honourable member should have extended the comparison further back, because if we take the seven years of Federation, we find that New Zealand has by immigration added 48,000 to her population, while the Commonwealth has added only something like 6,000. The time was when New Zealand was considered a bankrupt dependency of the Empire, and one of the least desirable nlaces for emigrants to go to ; but the legislation introduced by those eminent statesmen, Mr Ballance and the Right Honourable Richard Seddon, completely altered the position of affairs, so that the Dominion is now the most inviting country in the Southern Hemisphere. Until we put an end to the exodus from our own shores, it will be useless to try to attract people from the United Kingdom. We must first make sure of retaining our own population. When we have done that, our conditions will prove attractive to others abroad. honourable member for Yarra, when he referred to the. land monopoly which exists, particularly in the older settled States, mentioned the chief cause for the decrease in our population, and its undesirable and unhealthy concentration in the large centres. Official statistics show that of 700,000 adult voters in New South Wales, about 1 ,coo own half of rhe alienated land of s the State, and about 3,000 half of its accumulated wealth. Its land is divided amongst 170,000 or 180, JOO persons, and its accumulated wealth between about 200,000 persons, so that about 500,000 arelandless and without wealth. Until something is done to make the land available, our population must decrease year by vear. The honourable member for Wentworth attributed the flow of population to the cities to the increased efficiency of agricultural machineiy. I do not think that that is the true explanation!. The last redistribution of seats gave New South Wales another representative at the expense of Victoria; but in rearranging the etec toral divisions of the State the count ty divisions were reduced by one, another evidence of the d r if t of population to which I refer. Those who know the conditions under which people reside in the cities areaware how unhealthy a sign it is when the population is drifting there from the country. We are told authoritatively that in Sydney 1,000 women and children. work for from 5s. to nothing a week. Many young girls employed in shops and factories are content to give their services for nothing, merely to learn a trade or business. Last session a proposal was brought forward in the State Parliament for preventing the payment of a lower wage than 2s. 6d. per week. We find, too, that men employed in responsible positions, handling large sums of money, receive only from 30s. to £ 2 a week, while the remuneration generally of those earning weekly wages is not sufficiently high to offer an inducement to men who are not forced to leave the country to go 'to the cities.",58
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Thes e atatemerits, when cabled Home, will not induce people to come here.",59
450,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They are true, and if the present state of things can be altered only by telling the truth, the truth must be told. I have just returned from my electorate, where I learnt something about the methods obtaining in regard to State immigration. The New The South Wales - Governimen+, to provide occupation for the small number of imndgrants coming to the State, pays the poll M los. for .every man-for whom they find position, and', as a result, men who have been employed for. years are often disshould missed, immigrants' being taken on in their stead at lower rates, the'policemen-receiving ios. for finding one'man a billet at pense of another. If , as is often the case, the immigrant proves inefficient, he is dispensed with, .and sometimes the former ploye' is reinstated - Then I was told recently, when a party of immigrants, to town conditions, undertook to engage in scrub-cutting, they were driven out scrub on a distant station, and their proviis sions and tents having been unloaded, left entirely to their own resources. That is treatment to which , the Australian man is accustomed; but these unfortunates did not know how to rig. a tent, how to kill a sheep, or how to cook the provisions mates passed. supplied to them, and when they found a snake, they were so scared by the stories which they had heard, that they all cleared out. In another case a couple of immigrants were engaged to go into the counsponsible. try to a place where they were told they would receive a certain wage, but, ort arrival, the station proprietor said that could not pay the wage, and therefore they possible. had to accept less. They were housed, acpropriated cording to their own statement, with a of dogs,. being, I presume, sent to a shed in which dogs were tied. up. This was too much for them, and they left, carrying siderable damage to Australia. their boxes some 12 miles. These men have friends in the Old Country to whom they will write, and their stories will do to prevent emigration here than our adverscheme tising can do to encourage it, Canada and the United States, on the other hand, treat their immigrants in such a fashion that good reports are sent Home, and their ture friends come out to assist in the work of a waste of money. developing the country.'

469,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Fremantle) [10.29] As there seems to be some doubt as to the area of land available for settlement in Australia, I should like to assure honourable members that in Western Australia, at all events, vast tracts of country are available. There is, for instance, an area stretching, say from Albany to Geraldton, 600 miles long and probably 300 miles in width. Railways are being carried into it, and the country is being rapidly settled. There can be seen some of the finest crops that are raised in Australia. Since I first went to Western Australia settlement there has made enormous strides. Northam at one time was the chief centre of cereal production in the west; but farming operations have since extended for no less than 150 miles due east towards the gold-fields. The facilities for acquiring land in Western Australia are all that the people could desire. The Agricultural Bank makes advances to settlers in respect of any work done by them on their land. If they build a house, they receive assistance, and they are also Helped to fence and clear their holdings. I do not know of any State where the facilities for settlement are so satisfactory.",62
470,Mr MAHON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And the land can be obtained for practically nothing.,62
471,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Government offer intending settlers holdings of 160 acres for practically nothing. _ If a man wishes to commence operations on a larger 'scale, he may take up 2,000 acres, and also 1,500 acres on behalf of his wife. No doubt, in time to come, the cry for closer settlement, now heard so frequently in the east, will be heard in Western Australia. I would remind honourable members that those who want land need not go even so far as Western Australia for it."" Within the last fortnight, at the Mount Barker Agricultural Society's Show, I saw exhibited by the Agricultural Department of South Australia a very fine sample of be grain grown in the Pinaroo and other districts, where there is an average rainfall of only 8 inches. This wheat was grown on land which no one would have looked at five or six years ago. Had we been told a few years ago that it was capable of producing wheat of such fine quality, we should not have treated the statement seriously. Another large area of land, stretching from Port Lincoln in a northerly and north-westerly direction, was at one time looked upon as a desert, but it has been opened up by a line of railway 40 miles in length, which the Government propose to extend by another' 40 miles. Less than ten years ago, that country was regarded as useless, but settlers there are now doing well by wheat-growing. ItTnas been clearly proved that wheat can be grown on all areas which enjoy the winter rains, or, in other words, districts where the rain falls at the right time for cereal crops. When we reach the tropical areas, good crops cannot be relied upon, but there are in South Australia, as well as in Western Australia, vast areas of wheat-growing country that have not been opened up.. It only, remains for men with pluck, who are willing to work and to rough it, to take action. We certainly do not want to settle on the land men such as those we often see hanging about the street corners here. I have often looked at them, and would be afraid to mention within their hearing. that I was in search of labourers. Such men will not leave town to obtain employment, because they will not go far away from an hotel. An expenditure of £20,000 will not be nearly sufficient for this work. We shall have to expend something like £200,000 in inducing people to come to the country.",62
472,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the honourable member voices such extravagant ideas, he cannot hope to secure the transcontinental railway.",62
473,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If , instead of decrying our country, we spent money in inducing people to come here, we should have no difficulty in finding money for railway construction purposes. If the line to which the honourable member refers is constructed, we shall be able to settle 1,000,000 people along it. I , for one, am not surprised that agents from the Western State are here in the east. Many people in the eastern States are entirely ignorant of the conditions prevailing in the west. I have been asked here whether Western Australia is not a sandy desert, whether wheat can be grown there, and whether it is possible to grow oats'. people now in Australia wish to hold the country, they must be ready to recognise that we have plenty of room for all who choose to come here.

At the same time, we have the right to attract people to Australia. We represent the States, and it is for the benefit of the States that we desire to encourageimmigration. We certainly cannot improve the position of the Commonwealth by crying "" stinking fish."" The land is not locked up.

There is no hardship in paying a reasonable price for land in a good district, and there is no harm in either the States Government or the Federal GoBut vernment purchasing estates in order to sell the land to settlers. There is the value for money paid, and one way to encourage immigration would be to impress on immigrants that if they purchase the land at the price asked they have a good bargain.

I had not the details before me then, but I have since looked the matter up, and I find that the latest statistics support my statement. During 1906-7, New South Wales spent £ 1 7 , 0 0 0 , Queensland spent £10,000-of which something like £ 3 , 0 0 0 was refunded by the immigrants themselves-and the Commonwealth proposes to spend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . This makes £ 4 3 , 0 0 0 , and substantially supports what I said. I understand that the Queensland Government this year are spending considerably more. than in any previous year, and probably that was what was in the mind of the Prime Minister.",63
485,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes . - Mr. JOSEPH ;COOK- - (Parramatta) [10.45] - I do not jknow how long the Prime. Minister intends to continue this sitting. . Mr DEAKIN - This is the fourth night of the debate on this' one Department of the Estimates. Mr - JOSEPH COOK - I do not know that that is too long, seeing that in all probability, one or. two of. the Departments which follow will he disposed of very rapidly. In any case, I regard the De- partment before us as one of the most important in the Estimates;- it covers the widest range of subjects, and opens up more debatable matter than any other. I think that before this large sum of money is voted-no t large in relation to the object in view, but large in itself-w e should have from the Prime Minister a full scheme of immigration, either with or without the co-operation of the States. I understand the Prime Minister is waiting for the States to furnish him with some information.",63
486,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , as to their part of the scheme.",64
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Prime Minister has made many efforts to get the States to do something, and it is time he told us what the States intend to do, and what he intends to do irrespective of the States.",64
488,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Prime Minister last night promised to make a definite statement as to what the Commonwealth intends to do.,64
489,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , on the next Estimates.' As I have said, I have only definite replies from two of the States.",64
490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And asked to vote £20,000 in the absence of any scheme.",64
491,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have already said that we cannot expend more than one-fourth of the ""amount this year.",64
492,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then why does the Prime Minister not move that the item be reduced by £15,000?",64
493,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Because, , as I have already said, such action might be misinterpreted.",64
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think so, particularly if the Prime Minister makes the promised statement to the Committee.",64
495,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There would be no gain in reducing the item.,64
496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But on 'principle we have no right to vote money there is no' reasonable prospect of spending' -; That is' a "" placard,'.' with: a vengeance ! ' Mr DEAKIN - It would be a placard if i the item were reduced now - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - In my opinion, 1 it is a vicious principle to vote more money than we think is going to be spent. I understand the Government, have power toappropriate this vote to any other purpose - that they have power to transfer the ex-: penditure to some purpose that has norelation whatever to immigration. I suggest that progress be reported now, and' that the Prime Minister tomorrow make a statement before the division is passed.",64
497,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It will not be the statement about which the honourable member - has been speaking. I am prepared to make a statement which I commenced to make yesterday, or the day before, when: we were dealing with the first item.",64
498,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"At any rate, Isuggest that progress be reported now.",64
499,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I take it that that means the honourable member will assist me in bringing this discussion to an early conclusion ?,64
500,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I shall do my best; though I think this is one of' the most important Departments with which we have to deal. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. PROGRESS OF BUSINESS : DURATION OF SESSION.,64
501,Mr DEAKI N,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister of we are External Affairs) [10.53] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I take no exception, and have not done so, to the extension of the debate on the Estimates of the Department) of External Affairs. I recognise that the subject under discussion is of immense importance* and branches out inevitably into a number of urgent public questions. At the same time, I remind honourable members that if there is any idea of closing this session, and taking a recess before, commencing the work of the new financial year",64
502,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is that the intention of the Government?,64
503,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"As I have said from - the"" first, while perfectly willing to have a recess, it is oncondition that we have disposed of - the Tariff and other necessary .business. '- Mr. JOSEPH-. COOK -' ' Other necessary business."" ; Mr DEAKIN-Yes ; - and of - that necessary business there need not be a long list. , Unless we dispose of the Estimates' as a Whole more rapidly than we are"" disposing of those of the - particular Department now under discussion-, it will be clearly impossible to conclude the session as early as anticipated. I shall not complain, however, though I should regret the ' fact - for other reasons and for other members. I am perfectly willing to proceed so long as honourable .members think fit. But, having regard to the magnitude of. the measures to be submitted, and the importance of the issues with which they will deal, I dare say we shall face them better after a short reoess than if' we prolong - the present session. On the other hand, we .have enjoyed a much longer Christmas adjournment than that of the Senate, and the Government itself is prepared to go on as long as is desirable in the interests of' public, business. - Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.56 p.m. T",64
