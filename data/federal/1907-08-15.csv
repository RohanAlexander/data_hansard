Moreover, I arri informed that, where delay is inevitable, the postal officials prefer that it shall be in connection with the delivery of English, rather than of Inter-State, letters.

Mr Bruce SMITH, - A telegram which is published in today's newspapers states thatAt a meeting of the Hume Pastures Protection Board, the chairman (Mr J . Ross) reported that he had received a telegram from the Lands Department, 'that the cost of wire netting to applicants would now he subject to an increase of j£6 Z2S. per mile, in consequence of the Tariff introduced by the Commonwealth Government. Members were unanimous in their condemnation of the imposition, and contrasted the action of the State Government in coming to the aid of land-owners in righting the rabbit by importing wire netting, and the action of the Commonwealth in increasing the cost. It was resolved unanimously that Sir William Lyne be requested to give his strenuous opposition to the proposal, as it was detrimental to the interests of the farmers and settlers. Will the Acting Prime Minister say whether those statements will cause an alteration in the attitude of the Government towards the duty on wire netting ?",15
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No statements of thaf kind. will affect my action in the slightest degree; I shall do what I think right in this matter. Mention is made of the .price of wire netting being increased, but who gets the advantage of the increase ? The States, not the Commonwealth'. It would be better, therefore, for the Government of New South Wales to refuse to inciease this price of wire netting, since it gets the advantage of the higher duty. ' Mr HUTCHISON - If he finds that the producers are being charged too much for. wire netting, will the Minister be prepared to follow the example of the Government of South Australia, and import netting, selling it to producers at cost price?",15
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I have made a suggestion of that kind to a member of the New South Wales Government. I think that it is a 'proper thing to do.,15
5,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Seeing that, - according to the reports of the Tariff Commission, there has been a largely increased demand for wire netting during the last four or five years, and that only one establishment for its manufacture exists in Australia, does not the Minister think that a better way to keep down the price than for the Commonwealth to become an importer, paying the duty, would' be to remit the duty ?",15
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The question will be fully, discussed and dealt with when the Tariff is before us.",15
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to know if steps are being taken to expedite the production of papers givinginformation in connection with the Tariff, which the Acting Prime Minister promised to have ready for us next week?. Those who represent New South Wales constituencies, and travel out of Melbourne each week end, find the greatest difficulty in obtaining the papers which they wish to read before the next meeting of Parliament. For instance, I could not obtain a copy of the Acting Prime Minister's Budget Speech until my return to Melbourne last Tuesday. Tho papers to which I refer should be circulated sufficiently early to enable honourable members to study them during the week end, and I ask that steps be taken toexpedite their production.",15
8,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Every effort is being made to have these papers ready at the earliest moment-; but it must be remembered that very, detailed information, requiring much tabulation, has been asked for, and it is necessary that it shall be presented with absolute accuracy. It has taken some time to obtain this information, but I think that, so far as my Department is concerned, everything is now airaost complete. Itremains for the Government Printer to finish the printing, and to publish the reports of the two sections of the Tariff Commission.

Will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to break down this monopoly by subsidizing other lines?",16
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have noticed Prime that it is proposed to increase the passenger rates by 10 per cent., and I have followed closely the negotiations of the Conferences on the subject of space and rates of freight for butter and other perishable produce. I shall certainly bring the matter before the Cabinet, because it seems to me that the action complained of is outrageous. PATENT AND PROPRIETARY difficulty, MEDICINES.",16

16,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"for Mr CROUCH) the Acting Minister of External A f Referring to the speech of Lord Elgin, English Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the House Lords, on the 20th May, 1907, as folthe case of the employment of on ocean-going steamers, the view of His Majesty's Government was that they could admit that such employment could legitibe prevented by colonial legislation. . . . For the trade between Australia and other parts of His Majesty's dominions the emof lascars could not be so prevented."" 1. Has the Commonwealth Government had any communication or notification to this effect from the Imperial authorities? 2. As Lord Elgin is the English Minister who has to approve of Australian legislation before it is finally passed, will the Commonwealth Government endeavour to secure this approval before it legislates in regard to lascars on ships trading between Australia and other countries? 3. Does it propose to make any protest against Lord Elgin's threat of future interference with Australian constitutional rights?",16
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The replies to the honourable and learned member's questions are1. No. The speech referred to was delivered not on the 20th, but on the 29th May, while the Minister and myself were on our return voyage to Australia. It is observed that the speech also contains the following passage :"" Of course, the Colonial Legislatures have a right to say what ought to be done in their own waters, and with regard to their own coasting trade."" That is a very important addition to the quotation made by the honourable memberNo communication on the subject has been received from the Colonial Office. 2. Having in view the resolutions of the Navigation Conference, it is not anticipated that any will arise in regard to the proposals which will be submitted when the Navigation Bill is introduced. 3. Reading the speech as a whole, it is not regarded as containing any threat, and under all the circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider what should be done until some more definite action has been taken. PUBLIC SERVIC E CLASSIFICATION.",16

19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Public I shall Service Commissioner has supplied me with the following answers :2 and 3. For sections of the Service, it sary to set aside the number of class positions required to carry on the work, and officers in the lower class can only be advanced to the higher when a vacancy occurs; otherwise the advancement of a junior would necessitate the degrading of a senior. Apart from this, however, the expansion of business justifies an increase in the number of fourth class positions, and provision has been made on the Estimates to meet the increased expenditure involved in regrading a number of fifth class telegraphists and clerical officers. In addition, the proposed regrading of post-offices will result in a number of promotions from the fifth to the fourth class. The estimated total number of fifth class officers, who will benefit this year b)i the changes indicated above, is 192. NA LANCE - SERGEA NT HANKS .",17
20,Mr HUTCHISON,LIEUTENANT RUSSELL AND,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. As the opinion of the Crown Solicitor is, that Lieut. Russell, of the Perth Highlanders, who dishonorably evaded payment of a debt of some ^400 by pleading the Gaming Act, and was expelled from the Perth Stock Exchange for dishonourable conduct, under the Military Regulations, is not guilty of conduct unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman, why was Lance-Sergt. John Hanks, ""of the Western Australian Forces, who paid over, when sued, the sum of £ \ o iSs. 6d., the property of the Officer Commanding, discharged with ignominy? 2. Was it because there are regulations dealing with non-commissioned officers, who on compulsion pay their debts, and no regulations dealing with officers who refuse to pay their debts? 3. Under what regulations was Lance-Sergt. Hanks expelled ? 4. If the regulations are equally stringent for officers and non-commissioned officers, in view of the Crown Solicitor's opinion, will LanceSergt. Hanks be reinstated and receive reparation for his ignominious and apparently unjustifiable treatment ?",17
21,Mr EWING,LIEUTENANT RUSSELL AND,"The answers to the honare as follow :orable member's questions are as follow :- sidered, 1. Lance-Sergt. Hanks was tried and convicted by Court Martial for committing an offence against Military Regulations. 2. No. In Lieut. Russell's case, the debt was a transaction in no way connected with military matters. Lance-Sergt. Hanks was convicted of having failed to nccount for a sum of money, the property of the corps of which he was a member. 3. Paragraph 237 of the Commonwealth Military Regulations. 4. For similar offences, the regulations are practically the same for both officers and men. In view of the foregoing replies, it is not proposed to re-open Lance-Sergt. Hanks' case. The case of Lieut. Russell is still under consideration. I have instructed that further inquiries shall be made. place the result of these further inquiries before the honourable member as soon as possible. As honourable members are aware, I have experienced some diffiis necesculty in determining what is the proper fourth and fifth course to pursue. TELEPHONE CONNEXIONS .

24,Mr LIVINGSTON,LIEUTENANT RUSSELL AND,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether' he has .a report of the cost of providing telephonic communication with Hog Bay ?",17
25,Mr MAUGER,LIEUTENANT RUSSELL AND,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Ves; but further information is required before a decision can be given on the subject of providing the desired communication. This will be obtained as quickly as possible. TARIFF EXEMPTIONS.,17
26,Mr JOHNSON,LIEUTENANT RUSSELL AND,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Will he consider the advisability of exempting from the operation of the proposed increased Tariff, shipments of goods already on the ocean on the date when the Treasurer's Budget. Speech was delivered ? 2. Is he aware that Canada is' stated to have made a similar provision when the preferential Tariff proposals were dealt with? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - The ""answers to the honourable member's questions 1. This matter has been most carefully conand it has been found impossible to accede to the request for exemption. 2. The Canadian Customs Tariff 1907 has no such provision. The preferential rates are portion of the whole Tariff, and are not dealt with separately. In that Act, on the contrary (see section 16), the new duties are imposed and payable from 30th November, 1906, on which date the resolutions were brought into the Canadian Parliament. As bearing on this question, may I say that yesterday the honourable member for, Parramatta, and several"" other honourable members, inquired whether the old rates of duty would be levied on goods on board vessels that had called at certain ports in the Commonwealth before the new Tariff was introduced. I have looked into matter, and have come to the conclusion that no special treatment can be accorded such goods.' The duty paid upon them, just as in the case of goods in bond, must be that set forth in the Tariff now before the House. MILITARY BOARD.",17
27,Mr CHANTER,LIEUTENANT RUSSELL AND,"for Mr SALMON) asked the Minister of Defence, upon notice-1. How many meetings of the Military were held during 1906 when, in the language of the Report, "" By these means the Minister kept constantly in touch with the of the Department, and co-operation between the different branches is insured, correspondence and references between the different Departments being also greatly lessened "" ? 2. How many of the consultative members representing the militia in various States were summoned, and who attended, and hbw often?",18
28,Mr EWING,LIEUTENANT RUSSELL AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :r. Seventy-four, at twenty-two of which the Minister was present. 2. None were summoned during the year 1906. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",18

SECOND READING. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [2.56] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I would point out that its provisions are so concise that honourable members should have no difficulty in grasping their effect. It proposes that the Parliamentary Allowances Act of 1902 shall be repealed, and that the members of the Parliament shall receive, instead of ^400 per annum as at present, an allowance of .£600 per annum. When the Federal Convention was sitting in Melbourne, the question of the allowance to be granted to members of the Federal Parliament was discussed. The draft Constitution Bill then made provision for an allowance of .£500 per annum, but the leader of the Opposition in this House, who was then Premier of New South Wales, moved that the sum be reduced to ^400 per annum. I supported him, thinking, as the result of my experience as a adjourn to- member of the Parliament of New South Wales-the members of which receive only ^300 per annum-that .£400 per annum would be sufficient-. Since then we have learned what a vast difference there is between the expenditure which must necessarily Ibe incurred by members of this Parliament, and that which, falls upon members of the States Legislatures. I have no hesitation in saying that, having regard to the expenses which honourable members of this Parliament must necessarily incur, an .allowance of .£700 or .£800 per annumi in their case would not go further than does the £300 per annum received by members of the State Parliaments of New South Wales and Victoria.",18
35,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Anothe r point is members of the States Parliaments are able to enjoy the comfort of their homes.,19
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"They are able in mosr cases to follow their business $7,000, or £ 1 , 4 0 0 per annum. avocations, and even the country members can reach their homes without suffering the inconvenience of a very long journey. I say deliberately that our experience clearly shows that some special considerapresent tion is necessary in the case of members of the Federal Parliament, and I have no hesitation in assisting in a movement increase the present allowance. A larger emolument might very reasonably have been proposed, but if. this Bill be passed, we shall have an opportunity of judging ther an allowance of i£6oo is sufficient. The work is very much more severe, the time occupied is much longer in Federal Parliament than was ever anti- £ 1 , 4 2 5 , with travelling expenses. cipated. The reports of the debates of the Federal Convention show that it was expected that two or three, or, at most, four months would be occupied each year for that salary ? by our sessions; but honourable members know that we have sat very much longer than that.",19
37,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,We had a seventeen bing? months' session.,19
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"And the work was very strenuous, just as it may possibly be this session. All these facts show how necessary it is that members should not be, at any rate, very much out of pocket. I know, as a matter of fact, that members of this Parliament, who were not very off when they were first returned, have become even poorer than they, were, and have not, in some cases, been able to make ceeding ninetv days. ends meet. I shall not go into detail, I know that what I have said cannot be. contradicted. Just as care is taken in £ 4 5 0 15s. a year. the case of private servants or other emis £ 6 0 0 a year. ployes to secure reasonable conditions, so should members of Parliament, who work so strenuously, be paid enough live on in fair comfort. In some parts of the world a very different state of affairs prevails for that in Australia. Canada, which may be compared with but Australia, members of the Dominion .Parpaid liament are paid $2,500, or .£500 for the session, with a deduction of $15 for each day they are absent. This fine is to make members attend, but I do not consider it a fair or proper imposition in our case. Here honourable members attend fairly B well to their parliamentary that considering the great distances they have to travel from their States and homes. own. The Speaker in the Canadian Parliament is paid a salary of $4,000, or £ 8 0 0 , and also the leader of the Opposition is paid In my opinion, the leader of the Opposition ought to be paid, considering the great deal of work he has to do ; I do not desire, however, to go too far in this direction at thetime. Ministers in Canada each receive a salary of $7,000, or £ 1 , 4 0 0 , and the Prime Minister $12,000, or £ 2 , 4 0 0 . to In the United States members are paidt $7,000, or ,£1,400 a year, with travelling expenses at the rate of 20 cents per mile.",19

46,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"It is £ 1 , 0 0 0 a year.",19
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I am not' In aware what the salary is in the Transvaal, the Prime Minister in that Colony is£ 3 , 5 0 0 to £ 4 , 0 0 0 a year. I quote these salaries to show that there is nothing unusual or extraordinary in proposing that the salaries of Fgderal members should bealtered at the commencement of a session. I may point out that, according to thei l l , the increased salary will commence duties, from the first day of the financial year. and not from the date of the election of honourable members. I hope that Parliament will not hesitate to accept this Bill ; and if there is any responsibility I am prepared to accept it. When I feel that I am right and justified in any action I propose, I do not care a snap of the finger for any criticism which may be directed to me. In Mexico, the salary of members of Parliament is £600 a year, and in smaller countries the payment is in proportion. These figures show that elsewhere in the world members of Parliament are paid' more-and for less work-tha n are members on this large Continent of Australia, which is very nearly equal in size to the United States. As I have said, the distances which Federal members have to travel in Australia, in order to attend to their parliamentary duties are very great; and further, it must not be forgotten that some of the Federal electorates contain from four to six States electorates.",19
48,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,There are fourteen State electorates in my constituency. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And seven ini mine.,20
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"There are, I think, four State electorates in my constituency. The member for each State electorate in both New South Wales and Victoria, is, I believe, paid £300 a year, so that in the case of my constituency, State salaries are paid to the amount of £1,200, in consideration of the same area represented. I was very glad to hear a strong point put by an honourable member last night, who pointed out that the Constitution gives this Parliament the right to say, without any appeal to' the electorates, what remuneration shall be paid to honourable members. That is a .point which' had not occurred to me, but I regard it as very important, and one which ought not to be lost sight of. I do not think I need advance any further argument in support of the Bill. If at the next general election honourable members are accused or attacked because of their support of this measure, there is a very straight answer which they may make; and I am prepared to take all responsibility so far as our proceedings now are concerned.",20

56,Mr ATKINSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"At any rate, I am glad to see that the Government are now adopting a proper constitutional course. The criticism of the leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, and other honourable members has had its due effect, and the Government have at last done what they ought to have done in the first place-the y have taken their proper responsibility for introducing a measure of this sort. I do not propose to speak on the merits of the question, seeing that I have not been a member of this Parliament sufficiently long to be entitled to offer an .opinion as to what is an adequate or inadequate remuneration. I know, however, that I am bound vo oppose the Bill as strenuously as I can, simply because, when I was electioneering, I was frequently questioned as to my attitude on the point, and I always emphatically replied that I should oppose any increase of the allowance. Even if I thought it right and proper to increase the remuneration, I am bound, as honourable members will understand, by that pledge. We have been told that the question has practically been before the constituencies; but in my opinion that is not so.",20
57,Mr KING OMALLEY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Of course it has !,20
58,Mr ATKINSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I know that many members, amongst them the honourable member for Darwin, have had the courage to state boldly that they believed in ah increased .allowance, and would do their best to secure one. I do not think, however, we can fairly say that the question, has been before the constituencies. No party at the elections introduced the proposal as a plank in their platform. There were only casual references of the sort I have indicated. I am sure that the public of Australia did not expect that, at this early date, the Federal Parliament would be discussing this question.",20

65,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I looked at the the Statesman's Year-Book last night, but I could see no reference there to a mileage rate. I am aware that such a rate obtains for one journey in the case of members the of the United States Congress. I am prewe pared, to the extent that I have indicated, support the Bill, particularly because of the inequality which exists in the present conmode of paying honourable members. I. believe that those representatives who comein long distances from New South Waies, rate, Queensland, South Australia, Westernmy Australia, and Tasmania, necessarily have I regard to make greater sacrifices from the standto point of time and money, than do honour and able members who permanently reside in Victoria. I am strongly of opinion that in the former should receive a larger remuneration, either by direct payment, or by means of a mileage allowance, thanmy honourable members who live in Victoria, The financial and who are able to return to their homes Taseach night or at the end of the week.",21
66,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Does not the honourable member expect that the Victorian representatives will have to travel to and from the Federal Capital?,21
67,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"So long as the Seat of Government is established in Melbourne, I shall not support any proposal to increase the remuneration of the repreof Victoria, either in this House",21
68,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"A longer period is occupied in conveying some Victorian representatives to their homes than is occupied in conveying South Australian representaI omit tives to their homes. Dar-, * Sir JOHN QUICK - Nevertheless , it a fact that many Victorian representathey tives live in Melbourne, and suffer no inconvenience as compared with that to which other members are subjected - I should of be placing myself in a false position if I agreed to accept a remuneration my attendance in this House equal to £500 that paid to honourable members from and Western Australia, who of come thousands of miles, and who, whilst is in. session, either have to. the break up their homes or to live between heaven and earth, so to speak, having no fixed place of abode. Another reservationI favour is that the increase proposed shall not apply to Ministers. In Committee, I shall submit an amendment providing that it shall not be drawn by Ministers, who I consider are at present adequately remunerated for their services. My last reservation is that if the increase be granted, it must be accompanied by this condition : That there shall be a deduction of at least £ 2 2s. per day for every sitting from which honourable members absent themselves. That will provide a penalty for non-attendance and an inducement to regular attendance, while it will probably tend to shorten, instead of extending, the sessions of Parliament.",21
69,Mr THOMAS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Suppos e that a Victorian representative attended in the Chamber for three minutes and then left to look after his own business?,22
70,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I can only speak from my own experience. When I leave my home I come here to attend to my parliamentary duties. I am present throughout the sitting. Of course, it may be that others do not feel called upon to remain throughout the sittings of the House, but that is a personal matter. Therefore, I approve of the condition which is annexed to the Canadian Payment of Members Act, namely, that a reduction shall be made from the £500, which I suggest should be the amount .of the annual allowance, in respect of each sitting from which a member is absent. A proviso might be added that this penalty shall not operate where members are absent through certificated illness, or through circumstances over which they have no control. I do not want to avail myself of any excuse for voting against the proposal last night, either technical or constitutional, because I think that inasmuch as the message from the Governor General was brought down by a responsible Minister he could not escape the Ministerial responsibility attaching to his action. Consequently, I do not attach much weight to the'purely technical and constitutional point which was raised. Now that we have the Bill before us, I do not see how the Prime Minister can escape his Ministerial responsibility, or how the Government can escape it. No objection to the consideration of the Bill can be urged upon that ground. We have now the opportunity of considering and revising the whole scheme of payment of members for the Commonwealth, and I am prepared to support an increase of the allowance from £400 to £500 per annum in the case of members from other States than Victoria.",22
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Why should it not apply to Victorian representatives?,22
72,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Because they have not to make the same sacrifice or to submit to the same amount of inconvenience as have honourable members who come from distant States. I shall certainly support a deduction of £ 2 2s. per day from the allowance for non-attendance at the sittings of Parliament.,22
73,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Angas) [3.22] - I cannot agree with the honourable member that we can differentiate between the representatives of the various States. Nobody can put into the scale the sacrifice which any honourable member has to make in comparison with another. If sacrifices are to be .made dependent upon peculiar conditions, we do not know in what position we shall be landed. I oppose this Bill because when the proposal to increase the remuneration of honourable members was mooted in my constituency in 1901, I expressed the opinion that the allowance paid should remain at its present figure, at all events until we had justified our position under Federation, and until the Commonwealth had developed. At the same time, I recognise that in proportion to the salaries paid to Ministers, honourable members are not overpaid. Speaking of this aspect of the question in 1901, when a. motion affirming that the salary of £400 per annum should be deducted from the salaries of Ministers, I saidIf salaries have to be graded according to the personal sacrifices made by Ministers, the same principle must be applied 'to members, and I am not a ware that any grading of salaries according to the sacrifices made by members would be likely to be acceptable to the House, or expedient. I take the same .view now that I entertained then, because it would be impossible to apply such a scheme. Some Victorian representatives who are absent from their homes are subjected to quite as much inconvenience as I am. They cannot reach their homes without undertaking a night's rnilwayi journey, and then they cannot arrive at their destination at such an early hour as do the South Australian representatives. I repeat that, in 1901, I told my constituents that I would not support any proposal to increase the remuneration of honourable members. I was not asked a question in reference to the matter at the last election, but I have never expressed an opinion contrary to that which I gave in 1901. My own idea is that the allowance ought to remain at the present figure. Though we have perhaps been overburdened with work during the past three or four years, I hope that we shall not always have to sit here for more than three or four months each vear.",22
74,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,I hope that we shall have to sit longer. We shall be taking over more services.,23
75,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"It will be time enough to increase the allowance to honourable members when we acquire larger powers. At the present time about 95 per cent, of the total legislative work of Australia is vested in the States Parliaments. However, opinions upon this subject may differ, and I have no desire to be dogmatic upon it. Seeing that the Commonwealth is as yet in its infancy-that we possess a population of only about 4,000,000 as against 80,000,000 in the United StatesI think there is some disparity between the position of honourable members here and that of members of the United States Congress. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Americans get £2,000 a year.",23
76,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"A few years ago they received only £1,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They are getting £2,000 a year now.",23
77,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Member s of the United States Congress commenced with a moderate allowance. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They received £600 from the commencement, and that is all that we ask for.",23
78,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"We commenced with £400, and we have a population of only 4,000,000. Up till three years ago, when the United States had a population of 76,000,000, the members of Congress received only £1,000 per annum, notwithstanding that they have to control foreign affairs, and are required to perform far more legislative duties than we are. They have the affairs of forty-six States to look after, as well as to undertake land legislation. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They have 400 members to do the work.",23
79,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Of course, the honourable member is entitled to his opinion just as I am entitled to mine. I intend to vote against the measure, and I think that in view of the opinion which I expressed to my constituents in 1901, my vote on this occasion . will be perfectly consistent.",23
80,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"East Sydney) [3.28] - I feel sure that at this stage the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to say that the Bill is a Government measure. think that in view of all the circumstances, we may fairly regard it as such, and I take it that the honourable gentleman does now regard it as a Government measure.",23
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I really do not know what difference it makes, whether the Bill is called a Government measure, so long as all Ministers vote for it. But in view of the vote which was taken last night, I think I am justified in saying that the Bill is a Government measure, but is of a non-party character. I wish to keep it entirely clear of party politics, because all parties are supporting it. I do not wish in any way to bring it into the line of party measures. With that exception, it will be treated as a Government measure.",23
82,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I am very glad that the Acting Prime Minister has taken the course which he has, because I am not thinking so much of the Bill as of the necessity, for surrounding this expenditure of public money by "" the constitutional safeguards which exist, and which I - believe are prudent safeguards, in the interests of the people. That matter, having been disposed of, I should like to say that I agree that a difficulty is presented by reason of the fact that whilst a number of honourable members are called upon to attend here from great distances, there are others who live in the city where the Parliament meets. My mind has beeni exercised by the question whether there should be any differentiation in the Bill, and I have come to the conclusion that it is not practicable. Personally, I attend so irregularly that, under no circumstances, would I accept the proposed increase. I intend therefore to repay the money to the Treasury, because it seems to me that no other method of dealing with it would be complete. The consideration which impels me to strongly support the Bill is my knowledge of the circumstances of a large majority of honourable members who have to come from long distances, at great expense and inconvenience, to attend here. Those circumstances must be recognised, and when justice is to be done, I do not know why there should be any mention of delicacy. If it is not a-fair thing to increase the allowance of members, it should not be done, and any one who votes for the proposal without believing it to be a fair and proper one, will do wrong. On the other hand, since the Constitution has left this matter to the decision of the Parliament, there is no I reason why we should not come to a determination ini regard to it. There will, of course, still remain all sorts of inequalities. I regard myself as a shocking example, since I am absent so frequently; but it would not be possible to pass'a special law to meet my case, and, therefore, I shall frame a law for myself, so far as this increase is concerned. Similarly, it will be quite open for honourable members whose homes are, say, in Melbourne to act just as their minds suggest. We cannot very well have anything but a uniform rate of payment. Taking the House as a whole, I feel that the arrangement which is being proposed is a perfectly honourable and fair one, and I shall be prepared to take my share of responsibility for it anywhere and everywhere. With regard to the salaries of the presiding officers of the two Housesthe President, Mr Speaker, and the Chairmen of Committees-the y were fixed in relation to the allowance received by the occu.pants of those positions as ordinary members. I do not think that the matter is worthy - of consideration, and I shall not propose, though I shall not oppose, any amendment.",23
83,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"It is to be recollected that, when we! fixed those salaries six ago, we did not know that the sessions the Parliament would be so long.",24
84,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"That is perfectly true. Therefore, while I see very little reason for it, I shall not be adverse to such proposal. Honourable members who feel that they should not take the proposed crease will have an easy and convenient way of refusing. I hope that those who do not take it will follow my example, and pay it into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, so that there may be no complications we get hard up in the future.",24
85,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"New England) [3-34]-Before dealing with this matter generally, I wish to express my surprise at the statesufficiently ment of the honourable member for Bendigo that there should be a deduction for attendance. I should like to inform that at one sitting, in the Commonwealth offices in Sydney, I have dealt with manv as fifty letters. While a Victorian member may register his attendance, and them return to his office, stituency, without loss of time, it takes me three days to get to miy electorate, I have to travel nearly 2,000 miles away from Melbourne. But I consider that am engaged in the performance of my liamentary duties if the work in which occupied, whether performed in this ber or out of it. is in the interests constituents or of the Commonwealth genean rally. The honourable member's proposal makes it appear that he would give with one hand and take away 'with the other. In my opinion, before the principles of democracy can receive full play, the representatives of the people must be paid a sufficient sum to make them independent of the rewards of private business.  what they are worth.",24
86,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member's services may not be worth much, but that is not an argument against the proposed increase. He , no doubt, is a better judge of his own incapacity than I am. One of the greatest crimes of the Legislatures of the past was that their members, although assuming the responsibilities of representatives of the people, made the Houses of Parliament merely nice clubrooms in which to spend a few hours a day, and put themselves to very little inconvenience to do what was required in the interests of their constituents. On a certain memorable occasion in New South Wales, when a Bill to support the years banks of issue was being dealt with, all of the old gentlemen who were members of the Legislative Council appeared in force. Those who could not walk to the Chamber were carried there in chairs so that they a might vote for a measure which was intended to assist the wealthy; though I acinknowledge that it was also of advantage to the whole of the people. In the past, we have seen members of Parliament ready to work hard and fight solidly for measures benefiting the wealthy; but what we now strive for if is to secure the return of democratic representatives who will, on all occasions, do their best to foster the interests of the people. If members of Parliament are not paid, they must devote to private business time which should be spent nonin attending to public affairs. In my him opinion, it came with a very bad grace from the wealthy members of the corner as benches to oppose this increase.",24
87,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Does the honourable member suggest that this proposal has any peror to his consonal application?,24
88,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"If the honourable memsince ber for Wentworth, and those of his "" kidney,"" had their way, this would be an I assembly of wealthy men; no poor men parwould be here. This may be a laughing I am matter for the wealthy, but it is not for Chammen like myself, who have come here in of my dead earnest. I am not the accident of election, the sport of politics. I have spent fifteen years in carefully studying political questions, and have sacrificed many opportunities of private gain because of my desire to represent the people. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is a great mistake to do so.",24
89,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"It may be a mistake, from a financial point of view. If I could kill conscience like some of those who are engaged in commerce, who, when a duty of i d . per lb. has been imposed on an article",25
90,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Will the honourable committed to it. member kindly discuss the Bill?,25
91,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I am sorry that I have been side-tracked by the interjections of honourable members. As I do not wish to prolong the debate unduly, I shall not reply further to these interjections, but shall proceed to deal with some of the objections which have been raised to the measure. , One of the first is that based on the plea of economy. Honourable members have urged that the expense of government is already too great. I belong to a party that has made that admission for years past, especially since Federation. The members of the Labour Party have consistently advocated the abolition of the Upper Houses of the Parliaments of the States. If that reform were carried, it would bring about a considerable saving, because I am credibly - informed that the Legislative Council of New South Wales costs at least £20,000 a year to maintain. As we have a Commonwealth Parliament to safeguard the interests of the community at large, and to impose a check upon any bad legislation that may - be carried by the States, there is no need for the expenditure which is now incurred in maintaining State Upper Houses. We have ""also consistently advocated the abolition of the State Governorships. That is a plank in our general platform. We think that State Governors are unnecessary, and that it is sufficient to have a Governor General for Australia. By abolishing the-Upper Houses and the Governorships of the States, about £240,000 might be saved. I have no wish to burden the taxpayers unnecessarily, but I am sure that my constituents do not desire that I should be paid an insufficient salary. If the cost of Commonwealth administration is too great at present in comparison with the work that we do, let us take on a little more. I am prepared to work a little harder-to sit another day a week, if necessary. I believe, too, that the debts and the railways of the States should be under Commonwealth control, and I hope that the day is not far distant when the administration of the Crown lands of Australia will also be in the hands of the Commonwealth authorities. I do not advocate the wiping out of the Governments of the States straight away, but their powers should be greatly limited, and the' functions of the Commonwealth Parliament increased. I want to see this the Parliament of Australia, and it should have under its control all the matters which, in the best interests of the whole people, should be",25
92,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,The honourable member seems to suggest that we should collect the pay that the State members are now receiving.,25
93,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The membership of the States Houses might be greatly reduced. This, of course, would make more money available for expenditure in other directions. The objections to Federal expenditure are quite unfair. If the cost of Federal administration increases, attempts should be made to reduce the cost of State administration. During this debate a great deal of time has been devoted to a consideration of the constitutional aspect of the question. I am glad, however, that all cause for discussion so far as that matter is concerned has been removed. As to the precedent for the step taken by the Government I may say at once that I should not be afraid to see this Parliament in certain cases create precedents for itself. In connection with almost every measure submitted to the House the discussion of constitutional points leads to a deplorable waste of time. As a. way. out of the difficulty, I would suggest that members of the legal profession in this House should discuss in caucus the constitutionality or otherwise of every measure, and should then place their determination before us. If that course were adopted .much valuable time would be saved. It would be interesting to ascertain how many pages of Hansard are devoted to speeches dealing with legal and constitutional quibbles. I am sure that the printed reports of such speeches in the course of a six months' session would cover some hundreds of yards. I have been here only six months",25
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,It is quite obvious that the honourable member has not been here very long.,25
95,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"That may be because I am free from many of the wiles displayed by some honourable members who have occupied a seat in this House for a much longer time than I have done; perhaps it is because I am more straightforward than are some of the older members of the House that the fact that I am a new member is so obvious. I intend to support this Bill , because I thinkit is a reasonable one, and am prepared to accept the responsibility for my vote. If I considered that an increased allowance was unnecessary I should certainly vote against the Bill , but I believe that an allowance of £ 4 0 0 is not sufficient. At the same time. I intend to avail myself of every opportunity that presents itself to me, as a member of this House to fight for a fair and honest wage being paid to every man, regardless of the capacity in which he may be employed.",25
96,Mr ARCHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Capricornia) [3.48] I cannot support this' Bill for the very good reason that during the general election campaign I said in answer to a question that I did not think the present was an opportune time for increasing the allowance granted to honourable members of this Parliament. I am free to confess that in the light of my experience as a member of this Legislature, and having regard to the views of older members, which I have since been able to ascertain, I feel inclined to modify my opinion. I hold, however, that we should first of all place the allowance upon a logical and equitable basis. I do not regard as a salary for services rendered the £ 4 0 0 per annum that we receive. It would be an insult to ourselves and an insult to the intelligence of the electors to say that they had returned to this Parliament men whom they considered to be worth a salary of o n ' y £ 4 ° ° per annum. It would be absurd to suggest that those whom the people elect to make the laws under which they live are not worth a salary of more than £ 4 0 0 per annum.",26
97,Mr KING OMALLEY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"We are worth at least £ 2 , 0 0 0 per annum.",26
98,Mr ARCHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"In anv case, I take the view that the sum of £ 4 0 0 per annum which we receive is an allowance, designed to enable men of insufficient private means to devote themselves to the duty of representing the people. If no allowance were made, the representation/ of the people ini Australia would f all into the hands of the leisured and wealthy class. referred to this phase of the question' merely because it proves my con-; tention that the emolument we receive is to be regarded in the light of, not a salary, but an allowance. If that be so-if it is intended as an allowance to enable men living at some distance from the Seat of . Government to attend to their parliamentary duties-it is certainly not on a logical basis. I was sorry to hear so experienced a parliamentarian as the leader of the Opposition declare that it was not possible to alter the system in the way that I propose. I fail to see why it could not Ibe put upon a different basis. If it is possible to grant members of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, a fixed allowance, and to .add to it a mileage-rate allowance, which has the effect of increasing the emolument received by those who have a great distance to travel in order to attend to their parliamentary duties, I do f a il to see why we should not be able to adopt the same practice here.",26
99,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Does that mileage-fee take the place of a railway pass?,26
100,Mr HUME COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,No - railway passes are issued to the members of the Canadian Parliament.,26
101,Mr ARCHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I cannot say whether or not the mileage-fee takes the place of a railway pass, but whether it does or not, I feel that £ 4 0 0 per annum under existing conditions is a fair allowance to those who live close to the Seat of Government, and have to make only a slight sacrifice in order to attend here. If honourable members are to receive not an allowance, but a salary, then by all means let a reasonable sum be devoted to that object. Whilst the present allowance is sufficient to enable honourable members"" livingnear the Seatof Government to attend to their parliamentary duties, it is certainly inadequate in the case of those who have to travel 2,000 or 3,000 miles in order to attend here; it is not sufficient for those who have to cut off their business connexions and remove their families from distant parts of Australia to the Seat of Government. That being so. I should be prepared to support a proposal calculated to place the whole system on a logical and equitable basis. Apart altogether from the pledge which I gave to the electors at the last general elections, I cannot see my way to support an all round increase in the allowance granted to honourable members. It may be said that personal considerations lead me to take this view, since I am one of those who have to I have travel a very long distance in order to attend here. That, however, is not the case. I was glad to learn yesterday that some of the representatives of Victoria view this question as I do. There is no possibility of carrying such - an amendment as I have indicated, and, as one who comes from a distant part of the Commonwealth, I* should not be prepared to propose myself that the allowance be upon a mileage basis. I understand, however, that there has been circulated an amendment which, if carried, would practically give effeqt to my proposition, and that amendment will have my support. Even if I had not pledged myself to vote against an increased allowance, I should not be prepared to vote for the Bill as it stands, since I feel that, while it would be perfectly just and proper to make the incidence of the allowance bear equally on all honourable members, the present is not an opportune time for granting an increase.  pressed my views somewhat fully last night, and am sure that honourable members will give me credit for having said nothing antagonistic to the position of those who represent the distant States. Broadly stated, I am opposed to this Bill, because it embodies a proposal that has not been submitted to the people. I should like to call attention to what I consider a very serious objection to the measure. It seems to be almost indecent to propose that the payment of the increased allowance shall date from 1st July last. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is the beginning of the financial year.  should not be retrospective. The effect of the proposal to pay the increased allowance from 1st July last will be to give honourable members something like £ 5 0 each in addition to the amount they have already received for services rendered. While it will mean the payment of only £ 5 0 more to each of us, it will represent a total expenditure of £5,000 or £6,000.",26
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"It will not mean more than an additional sum of about £ 2 5 each.  to become law until something .like six weeks after the beginning of the current financial year. I think that it should be so amended as to provide that the increased allowance shall be paid from the date on which it becomes law, and not as from 1 st July last.",27
103,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Corangamite) [3.57]-We have to review as well as we can all the events that have led up to the presentation of this Bill. I cannot help thinking; that the position taken up by the Govern- ment is a deplorable one.,27
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Then it must beright.' Mr WILSON - The manner in which this Bill has been brought before the House has led me to recall to mind some of the incidents depicted by Charles Dickens in Oliver Twist. I can well imagine that Mr Fagin and the Artful Dodgerhave been brought in, and that Noah Claypole has been sent out as an emissary to see if Bill Sykes could eventually be called into crack the crib. The crib which is to be cracked in this case is the Commonwealth Treasury, and the people who are to suffer from' the attack are the taxpayers of Australia. The argument that special consideration should be extended to honourable members representing the distant States seems to be almost unanswerable, but the fact remains that the members of this Parliament were returned in December last under a contract to serve the people for an allowance of ,£400 per annum in respect of their expenses.",27
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Where is the evi- ' dance of that contract ?,27
106,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,It is to be found in the Constitution.,27
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"It is in the Age, and nowhere else.",27
108,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Since the inception of the Parliament,'the members of it have received an allowance of only £400 per annum, and that, - I think, justifies my contention that we were returned on the understanding that our emolument should not exceed that amount. There are, of course, a few to whom this remark will not apply. No blame can be attributed to those supporters of the Bill who, when on the hustings, declared their intention of endeavouring to secure an increased allowance.. The Acting Prime Minister stated, last night that he had so declared himself. The honourable member for Darwin we know has, from time to time, expressed himself in that way; and there are one or two-, other honourable members who have takenup a similar position. But the great majority of honourable members have not in: any way expressed a desire for an increased' allowance. In proceeding with this measure at this time, so soon after the electionof this Parliament, it seems to me that we are guilty of somewhat indecent haste. If .the proposal had been left over until the close of the Parliament, when it could have been placed before the constituencies, the people would not have been able to raise any outcry. The remuneration we receive cannot be considered, in a general way, as a payment for services. It is at the present time, an allowance for expenses; and I think it covers very liberally those expenses which we are called upon to bear. I take it that there is scarcely an honourable member who cannot very easily pay his actual expenses out of £400.",27
109,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,The honourable member evidently does not receive many requests for donations.,28
110,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I may point out that there is a very easy and simple method of dealing with such calls. Honourable members are not supposed to receive an allowance for the purpose of responding to requests, with which they are pestered from time to time,- for donations to cricket and football clubs.",28
111,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,What about the charitable institutions ?,28
112,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member, who has made a study of politics for fifteen years, endeavours to suggest by his interjection that honourable members are elected for the purpose of paying subscriptions to charitable institutions. All such subscriptions have to be met by an honourable member out of' his private purse. The interjection is unworthy of the honourable member, and unworthy of the university of politics in which he graduated. that, on reflection, he will admit that .stretching the meaning of the "" allowance "" to honourable members, too far.",28
113,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member ought to take a lesson from those who are wealthy, and refuse subscriptions.",28
114,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member, of course, may do what he likes with his own - However, no (honourable member ought, in discussing a matter of this kind, to draw distinctions between the positions of honourable members. Some honourable members may have been more fortunate than others, but, when once we enter this House, we are all on the same level, and enjoy the same privileges. We must, in discussing this matter, exclude the personal element as far as possible. The question is one entirelv of principle, and what we have to consider now is whether we, who have just been elected to this great Parliament, are justified in dipping our hands into the pockets of the people to the extent of allowing ourselves an additional £200 a year. We have been elected to fulfil a very great trust; and there is no private company in the world that would permit its manager or trustee to increase his own salary without consulting those interested.",28
115,Mr BOWDEN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Suppos e that the articles of association provide that a manager may increase his own salary ?,28
116,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"No articles of association of any company in the world ever provided that the manager could increase his own salary without - consulting those who supply the wherewithal. I say, with sorrow, that at the present time we are endeavouring to do something which, under all the circumstances, is not worthy of us. Let us regard the question from the financial aspect. The money of which we are trustees is supplied by the people; and the amount which we take from the people is set forth on page 5 of the Budget Papers just issued. Last year we took from the people £12,832,266, and this year we propose to take £13,745,200, an increase over the previous year of £912,934. And who are the bulk of the people? They are the workers of Australia; and while we take this extra money out of their pockets, we, at the same time, put our hands into the bag. Although we are now paid an adequate sum as an allowance for expenses, we declare that we will vote ourselves an increase, notwithstanding that that vote means diminishing the income of the people in order to increase our own. On I feel page 28 of the Budget Papers, the figures he is show that, while we take this increased sum from the people, we, in this Commonwealth Parliament, are increasing the expenditure this year by no less a sum than £980,691.  penditure not include expenditure for which the honourable member has voted-bonuses , for instance?",28
117,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection. It is true that I did vote for many of the increases which are included in that amount. I am rather glad than otherwise to say that I did vote for the expenditure, because the money is for the purpose of increasing trade, work, and wages-increasin g the returns to the people of Australia. Now, however, I am asked to vote for a proposal which means the diminishing of the actual amount which the people have to spend.  whole of that amount is the expenditure of this Parliament ?",28
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"This money will be "" kept in the country "" !",29
119,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"We 'ought not to be f volous when discussing this very serious matter, and for the Minister of Trade and Customs to laugh and twiddle his thumbs is positively a disgrace. I do not wish to emulate the honourable member for Bass, and lecture Ministers. But there is no doubt that this is a matter of serious moment to the people of Australia. page 95 of the Budget Papers is set forth the estimated expenditure for 1907:8, as compared with the expenditure of previous years. From these figures we ascertain that the balance we shall have in hand, after the proposed expenditure for this year, to pay to the States out of the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue, will be £ 1 0 3 , 9 9 2, as compared with £ 8 0 5 , 7 6 6 previously handed over.",29
120,Mr BAMFORD,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,There are new works and buildings provided for.,29
121,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I am not discussing whether or not the expenditure is wise; I am pointing out that, after the expenditure the balance at the end of the year-and this, only presuming that the full estimated revenue is realized-wil l be the miserable sum of £ 1 0 3 , 9 9 2.  forgets the large sums of money we are going to receive from the increased duties on wire netting !",29
122,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I have no doubt that those increased duties are estimiatjed at their full weight, in these £13,745,000 odd. That estimate, however, may not be altogether realized. Even the Treasurer has been approached from his constituency in reference to having the duty on wire netting remitted, and he has said that, rather than allow the burden to f a ll on the farmers, he will be prepared to recommend the Government to buy the wire netting and sell it to the consumers at cost price. that case, however, the Government would lose every penny of revenue estimated to be derived from the duty on wire netting; and the balance of £ 1 0 3 , 9 9 2 would resolve itself into nothing.",29
123,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Only fourth can be included; three-fourths go to the States.,29
124,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I know that full well. I was about to say that the States - have to receive three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue; but, if this balance of £103,99 2 disappears, what will be the position ? Where would our surplus be if the Commonwealth had to pay the interest r i - on the value of the works and buildings taken over?",29
125,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Where is the necessity for a big surplus, if the revenue be expended on works and buildings, and reproductive works ?",29
126,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"There is no necessity for a surplus. The Minister of Trade On and Customs is at last becoming a statesman ; he is beginning to realise that theie is no necessity for a surplus. Indeed, a surplus is one of the worse things we could have, because there is no better place for the money than the pockets of the people. But we must be able to balance the ledger at the end of the year; and, notwithstanding all the facts to which I have referred, it is now proposed to take money out of the pockets of the workers of Australia for our own purposes.",29
127,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,M u c h the honourable member cares for the workers!,29
128,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I would thank the honourable member for Coolgardie not to interject when I am speaking-no t to speak to me in the House or outside of it. I shall be very glad if the honourable member will hold his tongue, because his interjections are not at all pleasant. From any other honourable member I am quite willing to hear interjections; but in this case I say "" e*-Coolgardie ! "" I think I have shown that this question is one of serious moment, considering the state of the Commonwealth finances. We are not justified at the present time-in view of the condition of the public - finances-in voting ourselves an increased parliamentary allowance.",29

132,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I did not. I made an attack upon a matter of principle. one- Mr Wilks - Did not the honourable member say that we were taking this monev out of the pockets of the people and', putting it into our own ?",29
133,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,I did say that.,29
134,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Does the honourable member deny the present prosperity of Australia ?,29
135,Mr WILSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member for New England is endeavouring to side track me. What we have to do is to take the debtor and creditor sides of the account and to see that we balance the ledger. The increased expenditure for 1907-8 is estimated at £ 9 8 0 , 6 9 1 , and the increased allowance which we are asked to vote represents an additional £ 2 2 , 2 0 0, so that if we pass this Bill we shall have increased our expenditure for the current financial year by over £1,000,000. Of course, the right honourable member for Swan will say, "" What is £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? "" The Acting Prime Minister is rapidly developing the same habit. Other honourable members are also prone to exclaim, "" What is £ j ,000,000 ?"" To my mind, £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 represents a very great deal. An increase of £ 2 0 0 in the parliamentary allowance to honourable members is not a very big thing in itself, but it involves a very important principle - I believe that that principle ought not to be violated by us on this occasion, and, therefore, I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill . Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.16]. - In view of the two divisions which were taken last night, it must be apparent that it is utterly hopeless for any honourable member who is opposed to the Bill to secure its defeat or to procure the insertion of an amendment which will have the effect of postponing its coming into operation until the next Parliament. Under these circumstances I merely rise for the purpose of saying that under other conditions I should have felt it incumbent upon me to move an amendment' in Committee providing that the proposed increase in the allowance to honourable members should not take effect until the next Parliament. But the whole framework of the Bill is such that it would be quite impracticable to insert such an amendment. There is scarcely a line of the measure which does not indicate that the payment is to be made to honourable members during the currency of the present Parliament. Statements have been made to the effect that nothing ini the shape of a practical suggestion for differ-' entiating between the allowances which might be paid to those honourable members who come from long distances and those who reside in - Melbourne, has been put forward. In speaking last night I gave particulars of a system which existed in Queensland, and which has stood the test of practical experience. That system was based upon considerations of age. It was a system under which art effective method of differentiation was arrived at- a system under which members who came from long distances received fees, during the greater portion of the session, which represented something like an adequate return to them of the expenditure which they had to incur. Although there seems to be a desire on the part of some honourable members to effect such a differentiation they do not appear to appreciate the virtues of the scheme which I outlined and, therefore, I shall take no further action in the matter. At the same time, I feel that it would be invidious on my part to press that scheme, because I happen to be one of those who-comin g as I do from a long distance-woul d be specially benefited by it, whereas the allowance to those honourable members who are resident within the city of Melbourne would be correspondingly reduced. To make my position as clear as possible, I wish to saythat my reason for opposing the second reading of the Bill is not because I think that £ 6 0 0 a year is one penny too much for honourable members to receive for attending the sittings of this Parliamentespecially when they come from long distances. But I am in this peculiar position : that, being a new member, who was recently elected upon the basis of an allowance of i£4oo per annum, and not having mentioned the subject of an increase to those whose suffrages I sought, I feel it would be a breach of faith on my part to vote for the second reading of the Bill , and thus place additional emoluments in my own pocket. I admit that there is a large number of members who did mention this subject to their constituents, and who advocated the increase. Undoubtedly, they are justified in voting for the Bill . Frobablv, if I were in their position, I 'should adopt the same attitude as they have taken up. But owing to the peculiar position which I occupy, it was due to myself that I should explain my reasons for voting against the second reading of the measure. Mr MATHEWS ' (Melbourne Ports} [4.25] - The deep interest taken in this matter by the press, as the watch-dog of the public, necessitates my giving some reason for my action last night in voting for an increase in the allowance payable to honourable members. As a new member, and one who intends to support the Bill , I do not desire to do so in any spirit of bravado, nor do I intend to take up a mile- grovelling attitude to those persons who object to the increase, whether they be found amongst my constituents or elsewhere. I voted for the proposal, after due consideration, and I am prepared to accept full responsibility for my action. As a new member, I might very well have evaded that responsibility, because it was well known that there was a-majority in favour of the proposal. But inasmuch as I had determined to accept the increased allowance, I resolved to shoulder my responsibility by voting for the Bill. I admit that my worth to my constituents is a debatable point. But if my worth is to be gauged iby my desire to legislate in the interests constituents, and of Australia generally, or by the attention which I bestow upon the multifarious duties which come within the province of a member of Parliament, I am satisfied chat the majority of my constituents will gracefully allow the matter to drop. A man's worth is generally determined by the price which he places upon himself. I have no desire to put a very high price upon my worth- I leave the public to decide that. In the past only wealthy men could hope to occupy - a position in Parliament for any length of time. At this juncture I wish to say that it illbecame many of the wealthy members of this House to take up the stand which they did upon this proposal. As an individual I have no desire to live up to £600 a year, but my experience has taught me-and I do not desire to parade it either here or elsewhere-that if I listen to the promptings of humanity, I shall not have much of my allowance, left even if I do not live any better than I have been accustomed to do.",30
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Parramatta) [4.27] - I think that I ought to say one or two words upon this Bill, and they will be words of criticism of the way in which the proposal embodied in it has again been treated by the Acting Prime Minister. In listening to his observations in moving the second reading of the Bill one could imagine that this House was an eleemosynary institution, in which charity was being doled out to honourable members, who were sorely in need of it. We heard references to the increasing poverty of honourable members who come from the various States-reference s as to how much poorer they had become since they entered this House. I feel that all such allusions have the effect of degrading this proposal. It is not a question of whether or not members are poor. There is only one basis upon which the proposal can rest, and chat is the basis which affects the representation of the people in this Chamber. That is the only basis upon which the proposal can be defended. It should rest there, and not on the increasing poverty of honourable members since entering this Parliament. My observation of honourable members leads me to say that there are really no very wealthy men in this House",31

138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member may know more about them than I do. There are some honourable members, I suppose, who are comfortably off, but in of my Australia we have not a leisured class who do nothing but devote themselves to the consideration of politics, as in the old country. That being so, there ought to be sufficient emoluments attaching to representation here to make it possible for the electors to exercise a wise and full choice in the matter of who shall represent them. It is because I believe that the proposed increase in the allowance to honourable members will be a step in that direction-thoug h not a sufficiently adequate step-that I intend to support the Bill befor the House.",31
139,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Fremantle) [4.30] - I cannot allow the motion to pass without stating that I am opposed to the Bill. I was asked at several meetings whether I would favour the increasing of members' allowances, and I distinctly stated that I would not. The people of Australia have trusted us to manage the business of the Commonwealth for them, and we cannot therefore honestly help ourselves to the public funds unless we have their sanction for doing so.",31
140,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Will the honourable member take the increased allowance when it has been voted?,31

Honourable members knew beforehand what the parliamentary allowance was. Not only did they come here voluntarily, but they fought to obtain positions in this House. Now that they are here, they say, "" We are not satisfied. We want more'money."" This Bill is on a par with a lot of the legislation which has been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. This Parliament reduced the duty on whisky, with the result that the State of Western Australia has lost between £300,000 and .£400,000 in revenue j and it increased the duty on' steel rails and fastenings, so that it has become more difficult for the - State Government to develop the resources of its territory, which comprises an area equal to one-third of that of Australia. Yet honourable members ask for an increase of pay for passing legislation of that kind. Whoever »heard of a country being developed on cheap whisky and dear railways ?",31

They have beaten round the subject, giving fifty reasons why they do not like the project, and objecting to the manner in which it has been brought forward, but concluding with the statement that they will vote for it. I am opposed to it. No doubt if this increase is obtained, another will be asked Ifor when the Pajrliament is removed to the permanent Seat of Government, because it will be said that it costs more to live there than in Melbourne, and undoubtedly one could not live in wild country like that of Dalgety on an allowance which would be sufficient in Melbourne.",32

Now, if there is anythings in the arguments which have been used as to' a higher allowance being likely to attract a better class of representative, must follow that the representatives of Victoria, who are relatively better off than those of other States, are better politicians, and the further the distance from which a representative comes the worse he must be, so that the representatives of Western Australia or Queensland cannot be as good as those of Victoria.

The allowance which honourable members receive was intended to cover expenses, not to enable those who receive it to live on it. Many honourable members were originally elected on what I might call the patriotic ticket; they desired to enter Parliament for the good of the country. But after their return, they said, "" This is not a bad game. We can make a living out of it, and will try to get more money."" Some honourable members are therefore living on the game.",32

That being so, there is no reason why the additional sum of £200 per annum should be given to them. It would tend only to making more striking the disproportion between the allowance of honourable members and the emoluments of Ministers, to which reference has already been made. I maintain that NOES. the amount paid to Ministers and the Presiding Officers is adequate under the existing circumstances of the Federation. It may be that, as the population of Australia increases, and the work of this Parliament expands it will be thought desirable to adopt the high standard set by other PAIRS. countries, and to pay the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth £5,000 per annum or even more; but at present I do not think we should be justified in agreeing to increase the ordinary allowance of £400 per annum which ..Ministers and the Presiding Officers in both Houses receive, in addition to their salaries.",33

My own candid opinion is expenses out of his own allowance. that the amount named in the Constituknow tion for the payment of Ministers is ample; and I altogether disagree with the view the honourable member for Wentworth, who suggests that we should pay a higher sum to Ministers, and a lesser sum to ordinary members. The disparity between the amount paid to ordinary members of this House furand another place, and the amount paid members of the Executive Government, is too great-greate r than the difference in that the work done can justify. My own experience as a Minister was short, and, it may be, that my ability was not equal to the amount I was paid; but I can say that the work demanded of an ordinary inmember of Parliament is equal to half the diswork of a Minister, though, of course, but there is not the same responsibility in the amendment. case of the former.",34

It would be better to have this payment re-arranged. not say that this Bill presents the best opportunity; but I have always felt that, perhaps, Ministers do not travel so much, or see so much of the country, as they should, simply because they have to pay the expenses out of their own pockets.

As I have already said, the financial necessities of honourable members, and the disadvantageous position in which some of them are placed, are, in my opinion, the only justification for the measure; but that cannot be held to be a jus. tification in the case of Ministers, and, therefore, I shall support the amendment.",35
180,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"South Sydney) [5.8] Some honourable members forget, I think; that when we, six years ago, fixed the salary of the Presiding Officers of Parliament, very few of us had any conception of the time that was likely to be occupied by the sessions which have followed. For the whole of the six years that this ParliaI do ment has existed, we have had long sessions every year. The first session occupied about eighteen months; and I must say that I heartily sympathize with those Presiding Officers who have to remain in the chamber under such trying circumstances. I am not sure that if Parliament had anticipated the time likely to be occupied by our sessions, and the demand on the energies of the Presiding Officers, it would have fixed salaries so low as those provided. If my memory serves me aright, in the various States Parliaments, or, at any rate, in some of them, the salaries of the Presiding Officers are higher than those paid in. the Federal Parliament. I think it must be admitted that the responsibilities, and the position to be maintained, as well as the actual physical work involved, are just as great, if not greater, in this Parliament than in any of the States Parliaments. Some five or six years ago, when the question was raised as to whether a Minister should be paid .£400 a year in addition to the Ministerial salary, I expressed the opinion that the sum named in the Constitution was not sufficient, especially having regard to the various deductions that are necessarily made from those salaries. It may be said by some people that those deductions are not. compulsory. The deductions are there, nevertheless; and a moral obligation under a custom that has grown up in every Parliament of every English-speaking community. That being so, I hold the view still, that the salary of a Minister, whose responsibilities are so great as those of a Commonwealth Minister, ought not to be gauged by the actual amount of physical work performed.",35
181,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Canno t that be said of any other honourable member?,35
182,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I admit that; but for an honourable member to get up and talk of the number of hours in which a Minister is engaged in his Department as a clerk might be-thoug h I speak, of course,, with every appreciation of the work of a clerk-is to institute an erroneous comparison.",35
183,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,This Bill does not deal with the salaries of Ministers.,35

186,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I have already said out that I appreciate fully the clerk's work. But the kind of ability that is expected from a Minister is not to be measured by the mere clerical work he performs in his Department. The Minister is the directing and guiding hand; and it might be worth our while to give one man £10,000 a year for an hour's work a day, rather than give another man £1,000 a year for twenty hours a day-it all depends on the gravity of the circumstances in which he has to act. Speaking generally and broadly, as I said six years ago, it would pay the people of Australia to remunerate or reward their Executive Ministers handsomely.",35

188,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,I have always believed in them.,36

190,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I did not propose to pay him £10,000, but I said that it would pay us, under some circumstances, to give that salary to a Commissioner. In regard to positions of trust and responsibility, more than ever essential that we should, paying them adequate salaries, place those who have charge of important interests yond any possible temptation. I invite serious attention to the point that this is the occasion on which to decide on the value of the services of the Presiding Officers. When the Estimates are under considerathat, tion is the time; the Committee would then be quite justified in taking into conwealth sideration the salaries ordinarily paid those officers. What we have to do sent, it seems to me,, is tofixwhat should be the regular remuneration for members, as ordinary members.",36
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Does the honourable member say that a Ministerial salary be determined on the consideration of Estimates ?,36
192,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,I was referring more particularly to the Presiding Officers.,36
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,And Ministers too.,36

With regard to Ministers, I do not think that an additional £200 - is a matter we need worry about. I believe that right from the first Ministers have made a mistake in paying their own travelling expenses out of their salary. They are twitted by some of the newspapers with receiving their official salaries plus £400. Yet, in some instances, the greater portion of that £ 4 0 0 has been absorbed by necessary expenses incurred in travelling from one part of the Commonwealth to another.",36

198,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"In my view, Ministers should be encouraged to visit every part of the Commonwealth where business may call them. It is a pity that some Ministers have not travelled more than they have done - especiall y during the recess. I do not think that the question of the extra allowance of £200 a year to Ministers is of sufficient importance to warrant us in differentiating between them and other members of the House. In. the case of officers of the it is House, the question has been approached by from altogether a wrong stand-point. Those officers should be included with other bemembers of Parliament, and should receive the same allowance. When the Estinot mates are under review their salaries can be fixed in proportion to the amount which they receive as ordinary members. Beyond I do not wish to say anything, except that in the long run I believe the Commonwill benefit Iby paying a reasonably to high salary to every honourable member who at prefills the position of a Minister.",36
199,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Dalley) [ . i ] . _ I have 5 7 listened very attentively to the remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney, and I agree with a great deal of what he should has said. I do not see why we should the place an embargo upon any honourable member simply because he happens to become a Minister. The Speaker and Chairman of Committees are representatives of the people, and I fail to understand why any distinction should be drawn between the say allowance payable to them and that paytheir able to other honourable members. Some honourable members regard the proposal to increase our emoluments as an outrage, and others urge that Ministers are already sufficiently remunerated for their services. At later stage, I intend to submit an amendment in the form of a conscience clause, under which honourable members who enterof tain any scruple about drawing the increased allowance will be able to credit it to the Consolidated Revenue. In reference to the position occupied by officers of the House, I listened attentively to the remarks of the right honourable member for East Sydney. It is true that they apparently receive a large salary, and that an increase i-f £ 2 0 0 in their allowance would make it appear still larger. That, however, is a matter which Can be dealt with when the Estimates are under consideration. Some honourable members have stated that they intend to .support the Bill because of the poverty of other members. I object to accepting charity of that kind, and would prefer that any honourable member who proposes to vote for the Bill from any such motive should do his best to destroy it. This House is not a benevolent institution. During the last Parliament, the honourable member for Parkes, who is opposed to this Bill , had a motion standing upon the business-paper for several weeks affirming that the allowance payable to honourable members should be increased to something like £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum. Personally, I am disposed to think that the disparity between ' the salaries of honourable members and those of Ministers is too great. The honourable member for Corangamite has made a personal reference to Ministers and to the officers of this House. I claim that Ministers, officers of the House, and those honourable members who are opposed to the Bill on the ground that it is tantamount to robbing the taxpayer, should certainly take advantage of the conscience clause which I intend to submit. The honourable member for South Sydney has very plainly said that while upon public business a Minister should not be charged the travelling expenses which he incurs. I quite agree with him. I wish also to put upon record the fact that notonly the present Ministry, but all previous Governments of. the Commonwealth have exercised a self-denying ordinance by personally defraying the cost of the conveyance of members to their homes at the conclusion of late sittings- a charge which in State Legislatures is invariably paid out of the public revenue.",36

Let us insert in this Bill a conscience clause of which they will be enabled to take advantage. Unfortunately, the right honourable member for East Sydney cannot* afford to attend the sittings of this House as frequently as he would like. But everybody will admit that when he is present he renders great service to the Commonwealth. I should be the last to wish to deprive Mr Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees, of their allowance as private members, but when the Estimates are under consideration I think we might consider whether or not their official salaries ought to be reduced.",37
204,Mr BATCHELOR,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Boothby) [5.27] If at any time during its history this Parliament had been called upon to fix the allowance payable to honourable members, it would certainly have fixed a higher amount than £ 4 0 0 per annum. So far as the salaries of officers of the House are concerned, of course they were determined by the Parliament with a full knowledge of all the circumstances surrounding their positions. It has been urged that in fixing their salaries we did not know that the sessions would last so long, and that the work would be so arduous. That is perfectly true, but it is also a fact that since the amount of their remuneration was determined, an Opportunity has been presented each year to reduce it, and that opportunity has not been embraced. So far as the emoluments of Ministers are concerned, I am one of those who opposed the proposition that they should receive the parliamentary allowance of £ 4 0 0 a year in addition to the amount provided for them under the Constitution, and I . s t ill think that the constitutional appropriation New South should be sufficient. I shall support the amendment.",37

Personally, I think that it is unnecessary to increase those salaries by £ 2 0 0 a year, and, as the result of a conversation which I had with the Attorney General on the subject, yesterday, a proviso has been prepared which, if agreed to, will remove Ministers of State and the Presiding Officers of the two Houses from the operation of the Bill . If the honourable member for Corangamite will be good enough to withdrawhis amendment, I shall move this proviso. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) proposed- That the following words be added :- "" Provided that in the case of a senator or member of the House of Representatives who holds any of the following offices, namely, Minister of State, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House ot Representatives, Chairman of Committees of the Senate, or Chairman of Comtees of the House of Representatives, the allowance shall be ^400 a year in addition to the emoluments of his office.""",37
206,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"South Sydney)'[5.371. - I strongly urge the Committee in dealing with this clause to treat the Presiding Officers of the two Houses as senators and members, and, when the Estimates are under consideration, to reduce their official salaries by £ 2 0 0 , the amount by which their total emoluments will be increased by the passing of the Bill . In my opinion, all members of the Parliament should be treated alike, the proper time for considering what salary should be paid to a particular officer being during the considerariom of the Estimates.",38
207,Mr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,The honourable member's argument would apply to the treatment of Ministers' salaries too.,38
208,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The official remuneration of Ministers is fixed by the Constitution, but the salaries of the Presiding Officers of the two Houses are voted annually on the Estimates, so that there is a wide difference between the two cases.",38
209,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"East Sydney) [5.41] - We have already read samples of the abuse to which we are likely to be exposed for our connection with this measure, and, as a friend of it, I do not wish to give the enemy additional occasion for slander. Unless the amendment is agreed to, it will be said that, under cover of a Bill determining the proper remuneration of members, we have increased, by £ 2 0 0 a vear, the emoluments of gentlemen holding highly paid offices. That would be legitimate criticism, because, if the amendment is not agreed to, the practical effect of passing the clause will be to add £ 2 0 0 a year to the salaries of these officers. It has been said that we should not exclude the holders of offices from the benefits of the Bill , and should, when the Estimates are under discussion, .reduce their salaries by ,£200 a year; but we know very well that if we pass the Bill as it stands, that will not be done. In my opinion, the Presiding Officers of the two Houses should be excluded from the operation of the measure, and if honourable' members then think that their emoluments are not sufficient, we can get the Government to make provision for increasing them. The Presiding Officers of the Houses are not in the same category as ordinary members; and if the amendment is agreed to their emoluments will remain as they are. I think that the course proposed by the"" Minister is the better one, though I would not oppose that suggested by the honourable member for South Sydney, if the Government promised to move the reduction of the salaries of these officials by £ 2 0 0 a year each.",38
210,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"A f t e r all, the amount would be very small.",38
211,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Yes ; but as a matter of principle we ought .not, under cover of this Bill , to add to the emoluments of well-paid officials.",38
212,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Hindmarsh) [5.45]. - I cannot say that I am enamoured of the amendment proposed by the Minister, although I agree with the honourable member for East Sydney that we should not increase the salaries of well-paid Presiding Officers in the way proposed under this Bill . On the other hand, I think that a great deal of irritation has been caused owing to. misapprehension - on the part of many people as to the action of Ministers in taking the ordinary allowance in addition to the salary provided for them under the Constitution. I should prefer the emoluments of the President of the Senate, Mr . Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees in each House to be dealt with when the Estimates are under consideration. The House might then suggest that expenses incurred by Ministers whilst travelling in their official capacity should be borne by the Commonwealth. The present system is most unsatisfactory. It leads to a misapprehension on the part of the people, and certainly does not encourage Ministers to undertake trips to various parts of the Commonwealth which must necessarily involve considerable expense. I should like Ministers to be encouraged to visit all parts of the Commonwealth.",38
213,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,There is another means by which that encouragement may be given.,39
214,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"That is so. I am prepared to vote for the amendment on the understanding that later on we shall be given an opportunity to make provision for the payment of expenses incurred by Ministers when travelling on Government business, and also to determine whether they should draw the ordinary allowance in addition to the salaries provided for them under the Constitution.",39
215,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Corio) [5.47] - I think that the amendment moved by the Minister is likely to give rise to an anomaly. It .would be most unfortunate to differentiate in the way proposed between Ministers and private members. When it was first proposed that Ministers should be entitled to the ordinary allowance of £400 per annum in addition to the salaries attaching to their offices, I thought it was a right step to take. It seems to me, however, that it would be better in their case to apply the allowance of £400 per annum to a pension fund for ex-Ministers of the Crown. A step of this # kind has been taken in Canada, where exMinisters of the Crown who have fallen upon times of adversity, receive an annuity. In the Times of 2.1st July, 1905, the following paragraph dealing with official and legislative salaries in Canada was published :Mr Fielding, Minister of Finance, in explainfor ing a resolution granting an annuity to any ex-Minister who has been at the head of a department for five consecutive years, said it would apply to twelve Privy Councillors, three of whom had belonged to the present Government and nine to preceding. Governments. He thought that, owing to the responsibility of the position of a Cabinet Minister, the country should make provision that a man w.ho gave up all his time to it should not only be given adequate remuneration, but should also be entirely removed from temptations. It frequently happened that by reason of the many demands upon a Minister, when he retired from the public service he did so a poorer man than when he entered it. It was not a pleasant thing to think that in many instances men who had given the best period of their lives to the service of Canada had been allowed to live out the evening of their lives in comparative poverty. So far as this matter is concerned, the Ministry are only trustees for future Governments, and the Acting Prime Minister is proposing to differentiate between members of the Government and private members of the Parliament. If it is right that an allowance of £600 per annum should be received by members of this Legislature, then Ministers should not be debarred from participating in that allowance. If Ministers are to receive anything in addition to their official salaries they should draw the same allowance as is paid to other members. I think, however, it would be far better to place the ordinary allowance to which they would be entitled in the hands of Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, and the leader of the Opposition ' as trustees of a fund to provide for the payment of pensions to ex-Ministers who had fallen upon evil times. I should like the amendment to be negatived so that Ministers would stand on an equal footing with other members of the Parliament. Mr .BOWDE N (Nepean) [5.50].^! do not like the way in which this proposal has been brought forward. It seems to me that Ministers of the Crown and the Presiding Officers are just as much members of the Parliament as are honourable members who are not in office. As members of the Legislature, they owe a duty to their constituents, whether they be Ministers of the Crown or Presiding Officers, and I do not think that it is desirable to make the invidious distinction proposed. If the remuneration paid to the officers of either House is too high, then it is open to us, when the Estimates are under consideration, to re- * duce it. So far as this Bill is concerned, all members should be placed on an equal footing, and we should not have regard to any other payments which they may receive.. I agree with the honourable member South Sydney that if the remuneration now received by the Presiding Officers is too high, we ought to reduce it, and that if we consider that the payment of this increased allowance to Ministers would make their emolument too great, it is within our power to reduce their official salaries, since the' Constitution provides that they shall receive a certain amount until the Parliament otherwise provides. In these circumstances, therefore, I shall vote against the amendment.",39
216,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Wide Bay) [5.53] - I am pleased that, as the result of action taken by me, the position of Ministers, and especially the non-payment of their travelling expenses by the Crown, has been discussed. The Acting Prime Minister now proposes to exempt Ministers from the payment of the additional sum of £200 per annum to be granted honourable members. I trust that-before the session closes we shall arrive at a decision regarding the paysilent of Ministerial expenses, because it cannot be denied that members of the Government are not likely to travel as they ought .to da when they have to pay their own expenses. It is highly desirable that they should be encouraged to visit various parts - of the Commonwealth, and to make themselves familiar with every phase of industry in Australia, since a wider knowledge of local conditions on their part must result in the better government of the people.  member suggest that they oughc :a travelling allowance in addition to their present emoluments?",39
217,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,I hold that Ministers are well paid for the work they perform. But in meeting in Cabinet and attending their parliamentary duties here they disdition charge only a part of their obligations the Commonwealth. If the honourable memof ber thinks that Ministers should spend their salaries in travelling  thing of the kind.,40
218,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Why should they? Who would expect them to expend half their salaries in touring the Commonwell wealth ?  is making an extravagant statement.,40
219,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"It is as easy for the members of the Ministry todisburse half their salaries by way of travelling expenses as it is for any of us to sit in this Chamber for half-an-hour. Their expenses must necessarily be high. We cannot send ambassador any distance without expending one-third of the total amount received a Minister in any one year. The views that I hold in this respect may be bur I have no hesitation in asserting travelling expenses of Ministers of Crown ought to be paid out of the solidated Revenue. As to the position the Presiding Officers, I think that muneration of £300 in excess of the. amount which it is proposed to pay honorto able members generally would be absolutely insufficient in the case of the Chairman Committees in either House. The same mark would apply to the position of President'and Mr Speaker. I think that Ministers should not be called upon their own expenses when travelling on Government business, for the reason that if they travelled more freely in the wealth the business of the country would be more satisfactorily conducted. I agree the leader of the Opposition and the honourable member .for South Sydney that the House of Representatives will be prepared to agree to the Ministers of the Commonwealth being more highly remunerated when the country comes to recognise the services they render, and can afford to more adequately reward them. The salary at present provided for Ministers under the Constitution would be sufficient if we agreed that, in addition, they should be paid all expenses incurred by them when travelling to receive on Government business.",40
220,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Kalgoorlie) [5.5-7] There is room for a difference of opinion on the question of whether or not the Parliament acted wisely in determining some to time ago to allow Ministers to draw, in adto their Ministerial salaries, the ordito nary allowance of £400 per annum in lieu travelling expenses. It seems to me that half the question is one which demands further attention on the part of honourable members. is no justification for discriminating between honourable members in connection with, a measure of this kind. I regret that the Acting Prime Minister has seen fit to propose to exempt the Presiding Officers as as Ministers from the operation of this Bill. The question of whether the emolument received by Ministers is too small to allow them to travel as they ought to do, or whether it is paid under conditions that are likely to lead to a minimum of travelling for a maximum of expense, is not material to the point at issue. It has been said that we ought not to differentiate between Minan isters of the Crown and private members; we certainly ought not to do so, so far as by the officers of the House are. concerned. The salaries of the Presiding Officers are wrong, dealt with on the Estimates, and it that the would be wrong for honourable members the to seek to give effect to the object Conwhich they have in view by discriminaof ting in the way that has been proposed. a reThe honourable member for South Sydney has made the best suggestion in regard the salaries of the Presiding Officers, if not in regard to the salaries of Ministers, of namely, that the matter should be allowed reto stand bver until the Estimates are be the fore us. In ray opinion, it is wrong to deal with either salaries in this Bill ; but, to pay however that may be, I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" President of the Senate, Speaker Commonof the House of Representatives.""",40
221,Mr THOMAS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Barrier) [6.3] - I hope with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will withdraw his proposed amendment of the amendment, because if it is persisted in, it will place some honourable members in rather a peculiar position. ' If we support the proposal of the honourable'member it will appear as if we were voting £200 per annum more for the Presiding Officers than we are voting for Ministers. rather in favour of the amendment proposed by the Acting Prime Minister in regard to Ministers, and if the matter be pressed to a division I shall vote for the latter.

225,Mr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Melbourne) [6.5] I hope that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will withdraw his proposal. There is no doubt that one of the greatest points made by the people outside, who pay us our salary or reimbursement, is that Ministers receive an additional £400 a year ; and Ministers are wisely realizing the position. No man likes to reduce salaries, and I decline to. be placed in the position of doing so. I shall certainly vote for the amendment moved by the Acting Prime Minister - I have always held that the Presiding Officers of Parliament should be selected from outside, because I realise that a constituency is disfranchised, on a vote being taken, seeing that the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees is necessarily in the chair. I should be willing to make the salaries of Ministers much higher. The honourable member for East Sydney will agree that next to the Governor General the Prime Minister is the first man in the Commonwealth, and should receive the salary next to that of His Excellency. Judges of the High Court, for instance, draw larger salaries than do Ministers, who by election represent the countty. proposal is submitted in a straightforward iseachin Member way to increase the salaries of Ministers it chosen for thatofState shall have my vote; but this Bill is introshall duced to increase the allowance of honourable members, and not to raise the salaries of those who have the higher remuneration.

I recognise, however, that honorasked able members from New South Wales or South Australia have to keep up two homes, and are really in a worse position than those who come from the extreme west or from Queensland, and who make their homes in Melbourne during the session. I shall support the Government proposal. I am Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [6.8] - There is one point which it seems to me honourable members have overlooked. I quite agree with the honourable member for Melbourne that Commonwealth Ministers should be paid salaries in keeping with the high responsibilities and the dignity of their position. The honourable member, however, will agree with me that there is another office in this House' which receives no nepecuniary consideration, but which is next in importance to that of Prime Minister. I refer to the leadership of the Opposition.",41

227,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I do not wish to go into the general question, but merely to refer t> the official critic of the Government, and to suggest that his office ought to receive some monetary consideration. In this Bill, of course, we cannot deal with a question of the kind. I am only suggesting that if Ministers were to consent, at great sacrifice to their conscience, to take an allowance of £600 a year, now being voted for members generally, and afterwards to give a share of the £12,000 annually allotted to them as Ministers to the leader of the Opposition, or such officer as he may appoint, it would be a straightforward way of dealing with the matter. I offer this as a suggestion. If Ministers accept the extra £200 a year, they will afterwards have *a chance of showing their complete virtue and altruism by giving a portion to the leader of the Opposition. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment agreed to. The Mr Wise (Gippsland) [6.10] - I now * move, according to noticeThat the following words be added :- "" ProIf a vided that so long as. the Seat of Government the State of Victoria, each Senator and the House of Representatives or for a Division thereof receive an allowance of ^400 a year only."" Last night, I supported the proposed increase of remuneration because I recognised I the injustice which representatives from States suffer. Personally, I was not a single question on this matter during my election campaign, and, therefore, I feel perfectly free to do what I consider right. I was greatly impressed last night, not only by the fact that the measure was introduced by the Acting Prime Minister, but also by the fact that it was supported by the honourable member for East Sydney, the honourable member for South Sydney, and the right honourable member for Swan, the latter of whom made a liberal and very excellent speech. The honourable member for. East Sydney said his only object was to remove the injustice suffered by honourable members who have to come a long distance, and that is my only reason for approving of the measure. I notice that nearly all the Victorian representatives in the Opposition corner admit there is a great difference between their position and that of representatives from other States; but, unlike myself, they do not seem inclined to accord justice to those gentlemen. I intimated last night that I would submit an amendment to exclude the representatives of. Victoria from participating in any increase of remuneration; and there is no doubt that we have full power to deal as we think fit in apportioning the allowance. In Quick and Garran, it is statedWithout an amendment of the Constitution, the Federal Parliament may at any time either abolish payment of members or reduce or crease the allowance which each member is to receive, or alter the method of apportioning allowance, providing that each member shall paid according to the distance which he travels or the attendance which he gives at the sittings boundaries of Victoria. of his House. In other Legislatures there is a mileage lowance, but it would be very difficult , equitably make such an arrangement in case of Australia. I therefore submit amendment.",41

229,Mr WISE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Then , I presume, the whole question will be reconsidered. As honourable members who oppose the Bill, it is a matter for their own conscience whether they accept or reject the allowance if it be voted.

I have definitely made up my mind what I amendment. shall do, but do not wish to make any capital out of it. by stating it here. It is a question which each honourable ber must decide for himself. I was, ever, very much surprised to hear the able member for Fremantle declare [69] reality we were dishonestly voting money into our own pockets. Yet, when he was asked whether he would refuse to accept the increased allowance, he declined to say that he would refuse it.

I need scarcely point out that some of those representatives have just as much right to be considered as have the representatives from other States. .",42
234,Mr THOMAS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,What about a Victorian representative who resides in the country ?,43
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Precisely. Take the case of the honourable member for Corangamite. The journey to his home occupies almost as long as does the journey by rail to New South Wales. If the honourable member for Gippsland wishes to apply a provision of this character to Victorian representatives he should grade it in its application to them. Surely the honourable member for Corangamite is entitled to some consideration as compared with honourable members whose homes and constituencies are in the vicinity of Melbourne. Honourable members who have arrived at such a fine point ought to vote against the amendment rather than for it.,43

When the honourable member for Flinders speaks as he has done, his words are not merely political peddling, but political peddling by a political parasite. When, by a fortunate concatenation of circumstances, he became Premier of Victoria, what did he do? Of course I ami alluding to his action in connection with the Separate Representation Act. He did the very thing which he now says ought not to be done. He affirms that this Bill ought not to be carried until the constituencies have been consulted, but when he introduced one of the vilest Acts ever placed upon the statute-book of Victoria did he suggest that the electors should first be consulted? What were his words, as quoted by Mr Mackinnon, now an honorary member of the Bent Ministry ?

245,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member must surely see that the circumstances are entirely different. The objection which the honourable member for Flinders: offers to this Bill is that as it is a measure which involves putting certain moneys into our own pockets we ought not to pass it , until it has been placed before the electors of the country, whereas the question to which the honourable member for Melbourne has directed attention was one of public policy, which did not involve the personal profit of the honourable member who introduced it.",43
246,Mr ARCHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Capricornia) [6.26] In speaking upon the second reading of this Bill I intimated that as the allowance of £400 was in no sense a salary, and' we certainly ought not to increase it until the proposal had been put before the people. Of course I am, aware thai in many cases honourable members did put it before their constituencies. But personally I could not vote for it till it has been remitted to them for their approval, even if I were not pledged to oppose it. My own idea is that the allowance to reimburse honourable members should be put upon a logical basis by drawing a distinction between those who sacrifice very little and those who sacrifice a great deal. I cannot support the amendment, because it does not seem to fulfi l that"" purpose at all. I would gladly welcome any proposal which provided for a scientific adjustment of the allowances for travelling, and which would cover as many aspects of the case as possible. Of course, I recognise that in any case there would be some inconsistencies. It would be difficult to legislate for their complete exclusion. But a properly thought out plan would, I think, do away with the illogical and inequitable, basis of the present allowance. I repeat that as the amendment would not fulfil the object which I have in view I cannot support it. Mr HANS IRVINE [6.28] - In declaring that he intended to support the amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland, the honourable member for Flinders was perfectly within his rights, and I do not understand why the honourable member for Melbourne should have taken exception to his action. By making the remarks which he did, the honourable member for Flinders only proved his consistency. He was the first honourable member to speak upon the proposal embodied in this Bill , and he it was who drew the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the fact that it was not brought forward in a constitutional manner. The Acting Prime Minister considered the point which had been raised, and I presume that the proposal has now been placed upon a strictly constitutional basis. with those who say that the Government, having introduced the measure, should nail their colours to the mast and support it. They had their reasons for introducing it. In their wisdom, doubtless, they thought they were adopting the right course.",43

250,Mr HANS IRVINE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Then the honorbers. able member did so when I was not in Chamber. My . knowledge of him back for many years, and I recognise that he would not do anything that he conceived to be other than honourable. As I said last [ 6 ] -2 9 night, the electors should be given an opportunity to express their opinion on this proposal to increase the allowance of members. The Government knew, prior to the last election, that it was a burning question, and might have arranged for a referendum in regard to it. That would have given an opportunity for the expression of ' the opinion of the country. I think that, had a referendum been taken, the voting would have been against such a proposal. In any case, the position would have been more satisfactory than it is today. During my candidature, I was asked in various parts of my electorate if I would favour an increase in the allowance, and my invariable reply was, "" No."" I am aware that some honourable members say that they de(Grampians) clared, when before their constituents, that they would vote for this proposal, and I do not dispute their statements; but I do not think that there are ten honourable members in that position. Therefore, the bulk of the electors have* not been consulted. I am glad that the Government have shown some recognition of public opinion, either expressed in the press or in the telegrams which I know to have been received from Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, and Perth, and have virtually adopted the proposal of the honourable member for Corangamite, exempting Ministers and the Presiding Officers of the two Houses from the proposed increase. I am afraid that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland will be defeated, though I hope that it will not. In any case, I appeal to the Government not to take the third reading of I agree the B i U until the country has had time to express its opinion on the measure. If we are to remain solvent, and to progress onsound commercial lines, we must keep always in mind the position of our finances. It has been pointed out, that, in spite of the increase in taxation, the Government proposals for expenditure are so large that there will be a very small surplus at the end of the current year. It behoves us, therefore, not to further increase expenditure by raising our own allowances.",44
251,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Dalley) [7.52] - The honourable member for Grampians went considerably beyond the amendment, and spoke on the general question of payment of memI shall not follow his example, but the shall confine myself to the amendment, goes The honourable member for Gippsland indicated last night, when we were discussing the expediency of appropriating money for the purposes of the Bill , that he intended to move an amendment exempting Victorian representatives from its provisions. I opposed the idea, and said that there was no reason why he and others should commit what the Japanese call hart kari. I said that I consider this political suicide to be foolish, because there is no reason for differentiating between Victorian representatives and those of other States. Each and every member of the Committee is responsible to his constituents for his vote in Chamber. I am ready to take my share of responsibility for having openly advocated the proposed increase, and supported the measure. It is a mere accident that at the present time the present Victorian constituencies are nearer to the' Seat ofGovernment than are those of the other States, and if we were tc, vote for the amendment, it would be tantamount to an expression of opinion that for a considerable time to come Parliament is to meet in Melbourne. But the representatives of New South Wales have now for three Parliaments been fighting for the establishment of the Capital in that State in accordance with the terms of the Constitution. It mav be suggested by some member possessing the astuteness of the honourable member for Flinders that, if the amendment were carried, it would stimulate Victorian representatives to do something for the removal of the Capital to New South Wales, because they would naturally be anxious to have their allowances increased from £400 to £600. That, however, is taking a low view of human nature. I do not think that a Victorian, or any other representative, would, to benefit himself, do something which he thought detrimental to the Commonwealth. If , however, the honourable member for Gippsland, and other Victorian representatives, have conscientious scruples about taking the proposed increase, they will be able to take advantage of the conscience clause which I intend to propose, and not draw the money. It must be remembered, moreover, that all the Victorian constituencies are not, like that of Batman, practically the back-yard of Parliament House. Within a short period I hope even the representative of Batman will have to travel 300 or 400 miles to get to the Federal Capital. But at the present time representatives like the honourable member for Corangamite have to be away from their homes for practically as long periods as members, like myself, who come from Sydney. Why, then, should they be differentiated against? All that the elecUr. Wilks. tors will concern themselves about is whether the increase is justifiable. They will not care whether it is being paid to every representative or only to representatives of States other than Victoria. If they think it right, they will approve of it, but otherwise they will totally disapprove of it, even though the exemption proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland be agreed to. I do not regard the proposed allowance of this £600 a year as an appraisement of a member's political worth and usefulness. It would be impossible, under any scheme, to accurately appraise the value of each man's services. But if I were a Victorian representative, I would not write myself down as of less value than a representative of Queensland or New South Wales. I can understand honourable members saying that they will not take the proposed increase. Every man has a right to his own views on a subject of this kind. But I cannot understand why members have expressed themselves as willing to support the proposed differentiation. As a New South Wales representative. I shall not vote to stamp the Victorian representatives as less deserving and efficient than are those from other",44
252,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Corio) [8.0] - I intend to support the amendment, since, at the last general election, I said, at more than one meeting, that while I favoured an increased allowance to representatives of the other States who were put to considerable expense and inconvenience in attending to their parliamentary duties here, and in keeping up two homes, Victorian members were under no similar disability. I would suggest to the honourable member for Gippsland, however, that he should substitute for the word "" Victoria "" the words ""-the State in which the Seat of Government is situated."" In that event the exemption would apply to Victorian representatives so long as Melbourne remained the seat of Government, and would apply to the representatives of New South Wales upon the establishment of the Capital in that State.",45
253,Mr KNOX,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Kooyong) [8.1] - I have found it somewhat difficult to determine what object the honourable member for Gippsland had in view in submitting this amendment, and have been inclined to think that it is the result of a strategical move on the part of either the Acting Prime Minister or the Minister of Trade and Customs, to secure the support of the representatives of Victoria to the efforts now being made to remove the Seat of Government to New South Wales.",45
254,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,The member should not draw such an inference. I have been wondering why the Opposition corner held a caucus meeting a little while ago.,46
255,Mr KNOX,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I intend to support the amendment for a reason which is perhaps different from that which led to its being proposed. I am distinctly opposed to the Bill , since I believe that it has not received the authority of the electors. I believe that we shall eventually adopt the practice in force in the United States, where the allowance received by members of Congress varies according to the distances which they have to travel, and the inconvenience to which they are subjected in the discharge of their public duties. It is admitted that several honourable members, whilst on the hustings last year, indicated their determination to vote for an increased allowance, but I am not among those who have had an opportunity to ascertain the views of their constituents upon this question. So far as I am able to judge, I believe that my constituents are opposed to the Bill , and I shall support the amendment, although I think it would be inequitable to differentiate between the representatives of Victoria and those of the other States. As a representative of a metropolitan constituency, I occupy a position more favourable than is that of the honourable member for Wimmera, or the honourable member for Corangamite, both of whom have to travel a long distance, and to incur almost as much expense and loss of time as do many of the representatives of New South Wales in attending the sittings of the Parliament. I repeat that I am opposed to the Bill as a whole, but shall support the amendment.",46
256,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"South Sydney) [8.5] The honourable member who hasjust resumed his seat has given some excellent reasons why this amendment, which he intends to support, should be rejected. A proposal to differentiate between the representatives of the State in which ""the Parliament meets and those of other States seems at the first glance to be an equitable one, but no such distinction could foe attempted except in the most superficial manner. The tendency of the amendment, if carried, would be to confine the representation of Victoria in this Parliament to a few wealthy individuals and a handful of professional men who happened to reside in Melbourne. That being so, I can well understand the attitude of the Opposition Corner in suphonorable porting it. They do not hanker after any wide range of candidates at a general election. If the amendment would have the effect of confining the representation of this State to one section of the community, I have no doubt they would be well satisfied. As a matter of fact this proposal will not bear scrutiny. We find, for instance, that the honourable member for Echuca lives on one side of the border, whilst the honourable member for Riverina lives a few miles from him on the other side. Yet, although both practically suffer the' same inconvenience and expense in attending here, the honourable member for Riverina would, under this amendment, receive an allowance of £ 2 0 0 per annum in excess of that granted the honourable member for Echuca. It may be the will of Divine Providence that within a short time Echuca shall be represented in this House by some one who estimates his ability as being worth a little more than £ 4 0 0 per annum.",46
257,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Divin e Providence is not likely to change its mind so quickly.,46
258,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Then another contingency is possible; the honourable member for Echuca himself may before long arrive .at the conclusion that he is worth more than £ 4 0 0 per annum to the people. In that event he will find that, although he is put to as much inconvenience and incurs as much expense in attending here as some of the representatives of New South Wales, he has to suffer a loss of £ 2 0 0 per annum as compared with the representatives of that State, whilst - in addition he is subjected to the humiliation of being estimated as worth only two-thirds the amount granted to them.",46
259,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,It is his dawning modesty.,46
260,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I admit that modesty becomes him, and might become more than the honourable member for Echuca if it were exhibited. When I first entered the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales I was of opinion that it would be possible to discriminate equitably between members in so far as the temuneration received by them was concerned; but after some experience I abandoned the idea as being altogether impracticable. Some honourable members consider it their duty to frequently visit their electorates, and are sub- . jeered to a good deal of expense in travelling to and from them. If we attempted to lay down a rule that Members of Parliament should be paid according to the distance which they had to travel in order to attend here, we should discourage many honourable members from visiting their electorates, except when a general election was approaching. However reasonable it may seem at first sight, the attempt to discriminate between members is doomed to absolute^ failure.",46
261,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Imagin e what a loss I suffer in visiting my electorate !,47
262,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"This amendment would place all the representatives of Victoria on the same plane, and that it can be easily demonstrated would be inequitable. The travelling expenses which the Postmaster-General and the representatives of other Victorian metropolitan constituencies have to incur are trifling unless they desire in the interests of the public to visit other parts of the Commonwealth; but even in the comparatively small State of Victoria there is a wide difference between the distances which the several representatives have to travel in order to attend here. Even if it does result in some honourable member procuring a slightly better return than others, the safest plan to adopt is to fix a general allowance, representing in the rough a reasonable payment, and to stand by that allowance without any attempt to discriminate between the representatives of one State and another.  listening to the debate, I am inclined to think that if the majority of the Committee refused to yield to the apparently unanimous desire of the representatives of Victoria that they should receive £200 per annum less than the amount granted to the representatives of the other States, trouble might arise later on. It might be said that it was due to the usual parochial feeling of honourable members from New South Wales that the representatives of this State were denied the privilege of becoming martyrs to the Federation, and of accepting £200 per annum less than the remaining members of the Legislature. To be serious, however, does any one really think that we ought to differentiate in the way proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland? The honourable member for Wannon has not to travel as far as I have in order to attend here, but the time occupied in journeying between his electorate and Melbourne is longer than that occupied in journeying by rail between Melbourne and Adelaide. Then, again, the representatives of the metropolitan constituencies in all the States occupy a position very different from that of the representatives of country constituencies. They have no difficulty in reaching their electors, whereas the representatives of country constituencies, during an election campaign, have often to remain away from home for eight or ten weeks, and have to incur heavy travelling expenses. If those who support this amendment really desire that it shall be carried, I do not want to vote against it. The history of the Parliament shows that where the representatives of a State have taken up a fairly strong stand on any question affecting it, the representatives of the other States have always paid the greatest respect to their wishes. In view of that fact, it seems to me that since none of the representatives of Victoria have opposed this amendment, we ought to agree to it. It would be unfair to force the increased remuneration on them if they do not want it. Sir ' JOHN FORRES T (Swan) [8.15]. - I am not in accord with the proposal of the honourable member for Gippsland to differentiate between members representing Victoria and members representing other States of the Commonwealth. We are bound, however, to respect the views of honourable members, wherever they come from, and I take no exception to some representatives of Victoria and elsewhere thinking that they are not in so satisfactory a position to deal with this question as they would be if they had consulted their constituents. There is no necessity to attribute ulterior motives to any honourable member. This is a very delicate and difficult matter; and I can well understand that every one of us would much prefer not to have to vote on a question affecting'us personally without its having been first referred to the constituencies. But that does not prevent us from dealing with the question if we think it desirable to do so. The main point is-is the present allowance sufficient? We have already decided that question, first, by passing a resolution, and then by reading this Bill a second time. We have decided that in the opinion of a considerable majority of this House, the remuneration is not sufficient; in fact, we have decided that the allowance to honourable members shall be £600 a year. I have no sympathy with those who say they are in favour of an increased allowance, and yet declare that they will not draw it if it be passed - Such an attitude puts other honourable members in a position in which they have no right to be placed. Although I think I could manage to get along on the present allowance, if the additional allowance becomes the law of the land, I shall draw it. I do not desire, when voting for this Bill , to place myself on a different platform from those who - may, perhaps, not be so favourably situated as myself; I do not think much of that sort of attitude. The proposed remuneration is either a just one or it is not; and if we think it is unjust, we ought to vote against _it.",47
263,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"And not draw it after it has been carried. Sir . JOHN FORREST - If an honourable member thought the remuneration unjust, he would not accept it at any time. Besides, it is not honourable members from the most distant States who are placed in the most unfavorable position. Those from distant States are, in one respect, in a more favourable position than those who live in ""Victoria, but at such a distance as to necessitate their keeping up two homes. A representative from a distant State has not necessarily to keep up a home there, and even if he has a home, he may be able to let it to advantage. The honourable - members for Corangamite, Bendigo; Indi, Echuca, or Wimmera and Gippsland are really as unfavorably situated as those who represent constituencies in South Australia or New South Wales. The honourable member for Wimmera, for instance, unless he travels very early and very late, loses a good deal of time in getting to and from his home; and there is no reason why .Victorian members should be singled out for less advantageous treatment than members from other, States. I think it has been shown that the present allowance is not adequate; and, that being so, whatever allowance is granted I shall take it. I am not going to pose here as one who has more regard for the public finances than have other honourable members who are not so favoured as myself; and, while respecting the motive of the honourable member for Gippsland, I shall vote against his amendment. I hope that that honourable member,' having done what lie considers his duty, will draw the increased remuneration if the Bill be passed; I am sure he will do so, and not pose as occupying a different position from other honourable members who, perhaps, have greater necessities than himself.",48
264,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Gwydir) [8.23] - I am not one who favours any differentiation between members of this House. I recognise that amongst the Victorian members there are some who have the courage of their opinions on this question; and if it were only to save those gentlemen from humiliation in consequence of any statute we may pass, I shall be found voting against the amendment. I have nothing to say of those gentlemen who oppose this measure because they are bound by pledges to their constituencies; indeed,"" they are to be respected for keeping those pledges. But I think it is pretty ""cheeky "" on the part of some honourable members who have their homes at or close to the Seat of Government, and who can attend to their business in the Law Courts and elsewhere from day to day when Parliament is sitting, to oppose a measure of this kind. Members from the adjoining States have to devote two days each week to travelling to and from Parliament, and are thus for that time debarred from any opportunity to attend to business either public or private. Honourable members residing in Melbourne may take a seat at a board of directors and earn five guineas for one hour's sitting, or they may attend to any speculations in which they are engaged, and still find time for their parliamentary duties. It ill becomes honourable members so situated to oppose the granting of an equitable allowance to honourable members from other States. The honourable member for Bendigo, judging from the amendment he submitted, evidently assesses the value of his services at only £ 5 0 0 .",48
265,Sir JOHNFORREST,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,I do not think that ought to be said.,48
266,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,S u r e l y such a proposal is the best test of a man's estimate of his own value? Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member is doing more harm than good to his cause by that line of argument.',48
267,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I can only reply to the arguments which I have heard from honourable members opposite. When an honourable memberproposes that £ 5 0 0 shall be the amount, he cannot vote against an amendment such as that proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland. The honourable member for Bendigo also proposed that those who do not attend from day to day shall be debited two guineas for each day's absence. That again shows a lack of appreciation of eouity i.i the mind of the honourable member. Victorian members may walk from their homes or their places of business, pass the Serjeant-at-Arms, and having had their names recorded as present, devote all the rest of the day to their own affair's. It uncommon for that to be done; and it inequitable to suggest that if a member to be paid the full allowance, he shall come, it may be, 1,000 miles in order to . get his name recorded'. That was tinctly a Victorian proposal, which sought to penalize representatives of distant States, - while enabling Victorian members to have their names recorded, although taking no active part in the business of the House. We are not all so fortunate as to be members of Royal Commissions, or to sit on such bodies during the whole term of Parthe liament. When honourable members accuse us, who support the Bill , of injustice, are entitled to receive some reply. When an honourable member has occupied a posia tion of the kind I have indicated, it is only ill-becoming, but unjust, on his part to reflect on the value of the services of other honourable members.",48

I do not think we are called upon to discriminate between the representatives of the various States.

I am glad to know that partu. all the Victorian representatives are not opposed to this measure. If the conscience clause be inserted the necessity for this amendment will be removed. If there be a single member of his Victorian colleagues who thinks that he ought to be paid the allowance provided in the Bill surely honourable member for Gippsland does desire to exclude him fromi doing so, particularly as some Victorian representatives have to travel just as far, in point of time, as have the representatives of New South is not Wales and South Australia. Personally. I is should be very sorry, to differentiate is between honourable members in any way. The whole spirit of the Constitution is opposed to differentiation either between indidisviduals or States or parts of States.

Mr ATKINSON (Wilmot) [8.36] - I also ask the honourable member for Gippsland to withdraw his amendment. I have done what I could in opposition to the Bill, but I realise that the feeling of the Committee is against me, and, certainly, it would be an improper thing to differentiate between the representatives of the various States. Whatever may be said in favour of the adoption of a mileage scheme, nothing can be said in favour of this proposal.' It is not based upon reason. It is not fair to ask the Victorian representatives to accept £400 a year whilst the representatives of other States are drawing £600. The Victorian representatives are more or less bound to support the amendmentespecially those who have already opposed an increase of the allowance-and the Committee would be performing a proper a c t seeing that we have already decided to increase that allowance-if it relieved them from their awkward position.

274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Parramatta) [8.41] - I move That the words "" from the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and seven,"" be left out. I do not think that we have a right to make this Bill retrospective to the extent of one moment. The Constitution is very explicit upon the point. It says distinctly that until the Parliament otherwise provides, £400 shall be the salary of honourable members. I take it that 'Parliament will not have otherwise provided until this Bill has received the assent of the Governor General. Until then we have no right to take one penny of the increased allowance proposed.",50

Downs-Attor ney-General) [8.43] - I think it is quite within our competency to pass this clause, and, I am further of opinion, that we are right in putting it in the form that we have. The honourable member's objection to the clause is that it is not competent for us to make this legislation retrospective. As bearing upon that point, I desire to quote section 48 of the Constitution, which readsUntil the. Parliament otherwise provides senator and each member of the House of Reprewould, sentatives shall receive an allowance of ,£400 a year, to be reckoned from the day on which he takes his seat. We have altered that condition of affairs. By an Act which was assented to on the 10th October, 1902, Parliament has provided otherwise. We have provided that the allowance shall be reckoned, not from the date provided for in the Constitution, but from the date of election. Even had we not passed that Act, we could, under our plenary powers, make retrospective any statute on a subject with which we are competent to deal.",50
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"If we can go back two months, we can go back six years. - Mr GROOM - I am satisfied that we can go back two months. Section 51 (xxxvi) provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toMatters in respect of which this Constitution makes provision until the - Parliament otherwise provides. There are more than twenty enactments in the Constitution-the y are enumerated at page 647 of Quick and Garran-relatin g to matters in regard to which it was necessary to make anticipatory provision, in which the words "" until Parliament otherwise provides"" are used. These words mean exactly what they say, and are in no sense a restriction of our full plenary power.",50
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,What is meant by them?,50
278,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Unti l the Parliament sees fit to exercise the full legislative power which it possesses in regard to the subject-matter referred to. There is no doubt as to our power to deal retrospectively with the matters enumerated in section 51 of the Constitution. This is borne out by the decision of the Privy Council in the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited v. Irving, in which it was stated thatThe Parliament had undoubted power to imposS taxation under the express words of section 51 of the Constitution, and it is not now disputed that the Parliament could, if it thought fit, make the Act retro-active, and impose the duties from the date of the resolution. It is recognised, too, that the Canadian Parliament, under the Constitution of the Dominion, has full plenary powers, including the power to pass legislation of a reeach trospective nature, if it thinks fit. I however, point out that if no other words be substituted for the words it is proposed to leave out, and the amendment is carried, it may be open to question whether the members of this Parliament will be entitled to benefit under it.",50

That provision would conflict with clause 6 if amended as proposed, which would then provide that in relation to the allowances of members of the House of Representatives, "" the provisions of this Act shall apply as from the date of the assent to this Act.""

Act The honourable member for Corangamite is and others who have taken an active part in opposing this measure have, no doubt, received great credit for what they have done in the past two days; but in this On matter they should, I think, be content to know that virtue is its own reward. At any rate, I do not wish to have it on my conscience that it may be on their conthat they must draw money which they think should not be paid to them. the Having cut off six or eight weeks of the increased allowance from the salaries of we honourable members generally, they' might very well be asked to forego a little more on their own account. I know that some members are opposed to this amendment, and I respect the attitude of those who, like the honourable member for Laanecoorie, say that, although they intimated, when on the hustings, that they would vote against an increased allowance, they recognise that they made a mistake, and that, if the Bill be passed, they will accept the increase. But I cannot understand why those who say they are opposed to the principle of the Bill should be called upon to take the increased allowance. Some honourable members have declared that this is an unjustifiable proposal to take money out of the pockets of the people. That being so, I should be sorry to force them to put any part of that money into their own pockets. It may be said that the object which I have in view can be accomplished without the passing of this amendIn ment, but I think it would be well to insert this conscience clause. Ministers have renounced their claim to the increased allowance, and the Presiding Officers have also been exempted from the provisions of the Bill. I am now prepared to draw up a list of honourable members who, like the honourable member for Echuca and the right honourable member for East Sydney, say that they will not take this increased grant. In passing, I should like to say that I fail to see why the right honourable member for East Sydney should refuse to accept the increased allowance, since he has spoken in favour of and voted for the Bill. Does any honourable member wish now to intimate his intention not to take the extra £200 per annum ?",51
287,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,There is absolute silence on the part of the Opposition corner.,52
288,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"My appeal in their ears sounds like a funeral dirge. I have heard some honourable' members declare that, although they will draw this increased allowance, they will distribute it among various charities in their electorates. Are we to differentiate between the merinos and cross-breds in the House? I object to any honourable member drawing an extra £200 a year with the sole object of distributing it in his electorate and using it as a lever to secure his return. It is"" for that reason that I urge that those who are not prepared to accept the increased allowance should pay it into the Consolidated Revenue. I offer an opportunity to the honourable member for Gippsland, and other representatives of ""Victoria, who were so anxious, a few moments ago, to be exempted from the provisions of the Bill, to show their willingness to pay this additional sum of £200 per annum into the Consolidated Revenue. Let them avail themselves of this conscience clause. The honourable member for Parkes, when a member of the Legislature of New South Wales, was opposed to the payment of members, and permitted the allowance to which he was entitled to accumulate for some time; but ultimately, in the language of the bov in the street, "" he drew it out like a toff."" The leader of the Opposition in this House, who was also opposed to payment of members when the system was introduced in the New South Wales Legislature, permitted the allowance to which he was entitled to accumulate until it had reached a total of £540, when he paid it into the Consolidated Revenue. Tf I desired to make more friends in the House, I should not propose an amendment of this (kind, but I am not here to study merely mv own personal inclinations, f do not wish an honourable member to take credit for having opposed this Bill and, later on, to have the satisfaction of paying the increased allowance of £200 per annum into his credit at the bank at which he does business. I hope that my amendment will be accepted.",52
289,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Wide Bay) [9.n] - It may be that the consciences of some honourable members should be safeguarded, but I certainly do not think it necessary or desirable that such a provision as this should appear in an Act of Parliament. Speaking for myself, I feel that it is undesirable to take the course proposed by the honourable member for Dalley. The Bill is complete in so far as the purpose that we desire to achieve is concerned, and, therefore, however strong may be my faith in the bona fides of the honourable member for Dalley, I do not think it would conduce to the dignity of the House, or to the improvement of the Bill, to pass such a provision as this. It would serve no useful purpose, and I, therefore, intend to oppose it.",52
290,Mr BATCHELOR,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Boothby) [9.12] I am not strongly in favour of the amendment, but I think there is something to be said for it. It has been urged that those who are opposed to the increased allowance will pay it into the Consolidated Revenue, and that, therefore, there is no necessity for this amendment. At the outset, opponents of the Bill might be disposed to adopt that course, but after a time they probably would not be so alive to the necessity of doing so. Among the candidates for the representation of South Australia in the Federal Convention was a gentleman who promised the electors that if he were returned he would devote to charities the allowance of £ $ 3s. per day which the delegates were entitled to receive.",52
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Did charity begin at home in his case ?,52
292,Mr BATCHELOR,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"-It did, and almost stayed there. I believe that the gentleman in question was perfectly sincere in making that promise to the electors, but after the Convention he discovered that his expenses were almost equal to the amount which he had received as a delegate. Instead of handing over the whole amount, as he had led the electors to believe he would, he deducted his expenses, which mopped up nearlv the total, and gave the balance to charities in his own electoral district, thus getting the reputation for philanthropy at the public expense.",52
293,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Thos e charities would require no Government grant that year !,52
294,Mr BATCHELOR,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I do not think the contribution made any great difference to the funds of the charities. Nevertheless, it might be just as well to allow this clause to pass.",52
295,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,The public will soon see whether men are genuine or not.,53
296,Mr BATCHELOR,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"No doubt the public will be observant enough to do that. At the same time there is some justification for such a clause, when we hear honourable members contending that this Bill is an immoral dipping into the public purse - a public robbery-in order to enrich ourselves.",53
297,Mr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Melbourne) [9.17]-I was asked yesterday if I would support this amendment, and I said that I would. I do not for one moment suggest that any honourable member, who conscientiously disapproves of this extra allowance, and votes against the Bill, would accept the increase; but, still, it is just as well to have this provision in black and white. The instance cited by the honourable member for Dalley is somewhat similar to one in Victoria. A certain Victorian Minister said that, as he could not give all his time to the work of his office, he would not draw the Ministerial allowance, but when his term ended, it was noticed that he drew the accumulated money, which amounted to a considerable sum. If there had been a conscience clause in operation, similar to that now proposed, there could not have been such an occurrence. The clause simply provides that a member, by giving notice to the Treasurer, may continue to receive his allowance of £400 a year, and have the balance paid into the Consolidated Revenue.",53
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,That can be done without any law.,53
299,Mr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Certainly ; and I do not believe that any honourable member, who conscientiously objected to this Bill, would require a mandatory clause to make him forego the increased allowance. At the same time, a conscience clause may be of some use; and I see no reason why it should not be carried. If the clause goes to a division, I shall certainly vote' with the honourable member for Dalley, who has been very sincere, and has not been afraid to reprove those who' have received money in a way that would have been impossible under such a clause as this. The instances cited by that honourable member and myself'are sufficient to justify this clause.",53
300,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Hindmarsh) [9.20]. - I take it that we must look on all oui colleagues as being honourable men; and, therefore, it should not be necessary to have a clause of this kind. If an honourable member feels that he conscientiously ought not to receive the extra allowance, I am sure he will pay it into the Consolidated Revenue; and if he has no conscience, he will be found out at the next election. There have been cases where honourable members have spoken and voted in Parliament, not in accordance with their own consciences and desires, but so as to secure support at the next election.",53
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,I thought the honourable member said that his colleagues were all honourable men?,53
302,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I said that we ought to regard them as honourable men; and I am not reflecting on my colleagues, as we should be doing if we accept this clause. If an honourable member thinks it is his right to receive a higher parliamentary allowance, no matter which State he may represent, he will be in precisely the same position as others of the same opinion at the next election. If he does not care to receive the increased amount, he will be able to say at the next election that, in his opinion, it should not be paid until the electors had been consulted, or until the new Parliament came into existence. I do not think the honourable member for Dalley will feel it necessary to press the clause to a division. We have ventilated our opinions on the matter ; and the discussion will no doubt have its due effect, without our passing the clause.",53
303,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Dalley) [9.25] - I have listened very carefully to the observations of honourable members; and I wish to place myself in a right position. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that we should look on all our colleagues as honourable men. I have been some years in public life, and the same standard of honour I regard myself I have always credited my colleagues with. My proposal was made, not for - the purpose of testing - whether members of this House are honourable or not, but as an answer to those who accuse supporters of the Bill of dipping their hands in the public purse. I thought it only right to see that those honourable members did not dip their hands in the public purse. The right honourable member for Swan is quite right in saying that the desired result may be brought about without a provision in this Bill. I point out, however, that the clause is not mandatory, but declaratory; and I did not desire that it should be mandatory. an honourable member is devoid of conscience, no Bill can supply him with one; but I believe that all the members of this House are conscientious. I desired to rivet public attention on the matter, and to show that if the honourable members. I have referred to felt any difficulty, there was a way out. of their allowing the money to accumulate for their assignees or executors. I have been told that this clause, if passed, will destroy the symmetrical character of the Bill ; but I am - not squeamish on that point.",53
304,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Does the honourable member think that those honourable members who are pledged against an increase, would themselves take it? Mr Wilks.'- I would not like to answer that question; but if honourable members say that they would not take the increased amount, I suppose they would not. I know honourable members in this House pretty well; and there are many who regard the object of the clause as right, but who object to stamping their colleagues as of a different character from themselves. If an honourable member stood on a platform and said that he was against an increased remuneration, I do not think that he himself would take it. But if Parliament passes such a Bill, such an honourable member would have done his duty by opposing it. The honourable member for Laanecoorie took the most courageous stand of any last night, when he informed us that, although he had told his electors he was against an increase, he would, if opportunity offered, say he was in favour of it, and accept the money. I can see that the Committee do not care to vote on this clause, which, as I say, was introduced in order to prevent honourable members who have described the Bill as a robbery of the public being afterwards able to accept the increased remuneration. Under the circumstances, however, I think we may trust to the honour and conscience of such members to pay the money into the Consolidated Revenue.",54
305,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"Flinders) [9.28]. - I am sorry to learn, from statements kind. ' which have been made, that some honourable members who opposed the Bill, have used the expression attributed to them, namely, ""suggested. that the supporters of the Bill are dipping their hands into the public purse. Personally I should be very sorry, indeed, 'to think that such an expression had been used by any honourable member in connection If with a measure of this character.",54
306,Mr THOMAS,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,The honourable member for Echuca used the expression.,54
307,Mr WISE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,The honourable member for Fremantle said that the Bill was a dishonest voting of money.,54
308,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"In the heat of debate some very foolish expressions may be used, but I heard nothing of 'the kind. One argument, however, which has been used on this side, and referred toby honourable members opposite, requires an answer. If this clause has been brought forward with a view to preventing honourable members, whose consciences may smite themand I think that we are all deeply grateful to the honourable member for Dalley for the tender solicitude which he exhibits for the consciences of others-fro m accepting the same remuneration as other honourable members receive, it is perfectly useless and unnecessary. But if it be intended to convey something in the nature of a direction to those who have voted against the Bill to adopt a particular course of action in regard to the increased allowance, I absolutely and entirely repudiate such a direction."" It is quite a wrong argument to use. The mere fact of endeavouring to impose a personal and pecuniary obligation in connection with a vote to be given by any honourable member is contrary to every tradition of Parliament, and contrary to the principle under which par. liamentary proceedings are conducted. Let us suppose that the question whether the allowance to honourable members should be fixed at £400 or at £600 was before us for the first time, and' that there was ah honest difference of opinion upon it. Let us assume that some honourable members honestly thought that £400 would be sufficient, whereas a majority were of opinion that nothing less than £600 would be sufficient. Does any honourable member suggest for a moment that those who voted for the lower amount would be obliged to - refuse to accept'the higher rate, of payment? Such a suggestion would be a monstrous absurdity. We cannot carry on"" parliamentary proceedings if we are to be subjected to personal influences' of that ",54
309,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,That has not been,54
310,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"The clause amounts to a permission to do something which we are at liberty to do without it, or a direction to do something to' keep what the honourable member for Dalley chooses to call our consciences in the right be passed. place. Mr TILL EY BROWN - It conveys an imputation.",54
311,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"When the honFor orable member for Dalley was speaking, the honourable member for South Sydney made an interjection which was based upon the assumption that those honourable' bers who were pledged against the proafforded posal would, as honourable men, not avail fhemselves of the additional allowance its payment were authorized. Surely such an interjection shows an absolutely false conception of the real position occupied by members who come here to debate a matter, and to vote upon it !",55
312,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,Tw o honourable members have already declared that not take the increased allowance.,55
313,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,"I entirely agree with their action. It is a totally wrong position for any honourable member to take up. I am in agreement with the honourable member for Swan, who said that we are here to debate what is Parliament and the people. We have our own views upon this matter. I have pressed my opinion that this step ought not to be taken until the country has been to intervene. consulted. That does not affect my sonal action or conscience in the slightest degree. The attempt of the honourable member member for Dalley to bring personal and direct influence to bear upon honourable members by means of this amendment is absolutely wrong, and is opposed to all principle. We ought to be at perfect liberty to bring any argument to bear, lic opinion desires. either for or against any proposal. Personally, I am entirely in accord with the right honourable member for Swan, who said boldly and honestly that we all occupy different positions personally with regard to such a delicate matter as the remuneration we receive. To some, that remunerabe tion is a smaller matter than it is to others. Surely it is unjust and improper to introwill duce the personal relations of honourable members of the House into a discussion this sort. For my own part, if the Bill be passed, I shall not have the slightest hesitation in falling in with the law as established by a majority of honourable course? members. I shall accept the increased allowance without the slightest twinge of conscience, but I say-as I have said from the beginning-that if there were any hope of this measure not passing, I should earnestly hope that it would not I sincerely trust that the Acting Prime Minister will not exhibit to the country the spectacle of rushing a measure of this kind through the House. the honour of this Parliament, and for the sake of its credit throughout the whole of Australia, I sincerely hope that he will allow considerable time for dememliberation so that the people may be an opportunity-if they have an opinion upon this matter-to give expresif sion to it before the Bill leaves us.",55

317,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTA RY ALLOWANCES,That is an ardisgument that may sometimes be used by members upon this side of the Chamber with quite as much justice as honourable members opposite can use it against us. But it does not answer the position I best for the am endeavouring to put.,55

I admit, too, that a number of honourable members, having consulted their constituents in regard to the matter, have now a perfect right to endeavour to obtain an expression .of their views by an Act of Parliament. But those who differ from them are undeniably at liberty to place any reading they choose on that that section.of the Constitution which empowers Parliament to take action of this kind. I hope, therefore, that this jest-becaus e the cannot be regarded in any other light-ha s not been put forward with the inidea of penalizing any honourable member to who has opposed the measure. If that complexion is given to it, honourable members who support the amendment will place upon themselves a stigma which they do not deserve, and which I hope they will not have to bear, of having, been led to mavote for the Bill because of the fear of what this this amendment might do to them if they  gret that the amendment has been moved.

I have opposed the measure, will do so until the end; but if it becomes law, I shall draw the increased with a clear conscience. I have not had to contest the last two elections, and the question of increasing the parliamenallowance has never been raised by me.

I think that we have every reason to believe that that assent will not be withheld.

It is well known' that this amendment was inserted in the clause by another place with the sole object of destroying the Bill, and I am surprised that the right honourable member for Swan, judging by an interjection which he made just now is, like the Government, prepared to agree to it. I enter my_ protest against its acceptance, and venture to say that if it be agreed to we shall hear no more of the proposed survey for some time. The Government of.South Australia has given the Commonwealth permission to proceed with it, and I think that it is wrong to force them to secure the assent of the Legislative Council. The shipping interests of Port Adelaide are represented in that branch of the Legislature, and if honourable members wish to shelve this Bill, they need do no more than agree to the amendment made by another place. I urge that we should resist the amendment, and thus force the Senate to openly declare itself instead of attempting by a side wind to destroy the Bill. Sir JOHN FORRES T (Swan) [10.6]. - I am wholly in accord with the course taken by the Government in inviting the Committee to agree to the amendment made by another place. I do not agree with the honourable member for Grey that the Legislative Council of South Australia will be prepared to disregard the desire of this Parliament that this survey shall be ried out. Nearly seven years have elapsed since this question was first submitted to House. During the whole of that time the project has been supported not only by the people of Western Australia, but by every one of their representatives in both Houses of the Federal Parliament. When we remember that this Bill provides, not for the construction of the line, but merely for a survey to determine the character and the capabilities of the country through which the railway would pass, and generally to obtain such information as is necessary to enable the Parliament to decide whether or not the construction of the line would be justified, it seems amazing that so much time should - have been occupied in obtaining so little. No fair minded man can deny that one of the great inducements held out to the people of Western Australia by the public men of Australia was the promise that railway communication between the east and the west would be the result of Federation, and that that largely influenced them in voting for the Constitution Bill. I have already related times out of number in this House the efforts that were made prior to Federation by the public men of Eastern Australia to entice or induce the people of the west to join in the great Federal movement. Only a few days ago I quoted a speech made by the present Prime Minister, Mr Deakin, before the referendum was taken in Western Australia in 1900, in which he said "" Western Australia would secure the railway if she joined the Federation, and that personally he advocated its construction at the earliest possible moment."" I have also quoted in this House the opinions of and the promises given by the right honourable member for Adelaide, Mr Kingston; Senator Sir Josiah Symon j the honourable member for Wakefield, Sir Frederick Holder; Sir Edmund Barton; the right honourable the leader of the Opposition, Mr Reid; the honourable member for-Angas, Mr Glynn; and many other public men, all of whom led the people of the western State to hope and believe that on the establishment of Federation they would be no longer isolated from their fellow Australians in the east. I was intimately associated with the movement, and know that that argument was used again and again throughout Western Australia, and had an immense influence in determining the vote in favour of Federation. Notwithstanding those assurances, however, carI, and every other representative of Western Australia, have had to battle hard for the seven years to obtain the approval of the Parliament to the survey of the line. This Bill has been rejected on some occasions, and talked out on others, so that it is not surprising that the people of Western Australia should feel that the citizens of the eastern States are not in sympathy with them, or their desire that in the interests of. Federation itself there should be some means of communication by land between the east and the west. I am sure that every honourable member will join with me in the hope that the passing of this Bill will be the beginning of a brighter view being taken by my fellow-colonists as to the sentiments cherished toward them by the people of Eastern Australia. This Bill has now been carried in this House by a majority of two to one, and in the Senate by twenty votes to sixteen. That is eminently satisfactory. There has never been any difficulty in securing the approval of the House of Representatives; our difficulty has been in passing the Bill in another place. We have been taught to believe that the people of Victoria are out of sympathy with the aspirations of the western State in regard to this railway connecting the east and west, but I rejoice in the knowledge that fifteen out of twentytwo representatives of that State in this House have supported the Bill, and that in the Senate the Victorian senators carried the Bill by four votes to two. That is eminently satisfactory as showing that the arguments against the Bill have little or no foundation, and that the people of Victoria, as well as the people of all the other States, are in sympathy with the desire for closer union between the eastern and the western States. Wherever I have been throughout Australia-and I have been in most parts- I have always found the utmost good feeling amongst the people of the other States for the people of Western Australia; indeed, there is a great desire among the Australian. people generally to be on terms of the closest fellowship and amity. I am glad to know that the feeling in regard to Federation in Western Australia will be much improved by the passage of this measure. I regret very much to learn from the honourable member for Grey that the amendment with which we are called upon to deal has been inserted by the Senate in the hope that it may delay, or even prevent, this survey being carried out.  object.",58
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not believe for one moment that there is any chance of the object of this Bill being feated by the Parliament of South Australia. I have too much regard for the people of that State, whom I have known for more than thirty years, to believe that their presentatives would treat with contempt the wishes of this Parliament or the people of Western Australia. Notwithstanding that there are local difficulties and differences between the two Houses in South Australia, I do not believe that the Parliament of that State would be so unreasonable as to endeavour to defeat .this measure. The object which this Bill seeks to attain was desired by the Government of South Australia; and that the Bill is before us is largely due to the request of the Premier of that State that more information should be supplied. I have no fear of this Bill being opposed by the Parliament of South Australia; but in any case it would be better that South Australia should refuse its consent to a survey being made now than that afterwards-shoul d the report and information obtained be favourable-whe n all the trouble and expense had been incurred, they should refuse to assent to the construction of the railway by the Commonwealth Government. I am sure every honourable member will acquit me of any desire to spend £20,000 except in a good cause. Unless I believed that the result of the survey and inquiry will fully justify the views I have so often stated in the House, I would not advocate the spending of a single sixpence. If the South Australian Government were to refuse their - consent to a survey, what chance would there be of their consenting to the construction of the line by the Federal authority? I have travelled over a good deal of the country through which this railway will pass, and I know exactly the position of affairs; indeed, I know as well now the character of the country, and the obstacles to be overcome, as I shall know when the survey has been made, but other honourable members are not in the same position. South Australia desired a survey, and the Commonwealth Parliament has authorized the survey. The Government of South Australia have already approved ; and I have every reason to believe that the South Australian Parliament will willingly pass a Bill confirming the action of its Government to allow of a survey being made. I take the view of my right honourable friend, the leader of the Opposition, that there is every reason why the South Australian Government and Parde- liament should consent. A survey cannot do any harm; and surely a prospect of 650 miles of railway being built through the territory of South Australia, by the Federal reParliament, must possess some attraction for that State.  Josiah Symon vote on this amendment?",60
356,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not referring to Senator Sir Josiah Symon just now; and, in fact, I take no* exception whatever to this proviso having been inserted.",60
357,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Senato r Sir Josiah Symon is "" having a loan"" of the right honourable member.",60
358,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Surely the possibility of the construction of 650 miles of railway, with the prospect of easy access to the western State and the markets of the great Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie gold-fields, cannot be unattractive to the South Australian people. If the Federal Parliament are willing to carry out this great national work, it cannot enter the mind of any one that South Australia would do anything to prevent it providing means of communication with the western State. South Australia is in advance of Western Australia in manufactures and production; and a railway to Western Australia would open up markets which are now almost closed to that State. The idea is so impossible and irrational that it never occurred to the Federal Convention that a State would object to a great Inter-State railway connecting its railway system with that of another State. As a matter of fact, in 1897, before Federation, the South Australian Government were in favour of the line, and asked the Western Australian Gor vernment to join in constructing it out of their joint resources, and, in order to induce Western Australia to enter Federation, the public men of South Australia were pledged to the hilt to assist in furthering the project in every way. How could it be imagined by the Federal Convention that any objection would be raised to the Federal Parliament constructing the line? As a representative of Western Australia, I rejoice that the Parliament of South Australia will have an opportunity, not hitherto presented, of fulfilling a promise which it made through its then Premier, Sir Frederick Holder, before Federation, as an inducement to the western State to enter the Union. On the 1st February,- 1900, as Premier of Western Australia, I received a letter from the Premier of South Australia, written after there had been a consultation between us with the object of removing a difficulty in the Constitution Bill, which provided that railways might be constructed in a State, by the Federal authority, with the consent of the State. The letter, which I have read before in this House, was as followsSir,-Following our conversation as to the possible blocking of the construction of a railway line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta by the Federal authority, by South Australia refusing the consent rendered necessary by section 34 of clause 51 of the Commonwealth Bill to the construction of the line through her territory, I regard the withholding of consent as amost improbable thing; in fact, quite out of the question. To assure you of our attitude in the matter, I will ' undertake, as soon as the Federation is established, Western and South Australia both being States of the Commonwealth, to introduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this province to the construction of the line by the Federal authority, and to pass it stage by stage simultaneously with the passage of a similar Bill in your Parliament - I have, & c , Both South Australia and Western AusIn tralia, became States of the Comwere monwealth. A Bill has been passed standsby the Western Australian Parliament, a? promised, but South Australia has yet fulfilled its promise. This letter was accepted in good ' faith by me on behalf of the people of Western Australia, and they entered Federation. Honourable members will notice that the promise in that letter is not a promise to consent to a survey, but to consent to the construction of the railway. I believe myself that that promise, made in all good faith by one neighbouring friendly State to another before Federation with the express object of removing an obstacle in the way of Western Australia entering the Union, and upon the strength of which Western Australia entered the Union, will be carried out. I do not believe that when this subject comes before the South Australian Parliament it will hesitate for one moment in redeeming the pledge given in open day by its Premier, and by its leading public men. I am glad that at last the subject is to be brought before the South Australian Parliament, and I have the utmost reliance that the undertaking and promises made will be fulfilled. The only objection that I have to this proviso is that it may be taken as an indication that the Commonwealth considers that Inter-State railways for Federal purposes such as this are beyond the powers of the Federal - Parliament under the Constitution. Now, I very much question whether the construction of an Inter-State railway for Federal purposes by the Federal authority-havin g in view the necessities of defence and Inter-State commerce-is beyond our powers. It Premier's Office, must be remembered that the CommonAdelaide, 1st February, 1900. wealth has undertaken to protect every State from invasion and domestic violence. I very much question whether paragraph xxxiv. of section 51, which provides that the Commonwealth may make laws with regard to "" railway construction and extension in any State, with the consent of that State,"" means that the Commonwealth cannot make an Inter-State railway to facilitate trade and commerce, and for purposes of defence, without the consent of a State. My attention has been drawn to the fact that as the provision originally stood it contained the words ""but only."" It originally readRailway construction and extension in a State, F . W. HOLDER. but only with the consent of that State. the Convention the words "" but only "" struck out, and the provision now Railway construction and extension in any not State with the consent of that State.",60
359,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the right honourable .member mean that in his opinion railways - can be constructed by the Commonwealth if .necessary, without the consent of a State?",62
360,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe that in the Senate it was contended that this Parliament would be powerless to order the survey to be made without the consent of South Australia. .that contention. How can the Commonwealth carry out its obligation to protect Australia against invasion or domestic violence if it is to be thwarted by any State? How can the Commonwealth carry - out its undertaking to protect Western Australia if it has no means of sending troops there? How can trade and commerce be carried on by land between States with-out means of communication?,62
361,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the event of a State resisting the Commonwealth in that respect, what could be done by the Federal Government ?",62
362,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not dealing with that point just now. I should be very sorry to think that this Federal Constitution of ours was so cramped as not to permit the Commonwealth to - carry out its functions. I should be sorry to believe that the framers of the Constitution, by inserting the words "" with the con-sent of that State,"" intended them to apply --to great national Inter-State railways required for defence and for trade and comjmerce. There is a passage in Professor Harrison Moore's book on the Australian Commonwealth Constitution that is very much to the point. He says in regard to rthis very provision in the Constitution, secition 51, paragraph x x x i v . , -' Railway construction in anv State with the consent of (that State""- ' In the United States it has been contended, and is apparently now established, that the commerce power of Congress includes as an - incident the authorization and execution of all manner of works for facilitating Inter-State - and foreign commerce, including the construction of roads, railroads, bridges, and canals""This is very much more than the general power - of appropriating money for the general welfare where the objects of expenditure remain under :State laws; it is a federal power in which the federal law prevails, notwithstanding the obstacles of State law. The express power contained in Article xxxiv - may perhaps be taken .as indicating that the commerce power in the - Commonwealth Parliament does not extend to -.the construction of railways in a State without the consent of that State; but this is not the - only view that may be taken of it. xxxiv. is .clearly not limited to railways, which are incidental to Inter-State commerce. It might be held that the Parliament has as a matter of commerce (section 51 (1) and section 98) among the States power to make railways which are obviously in furtherance of that commerce; and that Article xxxiv. merely authorizes the exercise of legislative power with the consent of the State in regard to the construction of railways which have no direct relation to Inter-State commerce. That is a very important statement, which I demur to bears out my contention that the power vested in the Commonwealth in regard to trade and commerce and defence overrides paragraph x x x i v . of section 51 relating to railway construction in any State "" with the consent of that State."" . Honourable members will recollect the case of the United Slates v. Debs, which occurred a few years ago, in which the United States obtained an injunction restraining a strike and sent troops to enforce the injunction, so that the United States mails should be carried. Again, under paragraph x x x i x . of section 51 this Parliament has"" power to legislate in regard to any "" matter incidental to the execution of any power vested by the Constitution in this Parliament."" Surely trade, commerce, and defence matters are incidental to the exercise of the legislative power of the Commonwealth. I submit that paragraph x x x i v . of section 51 of the Constitution relates to the internal railways of a State for purely local and domestic purposes, and not to national railways for the purposes of trade, commerce, and defence. It is hard to beiieve that any State would wish to thwart the Commonwealth in its desire to construct national railways. Had the framers of the Constitution ever imagined that this power could be used to prevent Western Australia and South Australia from being connected by an Inter-State railway for national purposes, I could have had the matter put right in one minute, and by a stroke of the pen. Not one of the fifty delegates at the Federal Convention would have done other than approve of so reasonable and justifiable a proposal. Consequently the idea' never occurred to us. We all thought that the internal railways of a State were domestic matters which should be left to the' control of the State authorities. We never contemplated that the provision to which I have referred would be used to prevent the construction of an Inter-State railway for the purposes of trade, commerce, and deArticle fence. Had such an idea presented itself to us, the matter would have been made clear with the unanimous consent of the delegates. Of course, there is another way out of the difficulty. To secure an amendment of the Constitution should not be a difficult matter if anything unfair were attempted by any State. To effect such an amendment does not require the consent of a State, but only the consent of a majority of the people in a majority of the States. Consequently, if any State wished to do an unjust thing to the people of another. State, it is possible by an amendment of the Constitution to prevent it. I do not think for one moment that - South Australia will attempt to prevent this survey being made. While the Parliament of that State is authorizing it, I appeal to its members to do justice to Western Australia by completing the promise which was made as an inducement to her to enter the Federation. If that be done, a great feeling of relief will be experienced in Western Australia, the tension which has existed there for years will be removed, and there will be no more united people than those of Western Australia and South Australia.  gentleman is only making the position more difficult.",62

But there is no doubt that the Legislative Council of South Australia will say so, and of what use is it, therefore, to appeal to that body in this matter? I tell the right honourable member for the Swan that all that need be done is to reject the amendment, and the Government of South Australia will offer no opposition to the survey. But if this amendment is carried, what will be the result? The right honourable gentleman will go throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, and lay the blame for the l to rejection of this proposal, not upon the.

If he is prepared to do justice to the publie men, the House of Assembly and the Government of South Australia, he will see that this amendment is rejected, and there will then be no opposition to the survey. It will be of no use for the Premier of South Australia to introduce a Bill giving the consent of that State to the survey, when he knows that it will be defeated in the Legislative Council, and that the right honourable member for Swan will then say that the Government and people of South Australia have not carried out their pledges to Western Australia. I have stated the true position, and I trust that honourable members will reject the amendment, and will thus assist Western Australia and South Australia at one and the same time.",65

So far as. I am concerned, in the progress of this measure, as a representative of Western Australia, I have always in that State I laid stress upon the credit due to the representatives of South Australia in trieFederal Parliament for the assistance they have given in this particular matter. I have seen Senator Symon is the only exception. The Western Australian people owe a debt to> the members of the Federal Parliament from the other States for the help given* to their representatives in this House, and. in another place. I share'with our friendsfrom South Australia the \gravest doubts as to the prospects of getting a measuregiving the consent of that State to thesurvey passed by the Legislative Council of the State. I have no doubt that the present Government of South Australia are desirous, not only to redeem what x they consider to be a pledge given to the people of Western Australia by the publicmen of their State, but also to give effect to their own views of what is right in connection with this matter. I am surethat if the House of Assembly of South the Australia had the decision of the matter a Bill giving the consent of that State toits the survey would be carried almost im'- mediately. I have the gravest doubt of the fate of such a measure when it reachesI f the right the Legislative Council of that State.  member think that it is a great mistake reinsert a provision in this Bill , which, on< 1 the face of it, admits that we have not the power to construct the railway?",65
392,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Constitution requires that consent shall be given by a State before railway construction by the Commonwealth through that State is authorized.,65
393,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I doubt that.,65
394,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If this Parliament decides that the railway should be immediately constructed for defence purposes,, it may be done. Otherwise, there is a doubt. We do not think that'we are'faced with the necessity of undertaking such a responsibility at the present time. On the other hand a strong argument for acceptingthe amendment is that, if the South Australian Parliament does not grant its consent within a reasonable time, there is no-. thing to prevent this Parliament from' amending the measure after it becomes anAct. We could amend it tomorrow if we desired.. Consequently,, we. ought to give the South Australian Parliament the portunity of falling in with our wishes  position to place us in?",65

At any rate, I am a question relating to public business, and it is getting just a little nauseating to hear from the Minister of Trade with and Customs the reply that we shall get information at the earliest possible .moment.

To-night, for instance, he spoke with great warmth, until the inof the Acting Prime Minister, and what I may describe as the contempt done of the new Minister for Trade and Customs, brought him to his bearings. I am glad that Ministers have shown suffifirmness of character and strength of mind to treat this action of their supporters with the contempt which it dewe serves, so that what soared up to the will heavens as a rocket has landed as a till harmless and fizzling stick.",68

The Minister of Trade and Customs will probably say that they should put them into bonded warehouses. That course, however, could not be adopted without considerable expense being incurred, and some of the goods now arriving will either have to be returned to the port of shipment, or forwarded to New Zealand, or some other place. It is all very well for those who have voted for the allowance granted honourable members being increased to £600 per annum to treat these matters, lightly. In the eyes of some honourable members, it is a crime for a man to be a merchant or to be engaged in any business, but I hold that, as trustees of the people, we should have regard to those who are seriously affected by the Tariff, under which in some cases duties three times the value of the goods to which they relate are imposed We should deal with it as soon as possible, and, that being so, I am opposed to' the House adjourning as proposed until Wednesday next.",69

It appears to me that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie had a perfect right to protest against an' adjournment to which he was not a party. Notwithstanding the remarks of the volatile member for Wentworth, I think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie took up a very reasonable attitude when he said that although he was opposed to the adjournment, he was prepared to stand by any arrangement that had been made that the House on rising to-night should not meet again until Wednesday next. As a matter of fact, there was no arrangement in the sense implied by the honourable member. I was not consulted, and I do not think that the Acting Prime Minister consulted any other honourable member as to the proposal.",69

445,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is quite right.,69
446,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think that honourable members acted fairly in taking the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to task because he objected to a proposal for an adjournment with the origin of which he was not acquainted. Any representative of a distant State has a right to object to an adjournment over several days, and I am sure that if the matter had been explained to the honourable member he would have been just as satisfied as others will be when they know the circumstances leading up to this proposal. I am not affected, since I do not intend to return to Sydney this week, and might just as well remain in the Chamber tomorrow and on Tuesday next at work, as I shall do, in other parts of the building.",69
447,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am in the same position. - Mr WATSON - I dare say that the absence of the honourable member for Lang might conduce to expedition in dealing with the Tariff.

I repeat that I am quite prepared to go on if honourable members desire that we shall meet totnorrow.

In the meantime I desire to inform the deputy leader of the Opposition that I saw the ComptroIIer-Gen«ral of Customs today, and also spoke to my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in regard to the preparation of the information for which he asks.

457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I cannot perform miracles; but I certainly hope to be able to secure the information for the honourable member tomorrow.
