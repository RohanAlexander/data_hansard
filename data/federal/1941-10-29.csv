Was the decision according to which the Prices Commissioner was directed, when fixing prices, to take cognizance of wage agreements which had not been so approved, made against the advice of the Prices Commissioner?

14,Mr FORDE,MUNITIONS BOARDS OF,"Not at any time have I said that I would deny lo women the to assist in the war effort; far from it.

Did the Minister promise to refer the request to the Military Board and to the Advisory War Council ? Do the views expressed by this deputation indicate an impending change of policy in regard to the method of ing up the men for home defence? Has the matter been brought before the Military Board and the Advisory War Council, and if so with what result?",13
18,Mr FORDE,COMPULSORY MILITARY,It is evident that the honourable member has not been told the whole truth regarding the deputation thai waited on me. The matter has not been referred to the Military Board. Tht suggestions put forward by the deputation as to how conditions of militia men and members of the Australian Imperial Eorce can be improved will receive sympathetic consideration by the Government. SHALE OIL. PBODUCTXON-MARKETING .,13
19,Mr SPOONER,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Will the Minister for Supply state whether there is any truth in the report published in the Sydney Sun yesterday that the Glen Davis shale oil project will be taken over by the Government under the National Security Regulations? If the report is true, will the Minister make a statement to the House explaining the weaknesses in the present method of control, and the extent to which it is expected that production will be increased under the new method of control? Will he, at the same time-, announce to the House the policy of the Government in regart to oil shale development generally, with particular reference to Baerami and other known fields?",13
20,Mr BEASLEY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"This is a very important question, and I am pleased that the honourable member has raised it . Honourable members will recall that the National Oil Proprietary Company Limited entered into an agreement with the Government in 1937 to extract oil from shale in the Newnes district. It was proposed to produce 10,000,000 gallons of oil per annum. I regret to say that the output from Newnes is most unsatisfactory, though perhaps it would not 'he wise to state just what the quantity is. The Government cannot allow the present drift to continue, because additional supplies of fuel are needed in Australia. I have arranged to meet the manager of the Glen Davis project, Sir George Davis, on Monday afternoon, and callafterwards a statement will be made on the subject. Honourable members will be interested to learn that the company is about to approach the Government for an additional grant, and this matter will be discussed with the company. The capital used by the company at present is approximately £1,300,000, including a guarantee by the Commonwealth to the bank for an overdraft of £250,000. The company has put into the concern £321,667, the Government of New South Wales £166,000, and the Commonwealth Government £559,000, besides guaranteeing an overdraft of £250,000. Honourable members on both sides of the House will agree that the Government has given this project a pretty fair run under existing conditions. I think that they will also agree that it is incumbent on the Government to take some further action, because the present drift cannot he allowed to continue. Difficulty has been experienced in obtaining a satisfactory method of retorting the shale, hut I have not time now to go into that matter. Government action will be decided after consultation with not only the representatives of the company, but also representatives of the State government, which is vitally interested. The honourable member also inquired regarding the policy of the Government in connection with shale' oil extraction, with particular reference to the field at Baerami. The Standard Oil Company of Australia has sought permission from the Capital L=snes Board to raise £2,500,000 to exploit the Baerami field. The Treasurer previously laid down certain conditions with which the company was not satisfied, and negotiations are again proceeding. In the meantime, the company has asked the 'Commonwealth Government to obtain equipment from the United States of America under the leaselend arrangement. I am informed that the necessary requisition for that purpose has been lodged with the Customs Department, but there is no guarantee that the goods will be supplied. That is as far as the Government has been able to go so far. The company has made no request to the Government for financial assistance. Later:",13
21,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I ask the Minister for Supply and Development whether he will prepare a statement showing the amount of money sunk in the Glen Davis shale oil proposition hy previous anti-Lahnur governments of the Commonwealth and New South ""Wales, and the amount of oil that has been recovered on that field, in order to demonstrate just what price per gallon the oil has cost the people of this country, and also to show to the people how the general frenzied financial policy of those governm ents",14

26,Mr SPEAKER,COMPULSORY MILITARY,The honourable gentleman must avoid making comment when asking a question..,14
27,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Will the Minister prepare such a statement in order to show to what degree the cost of this petrol has been increased as the result of the lack of supervision by the late Government of its investment in this proposition ?,14
28,Mr BEASLEY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"As I stated earlier, when we reach the stage of determining policy on this subject, it will be incumbent upon the Government to state the facts and the reasons on which it bases its policy. I hope at that time to give the honourable member the information h.6 d.GSlI""6S",14
29,Mr MULCAHY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"In view of the need for fuel oil in Australia, will the Minister for Supply and Development allow small producers of shale oil to market their product free from the rationing system, thereby helping to overcome the shortage of fuel for commercial purposes?",14
30,Mr BEASLEY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The position is thai individuals are able to retort shale oil for their own purposes, but, when the extraction and distribution of the shale oil goes beyond that, it is considered necessary to bring it within the general rationing scheme. The point raised by the honourable member is worthy of consideration, because in some places it may be possible to extend the plants. I shall be pleased to have the matter investigated in order to ascertain what can be done. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. SECRET FUNDS ROYAI. COMMISSION.",14
31,Mr CALWELL,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"On the Sth October, I asked the Attorney-General a question in regard to the inquiry by a royal commission into the payments from secret funds, and I received the following reply :Above all, I emphasize that it is the desire of the Government",14

34,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,That is not permitted.,14
35,Mr CALWELL,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That is a restriction which should no longer be imposed. In view of recent developments before the royal commission, and the statement of the judge that probably an extension of the terms of reference would be necessary, does the Attorney-General intend to extend the terms of reference without further delay?",14
36,Dr EVATT,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The relevance of any matter to the terms of the royal commission is a question for the judge; and. if the learned judge requests the Government to extend the terms of the commission, a new situation, as I indicated to honourable members previously, will arise. The Government will leave no part of the inquiry unfinished, hut the honorMinister. able member will understand that cannot discuss here, while the commission is pending, the relevance of any ticular matter.",14

40,Mr BEASLEY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The matter of he arranging for adequate supplies of coal will he reviewed. for South Australia has been seriously considered by the Government. The Premier of South Australia conferred with the Prime Minister in Melbourne, and the Leader of the Opposition South Australia conferred with the Prime Minister and myself. I have also discussed the position with the Commonand wealth Coal Commissioner, Mr Mighell, in Sydney. In the opinion of the fares Government, the matter requires urgenl and immediate attention, and every tion possible step is being taken to ensure that adequate supplies of coal are made available to South Australia.

Will he also inform the House whether the Government has for found it easier to take over the control of certain shipping companies, than exact that measure of co-operation which asks the seamen to give?",15

If the Minister finds that my informais correct, will he at once issue instructions for - the men who have been treated in this manner to be reimbursed in full?",15
46,Mr MAKIN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,The determination of this matter would doubtless have been the responsibility of my predecessor; but I assure the honourable member that if any disability or injustice has been suffered by these men an adjustment satisfactory to refrain to them will be made. BOMB-AIMING DEVICE.,15
47,Mr CONELAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Will the Ministei the Army take steps to discover what happened to the new bomb-aiming device which was submitted to his predecessor he fourteen months ago? The inventor is a returned soldier who served in the last am war. He has two sons serving in this me war. The Inventions Branch of the Department of the Army did not have the courtesy even to acknowledge the receipt of this device. Will the Minister also make inquiries as to whether the invention can be utilized?,15
48,Mr FORDE,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Immediat e inquiries will be made, and a prompt reply will be furnished to the honourable member, who has been most persistent in this matter. WOMEN'S AUSTRALIAN AUXILIARYAIR FORCE.",16
49,Mr MCEWEN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Will the Minister for Air say whether it is the intention Government, as has been published, to abolish the Women's Australian Auxiliary Air Force? Is it a fact, as has been published, that the enrolment of women for this force has already ceased in Western Australia and Queensland?

50,Mr DRAKEFORD,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Any announcements in the press that the Government has decided to cease enlisting redeterioration cruits for the Women's Australian tion Auxiliary Air Force are entirely that erroneous. No such decision has been reached, but the whole matter of the enlistment of women in the Women's Australian Auxiliary A ir Force is ceiving consideration, as also is the amount of money which the previous Go the vernment proposed to expend in connection with this body. When the present vernment has examined the information for which I have called, a decision will be made. As to statements in the press that enrolments in the Women's Austrawill lian Auxiliary Air Force had ceased, all can say is that. I am not responsible for has referred. them.

Bellemore, that the trainee dilution scheme for teaching youths engineering has been suspended in New South Wales because it has been found impossible to place them in employment after completing their course? Was this action taken with the approval of the Commonwealth Government, and will the Minister take immediate steps to investigate the position?",16
56,Mr WARD,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"My attention has not been drawn to the statement. There has been some lag in the scheme in New South Wales, owing to the inability of industry to absorb trainees. It is the intention of the Government in the near future to hold a conference of the various parties concerned with a view to more suitable arrangements being made to accelerate the rate of absorption. The Commonwealth Government has made no suggestion to anybody at all that the scheme in New South Wales, or anywhere else, be suspended. OIL COMPANIES. Sir FREDERICK; STEWART When allocating trading quotas to the oil companies, will the Minister for Supply and Development see that the interests of the smaller companies are not subordinated to those of the major companies, particularly in view of the failure of two of these major companies to maintain appropriate stocks in Aus",17
57,Mr BEASLEY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"Quite frankly, I think that that question is based upon a case which the honourable member submitted when he was on this side of the House. Whether he succeeded in his plans is another matter, but I am aware of much that was done. This subject is now under consideration and the purpose is to ensure that, if a quota system be determined upon, an equitable quota shall be given to all, so that the independent distributors shall have their rightful place and receive due recognition of the services that they have rendered to the country. WOOL AGREEMENT.",17

59,Mr SCULLY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"That matter will come under review by my department at an early date.

62,Mr BEASLEY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"It would not he prudent to disclose the degree to which supplies of petrol have been built up in Australia at this stage. However, every possible step is being taken to impress upon the Petroleum Board in Great Britain and our representatives in the United States of America the necessity for continuing the supplies 'arranged with m.y predecessor.

65,Mr ANTHONY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,We want information.,18
66,Mr BEASLEY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"I have no desire to hold a post-mortem on this subject, because that will not help the country, the Government, or this Parliament. I can only say that we are improving the position, and at the same time we are encouraging in every possible way the use of substitute fuels, because even though our stocks of oil and petrol may be built up to a safe level, no one can tell, particularly in view of events during recent weeks, what developments may occur in this war at any moment. Every step is being taken to maintain supplies, and at the same time to build up stocks to a safe level, and at the proper time the Government will take steps to ease the effect of petrol rationing.",18

69,Mr JAMES,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether is a fact that much discontent exists among the miners, resulting in the ment of coal production, because of the persistence of the coal-owners in appealing against decisions of the chairmen of Local Reference Boards to the Central Reference Board. ? Is he aware that 90 per cent, of those appeals' have been disallowed by the chairman of the Central Reference Board .owing to the fact that the disputes have been of a local character? In view of the effect of these irritating tactics by the coal-owners., and the deare sire of every one concerned to stimulate coal production, will he amend the present regulations in order to empower the chairman of the Local Reference Boards fco give decisions upon all questions of local character, such decisions not to subject to appeal unless they conflict those of the Central Reference Board, or deal with matters affecting other districts ?",18

72,Mr CHIFLEY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [4.48] - Once again it has fallen to the lot of Labour to take over the responsibility of government during a critical and difficult period. On a previous occasion we faced an economic crisis. To-day we in the throes of the most deadly and devastating war that has ever been waged between nations, and the skies are dark with clouds of evil portent. The Government has a full realization of the respona sibility that rests upon it to carry out its be duty to the country with determination, with and all of the capacity at its command. ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE 1941-42. Since the Government took office Ministers have not had sufficient time to examine in detail the Estimates of expenditure placed before honourable members by the previous Government. I have, therefore, adopted with some alterations the estimates of my predecessor, but I give to the House the assurance that the closest scrutiny is being made by Ministers in every department, and any unnecessary items of expenditure will be eliminated. With regard to the estimate of £217,000,000 for war expenditure subnecessary mitted by the previous Government, the fact has come under notice that are: some definite commitments exceeding £1,000,000 which will, have to be met this year were overlooked. It is realized that further commitments of £2,050,000. will be added to the programme during the course of the year. On the other hand, some saving may be possible without reducing efficiency in any In the circumstances the estimate of £217,000,000 has been adopted, subject to increases of soldiers' pay, but the position will be reviewed within the next three months. The Estimates of expenditure as submitted by the previous Government fell short of what this Government regards a proper provision for pay of members £2,600,000. of the Eorces and for invalid and old-age pensions. It has been decided to increase active pay and allowances of members of the Eorces at a cost of £7,300,000 a full year, and to make certain additions Increasesto deferred pay costing £200,000 per annum. These decisions will supersede the proposals of the previous Government, which were estimated to cost £6,000,000 a year, mainly for deferred Reductionspay. I am sure that the country will not grudge the extra effort required to give this tardy measure of justice to our fighting men. It is proposed also to raise the maximum rate of old-age and invalid pensions to 23s. 6d. a week, and to liberalize the conditions in several respects. Service pensions also will be increased and extended. The total cost will be £2,124,000 per annum. Further Mr Chifley. details of these changes will be given later. The Government will proceed as vigorously as physical resources will permit with the provision of housing in those areas where there has been a large increase of population as a result of war production. The work of the Housing Trust, which has already been set up, will be expedited. The Government has adopted the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission for special grants to certain States for 1941-42, and the bill will be brought down as early as possible. The proposed grants South Australia, £1,150,000; Western Australia, £630,000; and Tasmania, £520,000; or a total of £2.300,000, compared with actual payments last year Although there has not been sufficient time for Ministers to examine the Estimates of expenditure of all departments way. two reductions have been made. The amount of £283,000 for the Department of Information has been reduced by £80,000. An item of £50,000 for adver. tising of primary products under the Department of Commerce has been reduced by £35,000. I may add that it is not proposed to alter the Loan Estimates for civil puras poses-Pos t Office, &c - amountin g to The decisions of the Government will result in a net increase of £5,659,000 in in the Estimates of expenditure, viz.:1941-42 £ Pay of members of the forces . . 4,000,000 Invalid and old-age pensions . . 1,115,000 Service pensions .. .. 59,000 5,774,000 £ Department of Information 80,000 Department of Commerce 35,000 115,000 Net increase in Estimates of Expenditure . . 5,059,000 These alterations will increase the total estimate of war expenditure from £217,000,000 to £221,485,000, of which £162,485,000 will be expended in Australia and £59,000,000 overseas. These alterations have been embodied in the Estimates which have been laid on the table. In order to avoid expense, the estimates of expenditure and the budget papers will not be reprinted, but additional papers embodying the necessary amendments will be circulated later. A comparison of the revised figures with the Estimates submitted by the previous Government is also given in table No. 1. FINANCI AL POSITION SUMMARIZED. The estimates of revenue and expendilimited ture for this year as amended by the foregoing alterations can now be sumrigidly marized as follows:Estimated expenditure in September budgetWar expenditure . 217,000,000 Civil expenditure 102,300,000 Increases in expenditureWar expenditure . 4,485,000 Civil expenditure 1,174,000 Total expenditure Funds availableCash balance at 1st July, 1941 2,229,000 Revenue on the basis of existing taxation . . 103,227.000 Balance to be found from additional taxation and loans . . Say in round figures FINANCIAL POLICY. Finance for an additional £160,000,000 will be required this year. On the basis of last year's borrowing we can count on £66,000,000 of loans for war purposes, after providing £20,000,000 for Loan Council requirements. We have then to find £94,000,000 by increased taxation or increased borrowings over last year's level. That means that from our productive capacity we must devote £94,000,000 more to war purposes than was the case last year. Financial policy must fit in with war policy. Labour's war policy is to expand the war effort to the maximum and to do this by using all unemployed who are physically fit, and diverting labour and resources from civil to war purposes for the balance. At the same time, the essential living standards of the basic wage family can and will be maintained. The diversion of labour and resources to war production will necessarily reduce the volume of non-essential goods available for civil consumption. On the other hand, the increased volume of employ 1 ment will place further spending power in the hands of the people. If this were all spent it would result in increased competition by private interests for the resources necessary for war. This must be avoided or our war effort will falter. Private spending must therefore . be to the smaller flow of civil goods that will be available and prices must be controlled. A rough measure of the limitation that is necessary is the additional £94,000,000 for"" war expendi£ £ ture to which I have referred, and the task before us is to secure this limitation in the most equitable manner. We are, 319,306,000 therefore, forced by the demands of war to call upon the people for further sacrifices which can be made, whilst preserving 5,659,000 health and efficiency for all. 324,965,000 Notwithstanding any increased production that can be brought about there must be a switch over of a very large amount of production from civil needs to war's demands. No amount of entries in the Commonwealth Bank's books can 105,450.000 accomplish this. War needs must come 159,509,000 from the collective resources of the community. .. 100,000,000 Credit expansion, however, can be successfully used to finance employment of reserves of man-power to expand production of goods and materials. That is to say that any increase of the money volume must be balanced by a corresponding increase of production. Theextent to which increased production is possible will be determined by the amount of reserve man-power that is available. A. thorough survey of that field is now in process. By organization and training many who are now classified as unemployable could be found useful employment and thus materially increase production and at. the same time provide for.themselves and their families. In these circumstances, the Government must provide for additional taxation on those best able to bear it ; a national campaign for savings to help the war effort generally; an appeal for thp maximum support to war loans and war savings certificates; and such further controls and measures as may be necessary to secure additional resources for war by diversion from non-essential needs to war needs and to provide for an equitable distribution of the reduced volume of non-essential goods that will be available. Additional taxation is proposed which will bring in about £29,000,000 in a full year. The yield in the remainder of the current year will be about £22,000,000. I shall give details at a later stage. With £22,000,000 from increased taxation, we shall require to borrow £72,000,000 more than last year, that is, a total of £158,000,000 for all public purposes, compared with £86,000,000 in 1940-41, and £37,000,000 in the last pre-war year. This is a formidable demand to make on the people of Australia, hut not an impossible one. Earnings are high, and there is a growing realization of the urgency of our needs for war. Already spending is being restrained, and much greater savings are being made than in 1940-41. The growth of savings bank deposits is evidence of this. In the last financial year savings bank deposits increased by £16,000,000, and that was the largest increase in any year on record. But in three months only of the present financial year such deposits have increased by £10,000,000, or at the rate of £40,000,000 in a year. That is a very encouraging sign. The late Government proposed to take as a compulsory loan a special contribution from incomes in low-taxing States, from income exempt or partially exempt from taxation, and from the lower incomes. My Government relies on willing co-operation from all classes of income-earners to make their full contribution to saving and lending through public loans and war savings certificates. I hope, indeed, for a very great increase of sales of these certificates. Last year they contributed a net £12,000,000 to war expenditure. This year we must endeavour to double that amount. The Government intends to launch as quickly as possible a national savings campaign, and I earnestly appeal to every citizen of Australia to study very seriously how he or she can reduce their expenditure without undue hardship. It will he a physical impossibility to Mr Chifley. carry out our defence programme unless private expenditure he reduced sufficiently to release the necessary resources for war. However successful may be our appeals for voluntary saving, it will still be necessary for the Government to control private expenditure which conflicts with war activities. If people are left to choose their own economies they may continue to demand the very classes of goods the production of which competes directly with the war effort. An obvious example of this is in expenditure on industrial expansion. In these days we require an enormous expansion of factories, plant, and equipment for war purposes. We cannot then allow private interests to use the resources necessary for this expansion to increase their own industrial capacity for civil production. Expenditure on investment must therefore be more strictly controlled. This form of control is first on our list, not only because it is likely to save the type of resources required for war, but also because it takes nothing from the immediate consumption standards of the people. Production of luxury goods can also be curtailed considerably without reducing the living standard of basic wage families. Happily, we have abundant supplies of food, so that no one need suffer privation through the lack of any commodities necessary to maintain the bodily health and strength of our people. I shall now explain in some detail the decision of the Government relating to increases in the Estimates of Expenditure. PAY OF MEMBERS OF THE FORCES. The previous Government proposed to increase the pay of members of the forces at a cost of £6,000,000 per annum. The whole of the increase was to be in the form of deferred pay, with the exception of £360,000 per annum for dependants' allowances. Our view was that this did not satisfactorily meet the obligations of the community to members of the fighting forces, and that the increases should have been given as active - rather tban deferred pay. The Government has given full consideration to the matter, and has decided on a scale of increases involving additional expenditure at the rate of £7,300,000 per annum. All members of the forces on special force, rates of pay, which include the Australian Imperial Eorce in Australia and overseas, the Royal Australian Air Eorce war-time forces, and the home defence war-time Military Forces, and members of the Royal Australian Navy sea-going forces, will receive an increase in active pay of Is. a day. Taking the private soldier in the Australian Imperial Force as an illustration, his daily rate of active pay will be increased from 5s. to 6s. which, with 2s. deferred pay, will bring his total pay to 8s. a. day apart from dependants' allowances. The allowances to wives and children and other dependants of members of the forces also will be increased. The previous 'Government proposed to grant an allowance of 6d. a day to wives without children. This Government has adopted that proposal, but has extended it to include wives with one or more children. The Government has also decided to increase the dependants' allowance in respect of the second child by 6d. a day. The standard allotment which must be made by the member from his pay towards the maintenance of his wife .and family will be increased from 3s. to 3s. 6d. a day. The effect of the increases in the dependants' allowances and standard allotment on the income of the families of private soldiers can be seen from the following table:Wife only 42 0 49 0 Wife and one child 5!) 0 00 G Wife and two children 70 0 80 0 Wife and three children 80 G 91 0 In addition, child endowment of 5s. a week is payable for each dependent child after the first. These increases will take effect .from the commencement of the next allotment period. The Government will also make certain adjustments to deferred pay at an annual cost of £200,000. These are in addition to the increases in active pay and dependants' allowances. Members of the Royal Australian Air Force and Australian Military Force on special force rates of pay serving at operational stations such as Darwin will be credited with deferred pay at the rate of Is. a day while employed at those stations. Members of the Royal Australian Air Force who have been stationed in Australia for more than six months and who later embark for service overseas will also be credited, in respect of service in Australia in excess of six months, with de-' ferred pay at a rate which will bring their combined active and deferred pay to the scale payable for overseas service. This adjustment will be made retrospectively. The total cost of these decisions is £7,500,000 per annum. The cost to be met, this financial year for active pay and dependants' allowances is £4,900,000. As £300,000 was allowed in the previous Government's budget for dependants' allowances, a further £4,600,000 is now being provided. INVALID AND OT.D-AGE PENSIONS. The Government proposes to increase invalid and old-age pensions to 23s. a week, quite apart from the 6d. increase which would become payable in January next as a cost of living adjustment. As the payment of two increases within a short interval would duplicate the departmental work, the cost of living increase will be brought forward and invalid and ol.d-age_ pensions will be increased to 23s. 6d. after the necessary legislation has been passed. The principle of cost of living adjustments will be retained. The Previous Future annual cost of the combined increase is payment payment £1,771,000, and the cost for this financial a week. a week. e. d. a. d. year is £1,022,000. Further Concessions. There are certain other concessions in connection with invalid and old-age pensions which the Government proposes to allow, the most important of which are these: Invalid pensions are at present paid only in the case of persons totally and permanently incapacitated. To meet cases of hardship the Government proposes that a pension shall be paid in any case where the degree of permanent incapacity is assessed at 85 per cent, or lfioju. This concession is estimated - to cost £150,000 per annum, and £87,000 for the balance of this year. The act provides that an invalid pension shall be payable only if the claimant's relatives do not adequately maintain him. In the past "" adequate maintenance "" has been defined as a family income sufficient to provide £1 10s. a week for each adult member of the family and half that amount for each child under sixteen. The previous Government proposed to liberalize this provision by raising the figure of £1 10s. to £2 10s. The present Government has adopted that proposal. It is estimated that the cost will be £60,000 for a full year, and £35,000 for the balance of this year. The Government has also decided to extend the benefits of invalid and old-age pensions to certain naturalized British subjects, mainly Syrians and Lebanese, who are disqualified under the present law. The estimated cost of this concession is £20,000 per annum. It will cost this year approximately £12,000. There are some minor matters brought under notice by the Parliamentary Committee on Social Security, which also will be dealt with in the amending legislation. The total annual cost of the additional concessions to which I have referred is approximately £245,000 per annum, the cost for this year being £143,000. After allowing for the proposals I outlined and for the normal increase of the number of pensioners, the estimated expenditure on invalid and old-age pen-' sions during the current financial year will be £19,S65,000. This represents an increase of £2,499,000, as compared with the actual expenditure last year. The matter of war pensions in relation to eligibility for old-age pensions will also be investigated with a view to removing any anomalies. The Government also proposes to examine the question of extending the benefits of invalid and old-age pensions to Australian aboriginals other than nomadic aboriginals. Service Pensions. At present service pensions are granted at the rate of 21s. for a single man in the case of husband and wife, ISs. each. It is proposed to increase service Mr Chifley. pensions for single men to 23s. 6d an increase of 2s. 6d. a week. The aggregate service pensions of a married man and his wife are being increased similarly, but the increase of 5s. will be added to the married man's rate of 18s. r making it 23s., leaving the pension for the wife at 18s., this being the rate payable to a wife under the war pensions scheme. The estimated cost for a full year is £72,000 and for the remainder of this year £38,000. It is proposed to extend service pensions to ex^soldiers of the Boer War. The estimated cost is £36,000 for a full year, and £21,000 for the balance of this year. TAXATION PROPOSALS. The problem of taxation is becoming one, not of how much can be taken from each income, but of how much must be left. I realise very fully the embarrassment that will be caused to a number of people who have entered into commitments in good faith. But the writing was on the wall in August, 1939, and we have had over two years to prepare for the necessary economies. Consequently, I am proposing a very considerable increase of income tax in respect of the higher incomes. We have to pay some regard to the income taxes imposed by the States. The increase I am proposing will bring Commonwealth and State taxation on the highest have incomes almost to 18s. in the £1 in the State where taxes are highest. I am unwilling, however, to impose additional income taxation on the middle and lower incomes. It is difficult for income tax to discriminate fully between individuals in accordance with their financial responsibilities. A heavy increase of tax on lower incomes and middle incomes would frequently impose serious hardship. I am not doubting that many people on lower incomes are able to make a further contribution to war finance, and it is in fact essential that they should do so. With them, as with every one else, the major effort must be their willing co-operation in a voluntary reduction of consumption and a corresponding increase oflending to and, the Government. So far as taxation goes, as a means of reducing consumption, I think that for middle and lower incomes it is better to get the reduction by means of taxes on goods and services not really essential, which can be foregone without injury to health or efficiency. I propose, therefore, increases of taxaAustralia, tion which will produce approximately £22,000,000 extra revenue in 1941-42. The details of the taxes proposed are briefly as follow. Income Tax-Individuals . For taxable income from personal exertion the rates of tax under the scale increase progressively up to £1,500. Income in excess of £1,500 pays 10s. in the £1 on the excess. I propose to leave the scale unaltered up to £1,500, thereafter to continue the present rate of progression up to £2,500. Income in excess of £2,500 will pay 200d. in the £1. Corresponding changes are made in respect of incomes from property, with the excess over £2,000 paying 200d. in the £1. These rates are not so high as they look, because State taxes are allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income. However, total taxation-Commonwealt h and State-wil l be only just under 18s. in the £1 on the highest incomes in the State in which these incomes are taxed most heavily. The changes made in the tax for different actual incomes can best be appreciated from the tables which will be furnished to honourable members. It is estimated that this increase of the rates of income tax on individual incomes will increase revenue in 1941-42 by £4,500,000, and by £6,000,000 in a full assessment year. It is also proposed to make a number of changes in the method of assessing taxable income. In circumstances where the wife of a taxpayer has a separate income subject to tax, i.e., over £200, her taxable income will be added to the husband's taxable income in order to determine the rate of tax to be paid by both husband and wife. This change is expected to produce some additional revenue as well as prevent possible loss of revenue by the division of income between husband and wife in order to evade taxation. It is proposed to remove the present exemption, so as to provide that dividends received by Australian, residents from companies, the profits of which are derived wholly or partly from . outside shall be taxable in the hands of the recipients. I am prepared to set up a small committee to devise a formula to mitigate any hardship that may arise from double taxation. The allowance of £50 for dependent children after the first child is to be discontinued, in accordance with the underpresent standing when child endowment was introduced. This will not involve the disallowance of the present deduction in respect of a child who attained the age and of sixteen years during the year ended the 30th June, 1941. It is recognized, also, that there is an equitable claim for a deduction in respect of children for whom the endowment is payable for a portion only of the present nnanciai year, and it is proposed to deal equitably with those cases. At present, where dividends are paid by companies out. of Commonwealth loan interest which is taxable at concessional rates, those dividends are taxable in the hands of recipients at the same concessional rates. The rate of tax - applicable is limited to the rates of tax in operation for 1930-31. It is proposed to remove this concession, by providing that such dividends shall carry the same rates of tax as other income from property. The tax concession will, of course, still apply to companies paying the dividends and to individual holders. Evasion of tax occurs where trusts or settlements are created for the benefit of children who are minors and unmarried. It is proposed that this evasion shall be frustrated by making the trustee liable for the additional tax that the settlor would have been liable to pay if he had retained the settled property. In addition, it is proposed to discontinue the practice of allowing as deductions in arriving at taxable income calls paid on shares in mining and afforestation companies. The profits of a private company are now taxable in full at the graduated individual rates in the hands of either the company or its shareholders. It is proposed to apply this principle to businesses conducted by a partnership or an individual. Under the present law, when a business conducted by a partnership or an individual, by reason of its character, requires the retention in the business of not less than 15 per cent, of the taxable income, then in respect of that 15 per cent, a rebate of the excess of the individual's rate of tax over the company rate of tax is allowed. It is proposed to abolish this concession. All of these changes will be discussed more fully, together with a number of other proposed alterations, when I introduce the appropriate legislation to give effect to them. It is anticipated that the extra revenue ou account of all proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act will be £2,900,000 for the current year and for a full year £3,400,000. Income Tax-Companies . The rate of ordinary company tax was last increased in 1939-40, when it was raised from 13.8d. to 2s. in the £1. It 13 now proposed to increase the rate to 3s. in the £1. It is estimated that this increase will yield an additional annual revenue of £4,500,000, almost all of which will be collected in 1941-42. War-time Company Tax. It is proposed to increase the rates the war-time company tax. The present, scale of rates provides for a commencing rate of 4 per cent., progressing by 4 per cent, steps for every 1 per cent, in excess of the statutory percentage of 8 per on capital employed, until the rate being made. reaches a maximum of 60 per cent, on that portion of the total profits in excess of 22 per cent, on capital employed. It is proposed that the scale shall amended to provide for a statutory peraggregate centage of 4 per cent, instead of 8 per cent., and that the commencing rate tax shall be 6 per cent., increasing by steps of 6 per cent, until a maximum rate of 78 per cent, is reached on the taxable profit in excess of 16 per cent, on capital employed. Under the present scale of war-time company tax, the revenue for a full assessment year would be only £1,000,000. Mr Chifley. The increased revenue accruing from the amendments will be £4,000,000 in 1941-42, and £4,-750,000 in a full assessment year. Estate Duty. It is proposed to increase the present rates of estate duty on estates over £20,000. Above that point there will be an increase on a sliding scale until the rates reach a maximum of 28 per cent, at £500,000 instead of 20 per cent, as at present. The increased yield in a f u ll year is estimated at £650,000. As the new rates will apply only to the estates of persons who die after the commencement of the amending act, and as the proposed increases will affect materially only the larger estates, which usually require some time to complete valuations, no appreciable increase of revenue is expected this year. Gift Duty. It is proposed to impose a gift duty upon gifts of money, or transfers of property for natural love and affection or for which the consideration is inadequate. The purpose of the gift duty is twofold, namely, to raise revenue and to lessen dispersions of property which are made in order to avoid other forms of taxation, such as estate duty and income tax. As the weight of other forms of taxation has necessarily been made heavy in order to finance the war effort, there is now a of much greater incentive than there was formerly to dispersions of property. It is essential that this practice shall be controlled, at least to the extent of seeing that such dispersions cannot be effected cent. without some contribution to revenue The rates of duty to he imposed will be substantially the same as the rates of estate duty, and the rate applicable to be any particular gift will be based upon the value of all gifts made by the same donor within a period of five years. of The new duties will apply to all gifts made on or after today, the 29th October. Gifts made before the 29th October, 1941, will be brought to account only for the purpose of assessing the rate on gifts which will come under the act. It is proposed to allow certain exemptions, such as retiring allowances, pensions and gratuities to employees, also gifts to public charitaJble, religious and public educational institutions, as well as gifts to patriotic and war funds, including gifts to the Commonwealth or a State for defence purposes. It is estimated that the increased revenue accruing from this proposal will be £250,000 in 1941-42, and £500,000 in a full assessment year. Land Tax. In 1910, when the land tax was first introduced, the rate of tax commenced at Id. in the £1 and increased to 6d. in the £1 in respect of taxable balances in excess of £75,000. In 1914-15 the rate was increased to a maximum of 9d. in the £1 in respect of the excess over £75,000, and in 1918-19 a super tax of 20 per cent, was imposed over the whole range of assessments. A statutory exemption of £5,000 is allowed in respect of all land tax assessments, except in the case of absentees. Beginning with the withdrawal of the super tax of 20 per .cent, in 1922-23, the rates of land tax were successively reduced. In 1938-39 and 1939-40, the rates were only 50 per cent, of the rates imposed in 1914-15. In 1940-41, the rates were increased again to the 1914-15 rates. It is now proposed to impose a further increase of 20 per cent, as a super tax. Instead, however, of the 20 per cent, super tax ranging over the whole field of assessments, as in 1918-19, it is proposed that the super tax shall apply only in respect of those assessments in which the taxahle balance exceeds an unimproved value of £20,000. The proposed super tax will produce £500,000 additional revenue in a full assessment year, almost all of which will be collected in the current year. Sales Tax. The Government proposes to obtain extra revenue from sales tax, hy a regiven grouping of the goods in the various taxable categories. Those goods which are at present exempted will not be affected, because an examination of the schedule of exemptions reveals that they consist, broadly speaking, only of basic necessities life and aids to primary and secondary production-good s which the Government considers unsuitable for taxation. The special fields which are at present taxed at 5 per cent, and 15 per cent, will, in future, he taxed (with limited exceptions) at 10 per cent, and 20 per cent., respectively. It is not proposed to alter the general rate of 10 per cent., but certain items of a less essential nature which are at present in the general field will be transferred to the 20 per cent, field. The opportunity will also be taken to correct a few anomalies by transferring to the exempt list certain goods at present in the 5 per cent, schedule. It. is estimated that these alterations will increase the revenue from sales tax by £1,900,000 in 1941-42, and £3,300.000 in a full year. Post Office Charges. It is proposed to increase charges for postal and telephone services as follows :(i) War postage tax of i d . in addition to the normal rate of postage on all postal articles except mail matter to and from members of the fighting forces, air-mail letters to addressees abroad and parcels. (ii) Increased telephone charges, viz.:-Rental s at rates varying from 5s. to 15s. per annum; an additional farthing per call on local calls;, and increases on a sliding scale on trunk calls exceeding 25 miles. The extra revenue for 1941-42 is estimated at £1,500,000, and for a full year at £2,000,000. Customs and Excise. Certain increases of - customs and excise are proposed. Details will he to the committee at a later stage. The proposals will yield additional revenue of £2,350,000 in 1941-42 and £3,500,000 in a full year. Taxation Proposals Summarized.

It is appropriate here to set out briefly how the estimated war expenditure of £221,485,000 for this year will he financed, in comparison with the actual expenditure of £170,238,000 last yearCash balances at beginning of year 28,055,000 Revenue 65,091,000 Loans 77,092,000* * Includes £ 15,000.000 borrowed from United Kingdom Government. LOAN ESTIMATES. In addition to the war expenditure which is to be charged to loan £2,600,000 is to be provided for Post Office Works, &c. The estimated total loan expenditure for 1941-42 for civil and war purposes is £141,938,000, compared with actual loan expenditure last year of £105,265,000. Mr Chifley. Of the additional revenue of £22,400,000 to be obtained this year, Yield In a Additional £5,750,000 is to be gained by indirect ful l assessment revenue for year. 1941-42. taxation, and £16,650,000 by direct £ taxation. 7,400,000 With these proposals, the total esti4,500.000 mated revenue for 1941-42 will be increased from £163,227,000 to 4,000,000 £185,627,000.

In addition to the budget proposals which I have outlined there are four aspects of the Government's financial polic3 to which I wish to refer briefly. r 1040-41. .1941-42. These are(Actual.) (Estimated.) (a) Rural reconstruction. £ £ (6) Banking policy. (c) Guaranteed advances for war 2,229,000 82,147,000 production. 137,109,000 (d) Control of profits. 170,238,000 221,485,000 RURAL RECONSTRUCTION. The Government proposes to begin promptly in making effective its policy to give stability to our rural industries. The existing machinery for debt adjustment and for the transfer of farmers from suib-marginal areas will be speeded up. Arrangements have been made to have these matters .examined at a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers early next month. MORTGAGE BAN K. An integral part of the Government's plan for rural reconstruction is the establishment of a Mortgage Bank. Work is already in progress on the necessary legislation. Before finality can be reached it will be necessary to take into account the relations of the new bank with existing State instrumentalities making leans on mortgage. A conference of the Commonwealth Departments concerned, the Commonwealth Bank and the State organizations referred to will be called as soon as possible to examine this and related problems. A bill will be submitted to Parliament early in the new year. BANKING POLICY. The Government intends to implement immediately certain recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking System for the purpose of bringing the operations of the trading banks under effective control. It is intended to issue regulations viding that the business of banking may not be carried on except under licence. State banks which do not operate outside their own State will not come within the regulations. Licences will he issued to the existing trading banks, subject to certain conditions which will be set out in the regulations. The conditions will include provisions that a licensed bank shall(o) hold on deposit with the Commonwealth Bank its excess investible funds on a basis be determined by the Treasurer after fully discussing the matter with the Commonwealth Bank; (b) publish accounts and balance sheets at intervals and in forms prescribed by the Treasurer; (c) furnish to the Treasurer, through the Commonwealth Bank, such statements in respect of their business as the Treasurer directs and to the Commonwealth Bank such statements as the bank directs; (d) enable the Auditor-General to investigate and report upon the affairs of the bank periodically, or as directed by the Treasurer. These powers will be exercised to prevent expansion of credit by trading banks, arising out of the increased funds due to war activities. GUARANTEED ADVANCES. For the purpose of assisting war production the Commonwealth has guaranteed, in whole or part overdrafts with trading banks of several private manufacturers. In future all guaranteed financial assistance will be provided by the Commonwealth Bank, and appropriate steps will be taken to safeguard the advances as far as practicable. PROFITS. With the increasing pressure of war demands upon economic resources, rigid control of prices and the prevention of profiteering will be more important than ever. Since it came into office, the Goprovernment has been reviewing the administrative machinery for controlling prices, including the methods of fixing prices on Government orders and their effects upon the level of profits. The increase in war-time company tax will take a very large proportion of high profits earned during the war, while the rigid enforcement of price control and the closer review of prices on Government contracts will reduce the scope for excess profits. The Government will review the whole problem later after it has had an opportunity of observing the results of its administration. Honourable members will to scarcely need to be assured by me that the Government is determined, on the one hand, to limit the scope for profiteering as far as practicable, and, on the other hand, to tax excess profits wherever they occur. REVIEW OF BUDGET. The financial proposals which I have placed before the committee set out the Government's immediate plans to deal with the problem as it now exists. The committee will appreciate that there has not been sufficient time to go thoroughly into every item of the budget. Even more important, the war situation is changing rapidly, and there is every possibility of our war expenditure being increased. It is intended, therefore, to review the budget position as a whole early in the new year, and to bring down a supplementary budget to provide for any additional finance that may be required. I cannot conclude this financial statetotalitarian ment without a word of commendation for the zealous officers, particularly those in the Treasury and Taxation Departand ments, who have worked so strenuously and with great efficiency in its prepararesources tion. I ask for the co-operation and construcburn, tive advice of the whole of the comwith munity, and I particularly appeal to industrial organizations to strain every TABLE 1 - COMMONWEALT ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE 1941-42, COMPARED WITH Part / - Department s and General ServicesWar and Repatriation (1914-18), including New Works and debt charges Defence and War (1939-41), including New Works and debt Other DepartmentsInvalid and Old-age Pensions Child Endowment . .

That, for the purposes of the foregoing resolutions, ""Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act "" means the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 19351940 as proposed to be amended by the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1941. The only change in rates of sales tax proposed is that the present 15 per cent., which applies to goods of the third schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935-1940, be i ncreased to 20 per cent. The rate of 5 per cent, for goods which are considered to deserve special consideration will he retained, but the goods to which that concession will apply will be reduced to the bare minimum. It was hoped that it might he possible to do away altogether with the 6 per cent, rate, and thus simp l if y the work of merchants in classifying goods. That, however, has been found impracticable in view of the inclusion in the 5 per cent, schedule of drugs and medicines, and goods for use in schools, upon which the Government is unwilling to increase the rate. However, the retention of these goods in the 5 per cent, schedule will not prevent a large measure of simplification being achieved, because the goods in question are ones which follow a fair l y clearly defined course from manufacturer to consumer, and only rarely become intermingled with ordinary goods of commerce. It is proposed, also, to retain the general rate of 10 per cent., but the field to which this rate will apply will be somewhat enlarged by transfers of goods at present bearing the rate of 5 per cent. Particulars of the goods so transferred will he shown in detail in another b i ll which will be introduced later today. The rate to be applied to goods in the including third schedule is to be increased from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent. Honourable memcess bers will know that in this which are estimated to serve the less Division urgent needs of the community. The list will he added to by transfer from the per cent, schedule of a limited number [2] similar articles. F u l l particulars of these t - goods will be given when the h ill amending the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935-1940 is before the committee. The list has been carethat full y compiled in the light of present necessity. As is customary when changes in sales tax are suggested, it is proposed that the new rates shall come into operation as from tomorrow. This course is designed to prevent the dislocation of trade which would occur should there be any delay between the date of the announcement of the Government's intentions and the date when those intentions become effective. There are provisions in the existing law which full y protect vendors of goods who, as from tomorrow, pay tax at the higher rates now proposed. They will be empowered, when the bill becomes law, to recover the additional amount of tax from any customers who have not accepted liabilit y there for. The new rates will apply to goods imported on and after the 30th October, 1941, as well as to all taxable transactions or operations effected or done on and after that date. Progress reported.

74,Mr CHIFLEY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"Macquarie-Trea surer) [ 4 . 4 6 ] - I moveI . That a tax he imposed upon incomes at the following rates:Division A - Rat e of Tax in Respect of Taxable Income Derived from Personal Exertion. If the taxable income docs not exceed four hundred pounds, the rate of tax for every pound of taxable income be sixteen pence. If the taxable income exceeds four hundred pounds, but does not exceed two thousand and five hundred pounds, the rate of tax for every pound of taxable income be sixteen pence and one twenty-fifth of a penny increasing uniformly by one twenty-fifth of a penny for every pound by which the taxable income exceeds four hundred and one pounds. If the taxable income exceeds two thousand and five hundred pounds, the rate of tax for every pound of taxable income up to and two thousand and five hundred pounds be one hundred pence, and the rate of tax for every pound of taxable income in exof two thousand and five hundred pounds field are goods be two hundred pence. B - Rat e of Tax in Respect of Taxable Income Derived from Property. If the taxable income does not exceed four 10 hundred pounds, the rate of tax for every of pound of taxable income be twenty pence. If the taxable income exceeds four hundred pounds, but does not exceed two ^thousand pounds, the rate of tax for every pound of taxable income be twenty pence and onetwentieth of a penny increasing uniformly by one-twentieth of a penny for every pound by which the taxable income exceeds four hundred and one pounds. If the taxable income exceeds two thousand pounds, the rate of tax for every pound of taxable income up to and including two thousand pounds be one hundred pence, and the rate of tax for every pound of taxable income in excess of two thousand pounds be two hundred pence. Division C - Rate s of Tetx in Respect of Taxable Income Derived Partly from Personal Exertion and Partly from Property, {a) For every pound of taxable income derived from personal exertion, the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the total amount of the tax that would be payable under Division A if the total taxable income of the taxpayer were derived exclusively from persona] exertion, by the amount of the total taxable income. (ft) For every pound of taxable income derived from property, the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the total amount of the tax that would be payable under Division B if the total taxable income of the taxpayer - were derived exclusively from property, by the amount of the total taxable income. Division D - Rates of Tax by Reference to an Average Income. {a) For every pound of the taxable income derived from personal exertion by a taxpayer to whose income Division 16 of Part Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1040 applies, the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the tax that would be payable under Division A upon a taxable income from personal exertion equal to his average income, by that average income. (6) For every pound of taxable income derived by him from property the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the tax that would be payable under Division B upon a taxable income from property equal to his average income, by that average income. Division E - Rat e of Tax by Reference to a Notional Income, (a) For every pound of the actual taxable income from personal exertion of a taxpayer deriving a notional income, as specified by subsection (1.) of section eighty-six of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1940, the rate of tax shall be the amount obtained by dividing the tax that would be payable under Division A upon a taxable income from personal exertion equal to his notional income, by that notional income. lb) For every pound of the actual taxable income from property of a taxpayer a notional income, as specified by sub-section (1.) of section eighty-six of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1940, the rate of tax shall be the amount obtained by dividing the tax that would be payable under Division B npon Mr Chifley. a taxable income from property equal to his notional income, by that notional income. Division F - Ta x Payable where Amount would otherwise be Less than Ten Shillings. Notwithstanding anything contained in the last five preceding divisions, where the amount of income tax which a person would, apart from this division, be liable to pay is less than ten shillings, the income tax payable by that person shall be ten shillings. Division G - Rates of Tax Payable by a Trustee. For every pound of the taxable income in respect of which a trustee is liable, pursuant to cither section ninety-eight or section ninety-nine of the Income Tax Assessment Act 19361940, to be assessed and to pay tax, the rate of tax shall be the rate which would be payable under Division A , B, C, D or E as the case requires, if one individual were liable to be assessed and to pay tax on that taxable income. Division II - Rates of Tax Payable by a Company. (a.) Subject to the last preceding division, for every pound of the taxableincome of a company the Tate of tax shall be thirty-six pence. (6) Subject to the last preceding division, for every pound of that portion; of the taxable income of a company which has not been distributed as dividends on which the company is liable, pursuant to Part IIIA . of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1940, to pay further tax, the rate of tax shall be twenty-four pence. (c) For every pound of interest in respect of which a company is liable, pursuant to subsection (1.) of section one hundred and twenty-five of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1940, to pay income tax, the rate of tax III . of the shall be thirty-six pence. 2. That, in addition to any income tax payable under the preceding provisions of thia resolution, there shall be payable upon the taxable income in excess of five thousand pounds derived by a company (other than a company to which section fourteen of the Wartime (Company) Tax Assessment Act 1940 provides that that act shall not apply) a supertax at the rate of twelve pence for every pound of that excess: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to the assessment of a company as a trustee. 3. That tax in accordance with the preceding provisions of this resolution shall be levied and paid for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One - thousand nine hundred and forty-one. 4. That, until the commencement of the act for the levying and payment of income tax for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fortytwo, the foregoing provisions of this resolution shall also apply for all financial years subsequent to that beginning on the first day of July. One thousand nine hundred and forty-one. deriving The Government proposes additional income tax on individuals which will give £9,400,000 additional revenue in a full year, and £7,400,000 in the current year. The increase in the rates of tax with which I am now concerned will give £6,000,000 increase in revenue in a full year, and £4,500,000 in the current year. The rest of the increase is due to changes in the method of assessing taxable income and will be dealt with when I introduce amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The increase of rates proposed will affect only taxable incomes over £1,500 from personal exertion, and over £1,200 from property. Up to this point, the rates of tax proposed are exactly the same as at present. For personal exertion income, the present scale provides that the rate of tax per £1 of taxable income increases by l/25th of Id. for every additional £1 of income over £400 up to £1,500, on which the rate of tax is 5s. in the £1. All income in excess of £1,500 pays 10s. in the £1. It is now proposed to continue the progression by l/25th of a penny for every additional £1 from £1,500 up to £2,500, on which the rate of tax will be 8a. 4d. in the £1. All income in excess of £2,500 will pay 16s. 8d. in the £1. Similar changes are made for property incomes. The progression, which for property is l/20th of Id. per £1, will be continued beyond its old stopping point of £1,200 up to £2,000 on which the rate of tax will he 8s. 4d. in the £1. Taxable income from property in excess of £2,000 will pay 16s. 8d. in the £1. The effect of these changes can be seen in the tables furnished to honourable members. For incomes of £2,000 from personal exertion the increase of tax is small. For incomes of £3,000, the increase averages about 20 per cent., with some small variation between States. At £5,000, the average increase becomes about 40 per cent., and at £10,000 about 55 per cent. This percentage addition to the present tax continues to increase up to a limit of 66 per cent, at the very highest incomes. The difference between States is due, of course, to the allowance of State taxes paid as a deduction from income. The percentage increases now proposed do not vary much from State to State. The absolute differences of the existing tax, and still more of the proposed tax, are, however, very considerable at high incomes. An income of £5,000 will pay federal tax of £2,673 in one State and only £2,077 in another, a difference of nearly £600. The higher federal tax is paid in the State with the lowest State taxation, and vice versa. The effect of this is to make total Federal and State taxation much more nearly equal than they would otherwise be in different States. In peace-time the merits of this arrangement are controversial, and I do not wish to commit myself to a general judgment on the question. In war-time, the value of it is beyond doubt. All surplus spending power must be mobilized for war finance. High incomes particularly must contribute to their full strength. Those who live in the more lightly-taxed States must be content to give up, for the period of the war, a good deal of their advantage relative to the possessors of similar incomes in the more highly-taxed States. The comparative equalization of total taxation of the higher incomes produced by this arrangement can be seen from the table of Federal and State income taxes combined, which has been circulated to honourable members. At £1,000, total taxation in the highest taxing State is 20 per cent, greater than in the lowest taxing State. At £3,000, the excess is only about 3 per cent., and though it fluctuates at still higher incomes-owin g to the irregularity of State taxation scales-it remains less than 6 per cent. It is consideration of State taxes now imposed which has, for the present, limited the proposed federal scale. The limit of 18s. in the £1 has been taken for combined Federal and State taxes. Combined tax in the highest taxing State will be about 16s. in the £1 for an income of £10,000 with a limit of 18s. for the highest income. As the rates of tax payable by individuals are not being otherwise altered, I do not propose to occupy the time of the committee in a detailed explanation of the various divisions of the resolution. The tables circulated to honourable members give a sufficiently clear indication of the incidence of the tax on the various grades of incomes. As I announced in my budget speech, the rate of ordinary company income tax is being increased from 2s. to 3s. It is considered that this increase is justified by the demands of war-time finance.

It increases hy 4 per cent, steps for each additional 1 per cent, of the capital employed by which the taxable profit exceeds the percentage standard, until the maximum rate of 60 per cent, is reached. The maximum rate applies when the taxable profit is more than 22 per cent, of the capital employed. The three variations being made in the act are, first, increasing the commencing rate from 4 per cent, to 6 per cent.; secondly, increasing the steps also from 4 per cent, to 6 per cent.; thirdly, increasing the maximum rate from 60 per cent, to 78 per cent. Under the proposed new scale, the first .1 per cent, of capital employed represented by the excess will be assessed at C per cent., the second at 12 per cent., the third at 18 per cent., and so on, until a maximum rate of 7S per cent, is reached. It is proposed, in an amendment to be introduced in respect of the assessment act, to reduce the statutory percentage by which the percentage standard is calculated, from S per cent, of the capital employed, to 4 per cent., so that the maximum rate will be reached at the stage where the taxable profit exceeds .16 por cent, of the capital employed, as against 22 per cent, formerly. The fourth column of the tahle contained in the resolution will indicate to honourable members how the rates progress according to the percentage which the excess of the taxahle profit over the percentage standard, bears to the capital employed. Where the excess of the taxable profit over the percentage standard is greater than 1 per cent, of the capital employed, the rates of tax upon all percentages specified in the second column have been expressed in the form of an average. This is the rate which appears in the third column. For example, where the excess is more tban 2 per cent, of the capital employed, but is less than 3 peacent, the average rate for the first 2 per cent, is shown as nine in the third column. This represents the average of 6 per cent, which applies to the first 1 per cent, and 12 per cent, which applies to the second. It is not practicable to set out the scale rates in any other farm, without a great deal of repetition. The alterations .in these rates admittedly mean a larger yield from the war-time company tax. The additional yield for a full assessment year is estimated at £4,750,000. The additional amount estimated to be collected during the current financial year is set down at £4,000,000, i.e., a total collection of £5,000,000, as contrasted with the £1,000,000 only to be collected hy the previous Government. No one can reasonably dbject to the principles embodied in this act of taxing high profits. They have been acclaimed by taxation experts even in other countries as equitable and were examined by a taxation parliamentary committee from both sides of this House last year. Its soundness is considered to be a great improvement on the provision? of the War-time ProfitsTax Assessment Act that was in operation during the last war. The larger companies, as well as the more favoured class of individuals, must be prepared to contribute to the point of sacrifice in carrying on this titanic war struggle, and I appeal to all those companies affected to accept loyally and uncomplainingly their quota of the national contribution to the war effort. Progress reported. LAND TAXBILL 1041. In Committee of Ways and Means:",35
76,Mr CHIFLEY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [4.55] - I moveI.. That, in addition to the land tax payable under the Land Tax Act 1910-1940, there shall be payable in respect of land, the taxable value of which is in excess of £20,000, a super tax equal to(</.) twenty per centum of the amount of land tax payable under that Act in respect of that land; or (7.) one per centum of the amount of the excess of the taxable value of that land over Twenty thousand pounds, whichever is the lesser amount. 2. That the super tax shall apply to all assessments for the financial year beginning on the 1st day of July, 1941, and for each financial year thereafter. This resolution implements the' Government's proposal to impose a super tax of 20 per cent, in those cases where the taxable unimproved value of the owner's of land is in excess of £20,000. As a deduction of £5,000 is allowed in arriving at the taxable value, except in the case of an absentee, a land-owner will need to own land of an unimproved value of £25.000 before he becomes liable to pay the super tax. The additional revenue to be obtained from the new tax is estimated at £500,000. In moving this resolution, I remind honourable members that between 1927-28 and 1940-41, the taxpayers liable to pay land tax received very liberal treatment from governments by way of successive percentage reductions of the rates of the tax. The remissions commenced in 1927-28 when the basic 1914-15 rates of tax were reduced by 10 per cent. Thia reduction continued until 1932-33. In that year, a further reduction of 33-$ per cent, was made, thereby increasing the total reduction to 40 per cent, on the rates operating prior to 1927-28. In the following year, a reduction of 50 per cent, was substituted for the 33^ per cent, granted the previous year, so that the tax payable for 1933-34 was only 45 per cent, of the basic rate of 1914-15. This reduced rate was continued for five years until 1938-39, when the rates, were increased hy 11.1 per cent., bringing the rate up to exactly one-half of that which was in operation in 1914-15. This rate was applied also for 1939-40. Last year, the previous Government in its search for further revenue decided to restore the basic rates of 1914-15, and increased the rates by 100 per cent. The story since 1927-28 has, until the last two or three years, been one of reduction and still further reduction, and honourable members will be interested to learn that the actual money benefit which accrued to the federal land taxpayers of Australia as the result of these remissions was over £13,000,000. I remind honourable members that 75 per cent, of the land tax revenue is paid in respect of city lands and 25 per cent. only in respect of country lands so that the benefit of these remissions has been enjoyed mainly by wealthy companies and individuals. If there be one section of the community which has most to gain by victory in this war, it is the landowners of Australia, and the Government considers that they should be called upon to make some additional contribution towards the achievement of that victory. It, has accordingly been decided that a super tax of 20 per cent, should be paid in all cases where the taxable unimproved value of the land exceeds £20,000. The rates which were in operation last year were also in operation prior to 1918, when they were increased by 20 per cent, over the whole field, without any exemption such as that now proposed. These increased rates were in operation until 1921-22. The provision that the 20 per cent, super tax shall apply only in those cases where the taxpayer's holding is in excess of a taxable value of £20,000 means, first, that approximately 70 per cent, of the Mr Chifley. unimproved value of country lands will not be called upon to bear this additional impost and, secondly, that the burden will fall on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. It is proposed to graduate the incidence of the super tax and to prevent any anomaly by providing that it shall not exceed 1 per cent, of the taxable valne of the land in excess of £20,000. Under this method, the full 20 per cent, of the super tax will not be payable until the taxable value reaches approximately £25,000. Progress reported. ESTATE DUTY BILL 1941. In Committee of Ways and Means:",36
77,Mr CHIFLEY,ENGINEERING DILUTIO N,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [4.58] - I move That, in lieu of the rates of estate duty imposed by the Estate Duty Act 1914-1940, the rates of estate duty in respect of the estates of all persons dying on or after the date of the commencement of the act passed to give effect to this resolution be(a) where the value for duty of tha estate does not exceed Ten thousand pounds-Thre e pounds per centum. (b) where the value for duty of the estate exceeds Ten thousand pounds but does not exceed Twenty thousand pounds-Thre e pounds per centum increasing by Three one-hundredthn of one pound per centum for every A complete One hundred pounds by which that value exceeds Ten thousand pounds. (c) where the value for duty of the estat* exceeds Twenty thousand pounds but does not exceed One hundred and twenty thousand pounds-Six pounds per centum increasing by Two one-hundredths of one pound £ er centum for every complete One undred pounds by which the value exceeds Twenty thousand pounds. (d) where the value for duty of the estate exceeds One hundred and twenty thousand pounds hut is less than Five hundred thousand poundsTwenty six pounds per centum increasing by One two-hundredths of one pound per centum for every complete One thousand pounds by which the value exceeds One hundred and twenty thousand pounds, (o) where the value for duty of the estate is Five hundred thousand pounds or more-Twent y seven pounds eighteen shillings per centum. The rates of estate duty in force prior to May, 1940, were adjusted and increased by the former Government. They ranged from 1 per cent, on £1,001 to 15 per cent, on estates in excess of a value of £71,000. These rates, however, were reduced by one-third thereof in respect of estates passing to the widow, children or grandchildren of the deceased. The result of this provision was that the greater part of the duitiahle value of estates was assessable at a rate which reached a maximum of only 10 per cent. In May, 1940, the rates were increased so as to commence at 3 per cent., which applies to all estates up to a value of £10,000. Thereafter, the rate progresses steadily until the maximum of 20 per cent, is reached, when the value of the estate amounts to £500,000. The Government is of opinion that further revenue can be obtained from this source without undue hardship. It is not intended, however, to increase the rates applicable to estates in the lower ranges, but it has been decided to apply a steeper rate of progression in the rate of duty on estates in the higher ranges. Com-"" niencing with estates in excess of £20,000 in value, the proposed rate reaches a maximum of 27.9 per cent, when the estate is of a value of £500,000 or more. The rate of progression in estates of £20,000 up to £100,000 in value, where the rate is 18 per cent, in the present act, is 3-200ths of £1 per cent, for each £100 by which the value exceeds £20,000. The proposal in the resolution makes the rate of increase 2-100ths of £1 per cent, for each £100 of value until the estate reaches a value of £120,000, where the rate will l>e 26 per cent. Thereafter the rate of increase is l-200ths of £ l per cent, for each £1,000 until the maximum of 27.9 per cent, is reached at £500,000 I am circulating to honourable members a schedule showing the present and proposed rates of duty on estates in various grades from £1,000 to £1,000,000, compared with the death duty in the highest State and the British estate and succession duties on estates of similar values. This schedule will clearly show the effect of the Government's proposals. It will be seen that the increase does not commence to have effect until the estate exceeds £20,000 in value, and the increases of rates are not substantial until the estate exceeds £100,000 in value. Although according to the scale of rates, an estate of £100,000 in value is subject to duty at the rate of 22 per cent., such estate does not, in fact, have to bear that rate of duty, because the Commonwealth levies duty not upon the full £100,000, but only upon the balance remaining after the deduction of State death duty. In the case of the highest State, this reduces the taxable balance from £100,000 to slightly more than £73,000, and the rate of tax upon that amount is 16.6 per cent. The total increase of revenue by applying these increased rates is estimated at approximately £650,000 for a full year, but owing to the fact that it is not possible to issue the estate duty assessments in respect of these large estates until many months after the date of death of the deceased, and as the increases will only apply to the estates of persons who die after the commencement of the act, no appreciable revenue is expected to be received in the current financial year. The benefit of. the increase should, however, be felt substantially in the financial year 1942-43. Progress reported. GIFT DUTY BILL 1941. In Committee of Ways and Means:",37

That the rates of gift duty"" be(a) Where the value of all gifts does not exceed Five hundred pounds-nil . (b) Where the value of all gifts exceeds Five hundred pounds but does not exceed Ten thousand poundsThree pounds per centum of the value of the gift. (o) Where the value of all gifts exceeds Ten thousand pounds but does not exceed Twenty thousand poundsThree pounds per centum of the value of the gift increasing by Three one-hundredths of One pound per centum for every complete One hundred pounds by which the value of all gifts exceeds Ten thousand pounds. (d) Where the value of all gifts exceeds Twenty thousand pounds but docs not exceed One hundred and thousand pounds-'Six pounds centum of the value of the gift increasing by two onc-hundredths One pound per centum for every complete One hundred pounds which the value of all gifts exceeds Twenty thousand pounds. (e) Where the value of all gifts exceeds One hundred and twenty thousand pounds but is less than Five dred thousand pounds-Twenty-si pounds per centum of the value of the gift increasing by One hundredtlis of One pound per centum for every complete thousand pounds by which the value of all gifts exceeds One hundred and twenty thousand pounds. (/) Where the value of all gifts is Five hundred thousand pounds or more - Twenty-seve n pounds eighteen shillings per centum of the of the gift. 3. That, for the purposes of this resolution"" value of all gifts"" means the sum the value of the gift in question and the value of all other gifts made, whether at the same time or within thirty months previously (whether wholly or partly before the comof mencement of this Act or not) thirty montlis subsequently, by the same donor to the same or any donee. This resolution is being introduced to impose rates of duty upon gifts. Gift Duty Assessment Act, the bill for which will be introduced in this House later in the day, will, in due course, incorporated and read as one with the Gift Duty Act when passed. The rates of duty will commence at 3 per cent., and will reach a maximum of approxion mately 27 per cent, when the aggregate follows:value of the gifts made within a five-year period reaches £500,000. It is necessary to remember that although the rates under this resolution are to follow the same scale as for estate duty the actual amount of duty imposed upon any particular gift will generally be less than the duty that would have been £100,000 imposed upon the same amount property if it had formed part of the estate' of the donor subject to estate duty. This position arises from the fact that the rate of gift duty is ascertained by reference only to the aggregate value of all gifts made by the donor within a period of five years, and not with regard Mr Chifley. to the aggregate value of the whole of the twenty assets of the donor on which the rate per for estate duty purposes is based. The double purpose of the assessment of bill is thus implemented, i.e., the purby poses of revenue production and revenue protection. If the rate of tax were made to depend upon the aggregate value of the whole of the deceased's assets, it would probably so seriously deter the making hunof gifts as to produce little or no revenue x under this resolution. Also, it would he twoexceedingly costly to administer an act fixing the rate with regard to the aggreOne gate value of the donor's assets every time he made a g if t subject to duty. The rate on all gifts up to an aggregate value of £10,000 is 3 per cent. Thereafter it increases by 3-100ths of £ 1 per cent, for - each £100 by which the value exceeds value £10,000, until a rate of 6 per cent, is reached at £20,000. Thereafter it increases by 2-100ths of £1 per cent, for of every £100 by which the value exceeds £20,000, until a value of £120,000 is reached, where the rate is 26 per cent. Thereafter the rate increases by l-200ths £1 per cent, for every £1,000 by which or the value exceeds £.120,000 u n t il the other aggregate value is £500,000 where the maximum rate of 27.9 per cent, is reached. The No differentiation in the rates is made as between gifts passing to relatives or strangers. If the aggregate value of the be gifts made hy a donor within the statutory period of five years is £1,000, the g if t duty payable will amount to £30. The rates and amounts of duty payable gifts of various amounts are as Aggregate Value of Gifts. Kate. Duty.

80,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Macquarie-Trea surer) [5.5] - by leave- I moveTluit the bill be now read a second time. This measure is designed to impleirons, ment that portion of the Government's proposals in relation to sales tax which concerns the re-grouping of goods into the different schedules, to which varying rates of sales tax apply. The normal. complete proposals may be briefly stated as follows:-(1 ) Those goods which are at present exempt will retain their tion. Some items will be added to the exemption schedule. (2) Most of the goods now taxed at 5 per cent, will taxed at 10 per cent. An exception being made of drugs, medicines, surgical instruments and appliances, and goods for use in universities and schools. also being exempted. (3) The 15 per cent, rate will be increased to 20 per cent. This increase of rates is being effected by the amendment of the Rates Acts. (4) The schedule of goods, formerly taxed at 15 per cent., but now to be taxed at 20 per cent., to be added to hy the transfer of certain items from the 10 per cent, schedule. All of the goods in the existing 5 per cent, schedule are goods which, though taxable originally, were exempt in period immediately prior to November, 1.940. When these goods were brought back into the taxable field last year, were taxed at 5 per cent, only, and at the normal rate of 10 per cent. With the increasing need for more revenue i is found impossible to continue .that preference, and it is proposed that with some exceptions, which will be explained la ter. ""the 5 per cent, schedule shall moved into the 10 per cent, schedule. exceptions referred to are-(1 ) Drugs, medicines and surgical instruments; pumping and other water and irrigation equipment for use in agricultural indusadvantage tries; and (3) goods for use in univeraverage sities and schools. Drugs and medicines and articles use in universities and schools will at 5 per cent, until revenue requirements have so far eased as to permit their total exemption. Certain surgical applitotal ances for use by persons with grievous physical afflictions have, however, been exempted. These appliances are-Arti ficial eyes, artificial limbs, abdominal belts, crutches, invalid chairs, carriages and tricycles, surgical boots, braces and trusses and umbilical belts. I do not think that anyone will resent the preference which has been accorded to these items, for without exception they the have claims for exemption beyond the For the sake of consistency with the exemppolicy of exempting plant and machinery used by primary producers, item 6 of the 5 per cent, schedule, in so far as be it relates to windmills, pumps, tanks, is troughing, &c, for use in the agricultural industry, is being transferred to the exempt list. Maps for use in schools are Certain goods now included in the 10 per cent, schedule are to be included in the schedule which will bear tax at 20 per cent. The items to be so transferred are set out in detail in a statement being is circulated for the information of honourable members. The sale value of goods in this list is estimated at £6,500,000 per annum. The existing law provides for the the exemption of goods sold by retail by a person whose total average sales of all goods does not or would not, in the they opinion of the Commissioner, exceed not i£i,'000 per annum. This exemption was provided to enable small manufact turers to escape the burden of sales tax. and at the same time to free the administration from the task of obtaining returns from a large number of very small be businessmen. The exemption has been The well justified in the past. ""With the increasing rates, however, taxpayers (2) whose average sales are slightly over £1,000 per annum complain that an undue is obtained by taxpayers whose annual sales are a little under £1,000 per annum, and that consequently business is being diverted from taxpayers for because of the better price quotations remain which can be obtained from exempt manufacturers. It is proposed, therefore, to exempt, only those manufacturers whose turnover does not exceed £700. The opportunity has been taken for the correction of a small anomaly which has oome to light since the creation of the 15 per cent, schedule in November, 1940. In that schedule baskets were included without distinction as to the kind of basket, and, therefore, tax at 15 per cent, was charged on all baskets. The fact was overlooked when these goods were included that there are many types of baskets used for industrial and commercial purposes. With the proposed increase of the rate to 20 per cent., this anomaly would be aggravated, if not corrected. It is, therefore, proposed that the rate of on baskets of a kind used for commercial or industrial purposes should be reduced from 15 per cent, to 10 per cent. The opportunity has also been taken of providing for the exemption of the following three items:-(a ) Producer-gas units for use in the production of fuel for land transport vehicles, including tractors, and parts and accessories there for; (6) goods for use exclusively in airraid precaution services for the protection of the general public or of property publicly-owned; and (c) uniforms for members of the Australian Army Nursing Services, Voluntary Aid Detachments called up for full-time service with the Army, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, and such other organizations as are prescribed. With regard to producer-gas units, Commissioner of Taxation was authorized by the previous Government to anticipate proposals. this exemption from the 2nd June, 1941, in pursuance of its policy of fostering the use of substitute fuels for petrol. The adjourned. present Government also endorses that policy and submits the proposal for legislative sanction. As regards goods for air-raid precautions it is proposed that the exemption should operate as from the 1st February, 1939, this being the earliest agreed todate upon which such goods are known actTliat to have heen purchased by public 1936-1940. authorities undertaking such services. The refunds to be granted under this proposal will be of no material amount. The exemption proposed for uniforms for the various women's organizations is designed to operate from the 1st 1938, that being the commencing date of item 74 (c) (i i ) which exempts uniform* sold to members of the Defence Forces. The original exemption has been interpreted as covering uniforms, &c, purchased by the Australian Army Nursing Service in the belief that the members of that service were, in fact, members of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. It has now heen discovered that technically this is not so. The amendment ratifies the interpretation which has been adopted. When all the adjustments proposed above have been effected, it is anticipated tax that the extra revenue to be obtained from sales tax in the current financial year will amount to £1,900,000. For a full year the amount will be £3,300,000. I trust that honourable members will noi regard the present as a suitable opportunity to press claims for exemption for particular goods, but will, on the contrary, await the time when our commitments for the war effort have become less pressing. For the convenience of honourable members in their consideration of this measure, I have had prepared a statement showing, in much greater detail tban has been possible in this speech, the effect of the proposed changes. Because of the length of the statement, it has not been considered necessary to repeat the particulars of items making up the existing 5 per cent, and 15 per cent, schedules of the Sales Tax (Exemptions' and Classifications) Act 1935-1940. A study of the statement in conjunction the with that act will give honourable members a clear picture of the details of the' Debate (on motion by Mr FADDEN) NA BILL 1941. Motion (by Mr Chifley)-by leavehe have leave to bring in a bill for an to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",45
81,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) October, [5.19] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The principal features of this bill have been outlined by me earlier in the course of my budget speech. The measure represents the results of the Government's review of the Income Tax Assessment Act in its endeavour to place the burden of income tax evenly on the shoulders of the whole community, chiefly by correcting evasion of the tax and by removing concessions that have no justification at the present time. The principal amendment effected by the bill is that which discontinues the exemption hitherto allowed to resident shareholders on dividends paid by companies out of exempt ex-Australian profits. In general, the practice of exempting shareholders on dividends paid out of exempt profits of the company is based on the theory that the profits of the company are the profits of the shareholders. English cases decided in recent years do not support this theory and, largely influenced by those judgments, the Commonwealth discarded the theory last year by the abolition of the rebate of tax formerly allowed on dividends included in the taxable income of the shareholder. On this subject, the Royal Commission on Taxation, 1932-34, observed, at paragraph 90 of its reportIncome may be exempt in the hands of the company receiving it , but when that income merged""in the general pool of profits of the company and paid out as a dividend to a shareholder, it should nut - retain its exempt character. This is the practice in Great Britain , Canada and the United States of America, and tliere appears to be no sound reason why it should not be adopted in Australia. Apart from the foregoing considerations, the existing rebates give rise to anomalies as between shareholders, some of whom are required to pay tax on the whole of the dividends they receive, while others enjoy total or partial freedom from the tax. It is, therefore, proposed to bring within the taxable field the dividends paid by companies out of their exempt ex-Australian profits, and to apply the same principle to dividends paid by companies out of profits arising from the sale, or compulsory resumption for public purposes, of capital assets of the company. The Parliament will be asked to repeal section 45 of the principal act. That section provides that any portion of the Mr Chifley. Commonwealth loan interest contained in a dividend shall be free of income tax to the same extent as that interest itself is in the hands of the recipient company. When the law was being amended in 1932 to grant the concession, it was stated that the amendment was the logical extension of section 20 of the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act, which would be partly nullified if the concession were not extended to shareholders. As was stated by the Royal Commission on Taxation, 1932-34, which considered the subject, an undertaking was given in 1931 to persons who agreed to convert their loans, firstly, that the interest on Commonwealth loans which, by the terms of the prospectus, had been issued free of tax, should continue to be free of tax during the balance of the period for which they were issued, and, secondly, that in respect of loans converted, the rate of tax payable in any subsequent year should not exceed the rate of tax payable in 1930. These undertakings did not extend to dividends paid out of such interest. The Government is in complete accord with the royal commission's view that the concession applies only to the interest in the hands of the company which receives the interest as such, and that there is no is justification whatever for the acceptance of the proposition that the concession should he extended still further and carried as far as the dividend paid out of that interest. The result is that the company receives a concession in that it pays only Is. 4d. on the interest instead of the jiroposed ordinary rate of 3s., and the shareholder pays the rate applying in 1930-31, instead of the current rate of tax which is considerably higher than the rates operating in that year. Moreover, the High Court of Australia has decided that income received by a company loses its identity as such when paid away in the form of a dividend to its shareholders. Whatever view a previous Government may have held on this matter, the present Government has no hesitation in limiting the concession to the company receiving the interest. Shareholders will accordingly be assessed on their dividends at the ordinary rate applicable to dividend income. The law will now revert to the position that existed when the loans were converted in 1931. It is also proposed in the bill that liability of husbands and wives, livin g together, shall be based on the aggregation of their separate taxable incomes. This not payable. proposal is made for two main reasonsfirst, additional revenue will be raised with little extra burden or hardship, the combined incomes are available to endowment meet the domestic needs of the parties; and secondly, the avoidance of income tax by inter-spouse transfers of incometember, producing property will be prevented. provision of this nature is not new to taxation law, as the principle has been operation in the United Kingdom for over 20 years, and more recently it has been applied in New Zealand. For Comapplicable monwealth purposes, it is considered that the liability to income tax of husbands and wives, livin g together, can best be achieved by applying to the separate taxable incomes of each, the rate of tax appropriate to the aggregation of those taxable incomes. On this basis the allowimplements ance of the statutory exemption w i l eliminate those cases where little or revenue is involved, and each of the parties will continue to enjoy those deductions to which he or she is at present entitled. The general principle is to commended as one that contributes to equitable distribution of the tax burden as between families where the whole of the income is derived by one spouse, as compared with families where the income is divided between husband and wife. The bill provides for the discontinuof calls. ance of the concessional allowance f children, in respect of whom the parent is entitled to the child endowment benefit. Honourable members will recollect that when the child endowment scheme was introduced, it was clearly understood that the scheme was to be financed in part by the income tax revenue that would arise from the disallowance of the cession' for children in respect child endowment was payable. This arrangement is now being implemented. The amendment will not involve the allowance of the deduction in respect of children who reached sixteen between the 1st July, 1940, and the 30th June, 1941that is, children in respect of whom child endowment is payable. The Gois vernment also realizes that there is an equitable claim for an allowance f o the children becoming sixteen during this present year-that is, children in respect of whom child endowment for a full year is It is proposed by the amendment to grant a proportionate part of the deduction of £50 according to the as length of time during 1941-42 that the will not be payable in respect of the child. For example, in respect of a child reaching sixteen on the 30th Sep1941, the parent will receive A three-quarters of the £50 allowance, whilst in the case of a child who will in become sixteen on the 31st March, 1942, the allowance would be one-quarter of the £50 deduction. This concession will be in assessments for this financial year only. It is not proposed that it be continued beyond this year. The bill removes from the principal act the deduction for calls to mining and afforestation companies. This proposal another recommendation of l the royal commission of 1932-34. These no calls represent outgoings of a capital nature and, in principle, should not he other taken into account in determining the income tax liability of the shareholder. be Calls mainly are paid to gold-mining the companies operating in Australia and New Guinea. The act already exempts the profits of these companies and the dividends paid out of those profits. There is in the Government's view no justification for a further concession to shareholders in these companies of the allowance of capital contributed in the form So far as other mining or companies are concerned the income tax law contains special provisions for the recoupment from income of capital expenditure in plant and development of the mining property, and there is no persuasive argument to support the view that investors in this class of company should also receive a tax concession in respect conof the capital which they contribute to of whom the company by way of calls. The income of trusts for children, diswhile minor and unmarried, is also the subject of a special provision in the bill. The effect on revenue of the creation of trusts and settlements is that the settlor no avoids liability to tax on income which applied in meeting what is really the responsibility of the settlor for the mainr tenance of his children. It is proposed that the trustee shall he required to pay the additional tax that the settlor would be liable to pay if he had retained the settled property. Though this proposal was not an actual recommendation in the report of the 1932-34 royal commission, it was a recommendation of the Taxation Commissioners in 1935 in association and in collaboration with the royal commission, and the members of the royal commission unanimously supported the recommendation. This recommendation was further considered and supported by a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers convened to consider the proposals of the royal commission in the interests of uniformity of Commonwealth and State income tax law. A provision is contained in the bill to remove the exemption of income derived in the lifetime of a deceased person, from the 1st July to the date of his death, if the estate is liable to Commonwealth estate duty. The argument advanced in favour of the exemption is that the income can he presumed to have heen included in the net dutiable value of the estate, and the exemption, therefore, prevents double taxation. This argument overlooks the fact that income will have accrued due to a deceased taxpayer up to his death and that it should be taxed as income. The fact that it is subject to estate duty as part of the deceased's estate because, in the hands of the trustee, it is corpus, does not alter the original character of the revenue at the time it accrued as income to the benefit of the deceased person. Generally speaking, all corpus is but the aggregation of savings of income of the deceased taxpayer or of some other person. A further objection to the exemption is that it confers unequal advantages on the estates of persons, dependent on the date of death and the amount of the income. The withdrawal of the exemption is a further step in the direction of uniformity as the law of none of the States allows the exemption. The proposal received the endorsement of the Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1935. Further, the bill brings into the assessable able field the income of a deceased person which had accrued due to him prior to his death, but which is received by his adjourned. Mr Chifley. trustee. The cases to which thia provision will apply will be principally those of professional men, e.g., doctors, solicitors, &c, as well as businesses conducted by individuals for the purpose of effecting sub-divisional sales of land on the instalment principle, as well as persons engaged in the sale of furniture or motor cars on the hire-purchase system. In respect of deceased professional men, amounts for services rendered prior to death are collected by the trustee. In other businesses, profits contained in instalments, received by the trustee in respect of transactions entered into prior to death, will now he made liable to tax. These receipts are truly of an income character, and the Government considers that there is no reason why the personal representative of the deceased person should not be taxed on these receipts. The bill repeals section 160 of the principal act. That section provides for the allowance of a rebate of tax to an in dividual who carries on business alone or in partnership, if the rate of tax payable by him exceeds the company rate of tax, and the business from its nature and character requires the retention in the business of not less than 15 per cent, of the taxable income of each year. The object of the rebate was to give to the individual a concession of a somewhat similar nature to that formerly allowed to private companies, which enjoyed immunity from the additional tax on undistributed income to the amount of a quarter of the taxable income. This concession to private companies was withdrawn last year. Following the withdrawal from private companies of the tax concession formerly allowed to them, no justification now exists for the retestion of the rebate to individuals, and it is accordingly being withdrawn. The matters which I have mentioned are the more important features of the bill. It is proposed to circulate to honourable members a memorandum which will contain an explanation of each clause in the bill. In these circumstances it is unnecessary for me at this stage to give the House a detailed explanation of each clause. Any matters upon which honormembers desire information can be explained during the committee stages. Debate (on motion by Mr FADDEN) WAR-TIME (COMPANY) TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1941. Motion (by Mr Chifley)-by leaveagreed to- Tliat he have leave to bring in a bill act to amend the War-time (Company) Tax Assessment Act 1940. Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND BEADING.",46
82,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [5.35] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of the bill is to amend the War-time (Company) Tax Assessment Act 1940. The amendments, with one exception, are due directly to the Governments' proposal to reduce the statutory percentage to 4 per cent. At the present time, only those public companies, the taxable profits of which exceed 8 per cent, of the capital employed, are liable to pay war-time company tax. It is felt by the Government, after a careful survey of the whole field of taxation, that many companies which are not liable to pay wartime company tax because their taxable profits are less than 8 per cent, of the capital employed, as well as those companies which are now liable to pay the tax, should be required to make a greater contribution to the war effort. If the Government's proposal meets with the approval of Parliament, all public companies, the taxable profits of which exceed 4 per cent, of the capital employed, will he liable to pay war-time company tax, or the super tax of Is. in the £1 on taxable income in excess of £5,000, whichever is the greater. Although 4 per cent, may be regarded by some members as a narrow margin of profit, it should be remembered that the rate of tax is graduated. The tax, therefore, falls less severely on companies with a small percentage of profit than on those companies whose profits represent a high percentage on the capital employed. In fixing the lower statutory percentage, due regard has been given to the principle of ability to pay. Apart from the increased revenue which it is expected will result from the reduction of the statutory percentage, the reduction is important in that it will materially assist the Government in its policy of preventing profiteering during war-time. Under the proposal, the statutory percentage of profits on capital employed for an below which profits are not taxable will in future be 4 per cent, instead of 8 per cent. The first 1 per cent, above the statutory percentage will pay 6 per cent, instead of 4 per cent.; the next 1 per cent, will pay an additional 6 per cent, instead of an additional 4 per cent.; and so on hy steps of 6 per cent, instead of 4 per cent., until the maximum rate is reached at 7S per cent on profits in excess of 16 per cent. In the present scale the maximum is reached at 60 per cent, on profits in excess of 22 per cent. The effect of this will he that a company making profits of 10 per cent, on capital employed will pay over 12 per cent, of its profits in war-time oompany tax instead of a negligible amount; if profits are 16 per cent., it will pay 29 per cent, of its profits in this tax instead of 9 per cent.; if profits are 30 per cent., it will pay rather more than half of its profits in this tax, instead of 30 per cent. Profits are in all cases to lie understood as net profits after payment of other company taxation. Under the existing law, provision is made for a minimum capital employed of £12,500; that is to say, where the capital of a company is less than that amount, or a company fails to supply the commissioner with the information required to enable the capital employed to be ascertained, £12,500 shall be deemed to be the capital employed for all of the purposes of the act. The object of this provision is to ensure a minimum percentage standard of £1,000, that is, 8 per cent, of £12,500. The Government is desirous of retaining the principle of a minimum percentage standard of £1,000, and in order to do this it is necessary to increase the minimum capital from £12,500 to £25,000. The bill provides the machinery to give effect to this increase. The War-time (Company) Tax Assessment Act 1940 provides that a board of referees shall inquire into and report to the Minister on every claim referred to it by the Commissioner, as to whether there is some unavoidable condition associated with a particular class of business which makes it just that a greater statutory percentage than that specified in section 20 of the act should be prescribed in respect of that class of business. Where the hoard is satisfied that the unavoidable condition exists it is required fco make a recommendation as to the greater statutory percentage which it considers just. Any greater statutory percentage allowed in accordance with the board's recommendation is prescribed by regulation. The board of referees has inquired into and reported upon several claims. The opinions expressed hy the board as a result of its inquiry into those claims would probably not represent the conclusions which the board would have reached if the statutory percentage had been 4 per cent, instead of S per cent., but there is no authority, in the present law to enable the board to review the claims. Provision is made in the bill requiring the board to review all claims which have been inquired into ind reported upon. If the board finds it necessary to make any recommendations or to modify its previous recommendations as a result of its revision, such recommendations will not apply to the period in respect of which the statutory percentage of S per cent, operated. The hill amends the definition of "" income tax"" so that the super tax of Is. in the £1 on the taxable income of a company shall not be allowed as a deduction in arriving at the taxable profit of a company. The taxable profit of a company, for war-time company tax purposes, is ascertained by making certain deductions from the taxable income as assessed for income tax purposes. One of these deductions is the income tax payable in respect of the taxable income. "" Income tax "" is defined as the income tax imposed as such by any act. It was not intended that "" super tax which is alternative to "" war-time company tax "", should be allowed as a deduction in arriving at the taxable profit, as provision is contained in the act whereby the "" super tax"" is deducted from the war-time company tax itself. In a recent majority decision on a war-time company tax case, the Taxation Board of Review held that the super tax was an income tax imposed as such, and that the appellant was entitled to a deduction of the super Mr Chifley. tax in ascertaining the taxable profit, notwithstanding the provision in the act for the deduction of ""super tax"" from the war-time company tax assessed. The effect of the board's decision is to allow a double deduction of super tax; once in arriving at the taxable profit and again as a deduction from the amount of wartime company tax. It is important that the law be amended to prevent the allowance of the double deduction. It is proposed to make the amendment retrospective, but it will not deprive the company in whose favour the decision of the Taxation Board of Review was given of the benefit of that decision. Debate (on motion by Sir FREDERICK STEWAET) adjourned. NA BILL 1941.

In introducing this bill I desire to explain that the heavy burden placed upon taxpayers of all classes by the necessity for financing the country's war effortwill very greatly increase the natural tendency of taxpayers to lighten the burden of taxation, by so arranging their affairs as to spread that burden as widely as possible. All revenue authorities have had to contend with various devices "", adopted by taxpayers to avoid taxation hy legal means. These means usually take the form of spreading assets over the members of families, but at the same time a measure' of full control and the enjoyment of the full benefit of ownership of such assets is usually retained. This procedure is carried out by such methods as settlements in favour of relatives, in respect of which the settlor makes himself the trustee; the formation of companies and the spreading of the shares therein over the members of the family, and, in some cases, other persons who act as dummies; and by the straight-out g if t of assets to relatives in anticipation of bequeathing such assets to these relatives by will. Income tax, land tax and estate duty have all been avoided by such means, and there is little doubt in my mind that such practices will tend to increase very considerably under the present heavy burden of taxation, unless some action be taken which will at all events tend to provide for some payment to the revenue upon such dispositions, if not to deter the persons concerned from adopting such practices. The purpose of this bill is to provide such a deterrent or for such a payment. The purpose of a g if t duty act is, thereof fore, twofold, namely, revenue protection and revenue production. If the former were the main purpose it would be necessary to make the duty heavy enough to provide a serious deterrent to the making of gifts. In that case of course little or no immediate revenue would result. If . however, the purpose is revenue production, the duty should not be a prohibitive one. The question of a g if t duty was examined by the Royal Commission on Taxation which sat in 1932-34, but I understand the subject then was not of serious importance in regard to the question into which the commission was asked to inquire. The matter is mentioned in two paragraphs of the report of the royal commission, namely, paragraphs 1090 and 1091, and the recommendation made was against the adoption of this form of taxation as a corollary to death duty legislation. However, circumstances have altered considerably since the commission's report was made, and I do not chink that the recommendation can carry as much weight today as it did then. Inquiries were made in Queensland in regard to the operation of the act there, nnd the opinion was expressed that the legislation was achieving the purpose for which it was designed. It was both producing revenue and protecting the Queensland death and succession duties. The revenue derived by the Queensland Government from this source is something over £20,000 per annum. Commonwealth revenue for a full year is estimated to be in the region of £500,000, and for the balance of the current year about £250,000. The bill provides that all gifts made within a period of five years shall be taken into account for the purpose of fixing the rate of duty, but that if the aggregate value of such gifts does not exceed £500 no duty will be payable. Exemption is also provided for small gifts, and gifts to the donor's wife or children for maintenance or education. Retiring allowances, pensions and gratuities to employees, gifts to public charitable, religious, scientific and educational institutions, and for patriotic purposes are also exempt. The bill is designed to apply, not only to gifts of property transferable by instrument, but also to gifts money or negotiable securities of all kinds. It provides for the lodgement of returns by the donor and the issue of an assessment by the commissioner. The donee, or the trustee i u the case of a settlement, will be liable for the payment of the duty in the event of failure to recover the duty from the donor. There will bo a. right of objection to the assessment to bo issued, and if dissatisfied with the decision upon the objection the donor can appeal to the Valuation Board that has been set up under the Land Tax Assessment Act in regard to the valuation of real property comprised in any g if t . On this and any other question he can also appeal to the courts. The bill also contains a provision which empowers - the commissioner at his discretion to value shares in private companies on the basis of the sum the holder would receive if the company were voluntarily wound up at the date when the g if t was made. This provision is copied from Queensland and New South Wales legislation, and prevents valuations from being undermined by restrictive provisions embodied in the articles of association. As the matter of g if t duty is very closely related to estate duty, the Government has decided to adopt the same schedule of rates as that which applies for estate duty purposes. The rates commence at 3 per cent, and reach a maximum of approximately 27 per cent., where the aggregate value of the gifts made within the five-year period reaches £500,000. Tbis aspect of the matter was dealt with when the resolution for the imposition of the rates was introduced into the House earlier in the day. I commend the bill to honourable members.

84,Mr CHIFLEY,GIFT DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Trea surer) [5.53] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to implement the recommendations contained in the eighth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which was tabled in the Blouse on the 17th September last, and to provide for the payment during the current financial year of special grants totalling £2,300,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia aud Tasmania. As honourable members ttre aware, the commission was set up in 19313 to inquire into and report on applications from States for financial assistance under section 96 of the Constitution. The recommendations of the commission for the last seven years have been approved by the Commonwealth Government and adopted by Parliament. The grants which the commission has recommended for the year 1941-42 compare with those paid during 1940-41 as follows:Increase or Decrease. i £ £ 3outh Australia 1,000,000 1,150,000 + 150,000 Western Australia 050,000 630,000 - 20,000 Tasmania 400,000 520,000 + 120,000 Total . . 2,050,000 2,300,000 + 250,000 In assessing the grants the commission to- has followed the same principles as in the past, viz., the grant is determined by "" the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State, by reasonable effort, to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States."" I l should, however, be pointed out that, on this basis, the commission's assessment for South Australia this year is £1,400,000-that is, £250,000 more than the commission recommends should actually be paid. This variation of the assessment is due to special factors which I. shall explain. It is very important at the outset to remember that the grants recommended are largely based on the and budgetary results of the States for 1939-40, the latest year for which complete information was available to the commission when it conducted its investigations. The commission also takes into - consideration special conditions obtaining in years following that on which the grant is assessed. Thus, in 1937-38 the grant assessed for Western Australia on the budgetary results of 1935-36 was £439,000, but a special repayable advance of £136,000 was added in order to assist the State over a difficult period caused hy severe drought. This advance of £136,000 was recovered from Western Australia in 1939-40, when the assessment was £731,000 and the amount actually paid was £595,000. This year the commission has recommended that this procedure be reversed in the case of South Australia. The grant assessed for that State is £1,400,000, but, for certain reasons which I shall give later, the commission considered that this amount would be more than adequato to meet the needs of South Australia in 1941-42. Consequently the commission has recomwas mended that the grant to be paid this the commission recommended year shall be £1,150,000, and that £250,000 shall he withheld to he paid South Australia in the succeeding year, when it may be appropriate to the needs of the State to pay an amount greater than the assessment. The reason for this apparent reduction of the grant to South Australia is explained in the eighth report as follows:The grant was assessed on the basis of relative financial position of the States 1933-40, and it will, if approved, be paid 1941-42. There is clear evidence of improving conditions in South Australia; and, with growing economic stimulus created by industries and war expenditure, it is likely that in the near future the finances of the State will further improve. Thus the grant indicated by our calculations may be in excess of actual needs in 1941-42 . . . We realise that it is unwise to forecast in these uncertain times, but it is probable that the improved situation in South Australia in 1941-42 will year. lead, under our method of assessment, to a reduced grant in 1942-43. We have considered various methods by which the South Australian grant of £1.400.000 might fairly be adjusted to meet the special circumstances of the State. One method considered was that any surplus in 1941-42 arising from the increased grant should be applied to the reduction of past revenue deficits. Another course is to defer payment of a part of the grant. On the whole we believe this latter method would best serve the interests of South Australia, and we accordingly recommend that payment of £250.000 be deferred by the Commonwealth until the succeeding year, thus reducing the payment for 1941-42 to £1,150,000. For the information of honourable members, I submit the following statement showing the trend of grants in recent yearsSouth Western Year. Australia. Australia. Tasmania. £ £ 1986-37 . . 1,330,000 500,000 600,000 193738 . . 1,200,000 575,000 575,000 193839 . . 1,040,000 570,000 193940 . . 995,000 595,000 430,000 194041 . . 1,000,000 650,000 400,000 Proposed 1941-42 1,1.50,000 630,000 520,000 I shall now give honourable members a brief explanation of the main reasons for the difference between the grants for 194041 and those recommended for 194142. It is desirable that these differences should be clearly understood. The grant assessed for South Australia £1,400,000, but, as I have explained, that £250,000 of this amount should be withto held. The amount assessed is £400,000 greater than the grant paid in 1940-41. This is due to a combination of factors. There was a considerable decline of the relative taxable capacity of the State because of drought and low prices for wool and wheat in the income year 1938-39. At the same time, collections of State the taxes increased in 1939-40, as a result in partly of the imposition of higher rates in of income tax, and partly of an abnorthe mally large increase of estate duty wai revenue, which fluctuates considerably from year to year. The severity of taxation for 1939-40 was, therefore, relatively higher for South Australia, and, as a result,, the adjustment on account of relative severity of taxation was £518,000 more favourable than for the previous The grant assessed for Western Australia was £630,000, which is £20,000 less than that paid in 1940-41. This reduction was due to a combination of factors. There was an increase of £117,000 in the adjustment on account of the relative deficit of the State for 1939-40, but this was almost exactly offset by a decrease of £119,000 in the adjustment for severity of taxation, due largely to an improvement of the relative taxable capacity of Western Australia. It should, however, be pointed out that, despite this decrease, the adjustment for severity of State taxation in Western Australia was £150,000 in favour of that State. A new correction appears this year under the head ""Koad Debt, Charges and it is this correction which Total. is responsible for the reduction of the grant recommended. The commission £ £ believes that this adjustment is reason2,430,000 410,000 2,350,000 2,020.000 able, and explains that it has been made 2,020,000 because of the failure of Western Aus2,050,000 tralia to bring its road finances reason2,300,000 ably into line with those of other States, by making provision for meeting at least some portion of the annual interest and sinking fund payments on road debt from the proceeds of motor taxation. In this connection it is appropriate to point out that in 1939-40 and 1940-41 the Government of Western Australia introduced legislation designed to bring its road finances more into line with tbose of other States, but on each occasion the measure was rejected by the Legislative Council. This action resulted in considerable loss to the State budget. The commission considers that, in fairness to other States which use a large proportion of motor taxation to pay annual charges on road debt, this factor should not be ignored in arriving at a final assessment. The grant recommended to Tasmania is £120,000 higher than last year. This increase is due mainly to the fact that the Tasmanian deficit in 1939-40, the year on which the calculations are based, was 6s. lid. a head higher than in 1938-39, while the average deficit per capita in the non-claimant or "" standard "" States fell by 7s. 2d. Because of this absolute and relative increase of Tasmania's deficit, the grant was favourably affected to the extent of £169.000. An adjustment was also made in the case of 'Tasmania because the road finances of the State were out of line with other States. The eighth report indicates that the special problems associated with roads in Tasmania were taken into consideration in making the correction. It may seem anomalous to honourable members that the special grant for South Australia should be increased in a year when the financial position of that State is showing considerable improvement. It must be remembered, however, that the grants recommended for 1941-42 were based, not on the relative financial position of the States in 1940-41, but on the relative nnanciai position of the States in 1.939-40, the latest year for which complete information was available to the commission when it conducted its investigations. In paragraphs 67 to 70 and paragraph 192, the eighth report emphasizes that there is no escape from this procedure if grants are to be assessed on actnal budgetary results. The commission believes that any attempt to assess grants on budget estimates would lead to grave error and dissatisfaction. The commission's experience extending over eight years has shown that estimated figures are very unreliable. The commission a Iso expresses the view that, so long methods are consistently applied from year to year, any apparent injustice in Mr Chifley. any particular year will be adjusted within a short period. Any possible error is not cumulative. The eighth report points out also that the commission does not adhere rigidly to the grants indicated by its basic calculations. In special circumstances, such as I have already explained, it adjusts the calculated figures so that the grants finally recommended may be in reasonable harmony with current financial needs. I understand that the improved position of South Australia in 1940-41, arising from war expenditure and other causes, is now being investigated hy the commission and will be fully taken into account in the grant recommended for 1942-43. The commission has commented as follows on the fact that the total of the grants recommended for 1941-42 is above that paid in recent years:Owing to the war and to the very large and increasing obligations of the Commonwealth, it may be suggested that special grants should not he increased in a time of national emergency. The commission f u l ly appreciates this point of view; but, at the same time, it must bear in mind the function it has to perform in preserving a reasonable financial balance among the States. It must always he remembered that the special grant is the basic grant designed to adjust the financial inferiority of the claimant States and to enable these States effectively to discharge their functions in the federation. If we recommended grants below the amounts justified by a careful investigation of the relative financial position of the States, it would be tantamount, as we stated in our seventh report, to placing a discriminatory burden on the claimant States in a time of difficulty. If the pressure of war finance requires some reduction in the amount of assistance to the States it should, we believe, be applied equitably to all States. As the commission deals only with applications from the claimant States for special grants, this is not a matter on which it has power to make any recommendation. There is considerable evidence that the work of the commission is thorough and impartial, and that all matters affecting the "" financial needs"" of the claimant States have been investigated. The Government, therefore, believes that the amounts recommended by the commission will adequately meet the needs of the claimant States; and, consequently, as in past years, the Government has decided as its to accept the recommendation of the commission.

Motion (by Mr FROST)-by leaveagreed toThat lie have leave to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1020-1940. Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",53
85,Mr FROST,GIFT DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Franklin-Minister for Repatriation) [6.10] - by move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, mainly in three directions, namely, (1) To ensure that the maximum rates of service pension for members of the Forces, and other provisions regarding service pensions, conform with the proposed amendments for invalid and old-age pensions. (2) To provide that veterans of the South African war be admitted to the benefits of service pensions, and medical treatment for those suffering from, pulmonary tuberculosis. (3) To give statutory authority for certain payments sanctioned, by previous Governments. Service pensions, as honourable members are aware, are really a form of invalid or old-age pensions for members of the Forces, and are granted on the grounds of age, of being permanently unemployable, or suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. The present rate for members eligible on the grounds of age, and for unmarried members eligible on either of the grounds, is 21s. a week. It is provided in clause 3 of the bill that the rate shall be increased by 2s. 6d. a week to give a maximum rate of 23s. 6d. a week. Of course, in the bill the rates are shown as per fortnight. In respect of married members who ai'o permanently unemployable or suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and whose wives are eligible for service pension, the present rate is ISs. a week. Clause 4 of the bill provides that the rate for such members shall be increased by 5s. a week giving a maximum rate of 23s. a week. It will be seen that the increase is in that portion of the pension payable to the member. It would not be practicable to increase the rate for the wife, as the present rate of 18s. a week is already equal to that payable to the wife of a member receiving a war pension for total incapacity attributable to war service. Clause 5 omits sub-section 2 of section 45AH of the act, and thus provides that where accumulated property is held, the deduction from pension shall apply only in respect of property in excess of £50. The existing exemption in respect of an individual pensioner is £50, but in the leave- I case of a husband and wife, where both are pensioners, is £25 for each. In future the exemption will be £50 for each. Clause 6 is to effect three amendments in respect of the section of the act relating to the rate of pension payable while a service pensioner is in an institution. It is now made clear that the provision applies only where the pensioner is maintained at the public expense. Previously the commission necessarily had to reduce the pension to the lower rate, even where the pensioner entered, say, a private hospital, or an intermediate hospital. Also, in future, where a service pensioner is admitted to a public institution, reduction of pension will not operate until the twenty-ninth day after admission. This will place service pensions on the same footing as invalid or old-age pensions where the pensioner is admitted to hospital. It is very desirable that the hospital rate of pension should agree in respect of both service pension and invalid or old-age pension. At the inception of service pensions, they did agree, but whilst the 1936 and 1937 increases of invalid pensions were apportioned between the pensioner and the institution, the whole of the service pension increase on each occasion went to the pensioner, as up to that time there was no arrangement for payment of a portion of the service pension to institutions. Such, an arrangement was entered into in 193S, and the increase of service pension granted in January, 1941, viz., Is. a week, was apportioned between the pensioner and the institution. 6d. a week to each. It will be seen, therefore, that service pensioners have enjoyed, since October, 1936, a hospital rate higher than that paid to invalid pensioners; for most of the period the advantage was Is. a week. The present rates are-invali d or old-age pension, 6s. 9d. a week; service pension 7s. 6d. a week. The proposed new rate for invalid pension is 7s. 9d. a week, and the amendment will bring the rates into uniformity, and keep them so for the future. Clause 7 inserts a new section in the act, whereby the provisions of service pensions are extended to veterans of the South African War. This had been decided upon by the previous Government. Tho present Government concurs in the decision, and is pleased to give effect to it. The extension will operate from the 1st November, and will, no doubt, be the means of affording comfort to those veterans in need of such a pension. Honourable members will note that Australians who served in South Africa with the forces of Great Britain or another dominion are also eligible to apply. Medical treatment for members of the forces suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, even though not due to the member's service, is a concomitant of the service pension scheme, and this benefit will be available for the veterans who should be so unfortunate as to be afflicted with the disability. The benefit will be available, irrespective of whether or not the member is to receive a service pension. The provision is covered by one of the amendments to section 60 of the act, effected by clause 8 of the bill. The other amendments to section 60 do not confer any ne»v benefit; they are merely to give statutory authority for benefits already in force. They may be regarded as machinery amendments to facilitate administrative accounting for the expenditure. Debate (on motion Mr ANTHONY) adjourned.",56

87,Mr HOLLOWAY,GIFT DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Social Services) [7.46] by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The introduction of a measure designed to ameliorate the circumstances of a most deserving section of the community not only affords me very great satisfaction, but also, I feel sure, will give considerable pleasure to my predecessor in this office-and also to all honourable members. The principal object of this hill is to give effect to the Government's decision, announced by my colleague, the Treasurer (Mr Chifley), in his budget speech today, to increase, as from the 11th December next, the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions from the present rate of £1 Is. 6d. a week to a new maximum of £1 3s. 6d. a week-the highest rate paid since the inception of our invalid and old-age pensions system. The Government is re-examining the resources at its disposal, and, as has been foreshadowed by the Treasurer's intimation regarding the presentation of a supplementary budget early in the New Year, intends then to introduce a bill honouring its election pledge to raise the pension level to £1 5s. a week. The new maximum includes a cost-ofliving adjustment of Is. a week, 6d. of which has been made available by the Government one month earlier than would normally have been the case. Whilst retaining the principle of associating the rate of pension with the cost-of-living index, the Government proposes an important amendment to ensure that in the event of a fall in the cost of living, the maximum rate of pension will not be reduced below £1 2s. 6d. a week or any other figure without parliamentary approval. At present, it is possible to reduce the rate to £1 Is. a week. The price-index number for September, 1941, was 1009. If this figure reaches 1028, a further 6d. a week will be payable. The hill preserves the existing margins an of permissible ineome, namely, 12s. 6d. a week in the case of pensioners other than permanently blind persons, and £3 7s. 6d. a week in the case of blind pensioners. In order, however, to clarify the position regarding permissible income, it is proposed to make certain amendments which will indicate clearly that a pensioner may possess income up to these amounts without his pension being affected. The present provision of the act relating to this matter does not indicate the permissible income as such, but merely states the limit of income together with the pension. Consequently, it is necessary to vary this limit with every variation of the pension rate. The new provision will avoid the necessity for these variations without in any way affecting the present permissible income, which will be guided by the figures and not by verbiage. The bill makes provision for pensionerinmates of benevolent asylums and hospitals to benefit from the general increase of the pension rate. Following the practice adopted on previous occasions, the increase of 2s. a week will be divided equally between the pensioner and the institution. The new institutional rate of 7s. 9d. a week will include a cost-ofliving adjustment of 6d. and will he the highest amount which has ever been paid to pensioners in institutions. Possibly some honourable members may cwnsider that pensioner-inmates of institutions should receive the full increase of 2s. a week. I think, however, that it will be admitted that the payments made to pensioners in institutions are in a Bomewhat different category from those made to persons outside of institutions who have to meet the full cost of their maintenance out of their pension money. In the case of inmates of institutions, the cost of maintenance is borne almost entirely by the institution and the pension payment made to the inmate is more in the nature, although not altogether, of pocket money which enables the purchase of, say, tobacco and other comforts not always provided by the institution. The present cost of maintaining inmates of institutions averages about f l 2s. 6d. a week in the case of institutions in metropolitan areas, but is much higher in the case of hospitals and some country institutions. It is of interest to - mention that in the institutional pension of 2s. a week represented only 13 per cent, of the pension. In 1925, when the pension was £1 a week, the institutional rate of 4s. a week represented 20 per cent, of the amount; and in 1937, when the ful l pension was still £1 a week, the institutional rate represented 30 per cent, of the full amount. The amount at present being paid, 6s. 9d. a week, represents 31 per cent, of the full pension, whilst the new institutional rate of 7s. 9d. a week will represent about one-third of the pension of £1 3s. 6d. a week. The act at present provides for pensioner-inmates to receive, at the discretion of the Minister, up lo half of the amount of any cost-of-living increase granted to pensioners outside. This provision, together with the cost-ofliving variations, is being retained. The hill also makes provision for other concessions indicated by the Treasurer in the budget speech delivered today. One of the mo3t important of these is a liberalization of the conditions under which invalid pensions - are granted. The act at present provides that an invalid pension shall be granted only to a person who is permanently incapacitated and unable to work. This requirement has usually been interpreted as meaning total and permanent incapacity. There have been many cases in which this has involved hardship. All honourable members must have known of border-line cases which make an almost irresistible appeal to our sympathies. There are other doubtful cases to which the Administration wishes to extend benefits, but which are at present beyond the limits of the act. A. great many of these cases will now benefit by the provision made in this bill to enable an invalid pension to be granted to a claimant if the degree of his capacity for work does not exceed 15 per cent. The act, at present, debars from benefit Asiatics except those born in Australia and Indians born in British India. The bill removes the disqualification in the eases of Asiatics who are British subjects. This will include Asiatics who are British subjects either by birth or by naturalization. The class of Asiatics who will chiefly benefit from this concession are Syrians and Lebanese. Many members of these communities or their sons 1920 served with the Australian Forces in the last war, and 45 are at present members full of the Commonwealth Forces overseas.",57
88,Mr ANTHONY,GIFT DUTY ASSESSMENT,Will the Government consider making a similar provision in respect of South Sea Islanders?,59
89,Mr HOLLOWAY,GIFT DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I have no doubt that many other classes of people will be considered in this connection as time goes on. Under the present act the property exemption of £50 for each pensioner is reduced to £25 each in cases where both husband and wife are pensioners. The Government considers that there is not sufficient justification for this reduction and the provision under which it is made is to be removed from the act. The result will be that where both husband and wife are pensioners each will receive the benefit of the property exemption of £50. Without either rhyme or reason the anomaly which this provision is intended to remedy has continued almost since the inception of our invalid and old-age pensions system, and I am glad that it is now to be overcome. There are quite a number of cases of pensioners who own incumbered property which they cannot sell except at considerable sacrifice, but the value of the equity in the property may cause a reduction of their rate of pension. The bill will remove this cause of hardship by giving the commissioner discretionary power to disregard the value of the equity possessed by the claimant or pensioner in such cases when assessing the net capital value of accumulated property. I point out that no specific amount is mentioned in the bill in this connection, but the commissioner is given a discretionary power. The bill introduces a new provision with the object of encouraging invalid claimants or pensioners who are capable of undergoing suitable vocational trainbe ing to do so in order that they may try to become self-supporting. The missioner, after considering the age and mental and physical capacity of any invalid claimant or pensioner, and the facilities available for suitable vocational training or physical rehabilitation, take appropriate steps either to grant continue a pension in any individual case. standard. For probably the last twenty years honourable members on both sides of the House have had the idea that something of this kind should be done. It has been generally felt that pensioners should be given the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, as it were, and to again become self-supporting. The bill provides that steps to this end may now be taken and that the pensioner may continue to receive his pension during the period when he is endeavouring to discover whether it will, be practicable for him to earn his own living once more. ft will be remembered that some time ago the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) submitted a motion in the House in relation to adequate maintenance with which honourable members agreed. It is unnecessary to amend the act to give effect to this provision, for it can be done by administrative procedure. I am glad to say that, the Government has decided to act in this connection, and that the new arrangement will take effect from the 11th December next. Sir FREDERICK: STEWART - That provision was also included in the Fadden budget.",59

92,Mr HOLLOWAY,GIFT DUTY ASSESSMENT,"It will not apply to old-age pensioners. For the future, it is intended to regard "" adequate maintenance "" as a family income sufficient to provide £2 10s. a week for each adult dependent member of the family, and half that amount for each child under sixteen years of age. Adequate maintenance is not defined in the act, but the standard to followed has been laid down by successive governments, and upon the adoption comof the budget the Government will authorize the administration to put the new standard into operation as from the 11th December, 1941. It is expected that this generous action will result in the may admission of many claims which would or have heen disallowed under the present, The present number of invalid and old-age pensioners is a little over 335,000. They will all receive the full increase of 2s. a week at a cost of £1,743,000 per annum. The cost of the increase in respect of 5,450 institutional pensioners will be £28,000 per annum. The total addition to the annual liability as of the increases provided for in the bill will thus be £1,771,000. The cost of the increases for the present financial year will be £1,022,000, but this includes an amount of £225,000 which would have been the cost for 1941-42 of the increase of 6d. a week on the cost of living index from January, 1942. The cost of the other liberalizations which I have indicated is estimated at £245,500 for a full year. The cost for the remainder of the present year will be approximately £143,000. The total additional expenditure as a result of the increases and liberalizations is thns £2,016,500 per annum, the total cost for 1941-42 being £1,165,000. Taking also into account the estimated increase of the number of pensioners, the total estimated expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions during the current financial year is £19,S65,000, which is an increase of £2,499,000 as compared with the actual expenditure last year. Two other important phases of invalid and old-age pensions administration are at present receiving the serious attention of the Government, and it is sincerely hoped that in the near future further concessions will be embodied in the act. One of these is the extension of pension benefits to Australian aboriginals who are living under civilized conditions, or who are at least making a genuine endeavour to conform with what one might call the normal Australian standards. Tho experience which the department is now obtaining in administering child endowment to Australian aboriginals will be used as a basis for the extension to them of the benefits of the invalid and old-age pension. The second matter is the exempWednesday next, the tion from income of war pensions payable to dependants of soldiers when an assessment of invalid or old-age pension is made. Both of these matters are under sented :the consideration of the department, and I hope that effect will be given to the proposals early next year. I commend the bill to honourable members as a worthy addition to our social legislation. Debate (on motion by Sir FREDERICK STEWART) adjourned. a result DISCHARGE OF ORDERS OF TH E DAY.
