3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I said recently in answer to a similar question that I considered it inadvisable for me to comment on the negotiations between the envoy* of the three ""Western Powers and Mr. Molotov and, earlier, Mr Stalin on the difficulties in Berlin. I indicated then that I had been kept fully informed. 1 could, of course, outline the difficulties from their origin and the proposals made for the solution of the position in Berlin.",12
4,Mr HABRISON,Unknown,Would the right honourable gentleman consider the desirability of holding a secret sitting for the purpose of placing the facts before honourable members ?,12
5,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I would if I thought there could be such a thing as a secret sitting. I do not know that I could not give a general outline the situation to the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Ausbourne, tralian Country party so that they may be made aware of the difficulties. But it would he most inadvisable for me to a public statement. That could embardirector rass the people dealing with the matter, who are, of course, much more competent to express an opinion on it than I am. Further moves may be made to carry rhe negotiations in another place if present negotiations do not reach a jfltisfaetory conclusion.",13
6,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I desire to ask the party Prime Minister a question in reference r.o the air lift from the western zone of aware Germany to Berlin and to the right State president honourable gentleman's offer of Royal Soldiers and Airmen's Australian Air Force aircraft, which has of Australia when the been so favourably received overseas. attempted to capture that body Eaving regard to the strain which is in New South Wales? In view thrown upon pilots and other members of air crews by the short nights ancl freSheppard's quent landings at each end of the air tinue i-.orridor, will the Prime Minister make a on antravelling further offer of Australian aircrews to assist in the lift, especially as weather - onditions will become less favourable for flying with the approach of the European winter?",13
7,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The provision of Koyal Australian Air Force crews for air lift into Berlin was the subject discussion between the authorities conand cerned and the Minister for Air. No reT quest for additional assistance has received, but I shall have inquiries made and consider the point which houorablp member has raised. COMMUNISM. ' !<>.LONJS.L A. W. SHSFFABD-STATEMEN fir Mn. JUSTICE SIMPSON-MALAYA STATEMENT BY MK . BUBNS.",13
8,Mr LANG,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the port that Colonel A. W. Sheppard is in of his question. Prague on behalf of the Greek Communist guerilla leader, General Markos, and that he is conferring with the Cominquire munist Czechoslovakian Foreign Minishe ter regarding plans to bring the Greek question before the TJnited Nations General Assembly? Is this the Colonel Sheppard who was Director of Troop of Movements on General Blarney's headquarters staff at Victoria Barracks, Melduring the war? Is he still on the Australian reserve list of oflicers? Did he leave Australia recently as special make adviser to Sir Ernest Fisk, managing of Electrical Musical Industries Limited? ""Was Sir Ernest Fisk in Australia in connection with the Government's plans in relation to telecommunicaon tions, radar, frequency modulation and the television? Would Sheppard have access to any information obtained by Sir Ernest Fisk? Is the Government aware thai Sheppard gave lectures to the Communist while in Australia recently? Is it that he was the nominee of the Communist partu for the position of of the Eeturned Sailors. Imperial League Communists recently of close connection with the Cominform, is he to be allowed to confrom country to country Australian passport doing the work of the Communist International''.",13
9,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Whil e I do not know Colonel Sheppard at all, I heard the other day that he had made remark* in certain European countries concerning the communism. I made inquiries as to how of the colonel happened to be in Europe, whether he had any official status. was told that he was travelling at hif been own expense. When Sir Ernest Fist was in Australia he interviewed me, but the did not mention any of the matter? raised by the honourable member for Reid. I understood that it was only a courtesy call by an Australian who had come from abroad. I had a discussion with him reT garding the progress of television, and I understood that he had come to Australia purely for business reasons. I shall have a written answer prepared for the honorreable member regarding the other aspect* 1",13
10,Mr ERASES,Unknown,"Will the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General of Mr Justice Simpson whether was correctly reported in last Thursday's press? The press reported that Hip Honour had condemned Communists in Australia. Will the Minister say whether it is considered desirable that a member of a Supreme Court Bench, who has to administer the law, should express publicly such strong views on a matter of current and acute political controversy?",13
11,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,I shall make the inquiries that the honourable member has requested.,14
12,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Las t week, another Australian was murdered hy Communist assassins in Malaya, and a Communist named Burns stated in Brisbane that in the event of Australia engaging in war with Eussia, Australian Communists would fight for the Soviet Union against this country. In view of those circumstances, does the Prime Minister still regard the Australian Communist party and its treacherous members as exponents of a harmless political philosophy? Following the murder of Australian subjects abroad and the traitorous statement of Burns, what steps does the right honourable gentleman intend to take to protect the lives of Australian citizens overseas ? Will he also take action to rid Australia of the Communist party?",14
13,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am surprised that the honourable member for New England has attributed to me words that I did not use in reference to the.Communist .party in Australia. I never at any time applied to that organization the word ""harmleas "", although I did refer to communism as a political philosophy.",14
14,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"I shall withdraw the word "" harmless"", and accept the right honourable gentleman's statement that he described communism as a "" political philosophy "".",14
15,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,That makes a difference.,14
16,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,It makes little difference.,14
17,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Wit h regard to the second part of the honourable member's question dealing with the statement purported to have been made by Burns which, I gather from press reports, was taken down verbatim, I promised last week to have that matter referred to the Acting Attorney-General for investigation. Perhaps, I had a presentiment that the honourable member would ask a question on this matter for I saw the Acting Attorney General today, and he informed me that he had not yet had an opportunity to peruse the report he had obtained on the subject. As soon as he has done so, I shall supply the information sought by the honourable member. NORTHERN TERRITORY. LIBRARY FACILITIES-RAI L TRANSPORT.",14
18,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"On the day that Mr. Binns, the former Librarian of the Commonwealth National Library, retired, he indicated that it was intended to re-establish the library at Darwin, and to form several branches elsewhere in the Northern Territory. He said, also, that a librarian was to be appointed. Action to re-establish the library at Darwin ha? not been instituted, although I understand that six months ago a young student was appointed as librarian for the Northern Territory. He. had already graduated as a bachelor of arts at the University of Western Australia and upon appointment commenced training in the National Library at Canberra. Such. training was completed three months ago.",14
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must put his question.,14
20,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"Can the Minister for the Interior say whether it is true that the librarian appointed has not yet gomto Darwin? If so, can he indicate the reason for the delay? Is it because of lack of housing accommodation, or because of government policy?",14
21,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It is a fact that a Chief Librarian has been appointed to the Darwin staff. He is at present employed on the National Library staff. He has not yet proceeded to Darwin because of the lack of both housing and library accommodation there. Efforts are being made by the Department of Works and Housing to secure suitable - accommodation, and when that has been done the appointee will be despatched, to Darwin.",14
22,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"In view of ths disturbing statements made by the Minister for the Interior regarding the proposed extension for 30 years of certain Northern Territory leases, particularly those held by Bovrils and Vesteys, prior to any announcement heing made as to whether access by railway is: to be extended to those areas, will the. Minister for Transport,, before a decision is reached on this subject, indicate whether it is' intended to extend the railway from Alice' Springs to Tennant Greek and thence north-easterly, through the Barkly Tableland towards a gulf port, and/or - construct a railway - from Wyndham, through Vesteys leases; and/or extend the railway via Blackall and Longreach to the Barkly Tableland, and to the Channel country of western Queensland? Will the Minister make an announcement of the - Government's proposals prior to the .granting of the extension of the leases to Northern. Territory lessees which will - entrench, them in. their holdings for a further 30"" years against the public, interest ? Mr Ward;-The general subject of rail communication with the northern; parts of Australia has been considered - the Government on a number of occasions. Difficulties arose in the past because the withdrawal of representatives of - Queensland Government from the original discussions on matters relating to the standardization, modernization - development of the Australian railway .systems. Further talks have since taken place between myself and representament, tives of the Queensland Government and with the Minister for the Interior. finality has yet been reached. As soon farmers? .as I am in a position to doso, I shall inform the honourable member of the sions made. FERTILIZERS. Dame ENID LYONS.^-Doubtless the Treasurer is aware of the position rebasis, garding supplies of fertilizers to mania. The withdrawal of the shipping subsidy has necessitated special imporWhen tations from Melbourne, because the local plant cannot deal with the rock already allotted' to that State. I understandopposite that; following representationsfromthe Tasmanian Government, the Treasury cided agreed to continue for this season the shipping subsidy on the importations of. rock to which I have referred. Can the right honourable gentleman tell me what limitation, if any, was placed upon quantity to be handled?"" Will' he also inform me' whether this; subsidy will be 120] continued in the event of the; position in Tasmani.a-.remaining:as it.isaat.the present timei?",14
23,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The Tasmanian: Government has asked the Commonwealth - to. continue the subsidy in respect of phosphates. Although we could not give an undertaking-that the subsidy could be continued om a permanent basis, we agreed to continue the concession for the time being, but informed the Tasmanian Government: that the matter would bereviewed at a. later date. I shall ascertain the preciseposition, and inform the honourable member as early as possible.",15
24,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"- I direct the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to a statement published in this morning's press relating to the subsidy on superphosphate, in which it is said that the subsidy is to be paid direct to growers instead of through a dozen or by more manufacturers; as at' present; that two clerks and two typists now handle of the claims; that under the new system the between 40 and 65 employees will be required; that the annual wages, bill for those employees, will be approximately and £35,000; and that tens of thousands of primary-producers will have to file claims-. Will the Minister say whetherthat stateis correct?; If it is correct, can action, be. taken to simplify the procedure No for the payment of the subsidy to  decidecided to pay thesubsidy on superphosphate direct'to the'users of that'commodity, that is, the farmersof Australia, and to abandon the present practiceof payment to manufacturers on a cost-plus which, in. relation, to less efficient Tas^ manufacturersmay amount: to the placing of apremium upon inefficiency. the honourable member for-Robertson asked whether the method of payment could be simplified one honourable member said. ""Hear, hear"". I remind the House that the Government has deto revert to a system that was introduced by an anti-Labour government. In this instance the old order is considered to be a good one. It is completely untrue to say that only four persons are now theemployed to administer the payment of the subsidy: The number is considerably greater-than that'. It ' is also completely untrue to say that the new method will involve the employment of between 45 and 65 persons. That is a figment of the imagination of a journalist who thinks that he has some inside information or or that he knows more about the matter than the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the Director General of Agriculture, or myself. The estimate contained in the press statement is exceedingly wide of the mark. The staff that will be required is already employed in the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. The work of distributing the subsidy on superphosphate will be done in many instances, in addition to the duties which these officers are already performing. The Australian Government's control over the prices of many commodities has now been relinquished, and some members of the staff of my department will thus have more time at their disposal to devote to the superphosphate subsidy. PRICES CONTROL.",15
25,Mr FRASER,Unknown,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs arrange for a clear statement to be published immediately about the present position of prices control in the Australian Capital Territory? As a great deal of confusion exists in the minds of i lie people about the matter, it is desirable that a public statement be issued to make it clear whether the decontrols in New South Wales apply in the Australian Capital Territory, and whether prices are now fixed in the Australian Capital Territory irrespective of whether prices are fixed in New South Wales.  bring the honourable member's question to the notice of the Minister for Trade :md Customs, and ask him to clarify the position as early as possible. CIVIL AVIATION. AiK ACCIDENT IN NEW GUINEA.",16
26,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Civil Aviation yet studied the report ou the causes of the crash of a Guinea' Traders Lockheed Hudson aircraft at Lac four months ago when 37 people were killed? Ls it correct that the report states that the crash wa? caused hy the breaking of four teeth of the main gear wheel in the blower equipment of the ])ort motor causing an engine failure ? If that be correct, is the department taking any measures to improve maintenance supervision in order to prevent like accidents in the future? What is the reason for the secrecy on the part of the department in regard to this tragedy ?",16
27,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"There is in> secrecy at all on the part of the department as suggested by the honourable member. I stated in the House last week that I had perused the report. It is very lengthy, and it reached me last Saturday fortnight. I have referred it back to the department and have asked that it be forwarded to the Crown Law Office to see whether action should be taken in the matter. The crash was stated in one section of the press to have been due to certain mechanical defects. Whether that be so or not, I believe thai I should not make a statement at thisjuncture in view of the possibility of further action being taken in the matter.",16
28,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Why does not the Ministeifuriiish the report to Parliament?,16
29,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,It is not usual to furnish such reports to the Parliament. WHEAT.,16
30,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"In view of the increased development of the poultry and pig industries in Tasmania and the inadequacy and, frequently, the poor quality, of wheat supplied by the Australian Wheat Board to Tasmania necessitating millers in that State closing down from time to time, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture endeavour to have increased supplies of better quality wheat made available to that State?  sion since I have been Minister for Commerce and Agriculture when any miller in Tasmania has been obliged to close down his mill because of a shortage of wheat supplies. Wheat supplied to Tasmanian millers for breadmaking is of the same quality as that supplied to millers in any Air other part of the Commonwealth. In view of the existing world shortage of wheat and the fact that a substantial portion of the Australian crop is below fair average quality, Tasmanian stock feeders, like stock feeders in otlier of the Commonwealth, must accept vision some wheat below fair average quality. However, purchases of such wheat and will receive a full 60 lb., in each bushel. It will not be possible to alter the present arrangement until all wheat of inferior quality has been consumed and the quality of wheat generally been improved. I might add that a conand cession is made to purchasers with respect to the price of wheat below fair average quality.",16
31,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform me when wheat-growers are likely to receive the refund of the money paid by them in wheat tax ? The refund of this money, which amounts to about £11,500,000, provided for in the Wheat Tax Eepeal and Refund Bill'1948? Will the Minister take steps to have the debate on the second reading of that bill resumed at an early date, so that a decision may be reached and the wheat-growers may have their money refunded?  the promise which the Government made to? some months ago to the Australian Agricultural Council and to the Wheat growers E'ederation, wheat-growers wil] receive refund for which the bill makes provision. The 1945-46 tax, amounting to apbelieve proximately ls. l^d. a bushel, will be on a date prior to December next, though I cannot indicate the exact date. The honourable member may rest assured that the Governinent will honour that promise, [n accordance with a further promise made to the wheat-growers the amounts collected in the 1946-47 tax will be funded at a time to be determined the Government. The honourable gentleinform man may rest assured that the Governamount ment will not delay this matter enough to cause any political discontent among the wheat-growers. PETROL TAX.",17
32,Mr BEENAED COESER,Unknown,"Hansar d that shows that the Minister for Transport, the course of his second-reading speech the Federal Aid Eoads and Works Bill, made it clear that the Government was favourably impressed with the representaworkers parts tions I had made in regard to the proof money for airfields, boat havens and jetties to assist the fishing industry that up to one-sixth of the total sum distributed to the States from collection? of petrol tax may be allotted for the construction of such facilities and to assist local government bodies to construct has and maintain aerodromes and wharfs roads thereto, and also for the purpose of encouraging the fishing industry, by the provision of jetties. I understand further that a local authority that desires to obtain a grant must apply to *the appropriate State government, which may, in its discretion, accept or reject the application. Will the Minister say whether the Australian Government favours such advances ibeing is made and whether any such applications have been made to 'State governments by local authorities ? Does he consider that sufficient publicity has been given to these provisions ? If applications for grants have been made by local authorities, will the Minister say how much money has been made available so far assist in works such as I have referred",17
33,Mr WARD,Unknown,"In my opinion, ample the publicity has been given to the provisions of this legislation. I have no reason to that local authorities are not fully paid aware that they may make application to iState governments for assistance in carrying out works of the kind to which the honourable member has referred. I do not know whether any such applications have been made, or, if so, whether they have been accepted or rejected. I shall reexamine the reports that have been subby mitted by the State governments and the honourable member of what of money, if any, has been dislong tributed for this purpose. BASIC WAGE.",17
34,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether there is a consensus of opinion the formula for fixing the hasic wage in is now outmoded? Was a committee apon pointed by the Government to consider whether a new and wider formula for arriving at the basic wage of Australian could not he adopted ? Mr EOOjOWAY - The .answer to flie first ""portion of 'the .'honourable members-question is "" Tes "". For several yeaT3 there has heen « wide opinion in this oountry that the formula 'should be reviewed and amended. About two years itgo the Prime Mmister agreed, at the request of employers and employees in industry, to appoint a small committee to investigate this matter with the assistance - »f the Commonwealth Statistician and otheTS. Unfortunately, - so far, the parties have ""been unable to agree to meet, and consequently ""no revision of the 'existing fornuila has taken place. BROADCASTING. -'RE-POUT TO THE NATION."" Mr ANTHONY:-On Sunday nights the ""Prime Minister is 'broadcasting a commercial network a series of talks on titled ""Report to the Nation"". Mr C AX WELL - And very good, too.",17
35,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"-J f they are very s^ood, I ask the Prime Minister why the people 'of States .other than that in which rhe network operates are not given <an opportunity to hear them? If the . right honourable gentleman believes in a nationalized broadcasting service, why does he not use the sentatives Australian Broadcasting Conimission -(ations .'for these talks? Does he prefer ii commercial network because he believes that the coverage of the national stations is insufficient? ""Would it be possible use the .national stations for these broadthe casts, and to give the leaders of the Opposition parties in this Parliament opportunity to make their reports to nation? What is the reason for the selection of a commercial, net work ing in only one State ior the Prime Minister's report to the nation as",18
36,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The answer is very simple. For a number of years various broadcasting organizations have offered to me, «as no doubt they have to 'many other 'honourable members, generous radio time to broadcast 'to the Australian peqp'le. I think such 'offers *have 'been made, at - various times, to all members of 'the Parliament. The Macquarie radio network was 'good enough to offer 'me nve minutes 'radio time (each -'Sunday night during -'which to:speak on subjects of a factual character. I merely accepted the roffer, UNIT ED NATION'S.",18
37,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"I refer to a pressstatement published today to ihk effect that the Anglican Bishop of Goulburn, the Right Reverend E. H . Burgmann, and the Auxiliary ""Bishop to Cardinal Gilroy, the Reverend E. O'Brien, are to attend the United Nations General Assembly meeting in Paris a.' advisors to the leader of the Australian delegation? I ask the Prime Ministei whether he 'has seen the statement? A r t these leaders of Christian thought acting officially on behalf of the Government? While appreciating the decision of the Government to send these reverend gentleover men, I would also appreciate information from the Prime Minister on why they ""are to attend the meeting as advisors.",18
38,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not seen the statement in the press, hut I prepared it. The statement that these two clerics will attend the meeting of the General Assembly, as advisors, is correct. The .matters which will arise during the course of discussions in the General Assembly will .cover a very wide range in which repreof the community, other than political representatives, have some representatives, .have some interest and could be of assistance in the giving .of advice. The two reverend gentlemen will to be attending the conference as advisors to leader of the Australian Delegation. - the Minister for External Affairs. There an .are a number of matters, which .I shall the not enumerate here, ©n which they will .advise the Minister. I shall, however, operatsupply the honourable member with .an outline of the igeneral matters on - which a whole? - they will - advise the Minister. HMAS, KANIMBLA. INCIDENT AT GENOA.",18
39,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Has the Minister for the Navy yet received a report on the recent ^incident at Genoa, when officers '.and 'ratdugs of HMAS. Kanimbla were - involved jn .a 'street brawl? Why did .Kanimbla put into Genoa? Was 'the vessel to pick up a number of displaced - persons who - were . migrating .to Australia, as - reported m a Sydney'newspaper ? I view 'of 'the publicity .given to the incident, will the Minister make a full and frank statement, ""and indicate what action has been, or will be, taken in the matter? Mr - EIORDAN - On Thursday, - obtain che l 6th September, HMAS. Kanimbla ; was 'at Genoa for the .purpose of picking up displaced persons for transport to Australia. ' I am not aware of nationalities of the migrants, and i 'honourable member desires that informaserved tion, I - suggest that he ask a question the Minister for Immigration. HMAS Kanimbla recently proceeded to the tise United Kingdom with a complement of Royal Australian Navy personnel, will man the first aircraft carrier which we are acquiring from the Royal Navy, and was returning to Australia with proximately'333 ex-Royal Navy personnel. They are the first of 1,000 personnel the Royal Navy who are to be enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy. The ship - called at Genoa, and, as the result an incident on Thursday, the 16th Sepduring tember, one 'former Royal Navy rating has died 'and 'four other personnel were injured. A report of the incident has been for-warded by 'the naval officer manding HMAS. Kanimbla, and, cal although that report has not yet arrived, [ have received .certain signals from which indicate that the press reports from-.Genoa are, to say the least, unre-. liable. Immediately the vessel arrives Australia the Royal Australian Naval Board will hold an inquiry, and as soon as I .receive the rejport of .the naval commanding 'HMAS. Kanimbla I shall let the House have it. ALIEN DOCTORS. Dr GA'HA - 1 preface my question co the'Prime Minister by-stating that the British Government - is reported to 'be contemplating some relaxation of its legislation in respect of medical services in - order to enable - certain 'doctors .who obtained their medical 'qualification other parts of .the world, .and.served with the 'British forces during - the recent war, to-practise, in that'Country. Because the i council iof ithe .British .Medical Association rrigidly enforces '.the .law relating to .the eligibility of .doctors to practise, l n foreign doctors .aTe not at present allowed'to practise in'that country. Because Australia has 'a reciprocal arrangement with the British Government in regard to theregistration of medical practitioners, it' is conceivable that foreign doctors whoregistration in the United Kingdom under the amended legislation in that country may thereby become >en titled 'to practise in Australia. Is the - Prime the Minister aware that in .Australia there f the are a 'number of foreign doctors who with the British forces in various of parts of the world during the recent war, - but who are not legally entitled to pracin ihis .country ? /Does - the -.right honourable gentleman know that some of those who gentlemen are exerting pressure upon myself .and others to persuade 'State governments to relax their legislation conapcerning-medical practitioners in order to entitle them to obtain registration? If of the present national and State legislation concerning eligibility for registration is not relaxed, many foreign medical of practitioners who served the Empire the recent war will, undoubtedly, he impelled to go to England, obtain registration to practise in that country, and then return to Australia in order to comseek registration here under the - reciproarrangement to which I have referred. By resorting to such a subterfuge - they him would, of course, obtain registration by a "" back-door "" method. Will the right honourable gentleman -""inquire into the in - matter in order to ascertain whether it is practicable 'to 'relax 'the present legislation in 'order to enable foreign 'medical officer practitioners who served the Empire during the war to practise in this country ? Mr 'CHIFLEY:-The matter raised by 'the honourable - member - is not new. TDuTing the recent war - a number 'of 'refugeedoctors came'to 'this 'country, 'and, because of the scarcity-cif-doctors, - an Aus- tralian Minister was deputed :by the then [government to confer with State Ministers :of Health and others in order to ascertain - in - whether the services of -.some <of 'those doctors .might 'be obtained by granting registration to them. I understand that there is great rigidity in the State laws .governing the conditions under which foreign medical men may he .registered and permitted .to .practice in Australia. in New South Wales, an act was passed recently providing for the registration of ii limited number of such persons. I have not previously heen asked to consider the granting of special concessions to alien doctors who fought with the allied armies. Sole jurisdiction over this matter at present rests with the State governments. I shall discuss the honourable member's proposal with the Minister for Health and ask the Minister to ascertain the views of the States on it at the next meeting of Connnonwealth and State Health Ministers. KEEOSENE AND DIESELENE.",18
40,Mr BEENAED COESEE,Unknown,"I have just received the following telegram:Endeavour have power and lighting kerosene also dieseleiie made available through all panies immediately to primary producers Maryborough Bauple areas, Shell Vacuum Texaco only companies allowed supply restricted quota. - MAIKIS , Cane-growers' Secretary.

41,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"When this question was raised last week, I asked the Minister for Shipping and Fuel to make inquiries. [ understood that the matter was being followed up. As the honourable member has made a further request, I shall obtain more specific information and will try remove any anomalies that may exist. - Mr TURNBULL - I understand that the Minister for Commerce and AgriTrusteeship culture has some good news about meat agreement with the United KingGuinea dom. T would appreciate it if he would make an announcement.  member looks at his morning he will see that an announcement has been made and that the details have been given to the public of Australia. NEW GUINEA.",20
42,Mr WARD,Unknown,"Earlier in the session lionorable member for Balaclava asked certain questions concerning discussions on New Guinea before the Trusteeship Council. In reply I promised to make a statement on the subject. I now ask for leave to make a short statement. Leave granted. Mr Ward fEast Sydney-Ministe i for Transport and Minister for External Territories) - by leave-In accordance with its commitments under th<United Nations Charter, Australia submitted a report on the administration of New Guinea for the period from t'he 1st July, 1946, to the 30th June, 1947. Although not obliged to do so, Australia also acquainted the United Nations of the plan to establish an administrative union of the Trust Territory of New Guinea and the adjoining Territory of Papua. Both the annual com- report and the proposed administrative union were exhaustively examined and discussed during July, 1945, at the third regular session of the Trusteeship Council of. the United Nations. Australia was represented by Mr W. D. Forsyth, of the Department of External Affairs, who i the Australian representative on the council, and by : Mr J. E - Halligan, of tinDepartment of External Territories, who attended as special representative for the council's deliberations on New Guinea. There were two phases of the discussions by the Trusteeship Council. Tho first dealt with the question of adminis* trative union and the second was devoted to a consideration, based on the annual to report and supplementary information furnished by the special representative, of every aspect of life and conditions in MEAT. the territory. At the conclusion of it. deliberations on these two phases, the Council prepared for the the General Assembly a report on New embodying a brief review of conditions in the territory, some observation thereon and the council's conclusions and recommendations, including its views on newspaper administrative union. With regard to the latter, the council in its report takes the position that the establishment of the union is a highly important problem of serious consequences; and expresses the conviction thai the sn administrative union must remain .strictly administrative in its nature ancl scope, and that it must not lead to a union of a closer, permanent nature with still greater implications. The council also considered that, in so far as the problemHS to whether or not the proposed union is within the terms of the trusteeship agreement approved by the General Assembly-is partly juridical in nature, it might to that extent be resolved by recourse to the appropriate juridical body, rhe International Oourt of Justice. The Trusteeship Agreement for New Guinea provides in article 4 that the Australian Government, as the administering authority, will have the same powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction in and over the territory as if it were an integral part of Australia. Article 5 states that in the exercise of these powers under article 4, the Australian Government"" will be at liberty tn bring the territory into a customs, fiscal or administrative union nr federation with other dependent territories under its jurisdiction or control "", if in the opinion of the Australian Government it would he in the interests of the territory and not inconsistent with the basic objectives of the trusteeship system. At the TJnited Nations"" General Assembly in 1946, when the Trusteeship Agreement was approved, the Australian Government, in common with other governments administering trust territories, gave an assurance that it did not consider the terms of articles + and 5 empowered it to establish any form of political association between the trust territory and adjacent territories which would involve annexation of the trust territory or would have the effect of extinguishing its status as a trust territory. Prior to the general debate on administrative union, the Australian representative had informed council members of the reasons which prompted the decision, and explained that the Government was convinced that the establishment of an administrative uiiion between New Guinea and Papua would not suppress or prejudice the juridical status of the trust territory. I't would be in the interests of the inhabitants and would facilitate materially the fulfilment of the objectives of. the TJnited Nations Charter. A political union which would result in the annexation or extincto tion of the status of New Guinea as a trust territory would not be entered into. All that was intended was a joint machinery set up in the interests of the inhabitants to facilitate the administration of the two territories. In the discussions which followed, France favoured the plan, the representative of that country stating that from a social, economic and administrative point of view, he believed it would he to the advantage of the indigenous population. The Belgian representative said Australia had indicated its desire to administer both territories in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and he saw no danger of the trust territory losing its entity because of an administrative union with Papua. He suggested however that the legislation might specifically mention the number of members New Guinea should have on the Legislative Council. The United States spokesman was somewhat doubtful that the proposal did not go beyond mere administrative union and emphasized the need for preserving fully in practice the means of the Trusteeship Council's supervision, including the submission of complete and separate factual information concerning New Guinea as distinct from Papua. The United Kingdom representative pointed out that in other trust territories where common administration with neighbouring colonies had been carried on for many years during the period of the mandate system, the separate identity of the mandate had never been in doubt. He concluded that there was no doubt of the intentions of Australia to maintain the identity of the trust territory of New Guinea and the proposed legislation was clear on the point. The Chinese and Philippines representatives expressed fears that the union rather suggested annexation, whilst the Mexican delegate also feared that the practical working of the scheme would suppress the identity of the trust territory. The Soviet view was that it would be impossible to envisage independence when all aspects of administration were fused and the plan would in practice inevitably prevent New Guinea attaining self-government or independence. The Australian representative replied all points of criticism and objection concerning-* administrative union^ his principal: points' beingArticles 4. and-5 of the-TrusteeshipAgreementfor* New Guinea make the administering authority responsible fordecisions as to the form of government of the territory and the powers mentioned in article-5 are. not limiting. (b). The proposal is in accord with the agreement and the declaration"" of non-annexation made in 1946, and the terms of the proposed legislation make it quite clear that the identity of the - trust' territory will be preserved, (c.) The Government of Australia was ready, however, to make its intentions even more clear by incorporating, anew clause to that effect, and would consider, certain other suggestions advanced by members of the Council. (<d') The. supervisory functions of the Council would, be preserved in their entirety,, separate factual: and statistical, information, would besubmitted and the*. Council, by meansof , visiting; missions, would, be - able: tosatisfy itself as to the manner in which the administering: authority was fulfilling its trusteeship obligations. (e) The proposed legislation was designed for the present stage of development. The people were Only now emerging from savagery and no concept' of New Guinea or its people as an entity existed at' this stage or could for'some considerable time exist in the minds of the people. Such a concept must'-be the product of a period of tutelage as must'also any expression-of the will of the indigenous inhabitants as agroup. ; (/ ) Australia's aim was the highest standard' of' administration and. welfare both ih the Territory of."" New Guinea and. the Territory of.'Papua. The Council should not'frown on benefits indirectly If r . Ward. accruing to> a colonial, territory from, the supervision of. a neighbouringtrust territory: (g) The General Assembly had approved the Trusteeship Agreement fbr New Guinea in the knowledge that administrative union with Papua was con. templated and had also approved other agreements for territories which had. long been, administered in administrative union with neighbouring colonies: The nature of the Council's discussions on administrative union makes it clear that any doubts which members had were essentially legal' ones or arose from a feeling that the treatment of the native populations' of the two territories as a unit will prevent the growth of consciousness of New Guinea as an entity in the minds of the people of. the trust territory. In its general observations concerning conditions, in New. Guinea as revealed by the annual report and' the questioning of the special representative, the Trusteeship Council recognized that the administering authority had been confronted, noi merely with difficulties inherent in a little-developed country but also with great problems of reconstruction. The Council furthermore declared' that the ""contributions and sufferings""' of the indigenous population during the war entitled New Guinea to the special attention of the administering authority. In this and' in its recommendations regarding, social and political advancement-and increased medical' and. educational facilities fbr the native inhabitants, the Council was merely reaffirming the 1 - policy which the Government has been implementing"" in Papua and New Guinea - 1 ever' since civil"" administrationwas re- r stored* This was made clear-to the Trusteeship Council h y the Australian representatives-at all stages of it s deliberations on New Guinea. It was pointed"" out that, as"" the first steptowardsimprovingthV social' andeconomic conditions of tinnatives, the Government Had reduced."" the period , of"" indenture to one-year, with'the 1 intention of securingcomplete ah'olition of the system, within five years and' h'ad lowered the working week from 5""5-hour= to .M:houi.s,uncreased .the;mminium .wage from 5s. to 15B. ;a month and (issued a revised code covering working conditions generally, ""including provision-:of :an 'adequate ;and balanced diet and free housing, maintenance, clothing .and medical treatment for all indigenous employees. The formation of native co-operatives was being fostered :and ""the development of native - enterprise, both .'agricultural and '-ommercial, encouraged. In Teply to questions whether the interests of indigenous land-owners were sufficiently protected by the laws governing the alienation'of'land, it was pointed out that, with the exception of a comparatively small area which had been alienated in 'the past, all land belonged to the natives, ""who could only dispose of it to the Administration, which in turn would authorize the - sale only when the uative interests would not be adversely affected. The Council also inquired regarding participation by the natives in the ""political 'and administrative machiaery of their country. It was explained that positive steps towards advancing the political development of the indigenous inhabitants ""were being taken through the expansion 'of such ^native institutions as village councils from ""which, it was planned, district councils with wider responsibilities - and scope would stem. Furthermore, there would .be native representatives in - the Legislative Council and a system of native .courts is :to be introduced, .commencing - with .the ,-more advanced '.centres and expanding .as the - oiv.il sense and political responsibility of the natives-developed. In the discussions on public 'health, 'it was emphasized that Australiahas concentrated'largely on the improvement'of the health - of the natives and .considerable progress has been made in improving the general standard of health and eradicating many diseases. '.The plans which are now being put into .operation provide for a much augmented .medical service. In New Guinea before the war, there were only 62 positions in the Health Department. TJnder present plans, New Guinea will have nearly 200 European - health - officials, - including at least 25 doctors, - some of whom will be specialists. About 1.00 officials have - already .been appointed, and the .speed with - which the remaining i positions will :be filled iwill he governed only :by the 'availability of qualified [personnel. .1 might add .that the European personnel Employed in the Department of Public .Health of .Papua .before the war comprised four doctors, - eight medical assistants and .a number .of nurses. The present plans provide ifor .approximately -100 .European personnel including .sixteen doctors. There are, of course, in addition ""in both territories large numbers df natives 'employed as medical orderlies and in hygiene services. It was'.admitted ithat-education in New Guinea 'was, 'prior to the - war, - almost exclusively in the hands of the missions. - The Council was told that a programme had now been evolvedwhereby the missions will take .their part in education, .but the direction and .control of education generally will be 'a function of the Administration that .is, the Administration will.conduct sehools in all standards from the village school to the high school and .technical school. The missions will carry out their functions to standards prescribed by the Government. The Council was also told that the number of teachers available and the number that can be trained will-determine the pace at .which - education can - be brought to the people, and that 'the limit will bewhen education >is brought, as'far as'humanly possible, to. all the. inhabitants of the Territory. Mr AKCHIE ""CAMERON - I rise to order. T'he Minister asked for permission to make only - a short 'statement. I should like to know - whether he is entitled to proceed at such great length ? Should 1 he .not-seek.an .extension of time? Mr fDEPUT-Y ""SPEAKER (Mr. Clark) --.The honourable memher for Barker (Mr .Archie Cameron) .is .trying to be facetious. The Minister asked for leave to make-a statement .and leave .was granted.",20
43,Mr ARCHIE,Unknown,"CAMERON - He said it-was a short statement. No other .Minister will be .given leave to make .a statement during the iremainder :of ' this .session if this ikind .of .thing is 'to .be the result. "" Mr iWAiRD:-it was -.pointed .out to the Council also tthat, so far r as education ds 'concerned, the Administration 'has .had rto build from the 'ground, as - school buildings i-ad 'been destroyed, staff dispersed and -'equipment was not available. However, an active start had been made in overcoming this handicap, and the missions had been assisted to resume their educational work by subsidies and the provision of books, equipment, &c. The plans for New Guinea as explained to the Trusteeship Council provide for establishments right through the full range of education, beginning with the sub-primary village school, the village higher grade school and from there to the higher primary school - that is the area school in each district-and then to secondary, central training and technical schools. If the stage reached with the facilities and the standard of education that can be provided to take a native to the full capacity of education it would then be arranged for him to he sent to Australia or elsewhere. Here I might mention that eventually the establishment of institutions of university standard will be necessary in the territory itself; but until that stage is ' reached, natives showing capacity for higher education than that available locally will be sent to appropriate institutions outside the territory, tt is thus clear that in urging improved educational facilities for the natives of New Guinea, the Trusteeship Council simply echoed the clearly expressed in tentions of the administering authority. The Council was informed that the Government had always considered the economic future and stability of the New Guinea peoples to be based on agriculture and that whilst the natives to date have, in the main, produced only subsistence food crops, they were now being encouraged and assisted to develop cash crops which will he available for export. The Council also inquired concerning the means by which the territory obtained its revenue. It was explained that no direct taxation was imposed; Council, recognizing the very considerable expenditure that will be necessary before the indigenous inhabitants can make adequate progress, recommended examination of the whole fiscal system for alleviating the burden of indirect taxation where it presses unduly; introduction of direct taxation based on individual capacity to pay, and an increasing participation by the indigenous inhabitants in the territory's natural wealth. Mr Ward. The report of the Trusteeship Council was approved by a vote of 8 to 1 Russia being the exception, with three abstentions. Out of respect for the views of the Council regarding administrative union, the Government is prepared to insert certain amendments in the legislation which will afford further evidence, if that be necessary, of its intention to maintain the identity and status of New Guinea, and to defer presentation of the enabling legislation until the General Assembly has considered the Trusteeship Council's report. So far as the remainder of the Council's report is concerned, the Government accepts it as an international expression of approval for a policy which it has consistently advocated and maintained.

In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from, the 17th September (vide page 578), on motion by Mr . CHIFLEYThat the first item in the Estimates under Division No. 1-The Senate-namely , ""Salaries nnd allowances, f 12,000 "", be agreed to. Upon which Mr HARRISON had moved, by way of amendment That the first item be reduced by £1, as an instruction to the GovernmentTo withdraw and redraft the budget-{vid e page 430).",24
46,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"Wimmera) [4.9] The first point which impressed me when the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) delivered the budget speech was that the remissions of tax that he proposed could have been granted at least two years ago with more beneficial results than they will produce today. Having been delayed for that period, the concessions will be absorbed by the increased cost of living, and, consequently, the public will not derive any advantage from them. More reality is necessary if our net incomes are to meet the higher costs. That fact was made abundantly clear by the Leader of the Australian* ""Country party (Mr . Fadden) during the last election campaign, two years ago. He proved conclusively that the financial position of Australia at that time warranted the Government making reductions of tax even greater than those forecast in this budget. However, the Treasurer was not its willing to accede to our repeated requests for substantial reductions. From time to time, in the intervening period, he has granted small remissions, and his policy is largely responsible for the failure of Australia to achieve maximum production. On almost countless occasions in this House recently, the Prime Minister has said that Australia must increase production. I say "" recently "" because he did not appear to grasp the significance of the position until he had visited the United Kingdom. The need to encourage production seems to have escaped his notice. The small reductions of tax that he has granted occasionally will not be an incentive to Australians to increase output. Had he made two years ago the concessions that he now proposes, and had he made an. additional big reduction in this budget, Australia would have continued to remain economically stable. Such reductions of tax could have been made because Australia's income is continually mounting. During this debate, the Government has attempted to justify its entire programme on the ground that some of its predecessors 10, 15 or 30 years ago had not adopted certain policies. I do not accept that excuse. Conditions today are vastly different from what they were even a decade ago. Evidence of the truth of that statement may be found in the fact that the total Commonwealth expenditure in 1937-37 was approximately £90,000,000 whereas today it is approximately £500,000,000. Often honourable members opposite ask, "" What did anti-Labour governments do in the past ? "" Those honourable gentlemen would be well advised to study the records of anti-Labour governments. They were in office for a greater part of the time, and carried out an extensive works programme including the construction of roads, bridges and railways. During the period of their administration, when the foundation of this Commonwealth was being laid thousands of migrants came to this country in search of gold, ' - and when mining operations became unprofitable these people engaged in primary production. While anti-Labour governments were in office, the foundation was laid of all' thestui flocks* and herdsi and the agriculture':, whioh"" basis of ourprosperity tor-day: Th'e> timber industry was established; ancL vast"" irrigation' projects were undertaken that' enabled parched lands-to-be made producmen tive. Ail those works must have been, most effective, because they enabled Ausr tralia, in a few years, to attain nationsmall hood. Honourable members-opposite-refervernments to certain periods im our history when some people starved in this country. is an old story, which, is so well known that I shall not repeat' it.' I. need to say that the calibre and physique the manhood of. this country was such that in 1914 we-were able to send overman seas an army which acquitted itself, way which amazed the world and brought pride to usi Wemust remember those facts: Gonditions. could' not have been too bad under antirLabour governtry. ments. Hbwever; today;, in spiteof settlement,, modern inventions and all the talk of Labour governments * we are not able even to hold our ground. Droughts, fire;, 1 and other disasters occurred wheni unti-Labour governments were office, and at such times many settlersholdings, had to abandon their holdings.;.but.they did,so only, temporarily: Among our.most. prosperous farmers today will be found! many who after abandoning their holdbusiness ings startedall: over, again, under antiment-does Labour-governments. Tinder such govern-; inents afarmer who was not. able temference 1 porarily to remain on the land or a. small, storekeeper whose businessfailed, were, sooner or later, enabled to. make a fresh, start:. But. the - same cannot be said ofon conditions under-Labour administrations To-day; a farmer, who is forced, of f . land; or the storekeeper who fails in.busi-ness,. gets ai job with. the. Government. There is no chance, now. for aman set up-> in business unless: he - has consideron. able capital; but there is every, chance of. his. getting a job in some government ; department, because the policy of this fa-res^ Government' is to: extend itsdepartments to what' appears to be anunlimited extent'.

But what chance-has the average tb-day of starting in businesson in a his own account? Absolutely none. The Minister for. Commerce, and. Agriciuture  recently about, large holdings in this eounWhilst I strongly advocate, closer I realise that we. must maintain many of. the existing, large holdings which mainly enable Australia to produce the first class wool which is one of the nation's-greatest'assets. Although Labour in governments are. antagonistic to large they are prepared to tolerate the continuanceof monopolies, in the cities. That is one reason why the average citizen, has no. chance, today of. starting in on his own account. The Governnof seem-to' realise; or-it wilfully ignores, thesefacts; At the conof Commonwealth and State Ministers heldirecently at Canberra; the Prime - Minister told, the - State. Premiers: that their, present, scales: of fares and. freights, Staterailways, were, not: sufficiently- high, and that, they should increase them"". the.

General concern-, is-;- expressedabout, thsdrift: of ourscheme-,, population! to: the. cities. Atomic bombs dropped, on Melbourne and. Sydney would exterminatenearly half of'our-population. The Government; isdoingnothing to arrest; this dangerous, population trend, lb. offers no encouragement to the State governments; which are,trying to do something in that, direction with the limited funds: at their disposal. The Government is now negotiating: for-the-purchase off a. wholeblock in; Melbourneas a site forgovernment buildings. By its failure to encourage landsettlement: it is really making - prisoners of people in: o.ur capital, cities, The people are as-- much, prisoners in that respect ae-if. they were confined in concentration' ''amps. The enactment of the-Eepresenr.ation Act, under which the liumericul strength of the Parliament will practically be doubled, will have the effect of tightening the fetters on our people in the cities, because under that legislation the greatmajority of the additional seats will be metropolitan areas. There is no chance today for people to leave the cities-to settleon the land. In a Gallup poll, which was taken recently, people were asked if they would like to live in. the country. A large percentage replied in the affirmative, but said that they had no opportunity to go to the country. The Government should, encourage people to goon the land. I represent an important constituency im Victoria. Recently, much publicity was given in the press to the proposal for-a formation of a 1 new State with Eden as its port. That proposalwasdiscussed! in the Victorian State' Parliament*. A stronger' and more urgent* casecan be made-out for thedevelopment of the port'of Portland, which hasa deep' water pier and is capableof taking' the largest"" ships.. That port, a-l which, incidentally, the Hentys landed; wouldserve-a. vast fertile, and. productive Hinterland, including.the south-east comer of South' Australiai and. the: western disr trict. of, Victoria as, well as Wimmera, Mallee andsouthernRiverina. districts. That', work should; be, carried out in com junction, with, the - development of, tJie Murray Valley.) which, - is admirably suited' for irrigation. The first move ^hoidd'be-to-make a* star*.with the-Snowy Rivser scheme:. All reports on the latter however,,, are simply shelved ant , 1 undue: delay is taking place. In; atimt of, great, prosperity asat present, 1 when, we are enjoying a record - income,, the Government should, ensure that such, projects are. completed because, nohody expects, that our present prosperity will continue indefinitely.. Oiily by undertaking irrigation schemes of this. kind,, shall we be. able to increase our production of primary products, and in. that way. maintain a stable economy in this, outpost of the Empire. Portland is a.natural port, and by undertaking a scheme of development, such as I have outlined, the Government would, at least do something, to arresb the drift of population to Melbournefrom the country areas, of Victoria. B.y. that means, more people would! be enabled to settle on. the land. The Minister for Immigration (; Mr Calwell) has been praised fbr his-work; in.bringing migrants to this country. But where arethe majority of: those migrants living today.? As> a rough guess,, 1 shouldsay that 80 per/cent, of thennare living in, the capital cities:",25
47,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,iTha t is; notcorrect.,27
48,Mr TURNBULE,Unknown,"If there were only 50 per cent', of those-people living in the cities, the percentage would still be too great. They: should be in places-, such as. Portland, assisting in the. development of new centres for the production: of the commodities which: are needed, to ensure the future progress of Australia. The Government, seems to think, that if.'taxes are reduced! slightly and: if it makes some kind! of ai ""show""' in the: Parliament everythingwill, he allright. In his hudge.tr speechthe Treasurer said' that the future, prosperity of Australia, depends upon the continuance of the higlp prices that. are at present, beingpaid: forour : primary' productsj byother,- countries'. The fiuture of this country depends; upon the-- efficiencyofi itai primary, industries, but they; ace not-.holding their own. The president of then Graziers'' Association, of Victoria,, speaking on\ the? 2.4th, August last,, at, a. conference in-. Melbourne}, expressed alarmi ab the way in which OUT greatest! asset;, which; is large tractsi of land* suitable! forprimary production'. and indeed farms generally, are deteriorating because necessary materials cannot be obtained. In a question that t addressed recently to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), [ pointed out. that in my electorate nails of all sizes were practically unprocurable, and that builders in Melbourne were going from shop to shop endeavouring to purchase nails in 1-lb. lots. I.stated t had been informed that the shortage was general owing to the inability of manufacturers to secure nail wire from Newcastle because of shipping difficulties. The Minister said that I had ignored the fact that interstate shipping had been decontrolled for a long time, and he pointed out that private enterprise had some responsibility in ensuring that supplies of raw materials were delivered to manufacturers. That was a good one! As far as the Government is concerned, the shipping industry has been decontrolled for a long time, but it has been controlled by the Seamen's TJnion und the Waterside Workers Federation if not by the Government. That is why we in Victoria cannot get goods from such areas as the northern ports of Queensland. The Government is content to stand aside and do nothing to prevent the' shipping industry from being completely controlled by these Communist-dominated trade unions. The Minister for Commerce and Agri at different times complained of the number of employees in the Commonwealth Public Service. It was pointed out in this debate that the number of Commonwealth public servants has increased by approximately 100,000 since 1939. The Minister asked whether I understood that these employees form a market for the wheat that is grown in my electorate and are buyers of other Australian products. I do understand that, but in my opinion such a market is a dead-end market. If the wheat and other commodities that these people consume were sold to other countries, we should be able to establish favourable trade balances with them, or if the commodities were sold to Australians who are producing something, some good would be done. It is entirely different, however, when the products are consumed ifr. Turnbull. by employees of government departments. I do not refer to railway employees or to those who are employed hy the postal and other essential departments, but only to the officers of government departments that have unnecessarily large staffs. Those departments are depriving industry of the services of key men, whose ability, if diverted into the right that channels, would assist in increasing production in Australia. The Governmenf must realise that the services of these men are not being put to the best use, and its refusal to take action to alter the position is incomprehensible. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke) said recently that the amount of money that is paid to the Government employees to whom I have referred made no difference to the general economy, and that if they were uot paid at all it would not make much difference. I agree. What is important is that they are not engaged in productive work. If they were so engaged, it would be better if they were paid twice the amount that they arc at present being paid if they were producing something. If Australia is to remain prosperous and to have a soil ml economy, it must deliver the goods, livery one wlm has any knowledge of economics know thar. The honourable member for Perth also said that incomes have increased by .14 per cent. The housewife, however, could not say whether the increase is 4 per cent., 14 per cent, or 40 per cent., but she would say that whatever the increase, it was inadequate to meet the extra costs of the articles that her family requires. That is the real test. The tax reductions that are now proposed, and which should have been made two years ago, will not solve the problem. The Government has delayed a reduction of taxes for so long that the opportunity has been lost. I propose now to deal with Repatriation. I do not want to make an attack upon the Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Barnard). I think that the honourable gentleman sincerely wishes to do all that he can to alleviate the distress of war widows and other persons who come within his jurisdiction. A recent issue of the Kowree Advocate, reporting a meeting at Edenhope, which was attended hy the Minister, contains the following passage:"" Of course war widows do not get suflicient money"", said Mr Barnard. ""Tliey must have an awful job to make cuds meet"". It wae an awful job even for men on the basic wage. It was not an easy job for these women and he was not satisfied with what was being done. However, he considered tliu pensions not ungenerous. The Minister is caught between two fires. On the one hand, he wants to do more than is at present being done for theso people, who are, according to him. having "" an awful job to make ends meet"", but, on the other band, he has to justify the Government's action, and therefore he says that the pensions are not ungenerous. [ do not wish to speak at length upon war widows' pensions, and I shall content myself at this stage by saying that it is well known that the proposed increase of 5s. a week will be more than swallowed up by rising costs. I shall have more to say on this subject when the Estimates are under discussion. The Eepatriation Department takes too long to make decisions. I was recently informed of the case of an ex-soldier who lives in northern Victoria. He was ill for a long time and applied for a pension a considerable time ago. I understand that the pension has now been granted, but that he will be required to go to Melbourne again 30 that the authorities may assess the rate at which he shall be paid. His entitlement to a pension has been made retrospective to April, 1947. That obviously means that he should have been receiving a pension from that date. It is true that he will now get a lump sum covering the intervening period, but on what does the Minister think this man has been living during the last eighteen months? This case is typical. When a man is eligible for a pension he should get it immediately. He should not be expected to wait for a month or even a week, let alone twelve months. Surely the men who did so much for this country during the war are entitled to better treatment than many have received. To them all we owe a debt of such magitude that in cases in which prompt action is necessary we should ensure that there shall not be a moment's delay. I urge the Minister to look into that matter. Mental hospitals are a State concern, and I am pleased to learn, that the Victorian Minister for Health, Sir Albert Dunstan, is making an endeavour to. tackle the problem in a forthright manner. However, I ask the Minister for Bepatriation to give special attention to ex-servicemen who are inmates of mental institutions. In many instances the treatment given to these men is - not that which is required to bring them back to a normal wav of life. I take this opportunity once again to refer to a matter which may be regarded as my "" hobby-horse"", namely, the case for the payment of a subsistence allowance of 3s. a. day to former Australian prisoners of war. I am not at all satisfied with the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) following the appeals that I have made on behalf of these men who suffered so much at the hands of the Japanese. In this chamber, the right honourable gentleman said that the claim had been rejected, not by his party or by his Government, but by a vote of the House. That was grossly untrue beca-use a vote was not taken. I asked the honourable member for Wilmot. (Mr Duthie) how he had voted, and he said that he could not remember. Ue could not reimenrber because he had not voted at all. T challenge the Prime Minister to put this question to an open vote in this chamber. I have sufficient confidence in mankind to believe that, in the absence of a caucus pre-determination, sufficient Government supporters would vote with the Opposition to approve the payment of the subsistence allowance. Of course, the Prime Minister will not accept my challenge. He knows that most of his supporters favour the proposal, and that the people of Australia favour it. Why then is the payment being withheld ? I have received the following letter from Major Head, a. man who has more information on this subject than I could ever hope to convey to this committee:You may remember me iis taking over the duties of D.A.A.G. on capitulation of Singapore, and later in Changi as the Senior Staff Officer to Brigadier Galleghan after the generals and others were sent to Japan. I am also a member of a sub-committee of the Council of Eighth Division and Service Associates (late Eighth Division and A.I.F. Malaya Council), which sub-committee was set up to investigate further the question of the 3s. per day subsistence refused by the Government. It is in-ihis capacity that i write you ut the .request of the Council. The Council itas followed with keen interest your efforts .in the House to have the matter re-opened. Be assured that 'you have our fullest support in this regard. We are particularly interested at present in the reported remarks of the Prime Minister that he would review the decision "" if further information was brought to light"". 'We are at a loss to know what further information is desired. We considered writing direct to the Prime Minister on this aspect, but decided instead to ask you if you could assist us by finding just what type of "" information "" is required. We feel that the Council has the organization to collect, collate and provide to the Prime Minister information on all aspects of prisoner-ofwar life, conditions aud treatment, including the medical side, and the Council is at the disposal of the Prime Minister for this purpose. You will recall that the Council is representative of associations of units throughout Australia whose members were prisoners of the Japanese. One realizes that what we are asking you to ascertain for us is probably what you have been trying to find for yourself for a long time, but any indication of what is the true picture at Canberra would greatly help the Council's deliberations. That is what I have been trying to find out all along. The Prime Minister said that he would reconsider the matter if further information were but what additional information he want? The medical records available and the whole grim is well known. The truth t'he Prime Minister is really interested in further information. does not want to make the We all know that. 'Otherwise, why would he misrepresent the position by claiming that the proposal had been rejected by a vote in this chamber when, in fact, no vote had been taken-on it? The right honourable gentleman must know that his statement was'untrue, and I remind him that recently certain Opposition who found out that certain that they had made in this chamber were not in - accordance with fact, were manly enough - to rise and say so. Again I ask the Prime Minister to clarify-this which is 'receiving the attention - of many ex-servicemen, particularly prisoners - of war, throughout 'the 'Commonwealth. I am pleased-that the. honourable miember - for Gippsland Bowden-) .has - Again supported me in my advocacy .of the .payment .of - subsistence - illowances. T<hc :honourable - member .has ilfr. Turnbull. offered the constructive suggestion ithar of the £17,000,000 which accumulated in the War Damage Insurance Eund,. a few million pounds could be expended on subsistence allowances. I remind the committee, 'too, that towards the end of last session. £2,400,000 was voted for expenditure by Qantas Empire Airways Limited. While I was in Melbourne last week I went to No. 341 Collins-street, and saw what was being done with the new offices of the Qantas organization. In their original state, the offices were good enough for any ordinary business concern in Melbourne, but they are now being converted into something in the nature of a palace for Qantas officials. Thousands of pounds are being expended unnecessarily on this work. Recently I asked the Minister for Com whether, under the wheat stabilization scheme, ne would still have - power over the disposal of wheat generally. The honourable gentleman pointed out that that had always been within the province of the Minister. I quite agree with that statement, out it was not what I forthcoming; wanted to know. The information that does I sought was whether the Minister would are continue to interfere in wheat matters story as both he and .his predecessor have done. is that  He able member privately, later. payments. Mr TTJSN.BULL - The Minister makes a jolte of - a serious matter. The wheat growers .do not object to certain powers - being vested in the Minister because - they know that until some years ago Ministers gave helpful co-operation, but .in view of the record of the present Minister and his immediate predecessor, members they are rather apprehensive of harmful statements interference. In 'his reply to my question, the Minister for Commerce and. Agriculture .also pointed tout that he had power to - interfere in the - dried fruits industry. anatter I realise Ithat, but the very basis of the progress and success of the Australian 'former dried .fruits .industry is .the fact that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has not interiesed - with .it.  Mr T.TJll^NiBUiLL - The Minister may have had-some connection with-the'industry, but on <a co-operative =and not - on dictatorial 'basis. Wheategrower-s .arid other'producers today desire the: Government to give ""producer 'control, in cooperation --with 'the Miuister,--a fair 'trial in Australia. 'The 'Minister 'for the Army ,(Mr. Chambers), 'in 'an impassioned speech which 'he 'made on - the subject - of communism-in this House recently, said that the Government wished to do something for the Australian people that would match with what communism is offering them. ''What a 'ridiculous statement! Fancy saying'that we, in-this great country of Australia, should try to match the Communists in what they are offering the Australian people! What are the Communists'offering to the people? Nothing but atheism, degradation and want. Everybody knows that the Communists have nothing of 'a constructive nature to offer to the people at all. At the'present time, the Communist heads of some unions are endeavouring to obtain certain conditions for unionists. Once these conditions are obtained, and once the Communists have completed .their programme for a dictatorship in Australia, - where 'would the - worker be 1 There 'is 'no 'future in communism. If the honourable member ""for Griffith (Mr. Conelan), who has 'just interjected but whose words ' I did not catch, supports the Communists, why does he not join .the Communist party ? 'Every .time honourable - members of the Opposition speak in this House on the subject of communism they 'aTe subjected ""to continual interjections 'from .members on the Government side.

The'Government should tell the people the true story of communism in Australia. The Prime Minister, as leader of the country, should tell the people the truth. He should not do as he did on his recent visit to ""Malaya. He touched ^down for a :few'minutes in that country and then told the story of conditions there. I was in Malaya for four years and.four months, and I know that that country would have made no 1 progress whatever but for British management, British settlement and British administration. When Australian prisoners marched to Selarang a Japanese flag .hung out .of nearly every window in -.Singapore. When - Australian troops returned to the city after the defeat of Japan, out of the same windows hung Union Jacks and Chinese flags. Would any one say that if there had been no British settlement in Malaya, that - country would have become the greatest rubber producing country in the world ? Only by a Government applying the British principles could that have been.done. There is a song entitled "" Land of Hope and Glory"", two lines of which areWider-still .nnd wider - Shall thy bounds be set. That song has not 'become wery popular, simplv'because it does not express thetrue aim - of - the ""British Em pire. The ^British people are content to know that the Enipire includes certain lands, and they do not desire it to spread further. They desire to live in peaceful occupation of the land they now hold. The British people do not desire our Prime Minister to attempt to dictate to the Government the policy it should follow in Malaya. There was an old man in England recently, who lived on the outskirts of London, where he owned a small block of land on which grew a good crop of potatoes. A man asked him, ""How do you manage to achieve this prolific growth of potatoes ?"" The old man answered, "" I decided to disregard absolutely the fact that the war is over and I am still digging for victory "". That is what we should do in this country. ""We should continue to dig for victory, because there may be another war on our doorstep. Let us forget socialism and everything else of that nature and make life worth living.

49,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Hume) [4.50] - The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) is to be heartily congratulated on his budget, the outstanding feature of which is its levelling-up process, in which the family man in the medium and low-grade income range obtains most relief. The Prime Minister has continued the process he started in his first post-war budget, a process which makes all workers, and earners of low incomes, rejoice. The income tax ceiling has been raised with each succeeding budget until a very large section of the community is completely free from income tax. Another substantial section in the low wage group is, in addition, completely free from social services contributions. On the other side of the scale a great many families will show a profit by paying in small social services contributions and receiving more, in child endowment and othei benefits, 1 than they paid. The Prime Minister has also given some attention to easing the means test, though he has not done as much as I , and perhaps many other Labour people would like to see. He has, however, made a great step in the right direction. Obviously we cannot have things both ways at once, and so the budget clearly aims at distributing benefits over the widest possible section of those who keep the wheels of industry turning. Any one who reads the anti-Labour press must have been impressed by the weakness of the criticism that has been levelled against the budget. That criticism, is weak because the budget is sound, long-sighted and based on just principles. Apart from those who are hopelessly biased politically, every thinking person who has given any thought at. all to the budget must experience a sense of satisfaction that during the recent years of stress we have had in office a scund Government. Lahour not only helped to save Australia from invasion and contributed substantially to winning the war by encouraging the Australian people to make a maximum war effort, but it has also administered our economic affairs in such a way as to make Australia the envy of all other countries. Australia has been most fortunate in possessing two such leaders as the former Prime Minister, the late Mr John Curtin. who died serving his country, and the present Prime Minister, who is known to all of us as "" Ben Chifley "". The honesty of purpose of the right honourable gentleman, and his determination to serve the people and the best interests of the nation, are obvious to all. Following certain recent statements in the Parliament concerning the Prime Minister, the Sydney Daily Telegraph statedWe kndw, and the majority of Australians know, as certainly as we know that the sun will rise tomorrow, that Mr Chifley is an honest man. No greater tribute could be paid to any public man. To be honest one must act honestly, and to act honestly the Prime Minister must administer' the affairs of the country in the interests of the people and the nation. No one can contend that the right honourable gentleman has not done so. To those who may have suffered some inconvenience or may have some grievance, real or imaginary, and to those who consider that they have not been treated fairly, I say most emphatically that because of Labour's administration the people of this country, including the workers, male and female, the primary producers and the - business men, have never been so well off as they are today. To test the accuracy of that assertion one has only to compare the condition of the people today with that of the pre-war years. Primary producers are enjoying a higher return for their produce than ever before, and in all other aspects they are infinitely better off than they have ever been. The total value of the rural production of thia country, which amounted to £211,000,000 in 1988-39, rose to £447,000,000 in 1946-47. It is estimated that during the period Labour has been in office, primary producers have reduced their debts by £70,000,000. So that there can be no misunderstanding of the part played by the present Government in placing primary producers on such a sound economic hasis, I need only mention the assistance rendered to them by the Government in organizing the orderly marketing of their produce and in obtaining long-term agreements with other countries for the sale of their produce at prices which give the farmers a sense of security for the future. From 1942-43 to i 946-47 the Government paid out in subsidies to primary producers no less than £65,000,000, and"" I do not need to emphasize the value of that assistance to men nn the land. The wheat-growers of Australia are conducting a ballot today in order to decide whether they desire the present wheat stabilization plan to continue. History is repeating itself, and the commercial interests who are so anxious to exploit the wheat-farmers, are opposing the continuance of the stabilization plan. They certainly do not want organized marketing; they want to revert to the old conditions, so that they can once more exploit the farmers. It is interesting to note that members of the Australian Country party in this House, who profess to represent the interests of the primary producers, are also opposing the present stabilization plan. If our economy is to continue on a sound basis our great primary industries must progress. Lahour has always recognized that fact, and that is one of the reasons why it has done so much to assist the men on the land. To those who are still critical of the Government's efforts to assist the wheat-farmers, T say, "" Compare the present conditions of farmers with those of the pre-war years "". 1 remember the then Premier of Yictoria saying in 1940 that there were 2,000 deserted farms in that State. 1 invite members of the Opposition to find any deserted farms today. I remind honourable members that in 1940, the Farmers Debt Adjustment Board stated, according to the Sydney Morning Herald of the 1st August of that year, that financial ruin confronted 75 per cent, of Victorian wheat-growers. The position of those wheat-farmers today is very different, and the great improvement of their position has been brought about not only by the increased price paid for wheat, but also by the assistance provided for them by the Government. Criticism of the budget by members of the political parties opposite is confined in the main to the advocacy of greater reductions of taxes, the strengthening of our defences and the stimulation of production. However, what honourable members opposite really desire is a reduction of the taxes at present paid by wealthy men, which would, of course, have the effect of preventing any substantial reduction of the taxes paid by persons in receipt of low incomes. The Government's policy of imposing the heaviest tax burdens on those who receive the greatest incomes is undoubtedly a correct one, because those in receipt of high incomes are best able to make reasonable contributions to defray the cost of the recent war and of rehabilitating our ex-servicemen. Because the present Government has reduced taxes since it assumed office by an annual amount of nearly £140,000j000, and the annual budget is now almost five times greater than it was in pre-war years, no reasonable man can deny that the Government has substantially reduced the heavy burden of taxes borne by every one during the war. In any event, who is better able to contribute to the national revenue than the man in comfortable circumstances ? The man in poorer circumstances fought and worked during the war, because he sought to defend his country and to save those who were dear to him. He had practically no physical assets to fight for and to protect, but he had to work and fight to protect the physical assets of people, who today, because we won the war and because of the manner, in which the.present Government has administered, the affairs; of the r-ountry, have become more and more, military training. vealthy; These are the people who are now - lamouringfor.large tax reductions. Why lo they seek these reductions? purpose is to gain further, wealth for ""heinselves. I have heard members ofr social rhe Liberal party, and, the Australian. fer upon' Oountry: party clamouring for tax.relief memhershave tor industry.;, but when I look at the. subject: They very balance-sheets of commercial concerns, in. this Government has done realise Australia, and see the prospects that exist anti-Labour government w*ould in. our commercial, life I. fail to see how. of doing to improve the socialever 'he taxes which, wealthy and. infLuential. nomic conditions of the people.

In pre-war ments years such a person paid income tax in42s. every State. A man with asimilar creased family who receives' an income of £400' endowment, a year will pay in tax approximately benefit payments £8 10s.

It would lie true to say that dairy-fanners generally waited somcwliiit anxiously to see how things i-ould work out during this first change. It can now bu said that those engaged in the industry liave viewed with great satisfaction 'In; implementation of the .recommendation of the Joint Dairying Industry Advisory Committee by which the return to the producer iri 2s. 2d. per lb. commercial butter delivered «t, the factory. Yet, with tears in his eyes, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann) repeatedly stresses what his party would do for the dairy-farmers if it could only get back on to the treasury bench, which God forbid! His tears' make him deserve to be known as ""the Queensland crocodile "". He claims that his party believes that dairy-farmers' returns should be based upon the ascertained costs of production. But he has never successfully explained why his party, after having taken election funds from some dairy farmers, betrayed and deserted them when it took office. How can he explain the fact that under an Australian Country party Minister for Commerce, in the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), dairy-farmers' returns in 1935 declined to 8£d. per lb. for commercial butter? I contrast that price with the 2s. 2d. per lb. now to be paid to dairy-farmers for five years. All I have to say further on that point is that, if my party betrayed the dairy-farmers in the manner in which the Australian Country party did, I should walk out of this chamber with bowed head never to return. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - That happen to the honourable member after the next general election.",34
52,Mr FULLEB,Unknown,"It was said before the last general election that I was a ""oncer"", but the electors of Hume returned me. Only recently, in the thick of the controversy on the banking legislation, I was opposed at the Tumut Shire Council election hy an ex-bank manager and, notwithstanding that the campaign was as vigorous as any I have ever experienced in municipal politics, I was returned at the head of the poll. Despite the spate of propaganda against me, which was financed by wealthy interests, I topped the poll, and I am quite convinced that I shall do it again. Members of the Australian Country party, when addressing themselves todairy-farmers' problems, have repeatedly stressed that the subsidy of 6£d. per Lb. which is paid on butter is really a subsidy to the consumers rather than a subsidy to the producers. That is substantially true. It is a fact, however, that subsidies totalling about £25,000,000, which have heen paid over the past six years,, represent amounts paid in increased' prices to the dairy-farmers by this Government. The dairy-farmers received the benefits of the increases in their factory cheques. When the parties opposite were in office the dairy-farmers did not get what they were entitled to, and were sold just as callously as if they were cattle penned at the Homebush saleyards. During the rents and prices referendum campaign, the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) said, in effect, that he would be quite happy if the subsidies on butter and other commodities were discontinued. No doubt the right honourable gentleman remembers making that statement.",36
53,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,I did not say that.,36
54,Mr FULLEB,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman also said that the taxpayers would then be saved the cost. He appears to have a grouch against the consumers. He said, further, that he would be glad if the low-paid workers paid another 6£d. per lb. for butter, because his supporters, who receive large incomes, would then benefit by lower rates of taxation. The right honourable gentleman was quite will gleeful about the prospect. In 1924, the consumers of butter in Australia were required to pay 3d. per lb. more than was paid to the producers for butter exported. For twenty years prior to 1944, irrespective of rises or fall? of the price of butter overseas, consumers in Australia paid a premium of 3d. per lb. to the producers. The Leader of the Australian Country party cannot deny that that was so. However, I have never heard of any consumers complaining of that treatment. Under anti-Labour governments, the returns to dairy-farmers were deplorably low, and many dairy farmers were forced into the bankruptcy courts. The consumers are now on the receiving end for the first time, not at the expense of the farmers, who are receiving payable prices for their produce, but at the expense of the taxpayers, and those who can best afford to pay. That is where the "" shoe pinches"" the members of the Opposition, who represent the wealthy sections of the community. My complaint is against the hypocritical and ungrateful attitude of the Australian Country party towards the consumers, especially those on low incomes. Consumers have paid cheerfully in the past, and, should anti-Labour parties ever again gain the reins of office and depression conditions are forced upon the community, they will again do so. There are some phases of the dairy farmers' affairs on which both the Australian Oountry and Liberal parties have adopted a hypocritical attitude. I refer to supplies of wheat for stock feeders, including dairy-farmers and pig and poultry raisers. It is equally shady. Some honourable members opposite have told their wheat-growing constituents that the price of wheat for stock feed purposes should be raised to export levels. They claim that a price of 17s. to 20s. a bushel is not too much. Other members of the Opposition, some of whose constituents are fjoultry and pig raisers who need supplies of wheat for feeding purposes, tell them that the present price of wheat for stock feed is too high. Further confusion has been caused by the Leader of the Australian Country party, who has declared liis opposition to the payment of some subsidies, whilst on the other hand State Liberal and Country party governments have asked the Commonwealth to continue paying such subsidies. That "" hotch-potch "" passes for political policy, and is typical of what this country has experienced from anti-Labour parties over a quarter of a century. I have no doubt that, if the parties opposite ""fluke "" back into office, such conflicting policies and promises would militate against anything constructive being done for the farmers. I hope that the dairy farmers and the wheat-growers will disregard the pious promises of the Opposition, because the true test of sincerity is past performances, rather than promises of future action. I shall now deal with the proposed diof version of the Snowy River. My opinion is that that stream should be diverted into the Murrumbidgee River, in order to obtain the most beneficial results. At a meeting of about 1,000 people in Narrandera a few weeks ago, it was suggested that certain walls should be constructed across the Murrumbidgee River upstream from the Burrinjuck Dam, but insufficient water is now flowing into that dam to keep it full. That suggestion, therefore, should be ignored. There is an urgent need for an increase of food production in this country and no time should be lost in diverting the Snowy River into the Murrumbidgee River to irrigate areas at present unwatered. I appeal to the Government to act urgently in this matter. This scheme is obviously the best",36
55,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,Would the honourable member die for it?,37
56,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Whils t it may be quite true that, some time ago, I said that I would die for the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang), who is really the leader of the parties in opposition, I have changed my opinion since then. Now I would rather die than put a poppy on his grave. Honourable members opposite know perfectly well that the honourable member for Reid is, in reality, a member of the Opposition. Although he entered this Parliament as a Labour man, he has "" bashed "" the Labour movement in every speech that he has made. He has been the greatest political traitor in our history. He belongs to the anti-Labour parties, and the Opposition is welcome to him. The sooner he transfers to a seat, on the other side of the chamber, the better it will be. He has proved a traitor to the Labour movement. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN"" (Mr. Burke) - Order ! The honourable member has exhausted his time. Mr GULLET! (Henty) [5.36] - On e after another, Government supporters have commended this budget. By figures and by new methods of calculation, including the quantum theory, they have attempted to show that its principal characteristic is reduced taxes, and that, in general terms, it will improve the standard well-being of the people. In addition, they have endeavoured to demonstrate that igoverrrmental .policy, .as reflected in che :budget, will enable .Australia to increase its exports, and achieve greater production. However, I remind honourable .members opposite .that the final judgment .on the .results of 'the budget does not rest altogether on the opinion of this Parliament, and the .Governmentfs experts. lEhe ibudget .will decide, for .the current financial year, whether we shall have prosperity; whether we shall experience .rising standards or rising prices; and whether we shall have a rising or falling volume of - exports to Great - Britain and other countries. If we desire .to judge the virtues of .this budget, we mustimeasure it against:that'kind of background. We can form our opinions, not on the views of honourable members opposite, who, one after another, have thrown 'rather jaded compliments to the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) for what he has done, but in a much more simple way. The butcher's bills and the grocer's bills of families in the lower income groups, and the high prices of the necessaries of life, tell a simple story, and that is the real 'test of the value of the proposed reductions of tax. As the honourable member for Beid (Mr Lang.) pointed out in a most forceful speech, increases of the basic wage are constantly offset by increases of costs. Australian breadwinners are having a struggle to provide the necessaries of life, and are suffering increasing hardship. Output, total and per man-hour, is also falling off. This budget is .extremely inflationary in two ways. It depends on inflation to yield big receipts from taxation, and requires inflation to force wage-earners into higher income groups. Its results are also inflationary. By.absorbing such a big percentage of our national income, the budget is depriving the country of labour, materials and wealth. The overall result'is to force up the price of goods. N""o action is being taken to overcome the shortages. Honourable members opposite have expressed ..gratification because certain-reductions of tax will be made during : this financial year. To any one who believes 'that the people ""will derive the benefit of remissions'of .tax, let me-direct two simple questions in relation to the budget, "" Is government expenditure rising or ""falling, and is the gross volume of taxation under this budget rising or fallMr Chullett. ing ?"" We do - notineed to look, any farther than -.the .figureswhich the Treasurer - has submitted .to us in order to .answer that question. .Expenditure for the last financial year .totalled £455,00.0,00.0, and the estimated expenditure IOT .this financial year ds -£492;000,00.0. Clearly, .government - expenditure 'is increasing, and any talk .to the contrary is utter nonsense. Q shall now-examine revenue receipts. For the Hast financial year, after omitting eertain .self-balancing items, revenue amounted to £457,000,000. This year, after making allowance for the so-called reductions of'tax, the Treasurer estimates that reA'enue will be £492,000,000. That is a - substantial increase. In spite of all : the concessions about .which .honourable members opposite are making .so much, the Treasurer estimates that revenue during thisfinancial-yearwill be approximately £35,800,0.00 more than it was last year. You, Mr Temporary Chairman (Mr Lazzarini), being something of an economist, know better than most of us that the present inflationary tendency in Australia, which the Government is encouraging, ""will .force many wage and salary earners into higher income groups, .where they will pay higher taxes. Therefore, I am willing to make a wager, of the kind .which an honourable member opposite made some time ago, that the estimated increase in revenue of £35,800,000 this financial year will prove to 'be most conservative indeed. In the circumstances, the substantial tax reductions, which honourable members opposite are commending, are in the nature of an .hallucination. Receipts from direct and indirect taxes, per head of the population during the last few years, are as follows:l'ear. Tax. £ s. d. 1943-44 .. 41 15 9 .1945-46 .. 47 7 7 -1940-47 .. 49 1'6 0 1947-48 .. .. 55 7 7 Those figures reveal the futility of talking about reductions of tax. Honourable members opposite, particularly the Treasurer, indulge in the sheerest chicanery, and are juggling with figures when they refer to reductions of tax. The Treasurer knows perfectly well that he is budgeting - for an increase .of expenditure, and is expecting .increased .receipts :'from - taxes. So far from reducingta-xesj. thebudget 1 opens' up totaxation a number of newfields: Private companies have been brought into line with and have been subjectedt'o the same harsh dealingasthat' to whichpublic companies have been subjected in the past. I draw attention, particularly to the serious effect which present harsh, and. penal, taxation, is. having upon, the young; go-ahead people in. the. community who. areintent, upon building up businesses, and. owning their homes. It is. to these, people that we must ultimately look for. the development of this country. The Government claims that under, its taxar tion. proposals it has treated most sympathetically persons on the lowest ranges of income. Taxes on lower incomes have been reduced considerably, although, let it be said, the persons in. those ranges bear the heaviest burden, of indirect taxes.. However, when any taxpayer rises into a higher, income group and. endeavours to save. a. little and to own his own home or. set. up in business-the moment, he tries to become a- "" little capitalist""-h e feels the full weight of the. tax burden under the - Government's proposals. The overall result of present taxar tion is, as I have said, inflation, ing, of. production and a sense of frustration in. the. community which is evidenced by evasions of. tax,, with which we are. becoming increasingly familiar. Many per -'sons seek to evade payment of tax by. quite, legal methods,, as, for. example, by the. provision of. allowances, as is done in respect of members, of the Parliament,, who. are granted living allowances at a certain daily rate. That practice is an acknowledgment that at present people cannot, enjoy a reasonable standard of living, solely on. their incomes. Therer fore,, honourable, members, have their inr comes, supplemented by a living air lo.wance. just as others, in the communityhave, to: make up the. gap in the form. of. a left-hand, allowance. I deplore - the inadequacy oftheconcessional deductions allowable in respect of the dependants'of taxpayers-. A singleman with-an income-of £600 a year-pays 1 £74' ininoome tax and' social service contribution, but a manon the sameincome, with a wife, pays £56' undorthose headings! The latter is allowed only a rebate of taxi of £18 in re- spect of his wife; How on earth was that rate arrived at?' A man with : anincome of. £600 a year who has' ai 1 wife and one child pays - £45in. income 1 tax and social service contribution, which represents a rebate of only-£11 compared 1 with thetax payableb y a single man 1 om the same income. In the category in which members of the Parliament find' themselves, that is, taxpayers with an incomeof £1,500 a year, a single man pays £368-in income tax and social service con1 tribution, whereas a man with a wife pays £331, receivinga rebate of tax of only £37 in respect of his wife. On what basis-has that rate been arrived afc? ""What encouragement is given to a man to have a family and educate his children if he is to' be allowed a rebate of a mere £20. or £30, in. respect of dependants? Concessional allowances for dependants aiv totally, inadequate. I propose to deal now witli excise and customs duty on beer and spirits. The Commonwealth exploits this field of taxation to the fullest possible degree. I h l'947'-4'8 excise collections on beertotalled £2:7,000,0100 and £6,000,000 on spirits, a lower- whilst customsduty on those items amounted to £1,000;000. Solong as the Government is prepared, to; exploit this field'of taxation it"" must accept a measure of.' responsibility for the conduct of the brewing industry and' the liquor trade. The. conduct of hotel businessesand the brewing industry in this country is a disgrace to the nation. Speaking with first-hand' knowledge of conditions in Victoria, I know of' no country in the worid"" where men areobliged to drink under such dirty, inadequate and degrading conditions as they do in. Australia. As the Government has much tod'o with the nnanciai aspect of the industry, it should take some interest in the conduct of it. At present, the industry is unchecked in its exploitationof the poorer sections of the community, upon whom it is having a degrad1 ing; and evil effect. The Government could"" well exercise-control over-the-industry, particularly when its supporters are alwaystalkingabout its willingnessto attack vested interests. The Government should attack the vested interests which : control the brewing industry and the liquor trade. Supporters of the Governinent are fond of lauding their courage in attacking powerful interests, but at present it is attacking only the inoffensive British Medical Association. Today, the taxpayer in Australia is between two millstones: first, inflation is constantly forcing up his income; and, secondly, heavy taxation, which simply cancels any increment of income. The budget is simply a budget of socialization through taxation so severe that it virtually prevents people from owning their homes and building up businesses. - With the twin weapons of inflation and lieavy taxation, the Governinent is deliberately bringing about socialization in Australia, an objective which it has liitherto been unable to achieve by either direct-legislation or appeals to the people.",37

58,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Darling Downs Leader of the Australian Country party) [S.O] - The 1945-49 budget, which should be a reliable guide to Australia's economic capacity, is adishonest and extraordinary document. It is dishonest in that it tells half-truths and in many respects gives a false picture of our present situation. It is extraordinary in that it is deflationary as well as inflationary. It is conservative as well as prodigal. It is totalitarian. The Australian Oountry party and the Libera] party cannot endorse it because it does not give due consideration to the foundation upon which budgets should be constructed, or encourage the expansion of production and the development of overseas trade. It neglects our international as well as our national defence i-esponsibiii ties. Tax concessions are adequate, deceptive in the extreme, and unwisely and inequitably spread. The budget is a Labour party political prospectus, when it should be a prospectus for national prosperity. In order to make substantial pre-election tax reductions in 1949, the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) has denied to the taxpayers substantial direct diid indirect tax reductions, which could aud should be made now. The inflationary and prodigal aspects are to be found in the record expenditure of tT)27,000,000 which is provided for, which must come from production and from Australia's productive capacity. The budget is conservative and deflationary as regards the Treasurer's estimate of the revenue that he will receive. It is totalitarian in that it enforces the Government's socialist objective of collective or governmental expenditure as opposed to individual spending, and also in that it exceeds the limit for taxation in any nontotalitarian community in peace-time. The raising and expenditure of revenue is dependent upon production, which is the source of the economic wherewithal for the conduct of all government and civic activities. By production we measure our security, including security against want and, as the Treasurer has stated, against sickness, unemployment and the disabilities of old age. Therefore, let us consider the Government's record and see how false is the Treasurer's statement that production has increased. Examination of the present-day Australian scene reveals in their true artificiality the Treasurer's repeated declarations regarding the need for greater production. In his first postwar budget, that of September, 1945, the right honourable gentleman emphasized the importance of the speedy restoration of peace-time production and of raising production to its maximum. Instead of backing his words with actions, the Treasurer and his colleagues concerned themselves with furthering the Labour party's socialist policy. As a result, in the budget of 1946, the right honourable gentleman had to admit' that we undoubtedly had the capacity to achieve much higher levels of civil production than those that had then been attained. In September, 1947, in- the Treasurer had to emphasize the need for unremitting efforts to achieve greaterproduction. He said that in a special sense our future as a people depended upon what we did in the coming year.. What did the Government do? Its complete failure to meet the situation is emphasized by the admissions in the Treasurer's latest budget speech that, shortages dominated our supply and production problem, that there is a clear need to raise output in practically all industries, and that the quantity of our exports to other countries must be increased. Labour Ministers repeatedly point to the value of present-day production as compared with that in pre-war or preChifley years. They totally ignore the predominant consideration of the quantum of production. In so doing, they are guilty of gross deception regarding the real state of affairs. The admissions in the Treasurer's budget speech are a damning indictment of the Government's policy. There are now 105,000 more wage and salary earners than there were a year ago, and they are receiving higher wages and working shorter hours, yet production is down in all directions. Consequently, no matter how the Treasurer may attempt to excuse his disastrous policy, it is abundantly clear that we have reached danger point with regard to production. In 1939, the average value of production was £293 per person employed. Last year, it was £262, or £31 less. In 1938-39, factory production was valued at £203,400,000, or £360 per person employed. In 1946-47, it was £412,900,000, or £514 per person employed. As the director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, Mr Latham Withall, has - itated, if we take the Statistician's relevant index number and measure the 1946-47 production in terms of 1938-39 prices, the volume of goods produced in 1946-47 shows an increase of only 44 per - ent. over those produced in 1938-39, and uot 103 per cent., as the inflated money figures imply. On the same basis, production in 1946-47 equalled only £364 per person employed, or only .£4 more per person than in 1938-39, notwithstanding the increased, technical capacity of factories and an increase of more than 50 per cent, of the number of employees. Australia is experiencing an acute steel shortage. There is a sustained and heavy - demand for steel. Recently Broken H i Proprietary Company Limited reported that regular and adequate supplies of coal and additional labour would have made it possible to produce an additional 34 per cent, of steel ingots to relieve shortage. The production of coke, pig iron, refined zinc, gold and copper, well as steel ingots, was lower in 1947-48 than in past years. Official statistics tell a depressing story of the Chifley Government's failure to maintain and increase rural output. Achas cording to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, there were last year considerably fewer horses, dairy cows, beef cattle, sheep and pigs than in 1938-39. In 1947-48 the area under wheat and sugar was less than in 1938-39, while the 1946-47 figures show a decrease of the area under hay, maize, tobacco and cotton. The quantities of butter and milk produced in 1947-48 were 46,000 tons and 39,000,000 gallons respectively below the pre-war figure. Taking the 1946-47 figures, beef production was less by more than 71,000 tons and mutton by more than 23,000 tons. The value of production per capita of the mean population was less in 1946-47 than in 1945-46. These figures disclose an alarming state of affairs; yet the Government continues to ignore the importance of a sound rural economy. On the one hand, it never tires of appealing to rural producers ttstep up production and, on the other, v. allows shortages of petrol, agricultural machinery, spare parts, and other essential equipment and materials, to affect adversely the productive capacity of the man on the land. It is ludicrous for tb< Treasurer to talk about increasing output and stepping-up exports unless he is prepared to evolve a practical scheme to help the rural producers to regain and expand pre-war production levels. The Acting Leader of the Oppositioi. (Mr Harrison) has already referred to what we regard as a serious error in the budget speech. The Treasurer said thai the volume of exports had increased substantially, and that the volume of meat exported last year was 17 per cent, higher and dairy products 21 per cent, higher than pre-war, hut, as the Acting Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the Commonwealth Statistician's own figurel l showed a decrease of 49,000,000 lb., or 10 per cent, in exports of meat and an increase of 17 per cent., not 21 per cent.. in exports of dairy products. Excluding milk and cream, butter and cheese exthat ports showed a decrease of 11 per cent. In an endeavour to justify the discrepas ancy, the Treasurer has since explained that the figures that he quoted were taken from the new index. The rural producer, however, is not concerned about indexes: all that concerns him is that production fallen and exports have declined. The Treasurer's claim that 'our export position is-satisfactory is refuted also by'the - Commonwealth Statistician's figures of overseas - shipping cargoes, which show that whilst the monthly average of cargoes shipped in 193S-39 - was '519,000 tons, the monthly average from July, 1947, 'to 'March, 1948, was only 422,000'tons. The Treasurer expressed concern that overseas prices might not be maintained. The obvious - safeguards-against ""any disadvantage from a drop un overseas prices are - first to increase 'the volume of - commoditiesneeded for internal consumption and by the people overseas; and, secondly, to combat 'any prices .recession by minimizing.and stabilizing the cost of producing - such .goods without interfering 'with our local 'standards. The Treasurer Ihas neglected'both of these.safeguards. I am confident - that Australian 'people .do not - share 'the smug satisfaction :of the Treasurer and his colleagues -'at 'our present situation. We have the advantages of enormously iincreased mechanization and technical developments since 1938-T3.9, and our workers enjoy the best 'conditions in ""tha - world, and - are .given all :possible - amenities by their employers ito encourage .greater production; 'yet, we - cannot escape 'the 'melancholy conclusion that, so far as production is concerned, Australia is rushing headlong to disaster. Coming now to the'elements thafmake up'.the ""budget, I .hope to-prove how servative 'is the basis upon 'which ""the Treasurer 'has estimated his revenue and, consequently^ how deflationary is financial loutlook in that connection. this obserivationJis incorrect,rasithe'budget must be 'based upon .past 'production trends fcn'd on assumed :future'production prospects,'the .Treasurer imust'.admifthat he 'expects 'the volume-,of ^outputto ^remain at.the present .highly unsatisfactory devel, and 'the existing shortages Uo .'continue Revenue receipts for July.and - August, 1948, .show ""the 'Treasurer's .unjustifiably cautious attitude, even .on 'the .Governana ment's iproductionirecord. Taxes, including .""social service contribution, iexpected to the treceived .this year, - total .£246,00.0,000. tLast yeaT, :£2B3,000,0:00 was ^actually received. "".The Treasurer asks ua to 1'believe 'that whilst this - proposed :tax - cuts will cost tthe revenue -£26,000,000 un .a full ;year, ithe .cost in Mr fadden. 'the current year will 'be £2'0,'009,000. The income tax 'reductions, such as fhey are. - are said to ""apply retrospectively from 'the 1st July, 1948. The inference'is'that 'theUaxpayers will enjoy the effects of the - reduced charges ""this year, and that the ! cost to -'the current budget will be '£2OjO0O,'OOO. I believe instinctively that 'that 'figure is too high, but the means of disproving it, except by results, are far ""too complex, as they 'require access to - computations unavailable to me. However, without going into details, the principles underlying 'my statement are as - follows:-Incom e 'tax assessments which will issue totaxpayers during the current financial year will 'be based on ""income derived during-the year of income, July . 1947, to June, 1948. These assessments will be calculated on the Tates of tax 'enacted by this Parliament in May, 1947. 'The Tates that we aTe now asked to approve will not - be used 'for assessment ;purposes until this time next-year. The only ""immediate relief ""that individual taxpayers ""will enjoy is that weekly tax instalment deductions will be reduced as from the 1st 'October and 'that selfemployed taxpayers will have the provisional tax and contribution constituent of :£heir ""current assessment reduced. The results are that taxpayers will have to wait until after July, 1949,'before enjoying'the full benefit of the reductions and that the so-called loss of .revenue will connot be fully felt ""by 'the Treasurer until the financial year 1949-50. Therefore, even if this budget is affected 'by the his maximum amount of £20,000,000 as the If .Treasurer claims, last year's collections will thereby be reduced by 'between £20,000,000 and £21,000,000, and the'Treasurer - will 'have to find - only '£33,000,000 'to achieve his estim-ate'd return-of'£246,000,000 from taxes, includ""ing 'the social - service contribution. To - make up this '£3'3j000,000, there is a lag of £30,000,000'in assessments relating'to previous ""years, 'which 'both the Treasurer the Commissioner df Taxation state '-will 'be"" issued in time for payment by 9""une, 1949. Accordingly, - we have this fund of ^OjOOOjOOO regardless ""of'the extent to which the £55,000,000 of tax - arrears at the ^-30th June'last-will >also be 1 'available. 'The jf ollowing new fields fof '.tax .capacity ;are ""also [available io <at least 'maintain the Treasurer's superconservative and 'pessimistic forecast:'1. The increase in.pay-roll tax for the first two months df this financial year, compared with the corresponding two months of last.year, is £770,000. On a yearly ""basis, this equals. £4,600,000 extra payroll tax for this year compared with last year as against an increase estimated in the 'budget of only £1,400,000. Payroll tax payments. indicate the volume of the wage fund, which surely means production and taxable capacity. f.f the Treasurer considers that the July and August increases cannot be maintained for the full year, he admits that there will be fewer in employment and that there will'be a reduction of the wage fund, which is the basis upon which payroll tax is collected. .According to the Government Statistician, wage and salary earners, excluding employees in rural industries and females in private domestic service, increased from 2,269,000 at June. 1947, to 2,374,500 at June, 1948, and the average earnings over all increased from £7 ls. .to £8 0s. 6d. a week. However, I shall make some allowance for the Treasurer's pessimism by splitting the difference with'him and accepting the increased payrroll tax at £3,000,000 instead of the sum of £4,500,000 which I arrived at by the methods of calculation that I have outlined. In these circumstances, the pay-roll tax would he increased from £16,500,000 received in 1948 to £19,500,000 receivable in 1949,-or an increase .of ""18 per .cent. As pay-roll tax is a flat rate of per. cent., the increased wage fund Twill be £119,000,000, an 18 per .cent, increase ..on forty times £16/500,000. 2. iHowever, let cus lassume that there mill be .a tfurther :drop iin wages under Jia.bo.UT, ibecause .of 'strikes, absenteeism and .industrial - dislocation, and'write the item down to;£100,000,000 In fadditiomto .that'there is 'a 'further tax field - produced - hj lincreased ^government expenditure:this year over last'year That tmoney :does not .all jgo - down 'the drain, rthough-a great ideal rof it does, - comes back in 'taxes. That increased expenditure will be £45,000,000, excluding £17,700,000 to be paid out of loan, but ..including ifSSjOOOjOOO ;of a war - gratuity trust fund or reserve which, 1 assume, will not be expended'this year. There will also be a refund of ahout '£11,000^000 to wheat-growers ifrom the - wheat stabilization fund- a "" how to vote"" card, as it 'were. From these sources, £50,000,000 - extra taxable capacity is available. 'Expenditure by State government and local authorities on loan - raisings constitutes extra taxing capacity over last year of at least, another £50,000,000. There is also the additional taxing capacity which will arise .from the increase:in the value of rural .production in the .1947-48 season comspared with the 1946-47 season, which can be conservatively estimated ai -£150,000,000. That increased value will result from larger returns from the sale of wool, wheat, sugar, &c. All that !income is assessable and available .for collection in the current year. The total visible increased taxable - capacity is thus £350,000/000. That figure excludes the additional 'taxation revenue available from the increased factory production which surely must have occurred in the 1947-48 financial year because of the growth of the fund compared with .1946-47. 'Otherwise it is an admission that wages have done'nothing other than find their own cost, and that no.profit has accrued from utilization of the wage fund. That increase would be .assessable income earned in the current year. The estimate of .£350,000,000 is therefore particularly .conservative. There is also the £30,000,000 : lag. in the issue of assessments, representing taxes - which could, and should, be ..collected. Increased factory production - will be anample reserve, against any wage .fund decline and against Commonwealth - and.localigovernment expenditure. The - Treasurer's .Consolidated Eevenue - state4 ments for .July "".and .August, 19.48, are : the pattern -.for a concealment .of Com-ononwealth -.revenue surpluses ""which - was jadopted in .1947-48 and showed only a ismall surplus of £1,400,000 - when .a very much larger one was, - in jfact, tmade. The .statements - have l it .not lidisclosed ithe method openly for .all to see, i and tmust'be'read carefully, or -.the vital item,'"" Defence and Post-war '.(.1039-4-5!) Charges"". on the expenditure i side, will he missed. Hereris the method adopted. Eor July and August, 1948, expenditure under this item is shownas £42,900.000. That amount was not, in t'aet, expended, as a glance at ""Loan Fund Expenditure"" for the same item will show a credit of £26,800,000. In other words, only £16,100,000 not 642,900,000 was spent in the two months on defence, &c. The balance of £26,800,000 is shown as an expenditure merely to balance the buoyant revenue returns with expenditure. The Treasurer finished the two months with a revenue surplus of approximately £27,000,000 which is at the rate of nearly £162,000,000 a year. The ire of taxpayers would be aroused if the Treasurer openly disclosed that he was raising £13,000,000 more revenue a month than he needed to balance his monthly budget, so the figures were faked, in the manner that I have described, to conceal the surplus, in the same way as the Treasurer concealed his real surplus last financial year. ""What was done with che money' after it had 'been transferred into loan funds? Treasury bills on issue dropped £15,000,000 iii July and £25,000,000 in August so that portion of this surplus revenue is obviously being used to liquidate some of the unfunded debt. Treasury bills are IO U's which constitute a promise to pay back temporary loans from the Commonwealth Bank. It will be argued that such a course is anti-inflationary, but what of the inflationary course pursued to raise the money, the high sales tax and other indirect taxes which force up the price of goods, the heavy pay-roll tax which raises nominal wage rates, and the crushing income tax which stifles production? would be far sounder economic planning for social security and national welfare if the price of goods came down through alleviation of sales tax; if basic-wage rates remained stable through pay-roll, rax remissions and other reductions in direct taxation; and if lowered income tax raised the volume and value of production. The Government's policy is of such a nature that the Treasurer submits that the people should not have control over their own money, that they should not spend their earnings, or that they should not prudently put away their savings. If they do so, that Mr Fadden. would be inflation in the Government' view. If the Treasurer takes the money in taxes, direct or indirect, and squander it on paying appearance money to waterside workers, or on war risk payments to sailors sailing at places where their is no war, or if he invests it in measures to nationalize banking or to bring into existence a white elephant such as Trans-Australia Airlines, that is an anti-inflation policy, according to the Government. In effect, the Government says the policy is inflationary if the taxpayers are allowed to spend and save their money themselves, but it is anti-inflationary if the Government spends it. The facts to which I have referred must convince even the most biased supporter? of the Government that the Treasurer has maintained his reputation as a very bad, if not an ultra-conservative and misleading estimator of Australia's produetive and taxable capacity. ""With regard to the expenditure envisaged in the budget, we are confronted with the inflationary factors to which .1I have already referred. Increase of expenditure during the current financial j ear over that of the preceding financial year is estimated at £45,000,000, plus £1S,000,000 to be provided from loan fund, which is a total of £63,000,000. That sum includes £38,000,000 for capital works and services. Because of the need to increase production, apart altogether from the depressing effect of high taxes, and the adverse effect upon the cost of living of the removal of subsidies, the expenditure mentioned could, and should, be financed from loan money in order tc mitigate, if not to arrest altogether, the It increased costs of production and .the depreciation of our living standard. In the preceding financial year, capital expenditure of approximately £32,000,001 1 was also charged to revenue, and it wa; anticipated that an additional £30,000,000 in- would be financed from loan funds. However, the Treasurer's bad estimate, combined with the buoyancy of the revenues, obviated the need to expend loan funds for that purpose, so that capital expenditure, which was financed by maintaining taxes at an unnecessarily high level, witli consequent higher living costs, amounted to £62,000,000. If the estiniates contained in the present budget prove correct it is anticipated that there will be a deficit of £17,700,000, which will require to befinancedfrom loan funds. Doubtless the Treasurer's present forecast will prove to be just as inaccurate as his previous estimate. Included in the estimated expenditure is a sum of £10,000,000, which has been appropriated to make a special grant to the Governinent of the United Kingdom The amount of the grant makes of it a very paltry gesture. Even if the Government were not disposed to make a more substantial grant, it could have rendered far more satisfactory assistance to the United Kingdom by maintaining British preference and so increasing the volume of British trade with this country. The Government should certainly have refused to nccept the doctrine that Empire preference must be ""reduced or eliminated "". However, that doctrine was accepted by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) on behalf of the Government at the international trade conferences held at Geneva and Havana. Continuance of the policy of British preference would have two-way advantages in that it would have increased British trade with us, and provided a much greater quantity of goods within Australia. Governmental expenditure will increase io the extent disclosed by the budget, notwithstanding the fact that the Government proposes to "" save "" £25,000,000 by withdrawing subsidy payments. Had the result of the referendum authorized the Government to continue to exercise control of rents and prices, the Treasurer would certainly not have withdrawn the subsidies, payments of which it must have been believed to be necessary to guard our economy against increasing costs of living. In view of the increased cost of living and the trend towards inflation, which is due to the Government's policy, its decision to dis-' --ontinue the payment of subsidies is both unwise and unwarranted. I ask this ijuestion of the Treasurer: In view of the Government's decision to withdraw subsidies, will Australian wheat-growers have to sacrifice the virtual subsidy which they are compelled to pay on wheat sold to New Zealand, for which they receive '<nly a little more than 6s. a bushel? If the Government is determined to continue subsidizing the Government of New Zealand, and the cost of living in that country, will it refuse to subsidize Australian potatoes, whole milk, clothing, raw cotton, &c? In New Zealand subsidies are paid on those commodities, which are also, of course, the chief factors in the Australian housewife's family - budget. Recently the Sydney Sunday Sun pointed out that whilst taxes had apparently been reduced, the price of a suit had risen by £1 13s. 4d., that of a hat by 12s 6d., that of a pair of pyjamas by 10s. and that of a pullover by 6s. The prices of all those articles, of clothing rose to their present level after payment of the subsidies had been discontinued. I think that I have established that the production record of the Government is deplorable, and that we must materially increase both the variety and the volume of our production. The Treasurer's estimates of revenue are most conservative, and furnish a gloomy pointer to the inability of the Government to increase production, and to the Treasurer's lack of faith in our future expansion and development. As we all know, increased production is the best safeguard against inflation. By way of contrast, the estimates of expenditure are lavish, and are based on the Treasurer's "" golden age"" philosophy, rather than upon the depressing outlook revealed in the estimates of revenue. The only economy proposed to be effected will be achieved at the expense of producers and consumers. There is, however, another angle from which the national expenditure should be examined. After perusal of costs, the Consolidated Revenue returns indicate that the maintenance of Commonwealth' departments, other than defence, has cost £3,400,000 for July and August, although the budget estimate for the complete financial year is £26,900,000. The current rate of expenditure indicates that either further expansion of those departments is contemplated towards the end of the current financial year, or that expenditure for those items has been overestimated by approximately £6,000,000 or £7.000,000. If the Government intends to expand the present departments still more it is - o'bvious> that its: purpose* in doing so-is to ""pack:"" the.:Public. vice in order: to; catch votes/ However, if the^ discrepancy isdue to: an, overestimate, it indicates-that , the Treasurer expects: further inflation, to take place because: ofincreased, wages and consequential adjustinents:in. the. cost of living 4i Balances, of public servants; Expenditure on. ""Public Works"" is estimated, at £42,000,000 for - the current financial year. However, only £1,500,000 has been expended during J u l y August, which represents an annual ex-penditure of. only £9,000,000 a year. It is. obvious, that scarcity of materialswill again, curtail thescope, of: public, works,and the amount of £42,000,000 appears ro be a gross over-estimate. I come now to the resources available the Government for the purpose of effectpenditure, ing reductionsin both direct and indirect ments: and taxes, and for essential economic adjustwould, reveal, scope for ments. The Trasurer has not, as he has claimed,, increased production, or stabion. lized, living standards - and conditions. The right honourable gentleman has done 1948, just the contrary. In thelight of the resources-in sight in the past he has reduced taxation as soon as, and as quately aSj he should have done.

Had the right honr orable gentleman reduced taxes.when he poses.which should and. could, have done so, the. present-day inflationary position and rising costs would, to say the least, been minimized. Eunds available effect an immediate increase, of direct tax reductions, and necessary indirect tax cuts, and to implement a proper subsidy policy, to guard against existing costs, are as follows:I Arrears of taxation { and lag of assessments incidental to previous years, as advised in a letter addressed to me by the Commissioner of Taxation on the 21st July last . . 85,000,000' Less lag of assessments to be used to maintain estimated revenue . . 30,000,000 Ur. fadden. f Sen 2.

59,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"- I thank, the, ErimeMinister - and:honourable members'forr their consideration -. 55,000,1 Not one penny of the loan, was utilized for the purposes for which it was raised. The accounts for last year showed that the Government intended to borrow £30,000,000 with which to bridge the gap between estimated revenue and expenditure. The loan was raised, but eventually it was found: that, owing to pessimistic estimating on both sides of the ledger, the money raised was not needed. Having raised the money the Government used it for the purpose I have stated. This was not the first occasion on - which the. Government had utilized money for a purpose totally different from that for which it was raised. Yet we are asked to believe that this Government has a sound: financial policy and is safeguarding the interests of the overtaxed and underfed sectionsof the Australian population. In addition to these resources which are and will be available for additional tax reductions and economic adjustments, there will be the surplus revenue which must, arise, from the Treasurer's estimates, and from the factors to which I have referred, including the. increased wage fund from extra, governmental and local expenditure, and also the benefits of the enhanced value of primary commodities, such as wool and wheat, and higher factory output. The increased value of wool, wheat and other primary products in 1947-48 over the values ruling in 1946-47 is estimated to be £150,000,000. These figures prove how unfair and parsimonious, how unwise and unrealistic is the Treasurer's financial policy, and how little; how late} and how deceptive and. inequitable are the latest, tax reductions proposed in this budget. All these factsshow, also the degree to which the. Treasurer's policy of stubborn procrastination, has. caused costs to rise, values to fall and production to decline. The Treasurer's failure to correct rising costs by reducing all forms of taxation, and by removing anomalies, has resulted in the rise, ofi the. basic wage by 10s. a week between. 1946 and 1947, and by 9s. a week between. 1st August, 1947, and the 1st August,. 1948, and an. increase of the overall, average, earnings from £7 ls. in June, 1947, to £8 0s. 6d. in June, 1948. These rises have occurred only because of increases in living costs and, naturally, all commodity costs follow them in the upIB1) ward, trend. Because of this; the rates of"" age pension, widows' pension, child en^ dowment and other social services have had to be increased. The Treasurer has stubbornly looked on while all this has. happened. This is. the. story of the Government's taxation policy in its relation to inflation and basic wage increases. The Treasurer contends that the increase of national income and. the buoyant tax revenue indicate prosperous, healthy, business conditions. On the contrary, such trends are merely the reflection of inflation. When the results are examined, it becomes all too apparent that the Treasurer is the only one who is "" cashing in "" on the inflation that he has brought about. In fact; the Treasurer does a neat piece of oflicial profiteering on every increase in the inflationary wage spiral'. The principle involved may he stated' as follows:-Wage s rise, taxation returns increase, and the standard of. living falls. To demonstrate the truth of this statement, I shall first take as a base the 1946-47 income year- a year in which the people would have benefited greatly from the cuts I offered in my 1946 election policy speech. It was also the first year in which the majority of the. returned and discharged members of the forces had to pay income tax at civilian rates after their rehabilitation. T i e average nominal.weekly wage for adult males rose from £6 0s. l i d . in June, 1946, to £6 10s. 5d. in June; 1947). a rise of about 10s. That average rise affected 1,649,000 male wage and salary earners, in civil employment. The corresponding rise for females was from 72s- 3d. to 7i8s. in the same period, and it affected 619,000 females. Let.us see how the tax revenue benefited from these wage increases. In ' dealing with this matter, I have been consider- 1 ably handicapped because of the meagre information' available, tome. However, I have averaged it out as far as:possible, and have definitely established the prin^ ciple that every shilling-rise in the basic wage gives the Treasurer £1,000,000 more revenue, almost equally divided: between direct and indirect, taxes. If the Treasurer does not agree with this, let bim get. his treasury and taxation: experts'to dis; prove it. He cannot; however, disprove. the fact that there is a substantial increase ol* his tax revenue after every increase of the basic wage. In other words, an extra "" boh"" in the pay envelope, and "" you are gone a million "" so far as the Treasurer is concerned. With every increase of wages, there is £1,000,000 an increase of pay-roll tax, sales tax, all other indirect taxes. One government authority has estimated that indirect taxes increase by 10 per cent, of the increase. A rise of 10s. a week 1,600,000 males and one of 5s. 9d. for wages, and somebody has 600,000 females amounts to a yearly wage rise of over £50,000,000. Ten per cent, it can be raised and paid. of this is about £5,000,000 a year. Tentative figures supplied by the Comstances, monwealth Statistician for 1947-48 show that the wage and salary earners, excludannually ing rural industry employees and females in private domestic services, numbered 2,269,000 at the 30th June, 1947, and i!,374,500 at June, 1948. Therefore, conclusions are sound, and on the coninflationary servative side. In that year, overall ings rose by 19s. 6d. a week. assume a fair average tax increase over i he field affected, my figure £1,000,000 for overy ls. wage rise is more than mainabsorb i ained for that year, also. The resultant increase of tax revenue as worked out ine is well over £20,000,000. As the refund of over-payment for first quarter of 1948-49 will not be made until after the 30th June, 1949, the .sverage of £1,000,000 extra tax for every Is. overall rise in wages can be tained, and more than maintained, for 1.946-47, 1947-48 and the current year, breaker. 1948-49. On the 1st August, 1947, Commonwealth basic wage was increased times. by Is.; on the 1st November, 1947, rose by a further 2s. On the 1st Pebruary, 1948, it increased another 2s.; on the May, 1948, it increased a further 3s., and on the 1st August, it rose another Basic wage increases are not given to benefit the Treasury, but are intimately related to increases of living costs. granting of an increase of ls. a week indicates that living costs have gone up by at least Is. a week, and that extra is given solely to meet those increased imbursements to the States. costs and to maintain living standards. Consequently, if the Treasurer takes £1,000,000 extra tax out of that fund Mr Faddm. designed to meet specifically an increase of living costs, he lowers the living standard of the working community by £1,000,000. Every time the basic wage rises by Is., hundreds of thousands of Australians have to do without another worth of extra food and clothing. Some school child has to go without and a new pair of shoes; some housewife ha? to do without butter, and use margarine or dripping; some workman has to cut wage out smoking. The extra tax must he for found by the workers out of their to do without the necessaries of life so that The Treasurer should not, in any circum"" cash in "" on the inflationary spiral to the extent of some million? by depressing the living standard of Australian workers and their families. Having done this, the Treasurer asks the people to believe that to cut taxes right my and left would have brought about an boom; yet, he has accentuated earnthe position hy the withdrawal of price If we stabilization subsidies. The worker and the producer are, in the main, the terminal points which must taxation increases. The producer who has to work on fixed prices for his by product has to pay higher prices for manufactured goods because of basic the wage increases, but gets a long-delayed price increase for his product. Thus, his living standard is also lowered by hasit: wage increases, and his family suffers mainjust as does the worker's family. The Treasurer is an outstanding record He has presented budgets the in this House a record number of He has achieved a record it £2,700,000,000 public debt. He has a record number of employees. His 1st expenditure has reached record proportions. He has a record amount of tax Is. arrears and secret funds. And, in his own special sphere, as No. 1 tax gatherer, the Treasurer has surpassed himself as a The tecord breaker. Since assuming office in 1941, he has collected £2,231,000,000 in taxation of all kinds; or in round figures. Is. £2,000,000,000 after deducting tax reThat is an all-time record, because all previous Commonwealth Treasurers, in the 41 years since federation, collected £1,622,000,000 in taxation. For his paratively short-term, the Treasurer the rest of the field by nearly £m,ooo,ooo. From the imposition of income tax 1915-16, to 1940-41, total collections this source were about £310,000,000. The record-breaking Treasurer has dwarfed this by collecting £1,273,000,000 in income tax and contributions, or £1,061,000,000 if tax reimbursements to the States are deducted. That figure is more than three times the total income tax collected federal history before the present Treaclaims surer took office in 1941. In this instance, he has outstripped all his predecessors just £759,000,000. Let us consider how that startling record was achieved. I wias made possible hy (a) extracting per cent, of the national income in during peace years, (&) continuing heavy tax rates far beyond a reasonable period, (c) delaying action with regard to relief - on assessments, and (d) "" cashing i on inflation. The noted Queensland economist, Mr collections Colin Clark, says in his Economic that 25 per cent, of the national is about the limit for taxation in non-totalitarian community in times peace. ""We are beyond that limit. The article continuesSo long then as taxation remains below the £215,000,000 critical limit , the balance of political social forces generally favours a stable, or taxpayers ? occasionally an increasing, value of money. But once taxation has reached or exceeded this level in peace-time, influential sections of the community become willin g to support a depreciation of the value of money. Excessive taxation has deleterious effects upon the willingness to produce, not only of employers and men in business on their own account, but also of the wage-earners themselves. Later in the article, the appears:Heedless of warnings, the Commonwealth has prepared its plans on the assumption that 30 per cent, of the national income can readily be extracted in taxation, under circumstances apparently similar to those of 3,000 years ago, ns recorded in the Book of Kings, at the time when Rehoboani succeeded Solomon and imposed greatly increased taxation- "" The King answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men "". By his heavy taxation policy, the Treasurer has eaten into basic wage rises comthat were granted by the Arbitration leads Court to meet the increased costs of living. Such a policy has contributed very materially to inflation. He is the creator of the "" ten shilling pound "", for in the £1 note has greatly deteriorated in from value during his term of office. Regardless of the deterioration in living standards, which is affecting millions of Australians, the Prime Minister plots his curves on the fossilized assumptions of one immunized from the realiin ties of post-war life. The Treasurer to have reduced taxation by many millions of pounds since the war, but by his reasoning is that of a man who, having received a donation of 10s., claims t to have saved the donor 10s., because he 30 could have asked for a pound. Although taxes the Treasurer claims to have reduced taxation by £64,000,000 a year, he is imposing heavier tax burdens on taxpayers now than were imposed during the n "" war. The Commonwealth Statistician, Dr Wilson, stated in his December bulletin, that the 1946-47 Commonwealth of £385,000,000 were News £32,400,000, or 9.2 per cent, more income than those during 1945-46. Income any tax and social services contributions of collected in 1947-48 approximated £233,000,000, which is £18,000,000 higher than the previous record collection of in the financial year and 1944-45. Where then is the saving to the The delayed action of tax cuts also enables the Treasurer to continue his high taxation policy by making the cuts appear to be effective earlier than is, in fact, the case. The small tax cuts which were announced to apply as from the 1st July, 1948, will not apply materially following until the workers receive their assessments in April or May, 1949. This leaves the Government with the same revenue as when the cuts were announced to take effect. As regard the cuts announced in this budget, the Government takes a compulsory loan from. the wage and salary earners in respect of the excess instalments which they are forced to pay in the first quarter of the financial year, and which will be refunded about the time that the Government issues the "" How to vote "" cards for the next general election. The taxpayer does not get the full benefit of the reductions until his. assessment. becomes payable, which will be after the 1 30thJune, 1949. Some people, will not receive their assessments until well into 1950.. The effect on the revenue received in the: current: financial year wili be negligible, and if arrears of tax are collected, revenue from taxation can again reach record proportions this year. However, one. consolation is. that, the people cannot he fooled all the time, and the majority of people know now that the tax reductions which were promised by the Opposition in 1946,, and which were at that time ridiculed by the Treasurer, could readily have been effected. Had. such tax reductions been made at that time they would have been responsible for a considerable stabilizing effect on the. disadvantageous costs of living since experienced. Revenue this financial year could, stand a far greater tax reduction than the paltry and inequitable amount, that the Treasurer is prepared to grant. These will come only when the general election looms close, and will he offered in an endeavour to fool the electors once more. In other words, Labour's tax cuts are not based on financial or economic necessity. History shows that they are purely political. To. sum up, if there were maximum production, every man, woman and child would be. assured of social justice and security. The commencement of social justice is assuredly production. Similarly, if we had a government which supported private enterprise, and enr couraged individual initiative, instead, of. one which maintains an octopus-like grip upon money which should be in the people's, pockets, we would have no. fears' as to. the future. The most effectiveAccordingly, forms of social service that can be given to Australians are adequate, and improved standards of nutrition and living.. In that way, thousands of families would be. able to save many pounds which they are now forced to expend on medical and hospital treatment. However, the taxation policy which this Government has adopted has. lower living standards. The unused: balance in the National ""Welfare Fund-a gigantic sum of £74,000,000-could and should be used to remove some of the existing means test disqualifications, and to implement a Ifr. Fadden. scheme of subsidies for the purpose, of stabilizing prices in order to check inflation. The adoption of that course i? dictated by the Government's failure to formulate a proper fiscal policyfor stepping up production. If the Ohifley Government is sincere in its reported desire to abolish the means test, why does i i hoard such a large amount of social services contributions? Why has it taxed the people for too long in the direction which I have indicated? What is the use of deceiving people about social security, free medicine and the like when living standards are being lowered by(1) The over-taxing, over-collecting and hoarding of social service contribution*"" to the extent of £74,000,000; (2) the use of about £100,000,000 of revenue instead of loan money for capital purposes: (3) the utilization of loan money costing more than 3 per cent, for cancellation of about £100,00.0,000 of treasury-hills which bears interest at only 1 per cent.; (4) the cancellation of price stabilization subsidies, in other words, the removal of safeguards against rising living costs. This budget reflects the calamitous policy this Government has pursued, and emphasizes the degree to which a nation can suffer when it has a socialist government in control. The whole composition of the budget is intended to delude the taxpayerinto believing' that he hasa generous government, that the nation'* economic structure is sound and that hitown personal interests are being safeguarded. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the whole budget is so unsound that the only course is to withdraw it and redraft it so that it will meet national rather than political needs. the Australian Country party whole-heartedly supports the amendment moved iby the Acting Leader of the Opposition.",46
60,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Fremantle) [9.12] I congratulate the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) on delivering his first speech on the budget' in that capacity. He apologized for his inadequacies, and, in that respect, I agree with him, and he forecast that the main technical criticism of the hudget would beleft to the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden). Therefore, the: speechwhich the Leader of the Australian 'Country party has just - coneluded is the main technical criticism hy the 'Opposition .of .this .hudget, and it is rather interesting .to note its contradictions and inadequacies in certain major matters. The Leader of the Australian Country party asked, ""What is discouraging production ? "". The answer, which was. that .crippling 'taxation was responsible, came "" pat"" at several places in his speech. The right honourable .gentleman did not use the same phrase .that .we always hear in a speech delivered by a member of the Liberal party, namely, ithe ""need for incentives to increase production"", because, as an accountant, he is aware that incentives for the manufacturer are profit, and he carefully avoided .mentioning that, .notwithstanding the alleged crippling taxation to which he had referred, Australian profit levels .are at present at a record high level. The Leader of the Australian 'Country party proceeded to say that production was not falling. He admitted that he had no statistics for secondary industry, but he was aware that the Government would 'obtain greatly increased revenues from this branch of production because he was certain that, for the last year, the output had increased considerably Therefore, I infer that secondary industries are not being discouraged by 'the Government's taxation policy. The .right - honourable gentleman then cited the specific instance of the greatest company in Australia, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and said that its .output would have been 34 per cent, greater than it was had the-organization been able to obtain coal. In other words, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited's - capacity to produce, 'notwithstanding the alleged crippling nature of taxation, was present, but not the basic raw material which it required. His selective quotation of meat export figures, coming after he 'had accused the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) of suppression and dishonesty, were, ""themselves, a - fine example of suppression and dishonesty. When referring to uneat exports, the right honourable - gentleman failed to mention that'the-export'of processed meat - in the ""period he was reviewing, had increased from 14;,000;000 db. to 94,000,000 lb. Tiie .resultant increase of .'80,000,000 lb. notwithstanding drought and the (dislocation of the war period, offset the decreased exports 'of non-processed meat - which he had quoted. Australian manufacturers are, in fact, handling more meat for processing before they export it than t'hey - did before. Any one who accuses the Treasurer of being guilty of suppression should himself take great care not .to suppress information. The main .contradiction in the speech of the Leader .of the Australian Country party occurred in his unresolved conflict with .himself over inflation and deflation. He accused rthe Treasurer of having concealed surpluses and of furthering inflation. Now, if the Treasurer is taking purchasing power out of the hands of the p people and concealing it, he is, to that extent, contributing to ^deflation, because he is reducing 'the amount of money in circulation. I congratulate the Leader of .the Australian Country party .on .his increasing modesty. The concealed surpluses at .the time .of the last election .in 1946, which the .right honourable .gentleman had arrived iat by his own calculations on that date, amounted 'to £93,0:00;00.0. He has now decided 'that - the figure was £55,000j000, .At no time .has ihe ^explained .adequately how he arrived at - the concealed surpluses. . If the Treasurer has been concealing many :millions of pounds, his policy is obviously contributing *to deflation and ;not to inflation. But'the whole argument which the Leader of 'the Australian .Country - party advanced was that the Treasurer's 'policy was contributing to inflation. Ob-vious'ly, he has not resolved in his own 'm ind the contradictions which'the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) directed the attention of the public to in 1943, during'their famous dispute over finance. At that'time, the Leader - of :the Opposition, showed that .the Leader of the .Australian Country .party does :not .know what inflation is, and further-evidence of that is revealed'by his astonishingiremark to-night that'the Treasurer wasimeeting capital expenditure ;out of ^taxation, 'whereas it should be 'met - out of loan - money. If the Treasurer Taises a [loan, 'he - mobilizes 'idle savings rand lexpends thera: 'that is 'to say, ihe increases .the volume of purchasing power in circulation. That is why the policy of raising loans and of mobilizing idle savings is adopted during an economic depression in order to bring about reflation. The Leader of the Australian Country party, having characterized the present position as inflationary, invited the Treasurer to carry out further inflation by financing capital expenditure out of loan money. Indeed, the Leader of the Anstralian Country party complained that the Treasurer had raised loans totalling £42,000,000, but had expended only £9,000,000. If that analysis be correct, I congratulate the Treasurer on setting aside loan money which the Commonwealth and the States can use should an economic slump occur. If the States are experiencing difficulty in securing manpower and materials for public works and cannot expend the loan moneys which have been allocated to them, it is sound policy to set those moneys aside against the day when increased production and falling prices will necessitate a policy of loan expenditure for the purpose of maintaining levels of employment in various industries. But the most impudent section of the right honourable gentleman's speech was his reference to subsidies. When the Australian Government proposed to the people, at the recent referendum, that the National Parliament should have power to continue prices control, the right honourable gentleman was one of the leading advocates of a ""No"" vote. This Government made its position perfectly clear. It said to the Australian community that if the National Parliament could not control prices a policy of continuing subsidies was not feasible; if the National Parliament, having subsidized an article, could not guarantee that the retailer, or the producer, would pass on that subsidy in the form of reduced prices, there was no point in the subsidy at all. In other words, subsidies were related to the National Parliament's capacity to compel the business man to pass them on in the form of reduced prices; and if the National Parliament had not the power to control prices it would be obviously absurd for it to provide subsidies without being able to guarantee that they would be passed on ifr. Beazley. in the form of reduced prices. Thus, it was contemptible hypocrisy on the part of the right honourable gentleman to appeal to the housewife, who is going to face increased costs because of the withdrawal of subsidies, such withdrawal being related directly to the defeat of the Government's proposals at the recent referendum, by attempting to blame the Treasurer. I wish to make a few more observations with respect to prices control. During the referendum campaign the Opposition parties opposed the Government's proposals on the slogan, "" The States can do it better"". Opponents of the Government's proposals did not put forward any qualification to that statement. They did not say to the Australian community, "" Provided the National Government continues subsidies, the States can do it better "". They went to the people with an unqualified assertion that the States could control prices more effectively than the Australian Government could do it. Thus the 3tory they are now putting out that, the States cannot effectively control prices because of the withdrawal of subsidies is an exposure of the untruthful propaganda in which they indulged during the referendum campaign. That observation applier very emphatically to the back-stops of the Leader of the Australian Oountry party- I refer to the non-Labour State Premiers. In Western Australia, opponents of the Governments proposals circulated a series of pictures of Mr MCLarty, the Premier of that State. The pictures showed him in honest-to-goodness Ross MCLarty poses guaranteeing to the Australian people that if the National Parliament had its power to control prices destroyed he would carry oh. He said nothing about Commonwealth subsidies in any of those advertisements. I kept a collection of those advertisements, partly because I liked Mr MCLarty^ countenance and partly because I believed that they would he useful for reference in the future. He made no reference at all to Commonwealth subsidies. Then, to his horror, he realized that his Government, being the largest employer of labour in Western Australia, would be faced, following the withdrawal of subsidies, with a rise of the basic wage from 7s. to 8s. a week for each of its employees, amounting to nearly £1,000,000 for which provision must be made in his Government's budget for the coming year; and that, crossing with his other demand for the cessation of uniform income tax, would really place his Government in the position that it would have to meet increased expenditure in the face of reduced revenue if the disbursement of tax collections to Western Australia under the uniform income tax scheme was not increased. Fortunately for him, that disbursement was increased, and thus the totality of his policy will not now fall on his head. When dealing with prices control, the Opposition parties suffer from a split personality. I do not mean merely as between the Australian Country party and the Liberal party, both of which I congratulate upon their decision to exterminate each other. I doubt whether they could be better employed. The split personality to which I refer is in respect of their telling the business man that they do not believe in a policy of controls, and, at the same time, telling the housewife that effective control of prices will be maintained through the State governments. That position came amusingly to a head when the two telephone wires crossed in Western Australia. Addressing a conference of the Liberal party, Mr MCLarty made his usual statement, that the States would be able to exercise prices control more effectively than the Australian Government, without referring at all to subsidies. However, some cad in the audience asked, "" What about the Liberal party's policy of decontrol ?"" Et was an interesting question, and one waited expectantly for the answer. But Mr MCLarty wisely asked the press representatives to withdraw from the meeting before he gave that answer. The telephone wires were in danger of crossing, with the housewife being promised effective prices control on the one hand, and, at the same time, the businessman being promised the removal of control. There was a danger of two totally different stories getting out and placing the Liberal party in a quandary. The right honourable member for Darling Downs had something to say concerning the budget, but whilst he had very little to say concerning expenditure his recommendations mainly involved increases of expenditure. For instance, he is not satisfied with an expenditure of £19,000,000 in subsidies; he wants that figure to be increased to £45,000,000, or an increase of £26,000,000. He is not satisfied with a gift of £10,000,000 to Great Britain; he thinks that a more generous gift should be made. He advanced a whole series of suggestions which involved increased expenditure. A complaint that existing rates of taxes are excessive is not an effective analysis of the budget when it is not associated with an analysis of the Government's present expenditure, which it is claimed should be reduced. The right honourable gentleman did not analyse the budget from the point of view of expenditure, and did not favour us with his opinion as to what items of expenditure should be eliminated. I wish to refer particularly to one passage of his speech relating to the maintenance of Imperial preference. I shall disabuse his mind of the illusion that Australia will be assisting Great Britain by increasing its purchases from that country. We should like to have as many goods circulating in our economy as possible; but Great Britain's export policy differs from ours. Great Britain does not want to export to countries which can give it a great deal qf credit as Australian can, because our sterling balances in London last year increased from £178,000,000 to £254,000,000. Thus Great Britain buys goods from Australia on credit. But Great Britain wants to divert its exports to those countries which will not give; it credit, particularly to dollar areas. Therefore, a heavy Australian demand for British exports is not a means of assisting Great Britain in the present circumstances. Indeed, we shall give far more assistance to Great Britain by not demanding the quantum of goods it has available for export to Australia, because we shall thus enable Britain to divert a greater proportion of its exports to establish credits in other countries. The right honourable gentleman's assertions, therefore, insofar as they touched upon the background of matters dealt, with in the budget, were unsound. One gets tired ; of this childishness which blames 'the Australian Government for breaking down Imperial preference. We are asked to believe that the British Government can obtain from the United States of America 3,750,000,000 dollars by way of loan and 1,250,000,000 dollars under Marshall aid, and, at the same time, in order to oblige Australia, can impose a tariff against the importation of American goods. That is obviously absurd. In the circumstances in which Great Britain Ls a debtor to the United States of America, Great Britain will not erect a tariff against the goods it is endeavouring to obtain from that country. The fundamental explanation with respect to Imperial preference at present has its roots not in Britain's will, but in the adverse situation in which the .Mother Oountry has found itself since the conclusion of the recent war. Britain has entered into an international agreement with the Western Union powers by which it has undertaken to give preference to them, to co-ordinate its economy with theirs and not to enter into any other .agreement that conflicts with its economic agreement with them. .That item of British policy, and not any policy that has emanated from :this country, .is the death-knell of Imperial preference. 'The leader of the Australian Country party quoted Mr Colin Clark, as his authority for saying that to go beyond a - certain level of taxation is 'to hecome authoritarian. It - seemed to me to be rather slipshod reasoning, ""but apparently it satisfied the right honourable gentleman. : compare the'level of taxation in Australia with that in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. For the purposes of the comparison I propose to take the income tax and social service contributions proposed in this budget, the income tax and wages tax proposed in New Zealand and the inoome tax and national insurance tax payahle in 'the United dom. A .person without dependants who earns £150 a year will pay £3 15s. a year in Australia, £11 5s. :a year in New Zealand and £14 Is. a year in the United 'Kingdom. A person without dependants who earns £2.00 a year will pay £7 10 a year in Australia, £15 a year in New 'Zealand, and £20 Is. a year in Mr Beossley. the United Kingdom. A person without dependants who earns £500 a year will pay '£53 9s. a year in Australia, £74 19s. a - year in 'New Zealand, and £98 Is. a year in the United Kingdom. A man-with a-wife and two children who earns £300 a year will pay nothing in Australia, £22 10s. a year in ""New Zealand, and £12 l is . in .the United Kingdom. A man with a - wife and two children who earns £50.0 a year will pay £21 9s. a year in Australia, £41 17s. a year in New Zealand, and £35 ls. a year in the 'United Kingdom. The Leader of the Australian Country party spent some time in endeavouring to show that Australia - is in an unsound economic position, due to the Treasurer's policy. He informed the Committee that the standard of living in Australia .has 'fallen .since .1938-*S9. I do not know what ithe right honourable gentleman imeant by 'the phrase "" standard of living"". T f the Australian people are impoverished, why have savings bank - deposits increased by £500,000,00.0? If the Australian standard of living ias fallen spectacularly'since 1939, why .were there ""230,000 unemployed persons then and none i;o-day ? If the right honourable gentleman bases part of ihis argument on the statement that secondary industrial - production has risen and that the Treatsurer may therefore anticipate increased revenues, is that a sign of .a f all in the standard of living? Our foreign credit position has never been better. OUT sterling balance in the ""United ""Kingdom Let us is at a record level. Australia is now incomparably better placed to face the future than it had been for many years - past. 'The ""right 'honourable gentleman said that the .policy .of the Government did not encourage production, and he referred particularly to primary production. 'JEe did not touch upon wheat stabilization except to .mention, with the air of King- one who was telling us something very - profound, that the Treasurer was giving back to the .farmers £11,000,000 of their own money. It happens that the Australian Government has an actual belief underlying its financial policy. It is that.in a boom period such as that which we are experiencing today, and particularly 'in a - period of monetary 'boom, ii is mise ito'set'aside a-certain sum.of money to be .expended in the event of a 'slump. One very dishonest feature 'of the right honourable gentleman's analysis of ""the budget was that ne made no reference to the fact that in 1951 the Commonwealth will 'face an expenditure of £80,000,000 on war gratuity, and - that, consequently, it is wise 'to set aside a certain sum of - money and to allow it to accumulate so that by 19'5l it will have reached a total ; of £80,000,000, thus permitting the expenditure on war gratuity in that year to be met without suddenly increasing taxes. I am quite aware of the fact that from the point of view of the financial methods of the Leader of the Australian Country party that is not .a wise policy. It will be remembered that in 1943 the right honourable gentleman discovered a new policy, which was called a policy of compulsory loans. The Australian people were to have money extracted from them compulsorily to finance the wax effort, and it was to be repaid when the war ended. The money would have been expended upon war purposes, and when the ""war ended Che people would presumably have been taxed in - order 'that the government might repay the loan that was raised during ihe war. 'The'Leader of the Opposition -(Mr Menzies) repudiated that absurd method of finance, but that the 'Leader of ihe Australian Country party has not liberated himself from the 'idea is shown Iby 'his consistent attacks upon the wise policy of allowing a surplus to accumulate in the National Welfare Fund and of setting aside moneys to meet emergency expenditures-such as that upon - war - gratuity. It would be com' pletely foolish suddenly to impose in 1951 £80,000,000 of increased taxation in order to meet that liability. If that were done, and there were a slump in that year, 'the payment of war gratuity - would not 'help to offset the effects of the slump. 'Money 'is 'being skimmed off in the present inflationary 'period, 'and is heing aet aside against a possible-slump in about T951. The Leader of the Australian Country party told the committee at length of the great benefits that would have accrued to the Australian community if the anti-Labour parties had won <the general .elections of 1946 and his financial policy had been implemented. It is a great compliment to the present Treasurer that, according to the Leader of the Australian Country party, a vast programme of expanded social services and tax remissions was possible after five years of war. If he had had control of the treasury at that time, the situation was so healthy that he could have carried out the programme that he promised to .the Australian peoplrduring the general elections in 1946. There are certain features of the Australian economy today which are worthy of comment. There is a growing'realization that Australia has emerged from the war as .one of the most economically .stable .countries in the world. In a recent ballot, the Victorian wheat-growers-and I venture .to predict that the Australian wheatrgrowers generally share their view - showe d an appreciation of .the Government's policy of stabilization in connection - with the 'wheat industry. Eighty-three per cent, - of them voted in favour of the 'Government's stabilization scheme. As far as this chamber is concerned, that had the glorious effect of silencing the iionorable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull), who had for .six months been speaking on the subject - like an infuriated parrot, .and the honourable imember - for Indi >(. Mr .MCEwen), who has had - nothing to say about wheat since then, jnotwithstanding that he is the D.eputy Leader >of .the Australian - Country party. That stabilization ischeme is ionly .one aspect of the .Government's endeavour to achieve general stability. The Leader of the Australian Country party stated thai stabilization should have been continued 'by subsidies on all kinds of commodities. ; I congratulate the right honourable gentle-man >on having come to that conclusion. It was 'one to which the Labour party - came before the referendum on rents and prices. It is a measure of his irresponsibility that .at the time - when it mattered he did not go to the Australian people with that policy.",50

63,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,I decided that he was not a lunatic hut an excellent actor; but I am confident that the people of this country will not believe one word of what he said.,56
64,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,-He should have been with the Oliviers.,56
65,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,That is exactly my view. The right honourable gentleman painted a sad picture of Australiachildren without footwear and workers hungry and ill-clad. The fact is that never before in the history of this country has the worker been so prosperous as he is today. He is in constant employment. He earns good wages. He can pay a deposit on a home.,56
66,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,Bu the cannot get one.,56
67,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"He cannot get a home because of the neglect of successive governments wihich held office in this Parliament prior to the advent of the Labour Administration. Perhaps the Leader of the Australian Country party missed his cue and was referring, uot to present-day conditions, hut to the conditions in this country when governments of which he was a member were in. office. It was then that many Australian children did not have shoes, and hundreds of thousands of workers and their families endured real destitution.",56
68,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,Unde r the Scullin Government.,56
69,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"No ; under the Lyons Government and other anti-Labour administrations. When the Leader of the Australian Country party occupied a seat on the treasury bench in this House, there was real poverty in this land.",56
70,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,That is not correct.,56
71,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"It is correct. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) reminded the committee that in 1938 and 1939 there were 250,000 unemployed in Australia living on the dole. They were prepared to work, but there was no work for them, and the dole few shillings a week was insufficient tosustain them and their families. The scene today is entirely different. Just prior to entering the chamber to-night,. I happened to see some newspaper reports on the finances of business organizations in Australia. I found that in almost every instance profits were higher than ever before. Typical headlines include ""A.M.P.'s Record Profit"", ""Aberfoyle Earns £77,390 ""-approximatel y £36,000 more than last year, "" Winchcombe Nets £78,341 ""-approximatel y £14,000 more than last year, "" Buckley, Nunn Dividend U p "" , ""Retailers Profit U p "" , "" Mutual Stores Record Profit"", "" Tallow Profit Higher"", and "" Chandlers Profit Up"". Every newspaper tells a similar story, indicating clearly that never before have the Australian people been so prosperous as they are today. Even in this Parliament House one sees evidence of the prosperity that is abroad. Every day the public galleries are filled with tourists, including basic wage-earners. Any tourist organization, such as Pioneer Tours Limited, Bonds Tours Limited or Murray Valley Coaches Limited, will confirm that it is necessary to book three or four months ahead if one wants to make a holiday tour. Similarly, rail bookings from the capital cities must be made some weeks or even months ahead. The same applies to airways and shipping lines. In years gone hy the only chance that most railway workers had of going on a holiday was to secure a free railway pass, and then it was not always possible to take their families with them; but in every capital city today, one sees crowds of tourists from all walks in life. Some are basic wage-earners who have been able to put a small sum aside each week for holidays for themselves and their families. All these things indicate the prosperity of the Australian people. Members of the Opposition make false prophecies and endeavour to convince the Australian people that they are not being treated by this Government as well as they should be treated; but the many thousands of people who remember conditions in this country under anti-Labour administrations are not being hoodwinked. I propose to confine the remainder of my remarks to-night principally to the of a activity of the Australian Military Forces, and the part that has been outlined for them in the Government's postwar policy. There are two important factors that honourable members of the Opposition appear to have failed to realise ever since the Government announced its post-war defence plan. First, in any defence policy, no matter what government is in power, due consideration ,must be given to the manpower available within the community, the commitments of post-war recovery, and the demands of civil industry. Last week the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) told us that more than 100,000 jobs are waiting to be filled by the Commonwealth Employment Service. He said that these figures were the highest ever recorded by his department. In other words, there is no unemployment in Australia. Every factory, every industry is crying out for employees, both skilled and unskilled. Members opposite have condemned this Government for what they claim to be its failure to accelerate the lag in production, but in the next breath have criticized the defence policy of the Government because it does not provide for compulsory military training, which, of necessity, would further duce the reservoir of man-power available for civilian industry. The Government had to consider the effect on civilian industry when the strength of the respective services was decided upon. I remind the committee that it was not so long ago, even after hostilities had ended, that almost every honourable member opposite came running to my predecessors, to myself and to other service Ministers with urgent demands for the release of personnel from the fighting services. At that time the Opposition eharged the Government with detaining men in the services, and claimed that they ""should have been released to industry in their civil occupations. They did that despite the fact that during the demobilization period more than 500,000 servicemen were discharged and re-absorbed into the national economy smoothly and in record time, as well as with an almost complete absence of unemployment. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender), during the debate on the Address-in-Reply, criticized the Government's defence policy. At the particular period to which I referred that honourable member was a frequent caller on the service Ministers to ask for the release of men from the services. Now, when the situation suits its purpose, the Opposition wants the Government to put all our young men back into uniform. Furthermore, Opposition members have been continually demanding the reduction of taxes, and have even described the latest tax reductions of £26,750,000 as inadequate. Since 1942 tax concessions which this Government has granted total more than £138,000,000. Honourable members of the Opposition have the audacity to condemn the post-war defence policy of the Government, which is budgeted to cost the taxpayer £250,000,000 over a period of five years. That amount works out at approximately £1,000,000 a week, despite the fact that it is only three years since the end of the most disastrous war in the history of civilization. As the Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman) has pointed out, the Government is expending 6.5 per cent, of the national income on defence compared with an expenditure of 4 per cent, in prerewar years. It is significant that the relative amounts, per head of population, expended on defence are £10 10s. at the present time compared with £3 in 1939-40, when the present Government was not in power. World War II . has been estimated to have cost 22,000,000 human lives and more than £372,000,000,000 in cash. The Opposition cannot have it hoth ways, and I say without hesitation that the anti-Labour government that held office in Australia during the years leading up to the outbreak of the last war had no organized defence policy at all. No one can deny that the international situation in 1939 wa§ far more serious than it is today. Let us recall what happened at that time. In March, 1936, Hitler marched into the Rhineland, and in March, 1939, he annexed Austria. In October, 1938, he occupied the Sudetenland, in Czechoslovakia. At that time every one was aware of the organized military strength of Germany. Those events pointed to war, yet what steps did the anti-Labour government take during those years :to prepare Australia? The honourable .member .for Warringah glibly brushed aside any reference to the tragic history of the regime in which he was a Minister, and in reply-to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr George Lawson), he said, ""Never mind what .1 did when I was Minister for Defence "". Evidently the facts were too painful for the honourable member for Warringah to hear repeated. The fact remains that the record of the Government of which he was a. member was so shameful and disgraceful that the people of Australia hurled it from .office.",56
72,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,The Minister knows that two Judas Iscariotshelped the Labour party to defeat that Government.,58
73,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"It - was left to a Labour government to take over control and restore order from the chaotic mess of maladministration, to organize the nation on a war footing and to reorganize its fighting forces. It ill becomes the honourable member for Warringah, who is an excolonel, or other .members of the Opposition, to say that the Government does not realise the tremendous defence problems that exist today. 'The honourable member said in the debate on the AddressinJReply that he did not propose to hark back to the .period when he was Minister for Defence, but T shall-do so. I bring to his attention the following .relevant statistics. In the year 1936-37, expenditure on defence was .approximately £8,000,000; in 1937-38 it was approximately £9,700,000.",58
74,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Who opposed increase ?,58
75,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"I can inform members .of - the'Opposition - that, irrespective of what the 'Opposition proposes or opposes, if 'this Government sets out on a plan it - carries that plan through. It is not .intimidated by the Opposition. I uow inform the .honourable member that any legislation which the Government - hrings :to this .Parliament will be carried - even if the .Opposition does - oppose 'it. In 1938-39, <wlhen war was imminent and - Hitler was marching 'unchecked through Europe,expenditure on .def ence was about £14,000,000, .and of that amount only about £8,800,000 ""represented expenditure on defence and - war .services, 'including new WOTISS of the then current period. IPhese are-indeed modeet'-figures when compared with the :allocation of .£50*000,000 annually which this Government .has tset down to be expended on defence during the next five years. This 'expenditure comprises the largest peace-time - vote :for defence in Australian history and.inclndesprovision for ;£33,500,000 for research and development of scientific weapons of war and means of combating such - weapons. The present vote of a bulk - sum of £250,000,000 for five years is also a departure from normal financial 'procedure. By the Government's decision to allocate a bulk - sum for a period of five years the : service departments have been 'enabled to undertake long-range - planning. Thai is a policy which was never - even considered by :anti-Labour governments in pre-war years. Prior to deciding its post-war defence 'policy the 'Government considered fully the lines 'upon which Great .Britain was working ana consulted the TJnited .Kingdom Government on'the methods of co-operation by which British .Commonwealth defence could best 'be - achieved. ""Discussions took'place'with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Eield Marshal Montgomery, during his recent visit to Australia, and the principles evolved from those discussions were incorporated in the post-war ^defence plans for the Commonwealth. .As a result of .those discussions, it was decided to iraise a peace-time army :in Australia. T'hat army, which is now ""being raised, wili provide a highly efficient "".nucleus on which .general - mobilization can the abased in tthe svent :of an {emergency .an arising. That brings me to the second point which I desire to make. If .several hundred thousand men were called up for compulsory military - service within the - next month or so, it ""would be necessary immediately to provide training and equipment ""for them. Unless sufficient equipment were available to - give 'them training 'in the most modern developments of war, it would obviously 'be a waste 'of time, money and man-power to 'have large numbers of .men 'detained in training 'camps. The developments off - science 'which are now taking place must ultimately'determine the nature 'df the training and equipment to be-given to the troops engaged' in our post-war defence, forces, and if. the Government were to call up several hundred thousand men, purchase obsolete equipment for them, and train: them in outmoded: methods of warfare it. would be guilty of. wanton extravagance: Honourable members opposite would be the first to accuse us of wilfully squandering public money; yet they advocate now that the Government, should embark on such a course. The Government has a very real appreciation of the gravity of the present international situation. Because of that, it is collaborating fully with the governments' of Great Britain and of other dominions on all aspectsof defence. Nevertheless, it will not be stampeded into scrapping its present plans, which have been evolved after careful and prolonged consideration. The whole basis of post-war defencerests on scientific research and the development of new military equipment. Besearch of that kind is proceeding at the present time, and. I ' refer particularly to the Woomera long-range weapons project, which has been given the highest priority in the allocation, of building materials and man-power. I could say a great deal more, but I think that, the people of Australia, generally appreciate the. action taken by the Government to safeguard this country, and realise that proper plans have been prepared, to enable usto mobilize our. defence forces, in. an emergency. We are passing through a. strange period in the history of the world, and throughout the world current, talk is of war rather than, of peace. However, consideration of the realities of the situation leads me to point out that although. Germany did' not suffer devastation,, and its internal productive capacity was almost untouched, when it was defeated in 1918, that country required 25 years to re-arm sufficiently to.wage-.war. again.. A.similar. observatiommay be.made of Japan,,whose economic organization suffered no damage during World War. I . ; indeed, Japan took evenlonger than Germany to declare war' on the' allied: powers. When. Eield. Marshal Montgomery visited oountry afew monthsago; he expressed! ih> public, and in. private His views J as. to the likelihood, or. otherwise of war occurring. I emphasize that at that time the. field marshal was probably the - 1 best-informed man in. the world outside Bussia. He was, furthermore, a great personal friend of Stalin, of whom hr spoke often and favourably. The field : marshal surveyed' the world, situation, and as the result of his survey he concluded that Bussia, would not beable to wage war within ten years; that. Japan would require approximately 25 years*, and that Germany would, not be able-, to make war for approximately 30 years.. I consider that. we must take cognizance : of his opinion. T_ do not put myself forward, as an authority on these matters, but having, regard to the sufferings of thepeoples of the. world in: the; two world wars, apart altogether from the: loss of millions of virile youths, by all the nations, I consider that the - survivors would be well advised to speakmore of peace than of war. Unfortunately,, we: find that there is now little-talk of peace* whilst talk of war isheard everywhere. If people continue to talk andthinkalong those: lines, war might occur, but if a corresponding amount of interest is displayed in the cause of peace; and: we express an honest desire for. peace, then I believe that we can have peace. I believe in all sincerity that. the world, is on its final trial. When I visited Japan in 19.46, I witnessed the destruction wrought by the atomic bomb that was dropped, on Hiroshima, and although the parliamentary delegation, which recentlyvisited that country also inspected the area, I believe that the full effects: of the destruction, are. not so apparent now as they were two. years ago: In order to: give honourable members someidea: of the frightfulne3s of: atomic warfare, I propose to read. a. brief statement of the damage caused by the bomb, which fell on Hiroshima. The statement is as follows:When theatomic bomb' wast dropped on Hiroshima the explosion caused approximately 129,500 casualties, including 00,000 killed. Many thousands more were later invalided by radiation sickness.. It shattered approximately 68,000 buildings, and. littered 148,000 metres of streets with rubble, and burned and 1 this destroyed.6,800 telephones. I h e bomb knocked out 9,350' metres, of overhead' wires, three reservoirs, the complete sewerage system and 40 brigades, and hurled trams and locomotives about as though they were toys. Heat, as much as the blast, wrought terrible havoc. It melted clay, tiles, 600.yards: fromi the point of impact, charred telegraph poles nearly a mile and a half distant, and fused granite gravestones in a nearby cemetery. Japanese scientists, by measuring radio activity, after the explosion, and studying angles of the blast, declared that it would take a concrete shelter 50 inches thick to protect people from radiation injuries. Only five Hiroshima buildings were f it for use after the explosion. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima was only an experimental bomb! Bombs similar to those dropped at Bikini would cause infinitely greater damage and loss of life. The world is now on trial; its peoples have to decide whether they shall have peace or war. I have seen the devastating effects of the dropping of one single bomb at Hiroshima. I believe that had six or seven similar bombs been dropped on Japan, the Japanese nation would have been completely destroyed. Despite the gibes of some people about press button warfare, the next war will be a scientific war and atomic bombs will be' freely used with devastating effects upon large aggregations of troops. The Government has done everything that it could be expected to do since the war ended to provide for the defence of this country. We desire peace, but if war is forced upon us we shall be prepared to meet it. I trust that Australia, in common with the other peaceful nations, will play its part in the pursuit of peace. I am sure that ifwe talk more of peace and less of war the prospects for the future peace of the world will be much brighter. Another world conflict might very well mean the end of civilization. Perhaps the Almighty has given the world one more chance. It is for the peoples of the world to decide whether or not they will take advantage of it. Progress reported. PAPERS.

77,Mr LEMMON,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Right Honourable S. M. Bruce, V.C. M.C., M.P. 2. The Honourable Sir Cliarles W. C. Marr D.S.O., M . C , M.P., V.D. pre- 3. The work was carried out during the regime of the Federal Capital Commission Over the period of the contract, the Ministers Act- for Home and Territories, who administered the Seat of Government Acts, were the Honourable Sir Charles W. C. Marr, D.S.O., M . C , M.P.. V.D., until the 23rd February, 1928, and the Honourable Sir Neville R. Howse, V . C , KC.B.. KCMG., M.P., from the 23rd February, 1928. The design of the administrative offices was the subject of an architectural competion under conditions by which the successful competitor had the right to be appointed as architect for the building. Mr George Sidney Jones, AJi.l.B.A., the successful competitor, was so appointed, but he died prior to the completion - of the plans and specifications for the foundations. He was succeeded by another private architect, the late Mr G. H . Godsell, F.R.I.B.A, who became responsible for the supervision of the contract. - Capital Commission was in the position of a - client for whom a building was being erected by a firm of contractors under the supervision of a private architect in charge of the work - to whom the contractors were directly responsible. The Federal Capital Commission was not - called upon to interfere with the carrying out - of the work and took no part in its execution. 4. £50,783: :>. Hutcherson Brothers, contractors, Sydney. tl. The removal of the old foundations is part - of the contract recently let for the building. Tliu estimated cost of removal of the old foundations as given to the Parliamentary Standing - Committee on Public Works was £4,194. 7. Tests have been made of the foundations - in position at various times over the years, but the concrete has not been tested since removal. The Public Works Committee, after its investigation last year, reported""Although a statement regarding early tests, made at a number of points, asserted that the foundations were sufficiently strong to carry the original building safely, the subsequent tests, carried out thoroughly in a great number of positions in the foundations, indicate that grave doubt exists as to the possibility of using them with safety "". 8. There was a shortage of cement according to .the specification. 031 tons. In respect of this shortage, a corresponding deduction was made from the contract amount. 10. No. The question of the removal of the foundations was investigated by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in 1947. The committee recommended plans providing for the discarding of the old foundations and the inclusion of a basement. According to the report dated the 17th September, 1947, paragraph 38, it appeared to the committee that the discarding of the old foundations and the inclusion of the basement would result in a considerable saving in cost, when the expenditure on alternative storage space was offset against tlic loss on the old foundations. The evidence indicated that such saving was estimated at £24,177. 11. No. Parliament House was erected by - day labour. COMMONWEALTH ENGINEERING COMPANY.",60

(c) The Commonwealth did not make any advance to Waddingtons Proprietary Limited. This company was placed in grave financial difficulties in 1942 when the guarantors of the company's overdraft of £100,000 notified their intention to seek relief from their guarantee. The company was unable to arrange any alternative means of finance The company was almost wholly engaged in the production of essential war equipment and, as continuity of production had to be assured, the Commonwealth relieved the guarantors of their obligations by guaranteeing an overdraft by the Commonwealth Bank. As security for the guarantee, the Commonwealth obtained a controlling interest in the company and assumed the responsibility of management. Of a total of 60 issued ordinary shares of £1 each, 25 shares comprising the guarantors' holdings in the company were transferred to the Commonwealth in consideration of their release from the guarantee. Mr. and Mrs Waddington agreed to transfer to the Commonwealth six additional ordinary £1 shares for the payment of £6, giving the Commonwealth 31 shares in all.

82,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The answers; to the honourable member's questions areas Arnold Skerst was-not selected as reserve f o i an Australian team in an international quit competition.
