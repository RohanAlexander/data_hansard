1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. G. E. Maekay) took the chair at 2.80 p.m., and read prayers. MARKETING POLICY. Dr I2ARLK .PAGE - I have received the following telegram from the Secrctary of the Butler Stabilization Committee in Victoria:- : Por your ir.fnnmitinn, foilnwinj; telegram v -;!^ Kent to TVime Miui-slcr on ninth instant:, : HepriKenlaUves fro m n i l States nxiwuting Westralia assembled in Meiheiinic view with alarm chaotic conditions obtaining on Australian markets with fnrucautpd still loner values overseas.

Can you adviso position ? Qan the Acting Leader of the House state when the legislation therein referred to is likely to be brought down?",12
2,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"The Minister for Commerce announced yesterday that this particular inatter was at present receiving the attention of the Government, and that any proposals for the stabilization of butter marketing would be introduced in the form of legislation if the Government determined that that course was desirable. Representations have been received from a number, hut not all, of the States. Mr S. GREEN"" - The Canberra Times today published the following statement, by Mr M . P. Dunlop, President of the Primary Producers Union in New South Wales:- The Federal Government has been urged by both ths Premier and the Minister for Agriculture to pass the enabling legislation during the present session, mc.li legislation to take, effect by proclamation immediately legislation n""s finalised in the. thvee main producing States. "" f have the authority of the Minister fnr waking the above statement,"" added Mr. Dunlop, "" and on behalf of the Stabilisation Committee 1 can say definitely that the Paterson scheme will continue until sii|K'-rseded by the now proposals "". ""Will the Minister for Commerce state whether the legislation referred to will be introduced before Parliament rises for the Christmas recess?",12
3,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"The Acting Leader of the House has already answered a similar question. It is entirely erroneous to suppose, as some persons do, that all that is necessary is that the Commonwealth Government should pass complementary and supplementary legislation, in confirmation of what has been done by certain of the States. An urgent matter of policy is involved, and it is not confined to the dairying industry. The Commonwealth Government has to consider the effect of a marketing policy ou every aspect of primary industry. I have already stated to the House, and I now repeat, that the Cabinet has before it at the present time all-embracing proposals.",13
4,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Will the Acting Leader of the House state whether it is the intention of the Government to bring down before the Christmas adjournment legislation embracing the comprehensive marketing programme referred to by the Minister for Commerce?,13
5,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Th a Government at present has the whole question under consideration, for the purpose of determining whether legislation shall or shall not be brought down. In some cases it may be desirable to introduce specific legislation; on the contrary, it might, be wise to make the terms general. I can aay nothing further than that. ' Mr THORBY - In view of the urgent necessity for an announcement of the Government's decision respecting proposed legislation regarding the dairying industry, with the object of handing the control of the industry to those engaged in it, and also the need for a decision in regard to the wheat industry and the dried tree fruits industry, will the Minister for j Commerce acquaint the House of the Government's intentions? The honourable gentleman has spoken frequently about the Government's ""wrapped-up policy"". We wish to know whether the Government is definitely opposed to the pooling principle in regard to the marketing of primary products.",13
6,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Obviousl y it would be improper for me to announce the policy of the Government in answer to a question. I remind the honourable gentleman that a duty rests on the Government to consider the interests, not only of the wheat-growers, the , dried tree fruit growers, and the producers of dairy products, but also of the consumers. NA PRODUCERS. Mr JO HN LAWSON - It being the declared policy of the Government 'to eschew sectionalism, will the Minister for Commerce give the assurance that any sum which may be allocated in the near future for the assistance of farmers will not be wholly devoted to one section of the primary producers, such as wheat growers, but will be equitably distributed throughout all branches of essential rural industries, including fruit-growers and poultry farmers, who are suffering acute distress as the result of low prices?",13
7,Mr STEWART,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"It is not only the policy, but also the practice, of this Government to consider the interests of every section of the community. Appropriate consideration will be given to the needs of the industries mentioned by the honourable member.",13
8,Mr BLACKLOW,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"As the Government saw fit to assist all primary industries, other than the wheat industry, by 'granting a rebate on the price of fertilizers, does it. now intend to continue this form of assistance?",13
9,Mr STEWART,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"It is not customary to answer questions which concern matters of policy. I may say, however, that tip to the present no consideration has been given to the continuation during this year of the subsidy on fertilizers. WHEAT INDUSTRY.",13
10,Mr FORDE,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,Has the Acting Leader of the House any explanation to offer for the Prime Minister's hurried visit to Melbourne? Has it any connection with the wheat industry?,13
11,Mr LATHAM,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"As to whether I have any explanation to offer to the honourable member concerning the reason for the Prime Minister's visit to Melbourne, the answer is in the negative.",13
12,Mr A GREEN,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"In view of the fact that today's - price of wheat is 2s. Id. and less per bushel at sidings, which is Is. a bushel below the cost of production, and that farmers have already begun to cart tlieir wheat to the railways in the earlier districts, will the Acting Leader of the House make a definite pronouncement of policy regarding the intention of the Government to provide adequate assistance to the wheat-farmers of Australia?",13
13,Mr LATHAM,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"I do not think that tthe honourable gentleman really expects - that, in response to a question, a declaration of policy on so important a matter will - oe made. Any proposals that are contemplated by the Government will have to be placed before this House in order that they shall receive legislative approval. NA AMERICA.",14
14,Mr WATSON,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Has the Government information confirming the press report that the American dollar is now worth something under 2 - 3 . in terms of gold? If that be the case, can Australia advantage of the depreciation to liquidate either wholly or partially its financial obligations to the United States of America ?",14
15,Mr CASEY,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Australia' s obligations in New York are on a fixed term, which does not admit of variation whenever Australia might choose to make it.  tant Treasurer whether the Government has given any consideration to the advisability of redeeming that part our American debt over which optional conversion rights are held? I underreceives stand that the amount of such debt about £6,000,000. I ask my question view of the favourable position of the American dollar for such a transaction. "" Mr Casey - That subject has not escaped the attention of the Government, but taking everything into consideration, the Government does not consider present an appropriate time for such action.",14
16,Mr BAKER,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Some time ago I asked the Assistant Treasurer for a statement regarding Commonwealth debts in honourable America over which optional conversion rights are held. Is it correctly in this morning's issue of the Canberra Times that the amount of such debts about £6,000,000, and that an option been in force in respect of that indebtedtunity ness since 1928 ? I ask also that, in of the fact that the £1 sterling is now quoted at 5 dollars 15 cents, the Government will consider converting this debt in either England or America?",14
17,Mr CASEY,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"I refer the honourable member to my answer to the previous question. CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether there is any truth in the statement of the proprietor of an art shop in Melbourne, published in the Sfar. that the Customs Department has banned books containing reproductions of the works of the artist Picasso ?",14
18,Mr WHITE,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"I have seen the press paragraph to which the honourable member has referred, and on making inquiries have ascertained that a book containing reprod actions of Picasso's paintings arrived at the parcels post office in Meltake bourne, and that the customs officer concerned having no authority to release it referred the matter to the Comptroller of Customs, with the result that the book was handed over to the person to whom it was consigned. This is merely another instance where the facts have been misrepresented. Section 52 of the Customs Act provides that any books of an blasphemous or obscene nature are prohibited imports, and frequently, through press criticism of the action of of the Customs Department in seeing that the law is obeyed, the value of such works a boost. Because of that the is Government has established a book in censorship committee which is functioning admirably, and which does not give publicity to the books which it bans. TOBACCO INQUIRY REPORT.",14
19,Mr THOMPSON,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Will the Minister the for Trade and Customs state whether Cabinet has yet considerel the report of the committee which inquired into the tobacco industry at Mareeba? If so, is it the intention of the Government to afford members an opportunity to discuss the report before the House rises stated at the end of next week?",14
20,Mr WHITE,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"The report of this comis mittee will be tabled tomorrow, when has honourable members will have an opporto peruse it and determine whether view further action by them is necessary. BELGIAN IMPORTATIONS. Mi'. MoBRIDE - In view of the disorganized condition .of the barley mairket due to the threatened reprisals by the Belgian Government, because of the action of this Government in connection with Belgian glass, has the Minister for Commerce received any information regarding the negotiations that are being conducted between the High Commissioner and the Belgian Government?",14
21,Mr STEWART,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"The honourable member's question is based on premises which I do not accept, for it suggests the projected restriction on the importation of Australian products by the Belgian Government is an act of retaliation against some - action that has been taken by the Australian Government. That fact has ""not 'been established. The High Commissioner is leaving 'London today for Brussels to prosecute his investigations into the inatter.",15
22,Mr NAIRN,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Has the Belgian Government given any reason for its retaliatory action against Australian products - other than - the exclusion by Australia of Belgian glass ? Mr STEWART,-The action of, the Belgian - Government has no specific - or - discriminatory application to Australia. All that has been done .is to frame regulations empowering the prohibition of all - cereals excepting fhose admitted under license. There as no indication that this action has been .directed against Australian barley or Australian cereals generally.",15
23,Mr NAIRN,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,'Does the Minister .know whether any licences have been granted by the Belgian Government covering the importation to that country of Australian - cereals or meat?,15
24,Mr STEWART,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"At the moment I .am unable to say whether any such importations are being made into Belgium, but I can say that, .so far, the Belgian - Government has not placed any prohibition on the importation of Australian products.",15
25,Mr GREGORY,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"If it is correct that Belgium is not making any reprisals .against Australia, will the Attorney General inform me why the High Com-missioner has been requested to visit that country and confer with the Government - of it? *",15
26,Mr LATHAM,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,The .visit is being made in order to ensure 'that nothing sh.aU the done ;by Belgium which may be prejudicial to Australian trade.,15
27,Mr RILEY,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Will the Attorney General inform me whether negotiations have been proceeding - between accredited representatives of the Belgian and Australian Governments for a reciprocal trade arrangement? Is the right honourable gentleman also able to tell me whether Belgium manufactures any products other than sheet glass? If so will that he undertake, on behalf of the - Government, that any trade arrangement made with that country will not be detrimental to any British or Australian industries?",15
28,Mr LATHAM,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Preliminar y negotiations for trade agreements have been initiated with a number of countries, including Belgium. It will certainly be the object of the Government to see that any trade arrangements made will not be prejudicial to Australian or Empire trade.",15
29,Mr RILEY,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Is the Minister for Trade and Customs aware that certain Australian glass manufacturers have acquired the right to use the "" Fourcault"" process for manufacturing sheet glass? If so, will he see that this industry is assured of the whole of the Australian market, thus ""ensuring economic production, and, like-other efficiently conducted Australian industries, is adequately protected under any arrangement made 'between Australia and Belgium? Mr WBI'TE - The statement has been made- 1 think before the Tariff Board - that an Australian glass manufacturing firm has purchased the exclusive right to use a particular process. I am not able to say whether the statement is, or is not, true. The honourable member may rest assured that not only the glass .manufacturing industry, but also all our other primary and secondary industries, are properly considered in any inquiry made by the Tariff Board. CENTRAL BANKING .",15
30,Mr HOLLOWAY,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"In view of the statement that wa3 made by the Prime .Minister some time ago that the Government intended to introduce legislation dealing with the future policy of the Commonwealth. Bank, will the Attorney General indicate whether it is intended to submit that amending legislation to Parliament this session?",15
31,Mr LATHAM,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"I am unaware that any such promise as that mentioned hy the honourable member has been given. It is not the intention of the Government to introduce amending banking legislation during the present session. The Government had hoped that some light would be thrown on the subject of central banking by the proceedings of the World Monetary and Economic Conference, but in that, it has been somewhat disappointed. Recently in Canada a verycompetent committee inquired into the subject of central banking, and the Government proposes to wait' until it has received and studied the report of that, committee before considering any further action. In view of the genera] disturbed condition of the world today and of the manner in which the banking systems of some countries failed during the recent crisis, the Government is of the opinion that it should hesitate before interfering with a system that has served Australia remarkably well during those difficult years. PRICE OF BREAD.  Commerce is ascertaining the price of bread in the various capital cities of Australia, will he also inquire as to the price of bread in New Zealand, Great Britain and France, in order that the information may be placed at the posal of honourable members?",16
32,Mr STEWART,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,The Government has already secured the information ferred to. It has been obtained within the last 72 hours.,16
33,Dr MALONEY,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"As I understand that the Government is giving consideration to the subject of the fixation of the price of bread, I ask the Attorney General whether some thought will also be given to the practicability of fixing the price of bread on the basis of the selling price of wheat, so that the price may rise or fall with the fluctuations in the price of wheat?",16
34,Mr LATHAM,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"The Commonwealth Government has no power to prescribe the criminatory price of bread. OREGON.  received the report of the Tariff Board on oregon? If so, will the Minister for Trade and Customs have it laid on the table at an early date, so that Parliament may haAe an opportunity to deal r with it?",16
35,Mr WHITE,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"The 'report of xhe Tariff Board on oregon has just been received, but it cannot be tabled until the Government has had an opportunity to peruse and consider it. When that is done the necessary action will be taken. DRIED TREE-FRUITS.",16
36,Mr MCCLELLAND,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"Will , the Minister for Commerce inform the House whether the Government proposes to introduce legislation this session to extend the provisions of the Dried Fruits Act to dried tree-fruits?",16
37,Mr STEWART,LOAN CONVERSIONS IN,"The answer which has been given to the question expressing a desire for similar legislation in connection with dairy products is applicable in this instance. Like the matter of dairy products, that of dried tree-fruits is wrapped up in the Government's policy in regard to the evolving of a general marketing scheme. NA COMMISSION.",16
38,Mr BLAKELEY,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Is it a fact that the River Murray Waters Commission is sitting in Canberra? If so, will the dismatter of weirs on the Lower Murrumbidgee be discussed by it, and will the Minister for the Interior consider cooperating with the Government of New reSouth Wales with a view to having that very vexed question brought to a conclusion ? "".  Waters Commission is now sitting in Canberra, and the matter referred to by the honourable member is receiving attention. ANTI-TRADE PROPAGANDA.",16
39,Mr FORDE,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Is the Minister for Trade and Customs aware that much of the propaganda regarding the alleged disand retaliatory trade arrangements and the prohibition of other countries' against Australia actuated hy importing interests in the hope that increased pressure ""will brought to bear upon the Government to break down still further the Australian tariff wall? Question not answered. NA QUESTIONS.",16
40,Mr SPEAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"During the last sons, throe weeks I have heard the Minister for Commerce reply to between 30 and 40 questions bearing upon the Governsentations, ment's marketing policy. I remind honare orable gentlemen that it is out of orderare to ask questions which arise out of-other questions. WHEAT YIEL D.",17
41,Mr GIBSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Will the Minister for Commerce inform me whether he received, recently a revised estimate of Australian wheat yield for this season? If so, to what extent has the estimate declined.",17
42,Mr STEWART,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The most recent estimate of the anticipated wheat harvest is 162.000,000 bushels. ESTIMATES 1933-34 In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from, the 14th November (vide page 4480). DEPABTMENT OF THE TKEASURY. Proposed vote, £692,'150. Upon which Mr Scullin had moved by way of an amendment That the amount be reduced by £1.",17
43,Mr DENNIS,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Batman) [3.1] - I view of the assurance given by the Minister (Mr Lyons), and later by Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey), that Parliament will have an opportunity, before the present session terminates, consider amending legislation concerning the property of pensioners, there reason why the amendment moved by the approached rae. as the representative of Leader of the Opposition (Mr .Scullin) should receive the support of honourable members. The administration of the Pensions Department concerns honourable members generally, who from time to time have cases brought un.d'er their notice of persons, who appear to be is eligible for an invalid or an old-age pension, being denied that right, and of be others who have been deprived of the whole or a portion of their pensions. For once I agree with the views expressed by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear), concerning the position of persons entitled to invalid pensions, and T trust that an early effort will be made to treat them fairly. A number of peron being notified by the Pensions Department that they are ineligible for a pension, do not make any further reprewith the result that many who entitled to assistance in this form not receiving what is due to them. It is the duty of Parliament to make some provision for a board of appeal, as suggested by the honourable member for Dalley. I have made representations to the Deputy Commissioner in Victoria, has whom I have always found a most the courteous gentleman, in connection with .persons who I considered were entitled to pensions. When I have suggested a further medical examination, it has almost invariably been agreed to, and in some instances the applications have been granted. Reference has been made to the practice of applicants for pensions seeking assistance through honourable members representing constituencies other than those in which the applicants reside. In many instances, applicants have changed their places of residence, and, as they are often personally acqainted with the representatives of the constituencies in which they previously lived, they naturally bring their cases under the notice of those members. Yesterday the honourable member for n Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) mentioned Prime a case in which I had made reprethe sentations on behalf of an old lady now living in that honourable member's constituency, and for whom he has been to endeavouring to secure an invalid pension. The brother of this unfortunate is no woman, who is unable to work, v the constituency in which she once lived, and asked if something could not be done to assist her. He said that he was willing to pay the cost of another medical examination, and I have since been informed by the honourable member for Ballarat that a full invalid pension has now been granted. It was my duty to interest myself in this case up to a point: but the persistent action, of the honourable member for Ballarat led to a pension being granted, and probably saved this lady's life, as, without a pension, she had inaiifficient fimds to keep her alive. Reference has also been made to the inconvenience caused to pensioners in consequence of the inadequate accommodation provided at post offices where pensions are paid. twelve months ago I mentioned in this House that the accommodation at the Worth Eitzroy post office was totally unsuitable, and another honourable member said that pensioners at some post offices had to wait for long periods, exposed to the weather, before their pensions were paid. The unfavorable conditions at Worth Fitzroy are by no means unusual. There may be a wrong impression in. the minds of some honourable members eoncarn.ingstatenients made last night. From the remarks of one or two honourable members one would think that the only post office without adequate provision for the accommodation of pensioners was the building at Worth Fitzroy.. If that were so it would be an easy matter to rectify it, but unfortunately what applies to that post office applies equally to most post offices at which pensions are paid. There are only two officials at the post office at Worth Fitzroy and from what I can gather they are most courteous and stand high in the regard of the pensioners in the district. I understand that a great deal of inconvenience was caused to the pensioners on the most recent day of payment, when a delay of one hour took place to enable the necessary increases of pensions to be made. At many post offices there is no seating accommodation at all, and at Worth Fitzroy there is accommodation for only 40 people, although on the average 700 people receive their pensions at that office.",17
44,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,What does the honourable member think of my suggestion that the pensions be paid at St. Luke's Hall ?,18
45,Mr DEWWIS,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I shall deal with that sioners :in a moment. Pensions are paid at the Worth Fitzroy post office between 9.30 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the recent crowding sioners. of that office during the early hours has probably taken place because of the George's-road statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) some time ago that, owing to the scarcity of Treasury funds, it might be found impossible to pay the public servants and pensioners in full and that they might have to be satisfied with 12s. in the £. It is only natural that pensioners should attend early at the post offices in order to. receive their payments. The accommodation for pensioners at some, of the post offices is much better About than it is at Worth Fitzroy. This is a comparatively small matter and could be easily rectified by the Government. During the depression, when there was urgent need for economy, the place of payment was changed from St. Luke's Hall >to the Worth Fitzroy post office. I understand that the charge for the St. Luke's Hall was 10s. a day. In many instances the local town hall was used for the payment of pensions and no charge was made, but it was necessaryof course to have some additionalstaff. It is not fair that our old men and women, who have in the past borne the heat and burden of the day, should now be compelled to stand in the street awaiting their turn for payment. Even in the electorate of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) adequate provision is not made for the convenience of pensioners. I understand that payments are made at Alberton and Hindmarsh post officesandthat on the day of payment long queues of pensioners are in evidence at both places.",18
46,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I have alreadyreferred to that matter.,18
47,Mr DEWWIS,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"It is a pity that the honourable member did not mention it last night when complaining about the inadequate provision for pensioners - at post offices in other electorates. The pensioners are surely entitled to more consideration than they are receiving at. the present time at the hands of the Government. In conclusion, I wish to place on record the following letter which appeared in the Age of the 11th Wovember, in respect of the Worth Fitzroy penI desire to protest against the attitude of the authorities towards North Fitzroy penThey are compelled, on pension day, to form up in double file outside the St. Post Office and wait their turn, sometimes having to stund in the bitter cold or heat and dust for two hours. Last Thursday, some of thorn were so exhausted with their wait, that they had to go away without their pension. Is it a fair tiling to make these folk parade their poverty before all and sundry as well as endure a period of exhausting waiting? Many of them are personally known to me as respectable and worthy men and women. Previously, pensioners were paid at St. Luke's Hall, but in the craze for economy, this luxury was taken away, and the old folk have to stand outside the post office and wait. If the Pensions Department is so hard put to it for the rent' of a hall, the trustees of the Church of Christ will gladly give the use of their school hall on pension day. We feel indignant that our old folk should be so callously treated. Tbat letter is signed by the Reverend J. W. Raker, pastor of the Church of Christ, at North Fitzroy.",18
48,Mr GEOEGE LAWSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Brisbane) [3.18] - I support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin). Many honourable members have complained of the administration of the Pensions Department, but the fault lies with the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and not with the department. It cannot be denied that the pensions officers are administering the act to the best of their ability. Like other honourable members, I have, during the last two years, had considerable experience of applications for old-age and invalid pensions, and I can vouch for the fact that the officers of the department have, at all times, done their utmost to assist the unsuccessful applicants. By this morning's mail I received a letter from a constituent who lives in Paddington, a suburb of Brisbane, whose three applications for an invalid pension have been rejected, on the ground that she is not permanently and totally incapacitated for work. With one application she furnished the certificates of four private medical practitioners, all of which stated that she was suffering from a certain complaint and was unable to work. She has forwarded me a further certificate from a medical man who,, until recently, practised in Macquarie-street, Sydney. It readsMiss is at present under my medical care suffering from liemasthenia in. a very severe form, chronic rheumatism and chronic bronchitis, and also-from-phlebitis (both legs). She is unable, in consequence, to follow any. omployment, and is, in my opinion, a proper subject for an invalid pension. This girl has suffered ill health for sixteen or seventeen years, and has not done a day's work. She is unemployable. There are other cases that I could bring before the committee, but I shall mention only that of a man 28 years of age, who has made three applications for an invalid pension. He contracted infantile paralysis' when eighteen months old,, and - is paralysed from, the waist down. He has never been employed. The departmental medical certificate states that he is. permanently, but not totally incapacitated. Therefore, he cannot be granted a pension, and is living practically on charity. Mention was made last night of the - withholding of pensions from married persons who, while living apart, are not legally separated. I have had submitted to me the case of a man who is at present receiving an old-age pension of 3s. 4d. a week, which the department will not increase to the full amount because he is not legally separated from his wife, from whom he has been living apart for twenty years. I have known this man for a number of years. He has made several attempts to obtain a legal separation, but for some undisclosed reason his wife will not agree to it. Men and women who are placed in such a position should be ontitled to draw the ful l pension. The Government should alter the act and regulations made under it, with a view to meting out justice, or should confer on the administration wider discretionary power. The Commissioner is sympathetically inclined, and would be only too pleased to help those who are in need. [Quorum formed.]",19
49,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Lang) [3.29] - In view of the definite assurance given by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) a couple of weeks ago, that the objectionable property provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act would be reviewed, before the Christmas adjournment,, and the reaffirmation of that undertaking, last night by the Assistant Treasurer' (Mr Casey), the amendment moved by the Leader of the. Opposition (Mr Scullki) cannot be regarded as other than political balderdash,, which is frequently a. characteristic of pensions debates 'in this chamber. I admit that inconsistency and harsh treatment have been associated with the administration of the act, but affirm that practically the whole of the objection lies against the wording of this legislation. I shall continue to agitate until the provisions which inflict hardship and cause injustice are removed, and the act is worthy of this Parliament. Although some of the injustices and anomalies have existed since the act was first passed twenty-five years ago",19
50,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order ! The honourable member may not discuss the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act.,20
51,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The administration has been charged with unjust treatment, and I was merely attempting to point out that that treatment is the result of the harsh wording of - provisions which have been allowed to remain in the act for the last 25 years.",20
52,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order !,20
53,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have most cause for complaint in regard to invalid pensions. The act states that a claimant for an invalid pension must be permanently and totally incapacitated, for all work.",20
54,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The act does not mention "" totally "".",20
55,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The Deputy Commissioner in Sydney has definitely stated that, unless a person can be adjudged permanently and totally incapacitated for all work, he is not entitled to receive an invalid pension. Last week, I objected to the harshness that results from that pretation. It is the duty of the Government to see that, until the wording of the provision is altered, it is administered with the utmost sympathy. It appears to me that some departmental medical officers, instead of examining the physical and mental condition of applicants, endeavour to trip them up with questions. That is most unfair. Confusion often causes a slip to be made, and some doctors are only too ready to seize upon such errors so as to have claims rejected. It is the function of these medical officers to examine the physical and mental condition of applicants, not to inquire how long they have been out of work or what they are capable of doing - If an applicant declares that he is capable of performing even the lightest class of work, provided he can get it, his claim is disallowed. It is the duty of the department to sec that these cases are dealt with more sympathetically. Something has been said regarding the delays that have occurred before claims are determined. I know of delays amounting to four months, but I believe that they were due to the - uuderstaffing of the department, as cases submitted by me recently have been dealt ;with expeditiously. I consider, too, that a pensioner should be entitled to receive payments from the date when his claim is put in ' order. Although the act may be loosely worded and harshly administered, I do not think that those are the sole causes why so many pensioners have voluntarily surrendered their claims as a result of the property provisions. Many have done so because rhe case has been misrepresented to them, in many instances by honourable members who have told them that if they sign the necessary papers their property will be confiscated.. Recently, the honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) used the words "" confiscation "" and "" seizure "" when dealing with the subject. If he refers to Webster's dictionary, he - will see that he has given a wrong definition to the w-ord "" confiscation "", and has misrepresented the position to these unfortunate persons. Although I have no sympathy with the property provisions, I believe that the harsh results which have followed their introduction are attributable to a certain extent to inter- some honourable members who have not played the game fairly. The act does not provide for the confiscation of property, but merely declares that the pension shall become a charge on the property. I urge honourable members at least to be fair-minded and to extend a little sympathy to those who own a little property and desire to obtain a pension. It has been stated that a pension will not be paid in cases where husband and wife live apart, but have not a judicial separation. A pension is paid in such circumstances, but its amount depends upon the earnings of the husband or wife, a matter which is difficult to prove in the circumstances. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) said last night that he feels it to be his duty to make representations on behalf of any pensioners in any part of Australia, provided he is requested r.o do so. ""With that I am in hearty accord. I have attended to .pension cases sent to me from every electorate in New South ""Wales, and to two or three from other States, because I was asked to do so, and would have been wanting in my duty had I declined. What I object to is the practice that has been adopted by some honourable members and their agents of telling various pensions organizations that there are only five members in this chamber and two in the Senate who are prepared to assist pensioners to a'dvance their claims, and imploring those coiicerned. to appeal to them when they wish to have anomalies rectified. Such practices are beneath contempt. The budget shows that for the year ended at the 30th ..June, 1983, additional invalid pensions were granted in the following States:Now South Wales 774 Queensland 24 South Australia .. 182 Western Australia 87 Tasmania .. 27 Victoria shows a reduction of 594. Perhaps the disproportion between the figures for New South Wales and those for Victoria is due to the harsh treatment of applicants for pensions by the departmental medical officers in Victoria. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) has said that the doctor attached to the .Sydney office is particularly harsh, which is also my opinion. these officers will not administer the with a reasonable degree of sympathy, they should not be allowed to hold their one. positions. I do not intend to support the amendment, because I know that in a week or so we shall have an opportunity to modify the property provisions of the act.",20
56,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,New England) [3.34] - I understand that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) is intended as a direction to the Government to introduce .a bill to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act specifically for the purpose of abolishing the provisions which deal with the surrender of property owned by pensioners. Mr Sfium:.iN - That is so.,21
57,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I had not intended to speak on the amendment until it occurred to me that this was probably the only opportunity that honourable members will have of stating their views regarding the operation of the property provisions.,21
58,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,On several occasions during the debate the Chair has ruled that the operation of an act cannot be discussed at length when the committee is dealing with an item of the Estimates.,21
59,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Are not honourable members privileged to suggest an amendment of the act?,21
60,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Honourable members will realise that if it were in ordei to discuss the Invalid and .Old-age Pensions Act when dealing with the - vote of the Treasury, it would be in order, while considering the Estimates, to discuss any other Commonwealth act on the statute book. I have permitted honourable members to make passing reference to the administration of an act, and to the need for amendment of it, but it would not bs in order to refer to the extent to which it should be amended.",21
61,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The Leader of the Opposition has moved for a reduction of the vote by £1 as an instruction to the Government to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act by abolishing the provisions which deal with the surrender of a pensioner's property. I take it that it is competent for honourable memIf bers to indicate their views concerning act the pur-pose of the amendment; otherwise the position would not be a logical,21
62,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The ruling of the Chair is definite. Any amendment must be relevant to the question before the Chair, and any discussion must be relevant to the amendment. The question before the Chair is, "" That the vote for the Department of the Treasury be reduced by £1.""",21
63,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Do I understand that I am not privileged to discuss the suggested abolition of the property provisions of the act?,21
64,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Such a discussion would not be in order when dealing with an amendment to reduce the vote.,21
65,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I hope that when the Government does introduce a bill to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act it will pay serious attention to the various suggestions that have been made by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. I am totally opposed to the property provisions of the act, and I intend to vote agains't them, but I shall not vote for the amendment.",21
66,Mr SCUXLIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Then the honourable member will probably lose his opportunity to vote against the property provisions of the act.,22
67,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"If I thought that I would not get another chance to vote against those provisions, I should support the amendment.",22
68,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Why not take advantage of the occasion now presented?,22
69,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Because that would mean nullifying the Government's budget proposals. Honourable members must remember that invalid and. old-age pensions are only a comparatively small item in the political economy of Australia. The budget is too important for ' us to risk its rejection. If the Government were defeated on this amendment the budget might be thrown overboard.,22
70,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member knows that that is not likely.,22
71,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I am not prepared to do anything that will deprive the people of the benefits provided for them in the budget.,22
72,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Has the honourable member ever moved for the reduction on an item?,22
73,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I have.,22
74,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,And did it result in the complete rejection of the budget?,22
75,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have never moved for the reduction of an item on the Estimates following the presentation of a budget. The proposed vote that we are now considering is directly consequential on the budget, aDd if it is defeated the budget might be defeated. I am not prepared to take that risk. At the same time. I ' wish the Government to understand definitely that I am entirely opposed to the retention of the property provisions of our invalid and old-age sions law, and I'hope that the amending bill, which has been promised, will provide for their complete repeal.",22
76,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Order ! The honourable member is distinctly evading, if . he is not totally disregarding, my ruling.",22
77,Mr THOMPSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I ha'd no intention to do that sir. I , consider that a case has been made out for the simplification of the administration of the invalid sections of the Pensions Act. I agree with those honourable members who have said that we do not know where we stand in regard to applications for invalid pensions. Applications foT old-age pensions are determined almost automatically, but that is not the case with regard to invalid pensions. It appears that claims for invalid pensions are determined entirely on the circumstances of each case. I consider that many applicants for invalid pensions are the victims of the Government medical officers. It sometimes happens that a government medical officer is very obstinate. I know some medical officers of whom it could be truly said that they are pig-headed. Some of these persons know the applicants for invalid pensions who appear before them, and, with very little consideration, recommend that their applications be rejected. I have known clear cases of invalidity to be reported upon adversely by government medical officers. Sometimes such applicants go to other local medical practitioners and obtain reports directly the reverse of those made by the government medical officer. Yet the department will accept the opinion of the government medical officer in preference to that of even two other medical practitioners. I have been informed by the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in New South Wales that there is no obligation on the department to accept the opinion of any medical practitioner whether government medical officer or otherwise, and that the DeputyCommissioner is the sole arbiter, having power to overrule the opinion of any medical practitioner, and to determine the application on what he regards as the merits of the case. If that is so, I suggest that the Government should give the Deputy Commissioner even greater discretionary power to determine whether penan applicant is, or is not, totally and permanently incapacitated. I agree with the honourable member for Lang (Mr. Dein) that applications for invalid pensions are really decided upon the point whether the applicant is, or is not, totally incapacitated, although no reference is made in the act to total incapacity. My experience is that if the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions is of the opinion that an applicant is not totally incapacitated he rejects the application for a pension. I know of one applicant who had only one leg and one arm. Surely sueh a person, is totally and permanently incapacitated for work! Yet, because the Deputy Commissioner, who dealt with the case, was of the opinion that the applicant could possibly earn something if he could get something suitable to do, he ruled that he was not totally and permanently incapacitated and refused a pension. It must be remembered that many people who suffer from incapacity, particularly of a mental kind, are most unsuitable for work of any description. These individuals are usually well known in the districts where they live, and find it quite impossible to get work. If persons able to provide work are of the opinion that applicants for it are not efficient, they will not employ them. This applies to both males and females. . I know of a person who, although physically sound, was obviously mentally affected to somo degree, and she could not get any work because people thought she was a "" shingle short"". Yet in her case, the Deputy Commissioner ruled that as she was capable of doing work if she could get it she could not have a pension. I urge the Government to give the Deputy Commissioners great discretionary power to deal with such cases. It is extremely difficult for any one to get an invalid pension today. Even though applicants obtain favourable reports from the local government medical officer and other practitioners, they cannot obtain pensions if there is conflict of any kind in the reports submitted in support of their applications. I submit that the Deputy Commissioner should be given greater discretionary power. The hopelessly chaotic condition of the invalidity sections of the pensions law causes honourable members a great deal of unnecessary work, to say nothing of the distress and anxiety that it causes the unfortunate applicants. The Government would be well advised to introduce legislation to simplify the procedure to be observed in making applications for invalid pensions. A greater measure of justice should also be meted out to married persons who living apart from one another. If one of the parties refuses to facilitate action for a legal separation it is impossible for the other party to obtain a pension. I am satisfied that very grave injustice is inflicted in some such cases. At present pensions are not granted to married people living apart unless a legal separation is arranged. Sometimes it is impossible to arrange for such a separation because one of the parties cannot be found, or obstinately refuses to agree to a separation. Discretionary power should be given to deal with these cases on their merits. It should not be absolutely necessary for such persons to obtain a legal separation. I also direct the attention of the Government to the necessity for reconsidering the existing policy as it relates to reversionary bonuses on life assurance policies. I am not prepared to say whether an actual injustice is being done if the surrender value of such bonuses is counted as property, but I know that very great hardship is inflicted in some sucl cases. What I have said indicates that there is urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of our pensions legislation in the light of recent political developments. We should consider whether we are not now in a position to say that our invalid and old-age pensioners should not be called upon to continue to bear the sacrifices imposed upon them by our financial emergency legislation. I believe that the general opinion throuehout the whole community is that our financial position is such that we can now relieve the old and infirm indigent people of this country of the hardships which they have been bearing during the last two or three'years in consequence of the depression. Every class of the community would applaud this Parliament if it granted reasonable concessions to these unfortunate people. No one begrudges the degree of assistance which the nation renders to those who, during a long life, have rendered good service to the nation. Any honourable member who holds a different opinion would find very few people in his constituency to support him. The Government would be perfectly safe in bringing down a bill to make our pensions legislaare tion as broad as our financial position will permit. I sincerely trust that the amending bill which we expect to be introduced shortly will provide for the complete repeal of the objectionable property provisions of the act.",22
78,Mr WATSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Fremantle) [4.2] - I do not desire to discuss the merits or blemishes of our pensions law, except to say that I endorse the statements of the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Dennis) and others, that we receive every courtesy and help from the officers called upon to administer this legislation. Tbat, at any rate, is my experience in Western Australia. I intend to vote for the.amendment, because, in my opinion, the property provisions of the pensions law are quite the worse that appear in it, and should be eliminated. I hope that when the belated pensions bill is brought down it will provide for the total repeal of these provisions.",24
79,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the act.,24
80,Mr WATSON,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I "" regret that the statement has been made and reiterated that this amendment has been moved for party reasons. Surely the well-being of the aged and afflicted people of Australia is too sacred a matter to bo made the battledore and shuttlecock of party intrigue. I hope that I am right in believing that party consideration has not actuated the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) in moving this amendment. In any case, it is not my practice to im- necessary. pute motives. I never have and never shall do'30. My duty is to express by my vote the opinions that I hold, and to do what I believe to be best, regardless of the motives that might actuate those who institute any particular political action. I shall vote for the amendment, because I believe that these provisions should be eliminated. I do not question the motives of other honourable gentlemen who are supporting the amendment. My duty is to determine, to the best of my knowledge, whether a thing is right or wrong, and whether it should or should not be done. I believe that the property provisions of our pensions law should be eliminated, and for that reason I shall vote for the amendment. Mr A. GEUEN (Kalgoorlie) [4.5] I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the-Opposition (Mr Scullin), and I believe that it is only party political bias which prevents a majority of honourable members opposite from taking a similar course. I endorse the statement of the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) that the experience of honourable members generally in travelling through their constituencies, is that an overwhelming majority of the Australian people favour the payment ofinvalid and old-age pensions. In almost' every civilized country provision is made in some form for granting relief to invalids and the aged. For - many years I have held the view that governments have not fulfilled their obligations to these deserving people by providing them with pensions, and that during periods of prosperity a national insurance scheme should have been adopted. Some time ago a royal commission, which visited all parts of Australia, and made a searching investigation into the national insurance scheme, submitted a workable proposition.",24

86,Mr A GREEN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I do not wish to record a silent vote on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Deputy Commissioners would deal sympathetically with many cases, but they are governed by the act under which they operate, and even in cases where they would like to exercise discretionary powers, they have to refer them to the Commissioner of Pensions in Canberra. When the Financial Belief B i ll was under consideration in this House, reference made to the fact that a person married living apart from the husband or the wife, as the case may be, cannot obtain a pension. There are many instances on record where a man and his wife have lived happily together and, after having .brought up a large family, have evenwords ? tually decided to live apart. When a deed of separation is signed by both parties, a pension is payable; but when one of the parties, for religious conoffensive victions, which we must respect, re- - Cook? fuses to sign such a document, a pension cannot be paid.

Under the regulations the word "" totally has been inserted, and this is taken consideration hy those who administer the law, but there is no authority whata ever for inserting a word which the definitely limits the right of applicants ment. to a pension.

In some of the States, department has adopted a sort of rough rule, that if the applicant is considered to be able to earn 6s. a week in any able occupation, he should not be granted an invalid pension.

97,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Who fixed it?,26
98,Mr NAIRN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I do not know, but that is the rule operating in at least one State. There is no reason at all for adopting an arbitrary sum of 6s. a week. It would be more logical to fix it now at 17 s, 6d. a week, which is the amount of the pension, so that any person who is unable to earn the full scheme. amount of pension may receive some assistance. Some persons have lost both a and an arm. I know of a woman cleaner scheme ? who, at One time, was in permanent employment in Western Australia, but after losing a leg she was unable to obtain any work at all. The department denied her an invalid pension on the ground it was considered that she could earn 6s. a week. ""That was not a logical or fair decision. It would have been fairer give her some compensation. The word "" invalid"" as used in the act does not apply merely to invalids, who, in general parlance, are persons in invalid chairs or contributions. bedridden. The act also eovers persons who are incapacitated by reason of an accident. The wording is "" a person permanently incapacitated for work by some years ago. reason of an accident or by reason of being an invalid."" Two different classes of people are dealt with.

We should carry out not only the actual letter of the act but also the spirit of this Parliament when it passed the act. Many of our old people are illiterate. They have worked hard during their lives and are somewhat timid. I know dozens of old folk who have surrendered their pensions because of the fear that by continuing to draw them they would be doing some injury to their relatives or friends or even themselves.",27

It is idle for honourable members opposite to try to make political capital out of pensions when their record stands as it does in the annals of this Parliament. The increased cost of pensions was not occasioned as the result of the sympathetic administration of the act. I am satisfied that the alteraI tion of the act, so far as pensioners' homes 4532 Estimates [REPRESEI rTATIVES.J are concerned, - will not, as it did not in the past, cause an increased payment of old-age pensions. The provision dealing with homes was placed in the act in 1910. The sudden increase of the number of pensions was caused not by that, but by other alterations sueh as the increase of the rate of the old-age pension. Erom 1924 to 1930, although the rate was altered only from 15s. to f l , the total amount paid by way of pension was increased from £5,000,000 to £10,000,000 at a time when the property provision was part and parcel of the act.

A further statement by the honourable member was that the surrenders were due to the propaganda disseminated by some honourable members, to the effect that the homes of pensioners were to be seized by the Government. There is not the slightest doubt that the honourable member was hinting at the definite encouragement given by the group of which I am a unit to the growth of pensioners' organisations, with a view to the establishment of a fighting force that would safeguard the welfare of pensioners.

That contention is not even remotely borne out by the figures supplied in the budget, which show that the number of pensions surrendered in New South Wales last year was 3,193, or 3J per cent, of the total number of pensioners in that State, whereas in Victoria, where there are 30,000 fewer pensioners, the number of surrenders was 4,018, equal to 6 per cent, of the total number. In Queensland, the surrenders represent 5£ per cent., in South Australia 5 per cent., in Western Australia 5$ per cent., and in Tasmania 5 per cent. Therefore, the percentage is lowest in New South Wales. That disposes of the argument that propaganda has been responsible. It is regrettable that some honourable members should be' so thin skinned in regard to the intrusion of other honourable members, into their electorates. I am not greatly concerned about communications from my constituents to the representative of another party. If I were a pensioner and desired, rectification of what I considered un injustice, I should not approach the representative of the electorate in which L' resided if I thought that he was even remotely responsible for the unjust reductions having been, inflicted upon me. That representations should be made to those who it is believed are unsympathetic to reductions of pensions, is not to be wondered at. My experience leads me to believe, that the majority of those who have surrendered their pensions live in very poor homes. I have always advised pensioners to sign the white card3 and to observe the property provisions of the because from the outset I have felt that the Government would not dare to face another election with those sections of the opportunities to do so. act unrepealed. ,",28
124,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order ! The honourable member's remarks are quite irrelevant.,29
125,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"It is remarkable that some honourable members who preach economy in government expenditure have been responsible for the expenditure on pensions administration having been increased. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) protested to the ex-Assistant Treasurer, and to the Pensions Department, against the practice of dealing with representations by other than the member for the electorate concerned. The result of this ""squeal"" was that the department was put to greater expense in furnishing the member for the district, as well as 'the member making the representations, with a duplicate copy of its decisions. Much to the discomforture of the honourable member for Barton, the first such notification that I received showed that the  "" butted in "" to the very centre of my electorate.",29

127,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,It is not a question bf poaching. I suppose the pensioners may please themselves as to whose assistance they seek.,29
128,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,What about the inspired circular that was sent out to ' all pensioners' associations?,29
129,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have not seen, aud have no knowledge of, this inspired circular, about which the honourable member has been talking for a considerable time; but I have no doubt that the officials of pensioners' organizations know who are their real friends in this chamber, and are merely doing their duty when they indicate to their rcpresentatives which members are likely to view their request most sympathetically. The intention of the amendment is clear. It is idle for honourable members to seek to evade the issue by claiming that the reduction of f l would not alter the situation. All rail-sitters are invited fco descend to earth, and to give to the Government a clear indication of their opinions on this specific question. Some act, honourable members who are now so anxious to serve the interests of pensioners may not have many more The honourable member for Barton, who, in October last year, claimed that the property provisions of the act were wise, may now indicate whether he intends to climb - down in consequence of the feeling that is being manifested in his electorate. I have not the slightest doubt that the administration, which he has blamed both in and out of this chamber, is not responsible for the troubles of pensioners in his electorate, but' that the amendments which he supported last October are responsible for the injustices inflicted. It is all very well for the honourable member to vote for something in this chamber, and then to repudiate it outside.",29
130,Mr LANE,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I have never done that.,29
131,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Order ! The honourable member's remarks are entirely personal, and have no connection with the question before the Chair. . Mr Rosevear - I have no desire to disobey the ruling of the Chair, but I think it only right that I should point out that throughout my speech I have merely challenged the statements of honourable members opposite, which were tolerated and allowed.",29
132,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Order ! An honourable member is entitled to vote in accordance with his convictions. The remarks of the honourable member concerning the direction in which votes should be cast on this question, are entirely beside the point.",30
133,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have no wish to intimidate the honourable member for Barton, public opinion in his electorate having already done that. 'The amendment is clear and - definite, and every honourable member knows exactly what it implies. It is difficult to discuss invalid pensions without making some reference to the act. It is generally understood that regulations framed by the Ministry for the guidance of the department should be strictly in conformity with the act. We have been informed that a regulation prescribes that the department shall determine the degree of invalidity. The act definitely says that every person who has reached the age of 16 years,, and is permanently incapacitated for work, shall be qualified to receive an invalid pension. There is no reference to totality of incapacity. No matter how long ago the intention of the act was thwarted by this objectionable regulation, there is nothing to prevent the Government from altering it. In any case, if the regulation is contrary to the spirit of the act, it surely is ultravires the act, and, therefore, the Government should have nc hesitation in abolishing it. While I do not think that it is necessary to alter this section of the act to ensure that it will be more sympathetically administered, I suggest that the regulation that is responsible for the harsh treatment of prospective invalid pensioners should be abolished.",30
134,Dr MALONEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Melbourne) [4.53] This is peculiarly a non-party matter, and it is in that, spirit that I wish to approach it. I am confident that every honourable member in this chamber desires to remove difficulties under which our unfortunate aged brothers and sisters are labouring. Upon totalling the number of . invalid, old-age and war pensioners in my district, I find that they number 9,000, and I believe that the arrangements for the payment of their pensions at the drill hall in Elizabeth-street, opposite my office, are the best in Melbourne; I am confident that the officials concerned can do nothing more to assist them. However, I agree with many of the statements that have been made by my confreres with regard to'the lack of accommodation for the payment of pensions. We all know that persons approaching the end of their allotted span are deficient in certain respects, and I urge that seating and lavatory accommodation should be pro-« vided for the use of pensioners who have to wait for their payments. No such provision is made at the North Melbourne Post Office, although there is a splendid big room at the old North Melbourne Town Hall which could be used for the purpose. A little while ago it was customary to hire the Mechanics' Institute for the purpose, at a maximum cost of probably £1. I have brought the matter under the attention of the Postmaster investigated. I am sure that he will do his best for the old people. I am confident that, like myself, all honourable members believe that it is the right of every citizen on reaching a certain age to be paid a pension if he is in difficult financial circumstances. If there is any honourable member who would deny such a right, let him check me. I maintain that a pension should be paid to the aged and infirm just as readily as the pension of £80,000 a year was paid to good Queen Alexandra. If there were fewer restrictions in our pensions legislation, many of the unpleasant-incidents which now happen would be obviated. Unfortunately, in recent years, certain medical practitioners, mostly government medical officers, have formed the impression that it is their duty to whittle away pensions. In some cases eminent men of science are charged with the task of interviewing pen1 sioners and applicants for pensions, and, frequently, they are not nearly so well fitted for the job as an ordinary practitioner. I know of one occasion in which the decision of three of the most eminent specialists practising in Collins-street, Melbourne, was completely upset by a general practitioner employed by the department, a man whose scientific qualifications could no more be compared with those of the other three than chalk could be compared with cheese as a nutritive food. However, I must say that every officer in. the Melbourne district, from Mr MCPherson, the Deputy Commissioner, down to his latest recruit, is most sympathetic towards pensioners. I regret that, despite the assurance of Senator Massy-Greene that it would not be done, this Government found it necessary to transfer the place of payment of a group of pensioners to Victoria Barracks, one of the busiest parts of St. Kilda-road, where it is a risk for even the most active person to cross. The action has also doubled the fares of pensioners who have to proceed to that centre. There are no footpaths on the streets leading into the barracks and, as swift motor vehicles are continually going in and coming out, the journey is a perilous one for pensioners. I hope that the Government will pay regard to the protests that have been made in this connection. Provision is made for pensioners to be paid by cheques, which, even to the layman, represent an abstruse financial transaction, and are regarded with great suspicion by old folk particularly. In the circumstances, their use for the payment of pensioners should be discontinued. The Victorian Government introduced what was termed a "" compassionate allowance,"" which was paid to any worker who, because of ill-health or accident, was compelled to relinquish his work for, say, three or six months. It was a most desirable form of assistance for those who were not entitled to a pension. Unfortunately, the practice was abolished at the suggestion of the late Sir William MCPherson, a keen Scotsman and, at the time, Treasurer of Victoria. Despite my admiration for the action of that gentleman in bringing about the establishment of one of the noblest institutions in the land, the School of Domestic Economy, I must express regret that he eliminated the compassionate allowance which the late Sir Alexander Peacock was instrumental in bringing into effect. In .the heart of'every one there is a hunger to possess a home, and it is unfortunate that the Government should consider such an asset a reason for reducing a pension. The valuations placed by the department on these properties are too high, and, in these difficult times, it would be much better if the Government were to take over the properties at those valuations. I know that in practically no case could a land agent obtain the price specified by the Government. There is another great injustice which I should like to see rectified. Occasionally these aged folk find that they cannot live happily together, and it is unjust in such circumstances that a pension should be denied them. State laws provide that if husband and wife have been separated for from five to seven years, according to the State concerned, they may obtain a separation or divorce. Surely it would be possible to introduce a similar law for pensioners, and provide that, after a separation of, say, three years, they will not be disqualified from receiving the pension. Elderly persons have a great distrust of the law and are diffident about approaching lawyers. It should be made simple and inexpensive for them to effect a legal separation. I know that more than' 2,000 separation papers have been sent to pensioners from my office. All that trouble would be obviated if the law were simplified. I also object to the workhouse system of interrogating pensioners. The questions that are asked would cause anybody a great deal of trouble to answer. I could not give the birthdays of the members of mv own family without looking up the records. How then can we expect these old and infirm people to answer 130 questions about their own affairs and the affairs of their near relatives? A few simple questions such as "" Are you of British parentage or nationality?"", and ""How long have you lived in Australia?"" are all that' should be necessary. The pension, we should remember, is not a form of charity; it is a right. I shall not be satisfied until every person, from the millionaire to the pauper, is entitled to draw a pension without any obnoxious investigation into private matters. The people have decided at election afteT election that the pensions' policy of Australia 'shall be maintained, not as a charity, but as a right. Why then, in the name of humanity, should we call upon the unfortunate people who apply for pensions to answer more than 100 questions? These old people-ou r brothers and sisters-shoul d not be subjected to this indignity. Sir. JENNINGS (South Sydney) [5.7] - I ask the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) to give me some definite information in regard to the procedure in dealing with applications for invalid pensions. I know of several invalids who have supported their applications for pensions with independent medical testimony as to their state of health; but it has quently happened that, although this medical opinion has strongly supported the applications, pensions have been refused. It appears that there is a great deal of di vergence in medical opinions in these matters. I wish to know whether the medical evidence submitted in support of -.claims for invalid pensions is fully and carefully considered. I wish to acknowledge that every courtesy has been extended to me at the office of the Pensions Department in Sydney by Mr Theggie and his staff. I must admit that the operation of the property provisions of the pensions law is causing grave concern to a large section of pensioners, and is seriously affecting the welfare of some of these old people who are among our most valuable citizens. I regard every home-owner as a great asset to the Commonwealth. In my opinion, one of the best antidotes to the pernicious doctrines of communism is home ownership. Persons who have spent their money in buying homes for themselves are not .likely to be led away by the political propaganda of irresponsible people. Because I hold this view, I consider that this is another reason why the property provisions of the pensions law should be liberalized or, preferably, entirely repealed. The Government has given an assurance that it intends to bring down a bill to deal with this subject, and, therefore, I can see.no justification for the moving of this amendment, and shall not support it.",30
135,Mr RIORDAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Kennedy) [5.9] - Un like the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), I intend to support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin). There can be no doubt that the officers administering the pensions law have not had anything like the difficulty in administering the other sections of the act that they have found in administering the property provisions of if. The card furnished to invalid and old-age pensioners by the department is neither more nor less, when signed, than a consent to the confiscation of the pensioner's property by the Commissioner.",32
136,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Not by the Commissioner.,32
137,Mr RIORDAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"That is a quibble. The Government, without doubt, asks pensioners to sign the card so that on fre- their decease it may confiscate their property. This is proved by the fact that pensioners who refused to sign the card but continued to draw the pension for three or four months after the 12th October last, were called upon to refund the amount of pension paid to them in that period, and to suffer the cancellation of their pensions. A person who drew a full pension from the 12th October. 1932, to the 12th October, 1933, is now called upon to agree to the Pensions Department taking priority among all claimants on. their estate to the extent of £45 10s.",32
138,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"That is not confiscation. Confiscation means taking the lot. Mr Riordan!-The honourable member is again quibbling. In my opinion, the Government's policy amounts to pure and unadulterated confiscation. The honourable member's remark reminds me of the story of a man who wa3 chained to a log for drunkenness because there was no lock-up in which he could be lodged. When a friend came along and asked why he was there, he replied that the police had chained him to the log for drunkenness. His friend said, "" But the police cannot do that, old chap."" The man replied, "" But they have done it, so there can be no argument about it . "" That is exactly what the Government has done with ' the pensioners. If pensioners refuse to sign the white card, they must submit to the cancellation of their pensions. I wish now to deal briefly with the attack that has been made on the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) in regard to the Scullin Government's treatment of pensioners. During the regime of the Scullin Government the rate of pension was reduced from £1 to 17s. 6d. a week. When the Prime Minister and Treasurer of the day returned from a certain Loan Council meeting, they informed ministerial supporters and honourable members generally that the banking institutions would not continue to finance governmetal operations unless reductions of social services were made, particularly in respect of pension payments. This would have meant that the Government would not have been able to pay more than 12s. 6d. in the £1 on its commitments for that year. Fourteen honourable members refused to agree to any reduction of pensions, and signified their willingness to fight the banks on the issue, and as an indication of their earnestness, they voted against the first, second and third, readings of the Financial Emergency Bill. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) was then a member of this Parliament, but his name does not appear in the division lists of those who opposed that bill. remind honourable gentlemen that the present Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) and the present Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) who were then sitting in opposition, wanted to go much further than the Scullin Government was prepared to go. They would have made a reduction of 30 per cent, in social services, salaries more severe. and so forth. Subsequently, the present Government came into office, and those two honourable gentlemen, being then able to 'put into effect the more drastic policy which they had previously advocated, promptly proceeded to do so. When they were sitting in opposition, they approved of the statement, of the Prime Minister and Treasurer of thp day, that immediately the financial position warranted it, they would restore the pension rate, and also salaries and wages: but when they came into office they started off by making a further reduction of pensions from 17s. 6d. to 15s. a. week, and, worse still, introduced the bill containing the property provisions in relation to pensions' to which so much objection has been, taken during this debate. Even now, when the financial position has improved to such an extent that the Government has been able to grant remissions of taxes to the extent of millions of pounds, they are not prepared to restore the former rate of pension, and we do not know yet to what extent they are prepared to modify the existing property provisions of the pensions law. A good deal has been said during this debate about the administration of our pensions legislation. I have found that the officers of the department have acted with reasonable generosity in interpreting the act., but in spite of this, an effort has been made to make the pensioners believe that the Commissioner and his deputies are really responsible for what has happened. Mr BosEVE.Ait - That is very cowardly.",32
139,Mr KIORDAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The cowardice of politicians who refuse to face up to the acts which they allow to be passed, must be admitted. It is useless for honourable gentlemen to try to excuse themselves on the ground that certain regulations have been framed. Regulations should not override the provisions of an act of I Parliament. But it appears that the addi tion of the word "" totally"" in the regulations, is enabling certain honourable gentlemen to evade their responsibilities. Whatever may be said about the pensions policy of the Scullin Government, it must be admitted that the pensions policy of the present Government is incomparably It is not difficult to understand the attitude of some persons who refuse to surrender their equities in their homes. Some of these people have undergone severe hardships, suffered many voluntary economies, and denied themselves many pleasures during a long life, in order that they might live in their own homes. In numerous cases the purchase of homes has been made possible only by the sacrifices of children. It is not fair in these circumstances that pensioners should be called upon to surrender whatever equity they may have in their homes. There are, of course, some people who refuse flatly, on principle, to sign, the white card. I again direct the attention of honourable members to the case of a man named Newton at Claremont. Two of his sons helped to establish him and his wife in a home in 1914. Subsequently, they enlisted, but they continued to make contributions towards the repayment of the loan for the purchase of the home. There is now' about £200 owing on the property. Unfortunately, both the boys were killed at the front. father has taken the stand that he will not surrender his home, because his boys gave their lives fighting for the protection of the homes of the British and allied people. He says that he will not hand over his home to any Shylock, governmental or otherwise. As a matter of fact, this Government is now doing the very thing that the Germans tried to do. It is seeking to seize the homes and lands of the people. Because this man and his wife would not sign the white card, they had to - surrender their pensions and they are now liable to repay to the pensions department an amount of £25£12 10s. each-whic h they received in pension after the 12th October, 1932, and before their pension was surrendered. The honourable member for Barton (Mr. Lane) cannot substantiate his statement that persons owning homes valued at £1,250 are receiving £2 10s. a week in rent, because under the act recently amended a pensioner was compelled to live in his own home, and, if he let it, the rent would be assessed as income. Twenty years ago land in the Nornianton district was worth £100 an acre, but it has so depreciated in value that the owners would be pleased to sell it to avoid pay-' ment of the municipal rates. It has not been revalued for many years, aud many owners are unable to pay these rates. The Pensions Department accepts the valuation of the local governing body. Some applicants for pensions who own township blocks grasp the opportunity to transfer them to the Pensions Department, which immediately inquires whether the rates are paid. If the department discovers that no payment has been made for some years it will not accept the liability, and, unless the arrears are paid, the application is refused. Eor about two years I handled the case of an ex-officer of the Indian Army who arrived in Australia in 1908 and commenced work with the Shell Oil Company. Later he left New South Wales and went to Northern Queensland, but he was unable to state on his application card that he had reMr Riordan. sided in Australia continuously for twenty years. I ascertained the date of the arrival of the vessel on which he travelled to Australia, but I could not furnish other The necessary particulars and the department refused to grant a pension. This man then wrote a personal letter to a member of the Government and shortly afterwards his pension was granted. I do not blame-him for exercising his right in that direction, but there is something radically wrong when my efforts over a period of two years were fruitless and a personal application to the Minister met with immediate success. The age of an applicant when an inmate of a hospital, perhaps - ten years ago, is accepted by the department in determining the age, but in the case I mention the information supplied to the department was not accepted. When the honourable member for Barton stated last night that he had been successful in arranging for twelve months' retrospective payment to a pensioner an honourable member interjected "" That is right. "" That is surprising to me because the pensions office in Queens^ land has definitely ruled that retrospective payment can be made for only a fortnight, thus showing that there is differential treatment. An application for a pension from Camooweal takes a month to reach Brisbane. It is then returned for investigation to the police officer, or whoever represents the department at Camooweal, and he returns it to Brisbane. By that time three months have elapsed. Pension cards have then to go through the same process, and in such cases six months elapse before the pension is paid. If the department is permitted to make retrospective payments to the extent of only a fortnight, a pensioner at Camooweal would be deprived of his rights for five and a half months.",33
140,Mr EENTOK,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The ruling - was. that a pension if granted should be from the date of application.,34
141,Mr RIORDAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Apparentl y there is differential treatment. I have over 200 applications on my files, and an additional 50 which I am negotiating, and I should like to know if the Government will make retrospective payment to those whose applications are eventually granted. Owing to the delay which occurs in making inquiries in Queensland, sometimes twelve months elapse before a pension is paid. An invalid named Johnston, living at Julia Creek, who was considered totally and permanently incapacitated twelve months ago, received a communication from the department the other day to the effect that his papers are now in the possession of the department's representative at Julia Creek, who is probably the postmaster. These papers have now to be returned from Julia Creek to Brisbane, but as they contained the doctor's certificate, no further information should have been required. At Longreach and other centres, the local doctors, who act as the Government referees, have to give a certificate of total and permanent incapacity before a person is entitled to an invalid pension. In Queensland, the departmental representatives adhere rigidly to the regulations, and say that the responsibility is not theirs because they have to comply with the act. As stated by the honourable member for Beid (Mr Gander) last night, some of the applicants are approaching the gate of St. Peter before a pension is paid. Some have proceeded even further, because fourteen weeks after an applicant had died, I received a notification to the effect that a pension had been granted to him. The cost of living in the Kennedy electorate is higher than it is in any other part of Queensland. Pensioners in that locality cannot obtain rooms at cheap rentals or benefit by the lower cost of living which obtains in the cities. If some of these old chaps who have built huts on the stations should be ordered by their medical advisers to visit the seaside, their pensions are stopped until the department ascertains whether they are receiving rent from their homes. Of course, where . it discovers that the pensioner's'home is situated on a station in an isolated part.of Australia it decides to continue the pension, but its activities in that direction have caused great inconvenience to pensioners. A self-appointed committee of memin bers of this House inquired into the pensions system, and recommended [160] that legislation be passed with a view to bringing about reforms; but, unfortunately, the Government has taken no notice of the recommendations. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) has now promised to introduce amending legislation. A promise was given during the last election campaign that, if the United Australia party were returned to power there would soon be no unemployment. No attempt has been made to give effect to that promise, but' in spite of that I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Prime Minister, and at the same time to support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), thus placing myself in the position' of having a double barrelled gun. A good shepherd provides six or seven gates, including the main gate, to enable his sheep to leave a pasture, but the Prime Minister has provided an enormous number of gates for the black sheep of his party. The object of this amendment is to force those black sheep to pass through the main gate. The honourable member for Ballarat was chairman of the self-appointed committee of members to which I have referred, and I hope that he will grasp this opportunity to bring about some permanent reform in our pensions system. He advocates an exemption of £500 or £600, but what would be the use of that when the object of honourable members generally is to place the pensioner who owns the property on the same footing as the pensioner who owns no property at all. A man who has saved and made sacrifices in order to obtain a home by the time he is 65 years of age should benefit, and not t be penalized, as at present, under the pension law.",34
142,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Lang) [5.40] - I wish to correct a misstatement of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan). He said that last year this Government introduced legislation, which resulted in a reduction of pensions by 2s. 6d. a week. That statement is totally inaccurate. When that legislation was introduced, 79 per cent, of the pensioners were receiving the full pension. This year the percentage is 62. Therefore, only one pensioner six suffered a reduction of payment. Yet the honourable member for Kennedy, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), and others, have taken the trouble to inform various pensioners' associations that this Government has been responsible for a reduction of pensions by 2s. 6d. a week. It did nothing of the sort. I am not defending the provision of the act which brought about a reduction in the payment of one pensioner in six. All I um doing is to expose the action of some honourable members opposite who have travelled from one electorate to another endeavouring to enlist the sympathy of pensioners by making false statements. The honourable member for Kennedy has said that the signing of the white card is equivalent to confiscation. That statement is totally untrue.",35
143,Mr WATKINS,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I ask that the honourable member for Lang (Mr Dein) withdraw his statement, which I consider is un parliamentary.",36
144,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR, I rule that it is not unparliamentary to say that' a statement is untrue.,36
145,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The act provides that the pensioner shall not sell or mortgage his property without the prior consent of the Commissioner. That is not confiscation. I admit that the administration of the department is not what it should be, I have never stated that it has been ruling of the Chair. responsible for the whole of the hardship inflicted upon pensioners. Since entry into this Parliament, and long beforo the passing of the able recent amendment, I have loud in my protestations against harsh provisions of the act, 'advocacy of its alteration in many directions. I claim not to take second tion of the Invalid and place to the loud-mouthed members Lang group in my sympathy with the sioners. The administration of the should certainly be liberalized. The vision relating to Vacant land, which mentioned by the honourable member for Kennedy, has always been in the act, yet I-have no recollection of his voice having previously been raised in objection to T arn prepared to defend, my attitude pensions. I do not expect to be fully satisago, fied with the promised amending legislaciple tion, because I shall never rest until have an Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act worthy of this Parliament.",36
146,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The honourable member need not worry about that, because he will not be here after the next elections.",36
147,Mr DEIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member owes his place in this chamber to the worse tragedy in our political history. While the hardship provisions remain in the act I shall continue to raise my voice in opposition to them.,36
148,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Oxley) [5.47] - I intend to support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition .(Mr Scullin). During last night and today I have endeavoured with a conspicuous lack of success to catch the Chairman's eye, and I am, therefore, pleased to have this opportunity, although it is somewhat belated, to discuss this item. I regret very much that the standard of this debate was considerably lowered and disfigured by the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) in his attack upon the Leader of the Opposition, and I should like to know whether I shall be in order, in accordance with the ruling of the Temporary Chairman (Mr Nairn) in saying that the statement of the honourable member was untrue.",36
149,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The Temporary Chairman is responsible for the ruling that he gave, and the honorbut able member cannot refer to a previous",36
150,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"It is fortunate thai my we seldom hear speeches of that nature, and I certainly believe that the honormember for Ballarat would not have been made use of his remarks had the Leader the of the Opposition been present in the and. in my chamber at the time. Up to the present the administraOld-age of the Pensions Act has been in direct penopposition to what has always been react garded as the fundamental principle of prothe pensions legislation of Australia. was From the inception of pensions legislation, it was believed that those who had served the nation faithfully and well during their best years, would in their years it. of need' be entitled to receive assistance on from the nation. Only twelve months however, a monstrous change of prinwas inaugurated by this Governwe ment. It was then decided that in future pensions should be a loan instead of a payment for services rendered.' The administration gets much of the blame for this, although it is merely giving effect to legislation passed by this Parliament. It is regrettable that even some of those who assist to make laws are ready to throw the responsibility for them on to public servants who are only doing their duty. The amount to be repaid to the Government is increasing every year. It has been stated this afternoon that honourable members of the Opposition have advised the surrender of pensions. I have advised against the adoption of that course, and believe that every other member of the Opposition has done so, too. I have always contended that the Government would not dare to go to the polls with these provisions of the act unrepealed, and that those pensioners who survived the next election would avoid the need for considering whether they should surrender or retain their pensions. A. practice of the Government which invites criticism is that of instructing officers of the department as to what they shall do, whether in accordance with the act or not, and of bringing into operation regulations that are definitely ultra vires the act. The legislation passed thirteen months ago provided that, upon the death of a pensioner or the surrender of a pension, the amount; received from the 12th October, 1932, should lie repaid. That provision was strongly opposed by honourable members 'on this side of the chamber. A few months later the Attorney-General (Mr Latham), despite the explicit provisions of the statute, stated that the department would not collect payments made between the 12th October and the 31st December, 1932, to those who, during that period, had surrendered their pension's. From humanitarian motives, I do not desire that they should be collected. But, the point that I make is that instructions wore given for a breach, of the law; whether the result w:ts for the good or the harm of the pensioner, is beside the point. Of what use is legislation if it is enforced only at the direction of the Government? I fear that interference with the discretion of the administration is an easy matter. Although under the act discretion is allowed in certain circumstances, there are instances of Ministers having succeeded in procuring rulings that have been denied to private members. Obviously, whatever government may be in power, discretion is exercised in accordance with instructions; that is more or less the duty of the administration; but the use of ministerial power .to obtain desired decisions, is un-. fair. It has been mentioned that the act merely states that in order to be eligible for an invalid pension it is necessary that a person should be permanently incapacitated. By a regulation made under the act, however, it is also required that he or she must be totally incapacitated. As no regulation can give powers that are not given by the act under which it is made, I contend that that regulation is - ultra vires. Practically all acts include the"" definite provision, that regulations inconsistent with them may not be made, and the Pensions Act is no exception. By section 55, it provides that "" The Governor General may make regulations not' inconsistent with this act"". I contendand I consider that the contention is beyond refutation-that thei;e is a very big difference between being permanently incapacitated, and being permanently and totally incapacitated.",36
151,Mr CASEV,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"""What is the meaning of "" incapacitated "" ?",37
152,Mr BAKES,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"If it. means totally, where is the necessity for the regulation ? Obviously those who framed the regtilutiou must have considered that it was needed, on the ground that "" incapacitated "" of itself did not mean "" totally incapacitated "".",37
153,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member's Government did not challenge it.,37
154,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"On e reason for that is, that the Labour party has been in power in both Houses of the Parliament for only two of the last twenty years, parties of the same political complexion as the present Government party having been in power for the balance of that period.",37
155,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"This regulation is as old as the act itself. Mr BAKER,-It needs to be altered. It is further proof of the practice of this and other parliaments, of giving complete power to the Executive. The question should be settled before Parliament rises this year. The Attorney-General has contended that the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition is unnecessary, because the Government has promised to bring down legislation this session. There are several reasons for my unwillingness to act upon that assurance. We are informed, through the press, on the authority of the Prime Minister, that the Parliament rise on Friday of next week. Business will have to be transacted very rapidly if the Government is to honour its promise. My second reason is that no statement has been made by the Government as to the terms of the proposed legislation. How are we to know what form it will take? The Government may intend to make the act worse than it is, if that be possible. No clue as to its intentions has been given. My third reason is a statement of the Attorney General on the Financial Emergency Bill last year. The right honourable gentleman then saidTho bill also provides for a charge upon property after the death of the pensioner. It is difficult to see any reasonable objection another. to a proposal-so eminently fair. It is no secret that the Attorney-General is the leading member of the Cabinet. Only twelve months ago he could not see any reasonable objection to a proposal over which the honourable members for Ballarat and Lang, and other honourable members, are working themselves into a frenzy, notwithstanding the fact that they voted for it. If it is proposed to repeal the property provisions, the right honourable gentleman will have to swallow his words. It is obvious that the charge of political expediency can be laid at the door of only one party, and that the party which voted for what its members oppose today. Sufficient time to consider the provisions was not given, because a time limitation was placed on the debate. Mr DEII? - I have no objection to the principle, which I believe to be right.",37
156,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The present deathbed repentance comes too late to save honourable members from the fate thatawaits them at the elections whioh are speedily approaching. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) has contended that the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition is useless. He and other honourable members, while agreeing that the procedure is archaic, must realise that no other course is open to express displeasure at the Government's action. If . the Government does not fulfil its promise, this Parliament will not have another opportunity to deal with the matter. I agree that the procedure is as will elumsy as the foolish and stupid practice of the Speaker leaving the chair, proceeding to his room., returning to' the chamber, and professing to have no knowledge of what has occurred in committee.",38
157,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The honourable m.em.bei""s remarks are quite irrelevant.",38
158,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I agree that there is considerable scope for the improvement of parliamentary procedure, but point out that the only method open to us is being adopted to express an opinion upon what we regard as one of the most important problems with which this Parliament should deal before the Christmas adjournment. It may be advisable for honourable members opposite to seize this opportunity, because they may not be given The Leader of the Country party also stated that the particular legislation with which the amendment proposes to deal was embraced in the act of 1910. Coming from a gentleman who has had such lengthy parliamentary experience, and who must have an exact knowledge of the position, that can only be characterized as deliberate misrepresentation. When the act was first passed",38
159,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member is aware that the Chair has ruled that the act may not be discussed.,38
160,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I am dealing with matters that have been raised by other speakers.,38
161,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order !,38
162,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"In giving effect to the provisions of the act, the administration must necessarily notice the difference between the present law and that which was enacted in 1910. This particular provision, which lays it down that a pension is to be merely a loan, was introduced last year. Under the earlier law, a pensioner was allowed to own £400 worth of accumulated property, whether in or out of Australia, and was allowed to deduct the capital value of the home in which he resided. There was no other reference in the act concerning homes, the provision with which we are now dealing having been introduced.by the present Government.",38
163,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order ! The honourable member is clearly discussing the act. . Mr BAKER - I am pointing out that the administration now has to deal with matters which were not within its scope some years ago.,39
164,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member cannot evade my ruling.,39
165,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Would you, sir, consider that I was evading your ruling if I said that until recently the pensions administration did not attach pensioners' homes, but that the practice has been instituted during the last twelve months, when this Government was in office. A committee of Cabinet was appointed to consider pensions legislation, and it made certain recommendations.",39
166,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The honourable member is distinctly out of order, and I shall not remind him again.",39
167,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"It has been said that, on making application, some honourable members have been able to secure retrospective payments to pensioners, extending as far back as twelve months. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) and I have submitted several cases to the department in an endeavour to obtain retrospectivity, but without success.",39
168,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The honourable member is referring to increases of pensions, not to the granting of new pensions.",39
169,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have submitted both classes of case without success, and consider that the anomaly should be rectified. A number of cases have been submitted t;o me in which, despite the medical history and the evidence of outside doctors, the opinion of the Government medical officer has been accepted. In such cases, the act gives discretion to the commissioner, who rarely exercises it. The act should be amended to provide for the appointment of medical referees to hear the case of applicants whose claims have been rejected. I also think that there should be an amendment of the act to make simpler the conditions relating to husbands and wives who are separated. The department should exercise every precaution before launching prosecutions against pensioners, and I shall cite two cases in which that was not done. In the first a summons was issued which was brought to my attention, and, .after reading it, I said that there did not appear to be a sound case against the person concerned. I therefore made representations to the Deputy Commissioner in Brisbane, the commissioner in Canberra, and the then Treasurer (Senator Massy-Greene). However, my intercession was of no avail, and the department persisted in its prosecution. The pensioner won the case after a good deal of trouble and a little expense. In the second instance, the pensioner also won, after having been put to some slight expense. I hold no brief for those who draw pensions when they are not entitled to do so, but I consider that the department should be extremely careful before launching prosecutions, as in the majority of cases, these unfortunate persons have not sufficient money to fight them. The existing position with regard to the property provisions would be Gilbertian if it were not so pathetic, and the Government would be well advised to amend the act. Peculiarly enough, those persons who, a few months ago, were so vigorotis in their support of this legislation, now condemn it. When the act was first amended, it was provided that the maternity allowance should uot be paid to any person in receipt of more than £4 a week. I am of the opinion that the amount should be reinstated at £5 a week, as a most worthy section of the community would then be benefited.",39
170,Unknown,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Sitting suspended from 6.12 to 8 p.m.,39
171,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"East Sydney) [8.0] - It has been amusing to listen to the efforts made by some honourable gentlemen to excuse themselves from voting for the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), but their attempts to justify their glaring inconsistency are futile. I suggest that, as the Standing Orders provide that honourable members must vote as they call, they should be amended to provide that honourable members must vote as they talk. Those who have protested against the harsh treatment, of pensioners under our existing legislation should be obliged to vote in support of their speeches. As the Standing Orders are so antiquated that they do not provide for'this to be done, they should be amended at the earliest possible date.",39
172,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member may not discuss the Standing Orders under this proposed vote.,40
173,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Honourable members opposite, who have alleged that they desire to cheapen and simplify the administration of our pensions legislation, and to remove the harsh provisions from it, should show their bona fides by voting for the amendment. If they refuse to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to indicate their disapproval of these obnoxious property provisions of the pensions law, they cannot object if we take every chance we get to tell their constituents that they talk one way but vote another.",40
174,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member must discuss the item before the Chair.,40
175,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,It has been convenient for honourable gentlemen to try to escape their responsibilities,40
176,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The honourable member must discuss the item before the Chair, and the amendment thereto.",40
177,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"You , sir, did not allow me to complete my sentence.",40
178,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The votes of honourable members cannot be discussed under this item. They are cast at the discretion of honourable .members.,40
179,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Surely I am. entitled to use the persuasive powers that I possess, small though they may be, to try to induce honourable members to support the amendment. I contend that some honourable gentlemen opposite are arguing in one way, but have every intention to vote in another way. Some of these honourable gentlemen say that the administration of the Pensions Department is at fault, and others, like the honourable member for Lang (Mr Dein), say that the administration is all right, but that the act is all wrong. Personally, I am satisfied that the officers of the Pensions Department work under definite instructions issued, not by irresponsible committees of honourable members of the parties supporting ' the Government, but 'by Cabinet itself. Orders come to these officers through ministerial channels, and they are obeyed We have been told that the officers of the department are sympathetic towards the pensioners; but the fact is that they are not able to display any sympathy that they may possess, for they must work within the provisions of the law. I have had many rulings given by the department which I have subsequently submitted to the responsible Minister, and on not one occasion has the decision of the department been reversed. This proves to me that the department is acting under instructions from the Minister. For that reason rulings given by the department are always upheld by the Minister when an appeal is made to him.. Honourable members opposite cannot escape their responsibility in this matter by saying that the previous Government failed to rectify certain anomalies. This Government and its supporters must accept full-responsibility for whatever is done. The plain fact, is that, although ' the Government has behind it a majority of honourable members in both Houses of the Parliament, it has failed to remedy the grievance brought, before it on behalf of pensioners. Let me direct, .the attention of honourable members to a few cases of so-called sympathetic treatinen t. I have had brought under my notice, aud have subsequently brought under the notice of the Government, the case of a man who enlisted and served wifth our forces overseas. 'Eventually, he was wounded on active service, returned to Australia, and granted a war pension. Dp to that point no question had been' raised as to whether - he was or was not a British subject. Apparently honourable gentlemen opposite, who talk so much about patriotism, and who indulge in so much flag-waving, have no objection lo foreigners going away to fight for this country.",40
180,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order !,40
181,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"After this man returned to Australia his experience was regrettable. I brought this case under the notice of the Government, and, although I know it will not be palatable to its supporters for the particulars to be publicly described in this way, I now feel it my duty to refer - to them. Eventually this man's war pension was cancelled, although his physical condition had not improved. He then made an application for an invalid pension, and his application was rejected by this sympathetic department, not on the ground that he was not .totally and permanently incapacitated, hut on the ground that he was not a naturalized British subject! How can honourable members opposite talk about sympathetic treatment in the face of that kind of tiling? No question was raised as to this man's nationality when he enlisted for overseas service. It was only after he returned to this country, broken in health and spirits, that this department, acting under instructions from the Government, denied him .the right to a pension, which would give him the bare necessaries of life. The Government, so far, has taken no notice of the representations made to it on this man's behalf. I now direct attention to the case of a woman who arrived in this country from Germany when she was a child eight months old. She worked here during her long lifetime and helped to make Australia what it is. .'Her parents both became naturalized British subjects and eventually received the old-age pension. Their daughter, supposing that she automatically became a British subject on the naturalization of her parents, applied for a pension in due course. The department ruled that, as she was not a naturalized British subject, she was not eligible for a pension. Some honourable gentleman with legal' training may say that this case has nothing to do with our pensions law, but is covered by some Other, act bf Parliament. I suggest, however, that a grave injustice has been done to this Australian citizen. I brought this case under the notice of the Government some time ago, but. nothing has yet been done to remove this injustice, and now that the Government is rushing Parliament into another recess, T suppose the anomaly will remain iinrectified, and the injustice will be perpetuated. I come now to the case of an Australian citizen - employed as a seaman on the Burns Philp steamer Morinda, trading between Australia and Papua. this Australian citizen was travelling in this steamer in other than Australian waters he was taken, ill . and although he was working under Australian articles at the time, his application for a pension was rejected on the ground that his disability was not incurred within the Commonwealth. Another similar case was that of a theatrical employee travelling on the Fuller circuit in New Zealand. He was engaged for a six weeks' tour, and while he was on it became ill . He also, being an Australian citizen, applied for an in valid pension, and his application was rejected because his disability was not in curred within Australia. The whole point is, of course, that officers of the Pensions Department cannot be sympathetic even if they desire to be, for they must act within the provisions of the law and on the instructions of the Government. Another source of convplaint that we have is that cases which have been unsuccessfully brought under the notice of the Government many times by some honourable members have subsequently been successfully brought under its notice by certain official political bodies that carry considerable influence with the Government. Several honourable members have made persistent representations in the interests of certain applicants for the pension, but with unfavorable results. One such case was later taken up by the National Council of Women, which made a big noise, with the result that, although the Pensions Department, backed by the Minister, had previously stated definitely that the applicant was not entitled to a pension, that decision was reversed and she received one. This shows clearly that there is partisanship in dealing with pension claims. Another case of the same kind which was unsuccessfully handled by an honourable member of this House was later taken up by an anti-Labour representative in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, who was able to obtain a pension for the unfortunate applicant, although a Labour representative in this Parliament could not do so. The circumstances had not changed in this case. We do not regret that the claimant, was able to obtain a pension, but. we protest against While the practice of giving preferential consideration to representations made by in dividuals and bodies that support the Government. We also complain that conflicting decisions are frequently given in connection with the same case, and that decisions are sometimes reversed under unsatisfactory conditions. I have in mind the case of a' lady who was granted a pension. Subsequently three persons sent a confidential communication to the department, with the result that the pension was cancelled. Later one of the women who signed this confidential communication repented of the injustice she had done and submitted a sworn declaration co the department to that effect. What did the department do in that case? It interviewed the two other signatories to the confidential document and, because they said that they were still of the same opinion, took no notice of the sworn declaration of the third party. In support of my contention that conflicting decisions are given, I direct the attention of honor-' able members to a paragraph which appeared in a letter that. I received signed "" J. Watson, Acting Deputy Commissioner "".' After stating that the application had been rejected, this officer.added"" It is not considered that Mrs. deserving of the pension "". The case was subsequently brought under the notice of the department in Canberra, and a letter signed "" W . Massy-Greene, for the Tteaurer"", contained the following statement :The evidence, however, indicated that the plaimant was not permanently incapacitated for work within the meaning of the Invalid .Wei Old-nge Pensions Act. These two letters, one from the Pensions Office in Sydney and the other from the authorities in Canberra, are, in my opinion, in conflict. It appears to me that the departmental officers have tried to smother up a wrong' decision. Anonymous letters, and even signed letters, sent to the department in connection with pensions claims are not always thoroughly inquired into, and ex parte statements are not always verified. The department should always take notice of sworn declarations of the kind submitted by the woman"" to whom. I have referred. I agree with the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Baker) that honourable members opposite who are now protesting against the property provisions of the pensions law are making a deathbed repentance. Honourable gentlemen such as Mr Ward. the honourable member for Barton (Mr. Lane), the honourable member for Lang (Mr Dein), and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), are using their positions as members of this Parliament in a .way that <is not justifiable. I suggest that they are now only trying to excuse their opposition to something in which they have professed to believe for some time past. The Leader bf the Country party (Dr Earle Page) made a great noise outside of the Parliament about the need, to move certain amendments to the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, but when the House assembled and an opportunity was given to vole upon matters which he professed to support, he suddenly found that his duties carried him to the north of New South Wales.",40
182,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member's remarks are distinctly personal and have nothing to do with the item before the Chair.,42
183,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"As I have said previously, it is regrettable that the Standing Orders do not permit an honourable memis ber to state the truth in respect of certain matters. It cannot be denied that the supporters of the Government are now complaining about the very things for which they were originally responsible. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) has been accused of moving the amendment for political purposes; but if the spirit of the amendment were right I should support it no matter who moved it, whether he be the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) or any one else. All these restrictions were placed upon pensioners simply because the supporters of the Government were broadcasting the fact that the pensions bill of this country had increased to such an enormous figure as to warrant the strictest economy. Now they say that they are in favour of liberalizing the provisions of the act, which, of course, would increase the expenditure. Their present attitude is in direct conflict with the attitude that they adopted when these restrictions were originally imposed upon applicants for pensions and upon those receiving pensions. The Standing Orders provide that an honourable member who wishes the Government to recast any particular financial measure must first move for a reduc j tion of the item itself. That is a stupid procedure, aud because it has to be followed, many honourable members will attempt to mislead the public outside by saying that the Leader of the Opposition moved for a reduction of the amount paid tn invalid and old-age pensioners. Some honourable members, including the honourable member for Lang, had to refer to the dictionary to ascertain the meaning of the word ""confiscation"". Although the honourable member was a schoolmaster before entering this chamber, ho evidently has not mastered the English language. Paragraph E, sub-section 2 of section 52 of the act, states",42
184,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order ! The honourable member may not discuss the act.,43
185,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,If honourable members will take the trouble to peruse the Estimates they will find that the cost of the administration of the Pensions Department has been increased owing to the appointment of certain investigation officers.,43
186,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,They are really pimps.,43
187,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"That is so. These men were appointed to spy into the lives of the applicants for pensions and, by the use of certain intimidatory methods, to prevent the applicants from proceeding with their applications. I do not particularly blame these officers for the nature of their examinations, because they merely carry out the instructions of the department, and, like the majority of our citizens, are unfortunately more concerned about pleasing their employers than about doing the right thing. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Jennings) and other honourable members have referred to the courtesy that they have received at the hands of these officers. That may be true because, naturally, members of the,Parliament, taken collectively, are the employers of these men; but an applicant for a pension would probably find that these officers would not extend to him the same courtesy as is extended to honourable members. I know of instances in which old people have been put through the third degree process of examination and have left the pensions office absolutely panic stricken, preferring to forgo their pensions rather than be subjected to another such ordeal. These inspectors should be instructed to extend the utmost courtesy to the applicants for pensions and pensioners who have grievances. The method of examination does not satisfy me. Persons for whose integrity I have the highest regard have informed me of what transpires at these examinations, and of the nature of the questions 1 put to them. It is an examination* that should not be permitted by any government which professes, by lip service 1 only, to be sympathetically disposed towards pensioners. We should demonstrate our sympathy with the pensioners not by talk in this Parliament but by our votes. That is what the members of my party have done in this chamber. I make no apology for what I have done and for what I shall do in the future. I shall not hesitate' to address the electors in any con- stituency and place the true facts before them. I shall reveal to them the absolute hypocrisy of many of their representatives who talk in one way and vote in another. The Estimates provide for an amount of £5,000 for medical examinations. I want to know from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) who are the individual doctors, the payments that they receive for medical examinations, and the basis on which they are paid, whether at so much per head or by results.",43
188,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I have already given the honourable member that information twice.,43
189,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The Assistant Treasurer has not referred to this item since I have been in the chamber. I want to know whether any instructions have been issued to these medical officers, and whether, if they give decisions contrary to the wishes of the Government}, their services are likely to be dispensed with?",43
190,Dr MALONEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,They have the benefit of private practice.',43
191,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Thes e officers have private practices. Many of them do not undertake the examination that is warranted in the circumstances. In one case a woman was suffering from sugar diabetes, and it is well known that any one suffering from that complaint has to have a blood test taken. She was sent to a medical officer who was working in conjunction with the Pensions Department, Sydney, and he merely felt her pulse and said that there was nothing wrong with her. Another case which I have brought before the notice of honourable members is that of a pensioner whose payment had been cancelled. She was totally and permanently incapacitated, and although we ashed that a further examination be made, no action was taken by the department. Within a few days of the cancellation of the pension this girl committed suicideby throwing herself over the Gap in Sydney. Honourable members supporting the Government cannot excuse themselves by saying that this is an isolated case, because I can quote case after case of persons who have not received from the medical officers the sympathetic treatment to which they are entitled. Instead of ' trying to patch up the existing pensions - law we should scrap it altogether and re-enact fresh legislation to cover these unfortunate people. The act is one mass of anomalies. The supporters of the Government have, on the plea of economy, tried to justify certain obnoxious sections of the act.",43
192,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order ! The honourable member is out of order in referring to the sections of the act as obnoxious. No honourable member can reflect upon any act unless to advocate its repeal when it is before the Chair for discussion.,44
193,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"If I cannot express my opinions in this chamber I shall avail myself of the first opportunity to express them outside. The honourable member for Barton and the honourable member for Lang suggested that the members of the party to which I belong had addressed meetings of pensioners and advised them not to sign the white cards, and. give to the Government the control of their property and their life's savings. Let me say that we have advised the pensioners to sign every card submitted to them by the department and not to allow the Government or any one else to cajole them into refusing a pension to which, they are rightly entitled. I have told them that all they had to gamble on was that they may, live un>til the next elections when a Labour government would be returned to office and the whole of the forms which had been signed by the' pensioners under compulsion would furnish one of the greatest bonfires ever witnessed in the Federal Capital Territory.",44
194,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member's time has expired.,44
195,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [8.30] - A number of honourable members have referred to couples who are eligible by age for the pension but are living apart without legal separation. The Commissioner has full power to disregard the circumstances, provided he is satisfied that such action is warranted. That is as near as one could get to the placing of complete discretion in the person of the Commissioner. Certain honourable members have suggested that the situation should be clarified and crystallized by an amendment of the act. I discussed the matter with departmental officers, and can merely repeat what I have said previously, that the position would not be made more advantageous to those concerned if it were provided for in set terms, because every possible cir'cumstance could not be covered, and there could be no departure from a rigid provision. Honourable members opposite would be the first to bring along a sheaf of cases that did not fit within the four corners of the amendment. To ensure fairness, some discretionary power would have to be given. I have examined the officers of the department, and find that there are no genuine cases of hardship under these sections of the act or the regulations.",44
196,Mr RIORDAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Unde r the act, unless there is a legal separation, there is no power to grant a pension.",44
197,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I repeat that, under the act, and under regulation 13, the Commissioner has the power to disregard the circumstances. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) made a point of having consulted the Deputy Commissioner in Western Australia. Deputy Commissioners have no discretion. I suggest to the honourable member-a n old parliamentarian-that, had he referred' thecase to the Commissioner in Canberra, it might have been given further consideration.",44
198,Mr BEASLEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The Minister must be aware that the Commissioner bases Jiis decisions upon material supplied by the Deputy Commissioner.,44
199,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I think it is fairly well known that honourable members can approach the Commissioner direct.,45
200,Mr BEASLEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,But the file is sent from the office of the Deputy Commissioner.,45
201,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"As the discretion lies ultimately with the Commissioner, a personal conversation with him is more likely to be fruitfu l of results. Comment has been made upon the qualifications for an invalid pension, and some discussion has taken place regarding the interpretation of ""permanent invalidity"". The regulations, on this subject, which go some little way towards the further definition of ""permanent invalidity"", have been in existence as long as this section of the act. very early stage in the existence of this legislation, it fell to the Commissioner to provide an interpretation of the words "" permanently incapacitated "", and they were defined to mean "" total and permanent incapacity to work"". Actually, it has not been so harshly administered; because, as honourable members probably know, in certain circumstances, invalid pensioners are allowed to earn a few shillings a week.",45
202,Mr GANDER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,They are not.,45
203,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I repeat that, in certain circumstances, invalid pensioners are allowed to do light work which brings them in a few shillings a week.",45
204,Mr LANE,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,That must be a new provision.,45
205,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"It is not in the act. I am merely .explaining how the act and the regulations are administered. earning of a few shillings a week from light, work does not disqualify a person from receiving the invalid pension. If honourable members can supply me with eases that are in contradistinction to that statement, I shall be glad if they will do so.",45
206,Mr LANE,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"What is the meaning of "" total and permanent incapacity "" ? As soon as light work is obtained, the pensioner is disqualified.",45
207,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The meaning of the term is "" inability to work interpretation by the department, in the administration of that particular section, docs not exclude a few shillings a week that a pensioner may earn for rendering small services. I am not prepared to say what the limit of earnings would ""be, ibut I suggest that 3s., 4s., or even 5s. a week would not be a bar to the retention of an invalid pension. I was rather surprised that the nonorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) should refer, in terms of contumely, to the .attitude towards pensioners of Dr Ludowici, one of the medical referees in the department. I have, since the honourable member spoke, taken the trouble to obtain the record of this gentleman, and I find that it is completely good.

The honourable member for New Enghave land complained that the surrender value of bonuses on insurance policies is regarded as income. That, I am glad say, is not the case. Bonuses on insurBritish subject. ance policies are taken into account as property, not as income.

I do not propose to traverse the many cases that were submitted by the honoraide member foiEast Sydney except tosuggest thai; he used the language of gross exaggeration, with a com' plete clis-regard for the meaning of words. The honourable member spoke about the infliction on applicants for pensions of something which approached the third degree, and I shall be glad if he will come from behind the cloak of anonymity and supply me personally, and not necessarily publicly, with some case in which there has been even incivility on the part of departmental officers.

I want to correct the honourable gentleman's statement that this is the first time that any complaint has been made against Dr Ludowici in connection with his treatment of pensioners. Unfortunately, my work being of such an extensive nature, I am not able to keep a filing cabinet which would permit me quickly to ascertain how many times I havb written to the department complaining about this medical officer. From memory I can safely say that I wrote at least half a dozen times to the Deputy Commissioner in Sydney, and I personally consulted him on the subject on a number of occasions. „",47

In the circumstances, it was unfair for the Minister to make a statement based entirely on what the Commissioner told him, and implying that my complaint had not the slightest foundation, and was, therefore, unjustified.",47
233,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"-Ha d there been any serious complaint against Dr LudoAvici, it would have reached the Commissioner at Canberra. Mr BEASLEY; - Not - necessarily. For one thing, the Commissioner has not occupied his position long. However, I do not wish to argue the case from the point of view that I would expect the Commissioner to be kept closely in touch with every detail. This matter is common knowledge to the Deputy Commissioner in Sydney, to whom many complaints have been made about Dr Ludowici's treatment of pensioners. There should be an immediate investigation into the conduct of this doctor. My colleagues and I have found it necessary to go to considerable trouble to collect medical evidence to prove that he has acted unfairly towards pensioners, and sion we have brought about a change decision, but, unfortunately, without retrospective effect. It is interestsubject, ing to learn that these medical officers receive 10s. for each examination that they make. The Minister should ing legislation. have gone further and informed us how much Dr Ludowici has received for the last financial year.",47

235,Mr BEASLEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The Minister made the interesting statement that an invalid pensioner is entitled to earn a small amount in addition to his pension, and I hope that the press will give the greatest publicity to that announcement. I am clined to think that, as was done in nexion with a statement made by the then Assistant Treasurer (Senator Massyance. Greene), and contradicted by the Deputy Commissioner in Sydney, the Government will dissociate itself from the present ""Minister's assurance.",48

237,Mr BEASLEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Earnings . I hope that the Government will abide by the statement of the 'Minister. The act and the regulations provide that an come applicant for an invalid pension to roust be totally and permanently inview capacitated. I am informed that when pensioners come before departmental officers to have their cases reviewed, are asked, "" Can you do light work?""; if they reply in the affirmative, the amination is immediately discontinued, and the pension dropped. The departallowance. ment will then tell those who inquire that the applicant had declared his ability to do light duties such as selling papers, driving a lift, or, in the case of a woman, sewing. If it is asked where the applimost cant can obtain light work, the departcame ment answers that that is not its responthat sibility, and dismisses the matter. I know that the information will be of advantage to many whose applications have been rejected. On the last occasion when I urged an appeal tribunal similar to that granted to returned soldiers should be set up, had the support of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), on occawho in a member of the medical of profession. I should, like the Minister to express an opinion on. the and hope that the Government will consider the appointment of such a tribunal when introducing its amendAs I stated yesterday, when pensioners are forced to leave their homes in order to live close to a hospital where they receive treatment, the ownership of the obhome is assessed, 'against them and their pension is reduced. While the department is most sympathetic in the matter, the responsibility should be lifted from it. My last point concerns the payment of maternity allowance. The law provides in that no person whose household has an conincome in excess of £208 per annum is entitled to receive the maternity - allowI know of many cases where, after the wage tax is deducted from the earnings of the person, concerned, the net income is less than £20S, but the person is still deemed not to be eligible for the allowance. I think that the Governmean ment should rectify that anomaly. If that were done, I am sure that every lion or able member, irrespective of his party associations, would be pleased. I am not saying that I agree with the iurestriction, but this is not the time discuss that aspect of the subject. In of the fact that the wage tax is paid in order to assist unfortunate unemployed, individuals in the community, 1 they do not think that it should be included and as income of other persons, thereby exdepriving them of the right which they would otherwise have to the maternity",48
238,Mr HUGHES,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"North Sydney) [9.1]. - The explanation of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) of some points in connection with invalid pensions has been interesting to honourable members. It to us all as a great surprise to learn an invalid pensioner could legally earn a few shillings a.week without running the risk of the cancellation of his pension. I had always thought that the capacity to earn any income whatever that was a complete bar to the granting of the invalid pension. I agree with the I honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) that hitherto the admission that an invalid was able to earn a few shillings a week by performing light duties was an absolute disqualification for the pension. I trust that the press will blazon from one end of Australia to the Other the statement that this is not so, for a grave injustice has been, and is still being, done to many people in consequence of the widespread impression that I myself have held until this evening. I think the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) was very unfair in the statements he made about the attitude adopted by officers of the pensions departdepartment ment towards claimants for the pension. I , personally, have always found the department most sympathetic. officers administering the pensions law have a most difficult task to perform. Perhaps the honourable member for East Sydney does not realise that they are called upon to deal with thousands of applications, some of which, I am sure he will readily admit, are not bona fide. The duty of the officers is to winnow the chaff from the corn. I have always found the officers most sympathetic when the facts relating to any case have been fully and frankly placed before them. I regret that there still lingers about the pension some taint of pauperism that marked the old methods of treating the poor people of Australia, - Great Britain and other countries. This pension is a right and not a charity. Men and ""women who reach the statutory age and become eligible for an old-age pension, or who through invalidity become eligible for an invalid pension, are as much entitled to it as is a workman to his pay, a judge to his pension on retirement, or an unemployed man to the dole. This is sometimes forgotten. The spirit which inspired the structure of our pensions legislation was that the pension should be a recognition of work well done. It must be assumed that these people have, on the average, done their work well aud truly and so are entitled to a pension on reaching the statutory age or on invalidity. In my opinion the time is fast arriving, if it has not already arrived, when the statutory age for a pension should be greatly reduced.",48
239,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,If the honourable member moves for a reduction of the age I will support him.,49
240,Mr HUGHES,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"This is not the occasion for action of that kind. I repeat, however, that the pension is a right. I take the strongest possible exception to the amendment made to the pensions law in 1932 by which pensioners were required to give the Commonwealth a mortgage over their homes.",49
241,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order ! I have already ruled that the provisions of the act may not now be discussed.,49
242,Mr HUGHES,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I am discussing these Estimates, bearing in mind that the is required to administer those provisions. We should not blame the department for what has happened. The The responsibility rests entirely with this 1 legislature which, I hope, by now has seen the error of its way3 and will take the earliest opportunity to amend them. I agree with the Assistant Treasurer that it is extremely difficult to define the word "" invalidity."" The law uses the phrase: "" total and permanent incapacity."" But what does total and permanent incapacity mean ?- A man who is by trade a blacksmith may become totally incapacitated from following that avocation, but what is to happen to him if he is of such a type that he is practically incapable of doing anything else ? Honourable members will realise that there are persons of that nature. But, without narrowing it down so finely, it is obvious that a person may be totally incapacitated from following his ordinary occupation and still be capable of earning something. A cabinet-maker or a storeman or packer may be incapable of following any one of those occupations, but may be able to use a typewriter, address envelopes, or mind a shop. Until the Assistant Treasurer made his statement this evening I was under the impression that if he did any of those things and earned a few shillings thereby he automatically lost his eligibility for the pension, but apparently a man may earn 3s., 4s., or 5s. a week. Mr GAR DEB,-The Minister went as far as 6s. a week.",49
243,Mr HUGHES,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Perhaps in a later effort the ' honourable - gentleman may spring another shilling, and so make it a shilling a day. I hope that the Government will, at the earliest possible moment, increase the pension to such a rate as will give the old and infirm people of this country a reasonable income. I do not for a moment admit that we cannot afford to do this. I hope that the odious amendment that was made to our pensions law last year, which required the pensioners to assign their property to the Government, will be repealed.",49
244,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order !,50
245,Mr HUGHES,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Having , said so much, let me end on an optimistic note. I rejoice exceedingly at the positive assurance of the Assistant Treasurer that whatever may in the past have been the definition of invalidity, and whatever may have been the defects in the administration of this legislation, the interpretation of the la'w will in the future be on a much more liberal basis - than we have hitherto Understood' to b§ possible. Having obtained that assurance from the Assistant Minister, it may be said that the time we have spent in discussing this subject today has not been 'wasted.",50
246,Mr R GREEN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Richmond) [9.11]. I regret that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey), in the speech delivered by him a few minutes ago, did not deal with a. Certain question, and I wish to ask him to make a definite statement regarding the date upon which pensions first become payable after they have beei granted. Apparently the department fixes an arbitrary date. I direct the attention of the Assistant Treasurer to a case concern- future. ing which I wrote him on the Sth September. The original application was made to the department in June, but when no information had been received about it after nearly three months, I - was asked to take it up. My letter was acknowledged on the 15th September, and I was advised on the 21st September that a pension had been granted at the maximum rate as from the 31st Auwist. ""Why was that time arbitrarily fixed ? It seems to me that when applications for pensions are' delayed until the applicants call in the aid of their parliamentary representative to press for a decision, the claim, subsequently approved, should be paid as from the date of the original applica^ tion. In this connection I have received the following ruling from the department :Date of first payment is first pay day within fortnight of claim.",50
247,Mr RIOEDAST,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The Assistant Treasurer, was surprised when that statement was brought under his notice.",50
248,Mr R GREEN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The ruling continues : In case of rejection and representation made hy member subsequently, payment is dated from such representation, not from original claim. I can understand that if the claim is rejected and subsequentlyapproved! upon a new application the payment should date from the date of the fresh application, but I cannot understand why the first payment on an original claim should not date from the date, of the c'laini. The rulingalso contains this statementClaim means lodgement of form of application. I hope that an explanation will be given me of why a claim made in June, and subsequently granted on the 21st September, s'ho'uld. be payable only from the 31st August. I am sure that honourable members generally do not know the procedure adopted by the department in fixing the date of the commencement of the payment of a pension, and if the Assist tant Treasurer can give the committee some information on that point, it will be of great assistance to honourable members, and will save considerable correspondence with the department in the",50
249,Mr MCGRATH,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Ballarat) [9.16] - I should like the Assistant Treasurer (MrCasey) to impress upon the medical officers who act in conjunction with the Pensions Department, the necessity for extending sympathetic and kindly treatment to applicants for pensions and those receiving pensions, who appear before them for examination. I know of onedoctor who is most inhumane in his treatment of pensioners. He never has a kindly word for them, and always leaves a bad impression. When the Labour party held office, I reported him to the if Government. I was bitterly hostile to him then, and I am just as hostile to him today. I should like the Assistant Treasurer to give this officer a rap over the knuckles, and to instruct him to he more courteous to thosewhom he is called upon to examine.",50
250,Mr GANDER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Why not dismiss him? Mr MoGRATH,-If it were within my power, I would dismiss him tomorrow. A kindly word costs nothing, and would go a long way towards easing the lot of many unfortunate pensioners. One would imagine from the remarks ' of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) that the provision in the act relating to naturalization was something new, yet it has been in operation since the inception of the pensions legislation. When the Labour party was in power, the honourable member was an active supporter of it, yet he never opened his mouth to complain about the operation of this provision, and took no action ever with a view to improving the lot of the pensioners. Quite a number of people are indifferent to the necessity for becoming naturalized until they awaken to the fact that they are in need of a pension. They then complain that they have to pay a naturalization fee of £5. Any person living in this country who is unnaturalized and wishes to apply for a pension should be compelled to pay £5 for that privilege.",51
251,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"If the applicant is an invalid, how can he obtain £5?",51
252,Mr MCGRATH,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"An exception could be made in the case of persons who are in bad health provided that they are good citizens, but in the ordinary course of events, the naturalization fee should be paid. Reference has been made to the earnings of invalid pensioners. .Last session, I stated clearly and definitely - and the statement was reported in practically every newspaper-that invalid pensioners were permitted under the act to earn up to, say, 6s. a week.",51
253,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The honourable member must have been the only member aware of that fact. Mr MoGRATH - I am not responsible for the honourable member's ignorance of the provisions of the act. I admit that under the recent restrictions the payment to invalid and old-age pensioners earning 3s. a week and over, was reduced by 2s 6d. a week, but that anomaly has now been rectified. The Government has promised to amend the property provisions of the act 'before the end of next week, and apart from those provisions the pensions legislation is now infinitely better than it was.prior to the advent of this Government. The administration of the act has also been considerably improved and a pensioner with an income of 12s. 6d. is now entitled to a full pension.",51
254,Mr MAKTN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,The honourable member held a different opinion the other day when he referred to the callousness of those with whom he is associated.,51
255,Mr MCGRATH,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"What I said was perfectly true. I am pleased indeed that Senator Massy-Greene has resigned from the Ministry, because he was responsible for the cruel and callous administration whatof the act. However, that is a thing of the past, and conditions are different today. We should be proud of the act as it now stands, and I hope that next year, if the finances permit, there will be a complete restoration of the invalid and old-age pension to £1 a week.",51
256,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"So soon as the Labour party is returned to power, the pension will be increased to £1 a week.",51
257,Mr MCGRATH,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The Labour party is not likely to be in office for many years to come. I ask the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin)' to withdraw his amendment, because, even if it were carried, it would serve no useful purpose. It would merely reduce the vote by a paltry £1.",51
258,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"As the honourable member has been Chairman of Committees, he should know much better than that.",51
259,Mr MCGRATH,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I know my business probably a great deal better than the ex-Speaker, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) knows his business. If the amendment were carried there would be £1 less to distribute among the old-age and invalid pensioners, and I suggest that it be withdrawn in view of the assurance of the Prime Minister that amending legislation will be brought down before Parliament adjourns for the Christmas vacation.",51
260,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Melbourne Ports) [9.28] - The reply of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) was satisfactory from the point of view of future administration of the department, .and his interpretation of the existing act is much more favourable than that of the department. What I find fault with is the way in which the Assistant Treasurer dismissed altogether the suggestion that married couples who had been separated for years had been unable to obtain pensions. He was emphatic that there were no such ' cases. I have already brought two such cases under the notice of the Commissioner in Canberra, and I am confident that both of these claims will be granted. I do not' think that the Minister will mind the disproof of his statement that no such cases exist. Since the amendment of the law last year, particularly as the result of instructions issued by the ex-Assistant Treasurer (Senator Massy-Greene), there has been speeding up by the administration in all the States, especially in Victoria, with a view to the reduction of the cost of pensions. In order that all existing pensions could be reviewed quickly, the department took the risk of reducing, suspending, and cancelling without investigation, placing on the pensioners the responsibility of proving that they were being improperly treated: I have handled 30 or 40 cases of that nature, and have heard of scores of others, Probably 90 per cent, of the pensioners would enlist the aid of menibers of Parliament. When the cases were reviewed, it was found that there was no justification for the action that had 'been taken and the pensions were restored, but only from the day on which the matter was rectified. I am certain that the Minister will not sanction an injustice of that sort in the future. Where there was no justification for it, the payment should have been dated back to the time of such, suspension or cancellation. I repeat that I have handled cases, the existence of which the Minister has denied. His statement must be based on the fact that they have not been brought to Canberra. I suggest that only a small, percentage of the protests that are made against the treatment of pensioners comes to Canberra. Honourable members depend on Deputy CommisMr IJoHowaij. sioners, and go over their heads to the Commissioner only on odd occasions. I admit that I have obtained better results from Mr Metford. One of the two cases that I have sent to him to-night is that of a miner in Lauriston, near Ballarat, which I have been handling for a year, and the other is that of a cripple who has been refused a pension for the sole reason that he cannot discover whether his wife is alive or dead, and, consequently, cannot prove that she is not in a position to maintain him. He has not seen her for twenty years. It is wrong to place such a responsibility on the applicant for a pension. I hope that the Minister will place on the administration the onus of proving disqualification.",51
261,Mr A GREEN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Kalgoorlie) [9.36]. - I wish to give the particulars of a case in which groat hardship has been inflicted on a man who was born north-west of Port Augusta over 70 years ago. His people were engaged in station work, and the difficulties associated with the registration of births in that distant part were evidently so great that Ins birth was not registered. He has followed mining of late years, and his health is now broken, yet he is denied a pension on account of his inability to prove that his age entitles him to receive one. A man in Kalgoorlie is prepared to swear that the applicant was carting wood as a lad of about fifteen years of age in Saltia 55 years ago. It is impossible to produce further evidence of his age. I took the case to the Deputy Commissioner in Western Australia. It is useless to find fault with a member who is unable to derive satisfaction from that source, because he natitrally regards such a. decision as final. I look upon the Deputy Commissioner in Western Australia as a man of wide sympathy, and in ordinary circumstances would not dream of going over his head to the Commissioner.",52
262,Mr GABB,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Does the applicant for the pension look his age?,52
263,Mr A GREEN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Every year of it. When immigrants from counties in Ireland, where births were not registered years ago, applied for the pension, their declaration of age was accepted. The only step taken by the department was to search the passenger lists of the vessels in which they came to Australia, in order to check the year of their arrival. Immigrants from the United Kingdom, foreigners who have become naturalized, and Hindus who could not speak the English language-when they came to Australia, have been able to obtain pensions after a residence of twenty years in this country; yet this Australian-horn is . denied one. In the circumstances, a sympathetic administration would see that the pension was granted. MT . GANDER (Eeid) |'9.40] - The i nformation given by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) to-night has pleased me greatly.

I did not think I would have been expected to go out to work as well as my family. Yet the administration, under instructions from the predecessor of the Assistant Treasurer, ruled that this ' woman must go out to work before she would be entitled to an invalid pension. The letter goes on to sayMy eldest son was in the Australian Army. The second one was chief gunner in the British Navy, and was on the Russell when it was blown up. After the war they all came home to live with me; since then, they have all married, but one. His work is only casual. He is all the support I have, and my health has been gradually failing, until I am crippled in every joint. I have tried for a pension before, but was told I had never worked for Australia. I am 03 years of age, and um hoping that you may be able to help me in this. outside I shall uot mention the name of the lady. I leave the matter with, the Assistant Treasurer, feeling confident that it will meet with the same fate as the previous t one submitted by me. I am also pleased that the honourable gentleman has given an 'assurance that, where the evidence of two independent doctors overrides that of Dr Ludowici, it will be accepted.",53
267,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"That is not so. Their evidence will be taken into consideration, and if the Commissioner or Ids deputy decides that justice has not been done, the case will be submitted to another medical referee for determination.",53
268,Mr GANDER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"That places the Commissioner or his deputy in a false position. The fairest thing would be to decide that, if there is a preponderance of medical evidence against Dr Ludowici, the matter shall be decided in favour of the applicant. I again seek the support of the Minister in connection with the case of the woman pensioner at Auburn, who has thirteen boarders who are also pensioners. The Government pays State institutions 12s. Gd. a week for pensioner inmates, hhe amount previously being l is . 9d. This old lady receives only l is . 3d. a week from each pensioner, and cannot show a profit. In the circumstances I urge tha.r, she be paid the full pension of 17s. 6d. a week. My last point deals with, the simplificathat tion of formalities to effect the official separation of an aged couple. At present it is necessary - to have the forms signed by 'both parties, which frequently impossible, as I proved a short while Reputable persons are permitted to certify .as to the eligibility of a pensioner, a similar arrangement should be in operatain amount of money. tion concerning the separation of couple. I know of an instance an honourable member was asked by a lady to obtain the necessary form from the - department, which lie did, and sent it on to appeal boards, her. The next day she visited the Federal Members' Rooms at the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, and said, ""You, a I member of Parliament, ought to be ashamed of yourself for coming between husband and wife; it is scandalous that you should have sent me a separation form to sign."" That sort of thing would be avoided if it were provided that 4 reputable persons could sign the necesment sary form certifying that a couple was sympathetically with them. living apart. I have found the officials of the departhave ment, who are public servants, to be sympathetic in the treatment of cases put before them, and I know that, if Assistant Treasurer were to say to them, "" I want you to give pensions to all these cases that have been referred to by the honourable member for Reid,"" it would be done. The whole thing rests with honourable gentleman. It is the first that he has occupied his present august position, and dealt with the estimates a department. Let him commemorate the that claims for invalid pensions are deoccasion fittingly, and, in so doing,* some of the fine old pioneers of country. Mr.'MAKI N (Hindmarsh) [9.55] - should like the Assistant Treasurer (Mr. Casey) to reply to my question concernindependent ing adequate maintenance. I know cases in which hardship is placed upon parents w.ith small incomes who have to provide special foods, medicines and medical deal assistance for an invalid child, like to see a broadening of the provisions of the act in this regard. I should also like the department be instructed to revert to the old practice of making pension payments retrospective to the date of application. Unfortunately, the extraordinary pensions legislation has been introduced by the Government has overwhelmed the department with all sorts of complicated problems, so that it has experienced difficulty in is dealing with new applications for penago. sions. It is unfair that persons whose applications have been delayed by the and department should be deprived of a cerI t would bo a equitable to make the payment retrospecwhere tive to the date of application. I agree that a strong case has been submitted for the. appointment of and I hope the Government will take the necessary action in this direction. I should like to say that have received every consideration from officers of the department, either in Canberra or in Adelaide, when I have made representations on behalf of pensioners. Rut I have found distinct difficulty in consequence of the undue hardship in any flicted upon pensioners because Governmedical officers have dealt tinI n my opinion applicants for invalid pensions a serious grievance in this connection. mo .it Certain Government medical officers, through excessive zeal to serve the departthe ment well, have served claimants for pensions most unjustly. I do not say that this has been done deliberately, but apparently certain medical officers cannot forget that they are associated with a the public department. This seems to warp time their judgment and to cause them to give insufficient consideration to the invalidity of provisions of the pensions law. Seeing 4 help termined on ""medical evidence submitted the by departmental doctors, every care should be taken to ensure that justice is I done to claimants. I support the request that has been made for the setting up of medical tribunals to hear appeals from unsatisfactory decisions of departmental doctors. If such independent bodies were constituted, a good of the dissatisfaction that at present and should exists would be removed. I also support the request of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. to Beasley) that the practice of making deductions from pensions in respect of those persons who are required temporarily to leave their homes to obtain medical attention at a hospital or other institution. We all know that in such cases invalid pensioners sometimes go to live temporarily with a son - or daughter who resides close to an institution which can vide them with the needed treatment. Frequently the old people have to close up tlieir own homes, because they cannot let them. Such extra treatment nearly always involves increased expenditure. There is, therefore, no justification whatever for reducing the pensions of persons who need this additional attention. This provision of the act should be interpreted as sympathetically as possible pending an amendment of it. Attention has been directed in this debate to many anomalies in the act which indicate the crying need for its complete overhaul. I urge the Government to give the most sympathetic regard to the aged and infirm old people of this country who are dependent upon the pension for the hare necessaries of life. These unfortunate citizens should not be required to endure any hardship that can be avoided.",53
269,Mr RIORDAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Kennedy) [10.6] No doubt today's discussion of our pensions law has been worthwhile, if only because it has caused the responsible Minister (Mr Casey) to' promise rhat more generous treatment will be accorded pensioners in the future. The honourable gentleman has said, for instance, that invalid pensioners may earn up to 6s. a week without endangering their pensions. But throughout my parliamentary experience I have discovered that Ministers anxious to get the Estimates for their department through the committee are prepared to be very generous, at least, for the time being. They will promise that this, that, and the other thing will be done. The Assistant Treasurer, in his new-born enthusiasm and generosity, has this evening made reference to the earning capacity of invalid pensioners. But we shall probably discover that when the officers - of the Pensions Department are consulted on the subject they will say that invalid pensioners may not earn even a few shillings a week without surrendering their pensions, and will point to the provisions of the act which govern the situation. It appears to me that if all the promises made this evening to liberalize the administration of the pensions .law were implemented, an increased expenditure - of £1,000,000, or even £1,500,000, would be incurred in the current financial year, and I am not optimistic enough to imagine prothat this is possible without a considerable amendment of the law. I do not cavil at the Minister for promising that the act will be sympathetically administered, nor have I any grouch against the officers of the Pensions Department, though many claimants for pensions may feel aggrieved because their claims have been rejected. But I am quite certain that when the officers of the department are called into consultation regarding the promises made this evening, they will say that the Minister evidently spoke under some misapprehension. Take, for instance, the case of husbands and wives living apart from one another. When we approach the Assistant Treasurer with a request that a pension be granted to either one or other of the parties concerned, he will doubtless call his officers into consultation, and they will certainly direct attention to the provision of the act which readsIf for twelve months of the previous five years the husband or wife has deserted either one or the other, they are not eligible for the pension. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) referred this evening to the case of an applicant for a pension who had not seen his wife for the last 30 years, and had not even heard of her for more than 20 years. Even that man had Buckley's change of getting a pension. I also direct attention to the following provisions of the act:25 - (.1.) The net capital value of accumulated property shall be assessed in the prescribed manner., and, unless otherwise prescribed, the following provisions shall apply:(<Z) In the case of husband and wife, except where they are living apart pursuant to any decree, judgment, oicler, or deed of separation, the net capital value of the accumulated property of each shall be deemed to be half the total net - capital value of the accumulated property of both. 20. In the computation of income(i>) In the case of husband and wife, except where they are living apart pursuant to any decree, judgment, order, or deed of separation, the income of each shall be deemed to be half the total income of both. I have brought under the notice of the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions for Queensland, Mr Maguire, many applications of married people living apart from one another, and he has invariably said that nothing can be done unless a separation order is obtained. Reverting for a moment to the assurance of the Assistant Treasurer that invalid pensioners may earn up to 6s. a week, I point out that the act uses the term ""permanent incapacity"", and the ""Deputy Commissioner for Queensland has ruled that a person who can earn any money is not totally and permanently incapacitated. The word ""totally"", by the way, appears in the regulations, but not in the act. I know of a woman who was wheeled to the departmental office in Brisbane in an invalid chair. At the inquiry into her circumstances, it was ascertained that she was able to earn a few shillings a week dressmaking, and for this reason, it was ruled that she was not totally incapacitated. The woman's health was very bad, and she had to use what, little money she could obtain to buy medical necessaries. She was not able at that time to produce a doctor's certificate to the effect that she was totally and permanently incapacitated ; even now she is not able to do so; but surely a woman who must be wheeled about in an invalid chair, and suffers incessantly, should be entitled to an invalid pension. We have all known of cases of the cancellation of invalid pensions when it has been discovered that the pensioner has been earning a few shillings a week. I had brought, under my notice recently when I visited Aramac, in my district, the case of an old lady who has beena sufferer for many years, and who spent almost the whole of her pension of 17s. 6d. a week in medicine and other requirements of a person in her poor state of health. She was in the care of her daughter, whose husband was on relief work for only three days a week. As soon as it was discovered that she was living with her daughter, the Pensions Department intimated that the value of her board and lodging would have to be taken into account in assessing her pension, and in consequence of this being done, her rate of pension was reduced from 17s. 6d. to 15s. a week. Mr Kiordnn. ' That occurred under the amending legislation passed last year. Despite the statement of the Assistant Treasurer respecting the earning capacity of invalid pensioners, it is on record in letter after letter that the payment of a pensioner who was receiving board and lodging from, a relative was reduced from 17s. 6d. to 15s. a week. This afternoon the honourable member for Lang (M.r. Dein) said that the Government had not reduced pensions by 2s. 6d. a week and he quoted figures to show that only one pensioner in six had had his pension reduced by that amount. The pensioners know the circumstances and it is of no use for the supporters of the Government to say that the Leader of the Opposition- (Mr. .Scullin) has moved this amendment for political purposes. As the majority of pensioners vote for the Labour party it would be only a waste of time for the Leader of the Opposition to move an amendment merely for purposes of political propaganda. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) has complained about the reduction of (the maternity allowance. Let me remind him that that reduction was brought about by legislation passed last year and supported by the honourable member. No person in receipt of an income of over £208 per annum is entitled to maternity allowance and no provision is made for exemptions. In parts of Queensland allowances are made on account of the .high cost of living and an income of £200 at, say, Longreach would not be anywhere near the value of a similar income in Brisbane. That applies also to pensions. The maternity allowance is now treated as a sop instead of a payment to which the mother of a new-born babe should, if the original intention of the Parliament were carried out, be rightly entitled. The Government should deal with this matter before the House adjourns. There is plenty of time between now and Christmas to rectify many^ of the anomalies in our pensions, maternity, and other legislation.",55
270,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"East Sydney) [10.21] I shall be pleased to accept the invitation of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) to bring, directly under his notice the complaints of many pensioners and applicants for pensions that they have been treated discourteously by officials of the Pensions Department. I can assure the Assistant Treasurer that it will require more than au hour of his time to deal with those complaints, and if he will make arrangements to spend' a week in .Sydney I shall keep him busily occupied. My reference to the discourtesy meted out to the applicants for pensions and those in receipt of pensions whose cases were under review, did not include the whole of the officials of the department, because, naturally, in all departments there are some officials who are prepared at all times to be courteous. However, there are far too many instances of discourtesy, and the Assistant Treasurer has adopted the right attitude by promising to make a personal investigation of these complaints. Referring to my statement that applications for pensions had been refused on the ground that the claimants had failed to become naturalized, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) said that that had always been the case under the act, but evidently he is not well versed in this particular legislation, because at one time no naturalization fee was required only in later years has the department required alien applicants to pay such a fee. I have suggested to the Government and to the department that where the failure of au applicant to become naturalized is the only bar to his pension, the. payment of the fee should be deferred until such time as it is repaid by small deductions from the pension. The Assistant Treasurer, referring to the case of an ex-soldie'r, said that the man had enlisted for service overseas, but had misled the authorities in respect of his nationality. That, of course, was a foolish action, but the defence authorities at. that time were quite prepared to accept his statement without question, and T suggest that in justice to this unfortunate individual who furnished incorrect information so that he nught serve overseas, the department should at least be prepared to assist him to obtain a pension in the declining years of his life when he is unable to work for a living. I was surprised to learn from the Assistant Treasurer that invalid pensioners are allowed to have an income from personal exertion. If the Minister investigates all the complaints that I have placed before him he will' find that a certain method of cross-examination takes place when an applicant for a pension is interviewed by a special magistrate. Special magistrates like other public servauts are instructed that they have to investigate cases aloug certain lines, and trick questions are put to the applicants. They are asked how they manage to do their housework and to clean their rooms, and invariably they answer that they struggle through it.. They are asked to sign a statement to that effect, and when they sign it they are told that as, on their own admission they are able to do their own housework, they are not totally and permanently incapacitated, and, therefore, are not entitled to a pension. Most of the applicants will sign anything in order to leave the office as quickly as possible, aud when later they ask honourable members to ventilate their cases the department produces signed statements to support its action in. refusing a pension. The pensioners' associations, which represent the great majority of the invalid and old-age pensioners in this country, should be allowed to appoint a representative and at these inquiries so as to watch the interests of their members, and if that were done I believe that many of the grounds for complaint would be removed. The Assistant Treasurer has said thatsome of the charges made against Dr Ludowici were unfounded. In respect of one ' case which was brought before the notice of the Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member concerned was asked to obtain from the neighbours of the applicant evidence to the effect that they had seen her in an epileptic fit, and three neighbours testified to that effect. Dr Fenner, of Balmain, stated that the claimant was totally and permanently incapacitated. Dr Porter, the Medical Superintendent of the Sydney Hospital, made a similar statement. Yet all that evidence was set aside in favour of the opinion of Dr Ludowici. I suggest that that medical officer should be treated in the. same way as any other employee of the - Government who is incapable of fulfilling the duties assigned to him. He should be dismissed and recise placed by a competent officer. The lowing astounding reply was furnished the departmentI have had the claimant examined by Commonwealth medical referee and the posiment tion now is one ior and one against. That statement shows that the outside testimony of reputable witnesses was enwas withdrawn. tirely disregarded. However, the department said that', as the result was one and one against, the doubt would be given to the applicant. There should be no doubt in that case, because the opinions of . three reputable doctors were directly opposed to the opinion of Dr Ludowici. Medical officers are paid 10s. for each examination, and it is only natural Dr Ludowici and other medical titioners employed by the Pensions Department who have private practices demand a higher fee than 10s. from their own patients. On some mornings when they are asked to make medical examiAct nations on behalf of the department they may have calls from patients, will hurry through the departmental examinations as was done in the case examining those enlisting for war service. The situation would be amusing if it not so tragic. I know of a woman sufdeprived fering from sugar diabetes, who by of her pension was able to pay for a special diet and for periodical injections earn anything. of insulin, and whose condition improved slightly. She was then called up for a provide ? further examination, and the medical referee, on finding that her condition had slightly improved, recommended that pension should be cancelled. The amazquoted the act. ing decision of the department was that, if her condition grew worse-naturall y would when she could not purchase what any kind? she required-he r pension would be restored. Another case which may interest Assistant Treasurer, who says that in has been inserted. certain cases invalid pensioners are allowed to earn a small income, is pensions that of an invalid pensioner in New South Wales suffering from rheumatic condition in the joints of the hands which prevents him from and undertaking ordinary work. The medical authorities said that if he undertook'light employment it would allow him to exerinformation Mr Ward. his fingers and his condition mightfolimprove. He was given permission to by make artificial paper flowers, and during the period of about twelve months he the earned about 2s. 6d. a week. The departthen decided that as he was able to use his fingers even only slightly his condition had improved, and his pension The Assistant Treasurer should at the for earliest possible moment notify honourable members when he can spare a week in Sydney, and we shall then be able to keep him fully occupied hearing complaints from applicants for pensions and from those whose pensions have been either reduced or cancelled. If he does so, he will realise that the statements made by that honourable members on this side of the pracchamber can be fully justified.",56
271,Mr MARTENS,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Herbert) [10.35] - I can should like to' know how the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) proposes to override the Invalid and Old-age Pensions and regulations framed under it, which definitely provide that-persons in and receipt of invalid pensions shall not engage even in light work. Before and of since I have been a member, of this House, cases have been brought under were my notice of pensioners who nave been of their pensions because they means could perform only light work.",58

277,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Oxley) [10.38] - The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) stated that the Government medical officer rejects applications for invalid pensions when two outside medical practo titioners arrive at a different decision with respect to the total and permanent incapacity of an applicant.,59
278,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,If the Deputy Commisand sioner so decides.,59
279,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,That statement differs from one which the Assistant Treasurer previously made. I was going to suggest that Deputy Commissioners should be sion. instructed to exercise discretion in such cases: The latest statement of the Minister nullifies that which he previously made. Do I understand that a Deputy Commissioner has discretionary power two medical practitioners disagree the opinion of the Government medical officer ?,59
280,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I did not say two.,59
281,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The Minister's statetions ments are somewhat confusing. I believe that if two medical certificates are in favour of the applicant, the Deputy Commissioners should be instructed to use their discretion in obtaining the opinion of another medical officer acceptable to both parties, whose decision should be final. I understand that the Minister has now said that an invalid pensioner is allowed to earn up to 6s. a week.",59
282,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I said that he is allowed to earn small nominal amounts of an intermittent character of, say, 3s., 4s., 5s. a week.",59
283,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The act and the regulathat tions provide that applicants for invalid practice. pensions must bo permanently and totally incapacitated. It has always been underspecific stood that the only persons entitled to invalid pension are those who are so capacitated that they cannot earn anyment thing. As a matter of fact, I know of a specific case in which a man was they adjudged to be totally and permanently incapacitated, and was granted a pennominal sion. He was so sick that he for hospital for a considerable time. He recovered to some extent, and,, upon his return home, felt so much better that, on. two different days, he performed some voluntary work as a carpenter in the erection of a church. He did not work continuously, but rested when he felt inhas clined, and went home when he was tired. He did not receive a penny payment, but an anonymous letter was sent the department stating that he had been seen working, and his pension was suspended. I made representations on his behalf to the Deputy Commissioner, was informed that if the man had done any work, whether he was paid for it or not, and whether it was continuous or intermittent, he could not be permanently and totally incapacitated, and was not, therefore, entitled to receive a penI t is laid down in the act that a pensioner may not earn any income, but the Minister, apparently overruling the act, if says that pensioners may earn up to a with certain amount. We' know that the Minister has, on previous occasions, overruled, the act, but it is not likely that he will do so in the interests of applicabrought forward by members of the Opposition. If he does, however, it given will merely prove that we are engaged in a farcical proceeding in passing acts of Parliament. If the Government is sincere, it will introduce an amending bill laying it down definitely that a person may earn up to a certain sum, and still be entitled to.an invalid pension.",59
284,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [10.45] - Replyin g to the point raised by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Baker), I desire to state that or I have not given any interpretation of this act in respect of invalid pensions is not in accordance with existing In order that there may be no misapprehension, I shall repeat in terms what I said on a previous an occasion. I said that invalid pensioners inwere permitted to receive nominal payof a few shillings a week for rendering small services. I suggested that might receive 3s., 4s., or 5s. a week, not as payment for regular work, but as payment for this class of interwent to mittent or casual work.",59
285,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Unde r what section of the act may that be done?,60
286,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The honourable member knows that there is no section in the act under which it may be done, but the act has been liberally interpreted in that way. The fact that such an interpretation has been placed upon it in no way mitigates the fact that a claimant for an invalid pension must be totally and permanently incapacitated, and the case quoted by the honourable member for Oxley does not prove that the practice I have referred to is not being followed. It is evident that if a carpenter, mason or a blacksmith is able to work at his trade, even casually, or for a short period, he is not permanently and totally incapacitated. There are, however, many ways in which a man may earn a few shillings a week at intermittent and casual employment in the way of rendering small services without forfeiting his right to a pension. Mr BEASLEV.'-What about applicants who perform their own housework?",60
287,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I should think that such applicants would have proved that they were not permanently and totally i ncapacitated.,60
288,Mr BAKER,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Can the Minister quote any specific case in which the act has been interpreted in the liberal way he speaks of ?,60
289,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"As a private member, 1 knew of more than oue such case, and since I have become a Minister I have become acquainted with others. Several honourable members complained ,of the condition, of the premises in which pensioners are paid at North Eitzroy. This matter was brought up over twelve months ago by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Dennis), and I thought' that the trouble had been remedied. Pensions used to be paid at St. Luke's Hall, and to revert to the use of that building would involve the Commonwealth in considerable extra expense. However, I shall have the matter investigated to see whether conditions are such as to justify that expense. References have been made to the manner in, which Dr Ludowici has carried out his duties as an examining officer in connection with pension applications. I have never met this gentleman, and his name was unfamiliar to me until: to-night; but it is only fair to him to say that, although honourable - members have criticized his decisions in regard to applicants for pensions, there has been no reflection upon him in his professional capacity. The honourable member"" for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) mentioned the case of pensioners who had to leave their homes and reside elsewhere, and he suggested that the act should be amended so that no deduction would be made from their pensions in respect of the houses they a stonevacate. He quoted the case of a man who, because of sickness, had to leave his horne and live in the city. He admitted that the Deputy Commissioner had been liberal in his ruling in that he did not charge the value of the unoccupied premises against the pensioner. This is a matter which has to be left to the discretion of the Commissioner, so long as the property provisions remain in the act; aud an unoccupied home has, as a general rule, to be charged against the pension rate. I imagine that the case mentioned by the honourable member for West Sydney is a typical one.' The honourable member admitted that the Deputy Commissioner had exhibited a liberal spirit by not charging the home against the rate of pension. In the interest of the pensioner, it is much better to leave the matter to the* discretion of Deputy Commissioners, all of whom are humane and reasonable. In respect to the minimum income entitling one to the payment of the maternity allowance, the deduction of the wage tax from the total income is a new point that I undertake to investigate and consider. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) raised the point of proof of age having to be furnished by a claimant for a pension. I draw his attention to the specific provision in the act which reads- . In. respect of the age of the claimant, the magistrate, if otherwise satisfied, may dispense with corroborative evidence. It is thus within the discretion of the examining magistrate to judge a man's age by his features and his general condition. The production of a birth certificate is not insisted on.",60
290,Mr MARTENS,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I shall place beforo the Minister tomorrow correspondence which proves that it is.,61
291,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have quoted from the act to show that corroborative evidence may be dispensed with if the magistrate is otherwise satisfied. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) raised the question of the adequate maintenance of invalid pensioners who live with their parents. In such cases the rate of pensions is based on the circumstances of the parents. If , upon a reasonable computation, £ 1 a week may be attributed to the maintenance of the invalid pensioner, the full rate is paid. If the amount that may be so attributed is 30s. a week, the pensioner receives a half pension. Generally, this is not an unfair method of computation.",61
292,Mr MAKIN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Why not revert to 30s. rate ?,61
293,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Times have changed, and in the circumstances the method of computation is fair.",61
294,Mr WARD,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Is the Minister prepared to consider whether, where no other disqualification exists, an unnaturalized son may be granted a pension and defray the cost of his naturalization out of subsequent payments ? Will he also give to pensioners' associations the right to be represented at inquiries held by the department ?",61
295,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The first request involves an amendment of the act, which is not a matter for discussion on these Estimates. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) complained of delay in the investigation of claims for pensions. Where undue delay, which is not the fault of the claimant, occurs, the Commissioner has discretion to allow a reasonable amount by way of retrospective payment. During the last twelve months the department has been under considerable stress in re-assessing the 250,000 cases of existing pensioners. Though greatly to be regretted, that was unavoidable. Happily, however, that stress is now practically removed, and I assure the honourable member that undue delay will not occur in the future.",61
296,Mr R GREEN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Canno t the payment be made retrospective for the period during which the delay has occurred ?,61
297,Mr CASEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,It has not been the practice to allow retrospective payment to the date of the claim.,61
298,Mr BLAKELEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Darling) [10.58] I support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) that the amount be reduced by £1 as an instruction to the Government to remove from the act certain of the property provisions.

303,Mr BLAKELEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Certain iniquitous provisions, which compel pensioners to per- sign cards, and mortgage their property to the Government, make it no longer a pension.",61
304,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Order ! The honourable member knows that I have ruled many times that the act may not be discussed.,61
305,Mr BLAKELEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Because of this disqualification there is widespread resentment which has been reflected in one of the longest debates on the pensions law that has ever taken place in this Parliament. I desire to briug to the notice of the Minister an anomaly in connection with the consent to sell. Under the act as amended by this Government, a pensioner owning property is f8rced to sign it away. In hundreds of cases pensioners, to ensure that their property shall be passed on to their children, have made special efforts to procure sufficient to refund to the Government amounts paid in pension, since October of last year. In one case that came under my notice recently, a refund having been made, the pensioner anticipated that consent to transfer the property would be given, but to his surprise discovered that it was withheld. When the act was amended by this ' Government, auctioneers, estate agents and others doing this class of busipermitted ness, were advised that they would be liable to all the penalties of the law if they had any part in the transfer of a pensioner's property over which the Crown had a lieD. It has been ruled, in New South Wales courts, at all events, that upon a refund of pension payment being made, the penal provisions of the aet no longer apply, and that, therefore, no consent is necessary for the transfer of property. That, might be good law but it does not satisfy estate agents or auctioneers. The Commissioner of Pensions or the Deputy Commissioners in the various States should make it widely known that where refunds of pension payments have been made, those provisions of-the act dealing with consent to transfer no longer apply. Although this debate has been most protracted, it has been worthwhile in that it has disclosed a number of extraordinary features in administration. For instance, the Assistant Treasurer tonight has made the astounding statement that it is possible for a totally and permanently incapacitated pensioner to earn 3s., 4s. or 5s. a week without having his pension affected. I have been in this Parliament since 1917, and I know from experience that in every case where ,a pensioner was found to be in employment, his pension has been stopped. There has never been any suggestion that pensioners could earn 3s., 4s. or 5s. a week without suffering a reduction of payment. every instance the pension 'has been stopped, and in some cases I have been obliged to make representations for several months before securing its restoradebate tion. It is evident, therefore, that the Government, in its administration of the act, ha§ one policy for members of the Opposition and some of its own supporters, but a different policy for those who are in the ""know"" as to how the act is interpreted. One result of the Minister's statement will be that the Pensions Department will be inundated with applications for a re-instatement of pensions, and probably for increased payments, because of pensions having been withheld in cases where pensioners have been earning a little money. I strongly protest against pensions authorities in some States being Mr Blakeley. to use their discretion in the matter of pensioners' earnings, while the officials in other States are required to administer the act strictly. Altogether the Minister's statement has disclosed an extraordinary position, which hitherto has been kept remarkably secret. Very few members of this Parliament had any knowledge that discretionary power was vested in some of the Deputy Commissioners. The next point to which I wish to refer is the method of computing the cost of living, upon which pension payments are based, namely, on index figures for the six capital cities. I hope the present system will not be retained for long. A change of government will mean that the whole of the iniquitous provisions of the act will be repealed. The present system operates unfairly against pensioners living outside the six iState capitals. In the electorate of Darling, for example, and the same remark would apply to other country electorates, the purchasing power of the pension is probably from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, below that of the capital cities, From time to time. I have made representations to the Minister, pointing out that as climatic and district allowances are paid to Commonwealth and State public servants, and to unionists working under Arbitration Court awards, the same principle should be applied in the payment of pensions.",61
306,The CHAIRMAN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,That subject could more appropriately be discussed In when the promised amending bill is before the committee ,62
307,Mr BLAKELEY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have no desire to it further at this stage, except to say that the present method for the computation of pensions is unsatisfactory, and means a loss to very many pensioners.",62

310,Mr NAIRN,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Perth) [11.19] - The Sales Tax Act provides that returns shall be made and lodged monthly with the Commissioner of Taxationby the 15th day of the following month,, a penalty being provided in the event of default,, the minimum amount being £1. The returns have to be sent to the Commissioner of Taxation, and, in some parts of Australia, if the post is used, it is not possible to furnish them within 21 days of the end of each month. I have received a letter from the Secretary to the Taxpayers. Association of Western Australia, Mr L. E. Horne, stating that the steamers' sailing dates, are often at long intervals at northern ports, and that returns for August last posted on the 1st September at Broome reached the Perth office on the 2nd October, resulting, in a penalty of £1 being imposed. Obviously it is wrong to impose any penalty for failure to comply with 23 the provisions of the act, when compliance is impossible. I suggest that, the Minister ATEB. should accept the date of posting as that on which the returns are submitted. Not only in Western Australia, but also in the Gulf country of Queensland, it must be impossible to. submit returns within 21 days. ^",63

312,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Melbourne Ports) [11.24] - The cost of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is a matter of great importance to the people of Australia, and we are fortunate in the fact that the present Attorney-General (Mr Latham) PAIRS. has been closely associated with industrial arbitration. In January, 1931, under an award of the court, the employees in most of the trades and callings with which the court has dealt suffered a reduction of their wages by 10 per cent. This came about almost automatically, because far too much time would have been occupied by the Court to satisfy the employers in hearing individual plaints. Since that time, almost a complete change of opinion has occurred throughout Australia. The present Government, public bodies and groups of employers, other than those who work under court awards, have at least partially restored the amounts by whioh wages were then reduced. I asked the Attorney General recently to ascertain whether the business of the court was now congested, and whether the claims for the restoration of the former wages were likely to be heard within a reasonable period. At the present time no fewer than 133 cases are listed for hearing, and if these are to be dealt with before the claim for the 10 per cent, restoration, .in inordinately long period must necessarily elapse before decisions are given. It would be unfair to allow judgment in these matters to be further delayed without some effort being made by the Government to assist the court to deal with the cases more speedily. Business people generally are feeling the effects of the continued reduction of the spending power of the workers, and although many employers have expressed a desire to refrain from making any further wage reductions, even small reductions on account of fluctuations in the cost of living, no employer cares to take individual actiou in the inatter because of the keen competition. Several large companies have recently refused to apply for wage reductions rendered possible by reductions of the cost, of living, but large firms or companies, or public bodies like the Sydney City Council, can take the risk of increasing wages unless the restoration is uniformly anolied. Competition makes it almost impossible for private employers generally to depart to any considerable extent from the standard set by the less reputable employers. I suggest that it is fair and reasonable to ask the Attorney General to assist the community in this matter. I recollect that, when discord arose over the subject of uniform working hours, both the employers and the employees thought that the slowness of the court procedure was Mr Holloway. harmful to industry; and on more than one occasion, through the action of the Attorney-General, an award with a general application was made instead of cases having to be heard individually. Since January, 1931, the amounts by which the salaries and wages of public servants, and even the sum by which the parliamentary allowance was reduced, have been partly restored, but no restoration has been made to the great mass of the workersof the 10 per cent, reduction of real wages. One or two odd applications have, been heard, and there has been a partial restoration of the 10 per cent, cut in one or two industries ; but speaking generally, the workers of Australia are still suffering the loss of wages which was inflicted upon them through the general 10 per cent. cut. If special applications have to be made in every industry, the hearing of the cases would extend over many months, and the workers in certain groups of industries would be still suffering after others had been helped back to their old wage level. The hearing and granting of applications piecemeal would cause chaos in industry, and place some employers at an advantage compared - with others. There is. only one sound, economic 'way of doing it. I appeal to the Attorney General ' to do what is necessary to help the court, to deal with a general application for the restoration of the 10 per cent. cut. If the judges need more help, it should be given, and if additional registrars or industrial officers are necessary, they should bo appointed. The court has always been prepared to only accept advice from the Attorney-General of the day on a matter of this kind', and has not regarded the tendering of it as an interference with its functions. On more than one occasion, to my knowledge, the judges have suggested that some other authority - Parliament - shoul d give them a. lead when any new principle of wage adjustment or any vital alteration of conditions has been proposed. It would ""help employers and employees alike if some formula could be applied on a universal basis for the restoration of the 10 per cent, reduction of wages. It will be rcmembei'ed that when the standard of working hours was altered from 48 to 44 some years ago, it was done on a general basis. I could give the names of 20 or 30 firms and public bodies which have expressed the view that it would be in the best interests of the community if wages were restored to their old level. Many people who felt some time ago that the reduction of wages would be efficacious in restoring prosperity to the conntry now doubt the wisdom of that policy, and would gladly revert to the old standards. If the millions of pounds which were subtracted from the general wages fund by the 10 per cent, reduction could be restored, it would have a very marked eifect on commerce and industry, and would give to business that necessary stimulus which is now lacking. Chambers of manufacturers, chambers of commerce, and employers' federations can do nothing of themselves to meet the situation. Action must be taken through the Arbitration Court. If the Attorney General would take the initiative, he would perforin a real public service. An application for a general restoration of the .1.0 per cent, cut was made to the court some time ago, but not granted. I believe that the judges would welcome a proposal from the Attorney-General that the restoration of wages should be on a general basis, just as the cut was on a general basis. The present position in the court is that there are 133 matters awaiting attention. I suppose a year would elapse before all of these could be dealt with.",63
313,Mr LATHAM,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"The x ties are not pressing for the hearing of the matters awaiting attention. The Full Court has sat for only 38 days, and single' judges for only 51 days in the last six months. For their own reasons, the parties concerned in the applications now waiting attention are not pressing their claims; but the great majority of those claims have nothing to do with the 10 per eent. reduction of wages.",65
314,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"There are 30 industrial disputes, 81 applications for variations of awards, 16 applicadone, tions for interpretations of awards, two cases involving alleged breaches of awards, and four appeal cases awaiting attention. The central execuaway tives of the trade, unions have quested the court to deal with the application for the restoration of the 10 per cent, cut on a general basis, and the employers also wish the matter to be dealt with in that way, so that there shall be no unfair competition in industry. To suggest that the'unions do not want their awards reviewed and the 10 per cent, reduction restored is quite wrong; but they desire the court to hear a general case to cover all employees. In these circumstances, I appeal to the Attorney-General to make a suggestion to the court with this object. He has done such a thing before.",65
315,Mr LATHAM,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have not"" done what the honourable member is now suggesting that I should do.",65
316,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"But the right honourable gentlema^ has, on occasions, made a proposal that the court should act in a certain way.",65
317,Mr LATHAM,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I have intervened in an actual case, and would be prepared to do so again, but I shall tell the honourable member presently why I cannot do what he is now asking me to do.",65
318,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I am certain that the court would not regard it as an interference, for I have been present when the 'Chief Judge has stated that he would be glad if a lead were given to the court.",65
319,Mr LATHAM,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"He meant a legislative lead. That was suggested some time ago in connection with a case affecting the ,airailway service.",65
320,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I had in mind the case in which the judge asked for a lead in .connection with the method of arriving at the index figure for determining the basic wage. No objection would be raised if the Attorney-General arranged for a general case to-deal with the restoration of the 10 per cent. There is no other way in which the position can be met, and I , therefore, appeal to the Attorney-General to take steps accordingly. If something of the kind is not the position will never be rectified, because one employer cannot restore the 10 per cent, to his staff unless his competitors do the same. The court took the 10 per cent, in one act, and it reshould restore it in the same way. A few days ago the honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby) referred to the action of Mr Justice Starke in ordering some copper beaters to cease work because the noise they made interfered with the hearing of a case over which he was presiding. The firm concerned realized that the judge was justified in complaining about the noise, but I point out that his action has prevented the firm's employees from working at their legitimate occupation during the hours that the court is sitting. Consequently, they have been put off, and are losing their pay.",65
321,Mr LATHAM,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,I do not think that is the case now.,66
322,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"I hope that the Attorney-General is right; but it is a fact that the men lost time and pay which can never be made up. The firm in question was in business in the locality making divers' suits and vessels of copper long before the court building was erected, and it is not right that it should action. be hampered because the proceedings of a court which was set up many years later are interfered with. It would appear that the firm and its employees are to be penalized because the court is not equipped with proper facilities for excluding noise. If there is nothing in the Estimates to provide those facilities, provision should be made accordingly. [Quorum formed.]",66
323,Mr LATHAM,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.49] - I shall deal first with the second point raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway), namely, the incident which took place when His Honour Mr Justice Starke requested, and, indeed, directed, that a certain noise which was interfering with the hearing of a rather intricate case should cease. I am, of course, well acquainted with the locality. I know the works in question. High Court and the' Supreme Court are close to the works. The honourable member has rightly said that these works have been there for some 50 years, and I think that I am correct in saying that this the first occasion on which they have terfered with the conduct of the business in the courts. Apparently, the interfor ference arose because of the manufacture of two particularly large vacuum pans, and the hammering upon them caused far-reaching reverberations. I do not think that any apprehension need be felt as to this happening again, and it is only the particular circumstances which caused the difficulty. The work on these two vacuum pans will now be able to proceed without interference because the High Court is sitting in Sydney. In the past, on occasions, noises have interfered with the judicial tribunals. For example, when the notorious Deeming was being tried in the Supreme Court of Melbourne, the presiding judge had to stop certain noises which were interfering with the hearing of the case of a man on trial for his life. That occurred, I think, early in the 'nineties. I have been closely associated with all the courts since the beginning of this century, and I know of no other occasion on which it has been necessary for a judge to take similar The honourable member suggested that the Attorney^Geuicral had some power which he could properly exercise for the purpose of bringing about an early hearing of a claim for the restoration of the reduction of wages of 10 per cent, made in January, 1981, which still generally obtains, although it has been restored in a limited number of special cases. I do not intend to discuss the question of the desirability or otherwise of making that restoration, because that will be one of the most important matters for decision by the court; but I certainly agree with the honourable member'that it would be a good tiling if the restoration could be made. That, however, would depend upon various conditions. The honourable member has heard in this House claims from practically every rural industry, except the wool industry, for some sort of assistance or relief. The conThe ditions, therefore, of the whole community have to bekept in mind in connection with any such application. The honourable member suggested that I , as Attorney-General, could do someis thing to expedite the hearing, but it inis quite impossible for me to do that. As a matter of fact certain applications restoration of reductions have already been refused, although a few have been granted; and the court has intimated that, as it understands further applications are to be made, it will hear them early in the new year. Up to the present no such applications have been made. That is the position. There is, therefore, nothing in relation to which the Attorney-General can conceivably act until the applications are made. Another point taken by the honourable member was that there have been occasions in the past on which, as Attorney-General, I have intervened under a section which I myself drafted and had inserted in the Arbitration Act for the purpose of bringing about the hearing of a general question affecting the basic wage or standard hours. That section, was enacted with the idea of making possible the discussion at one general heaving of a question affecting many industries. The effect of the intervention of the Attorney General was not that the Attorney General would appear and argue the case, but that upon his intervention a notification would be inserted in the Gazette, and anybody interested might apply and obtain the right to be heard. I thought, as I still think, that that was a useful and valuable provision in the act. Unfortunately, however, last year the Railways Branch of the Australian ""Workers Union, in a caso affecting the railway workers at Fori Augusta, raised the point that this legislation was ineffective. The union was successful in its argument, and the result was that it obtained a decision from the High Court which almost entirely deprived this legislation of its efficacy.",66
324,Mr HOCLOWAT,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"'Che Attorney General, himself, made the law state .that only three judges could alter the basic wage, whereas one judge had altered it in the railways case. Mr LATHAM! - I have no wish to enter into an argument on difficult legal technicalities. As the result of the High Court decision, now, as the legislation stands, every dispute which involves an alteration of the basic wage, either up or down, by one penny must be heard hy three judges, and that, I venture to say, is unnecessary, and was not the real desire of the union which took this point in the particular case. I have been con[161 ] sidering the matter, but have not yet found a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. Another result of the reference of the railways case to the High Court is that the High Court has laid down what I always suspected it might decide-that every decision given by the Arbitration Court must be a decision in relation to a particular dispute. The only jurisdiction of the court is to determine particular disputes, and to make awards or register agreements in relation to them. It cannot lay down a general rule to be applied by the single judges of the court, and accordingly a single hearing of a general question applicable to all cases is not possible under the sections of the act.",67
325,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,Unles s there is a dispute.,67
326,Mr LATHAM,REPETITI ON OE SIMILAR,"There has to be a separate hearing for each dispute. I am considering whether it is possible to devise, even under the existing law, some moans of meeting the position, in order to prevent the hearing of the same point in quite a number of separate cases. The practical difficulty is, of course, that one union or group of employers may refuse to be bound by something which does not legally bind it, and may threaten to argue the question again. By consent the parties can agree that one argument will suffice for a number of cases; but if they insist, upon their individual right to be beard, considerable difficulty may arise in the future. I have been interviewed on this matter by representatives of trade unions, and I asked them some months ago to make suggestions for the solution of the problems to whioh I have referred. Although I have not received any suggestions from them, I have not abandoned hope, arid I am trustful of finding some way out of the difficulty. Progress reported. PAPERS.
