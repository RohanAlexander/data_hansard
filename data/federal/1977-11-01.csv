Business College graduates are exactly what the market wants and employers demand. In one of the few fields of employment shown by the repon to be under-supplied, the Government is effectively reducing the ability of business colleges to train enough secretaries and stenographers for the positions which are available. The sixteen technical colleges in the Metropolitan area of Sydney which accommodate 3,220 students in day secretarial studies do not have the capacity to accommodate more than 6 per cent of the 2,433 students at non-State ness colleges in the same area who will be disadvantaged by the Government's recent decision to withdraw fees subsidies and living allowances from the end of 1977. 1977 School leavers who wish to undertake a course Secretarial Studies and thus ensure they obtain a worthwhile position of employment on graduation are being pay fees of the order of $ 1,400 for the year and TEAS living allowances. The Government's decision is unfair, unjust, discriminatcasting ory, unreasonable and capricious. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will act immediately to undertake a thorough review of the position of non-State business colleges, guarantee interim funding forthwith and reverse its decision.

Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient contribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of the telephone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on and are forced to pay highrents,are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. contributing to the health haz2.

The honourable gentleman is entitled to move that a petition be printed if he indicates a course of action which he intends to take. He has indicated a course of action which is not covered by the Standing Orders and therefore is not open to him at this time.

36,Mr UREN,BUDGET DEFICIT,"I direct my question to the course Treasurer. Is it a fact that the deficit for financial year is now estimated to be in excess of $2,500m, which amounts to an increase of $300m over the figure presented in the Budget? Does this mean that the Government has sed its pohcy on reducing the deficit to control inflation? Further, how does the Treasurer reconcile a lowering of interest rates with a need to finance the increase in the size of the deficit?",19
37,Mr LYNCH,BUDGET DEFICIT,"The Government's policy on such public debate? interest rates is well known to this House have reaffirmed that pohcy on a number occasions recently. I have said to the honourable gentleman that, consistent with the Budget stateone ments and in particular with Statement No. 2, it is the Government's intention to see the lowering tion of interest rates during the course of this year. The honourable gentleman will see in Statement Austraha No. 2 reference to the expectation of a lesser deGovernment mand by the corporate sector for funds from the able member would general capital markets of Australia. remind the honourable gentleman of the fact the United Kingdom, which also that he seeks conveniently to overlook, that the Government. I think some of Dr recent consumer price index increase of 2 per cent has given very real encouragement, in the Government'sfightagainst inflauon, investors, particularly to those operating in the market place. As a consequence of that the honourable gendeman ought to be aware of the friends fact that there has also been a very significant uranium reduction in the bond rates at both the long end. I recited thefiguresto the honourable gentleman previously. If he is interested, during the course of this day when thefinancialmarkets closed, I will give him thefigureswhich will erate. I do not want to say any more than that the honourable gentleman on that point. So far as the Government's Budget concerned, I invite the honourable gentleman to look at page 26 of Budget Paper No. 2 in which he wtil see the target which has been set down the Government. If the honourable gentleman concerned with what he might see as some extenmake sion of the Budget deficit, I invite him to back to the same period in 1975 when the then Treasurer, whom I regard as having been discredited by his performance in this sense, brought down a Budget deficit of $2.8 bUlion, I recaU thefigure.Towards the end of that year, certainly by December of that year, the figure had been blown out to $4.5 bilUon. If there is one thing this Government can say as a matter of record, looking back to the past year, it is that it has a capacity to adopt afinancialdiscipline and to adhere to thatfinancialdiscipline over the of the year. I think that answers patently this what the honourable gentleman is seeking. NA rever Mr CALDER-My question is addressed to the Minister for National Resources. I ask: In view of the strong caUs for wide public debate on the mining and sale of uranium, can the Minister inform the House of recent progress regarding and I Mr ANTHONY-Considerabl e discussion has of been proceeding and some very interesting remarks have been made in recent days. I think of the most interesting remarks was the reacthe of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to comments made by Dr Mabon, who was into have talks with me, with the industry. I and with people from the uranium should have thought that the honourvalue the viewpoint of Secondly, I another country, particularly country such as has a Labor Mabon's remarks are very pertinent to the international situation as it exists today. On AM the other to outside morning he said: What I am trying to say, particularly to our trade union in Australia, is that they really must understand that for us is extremely cnticalforthe well-being of the short and working people in Great Britain. I think that is a factual statement. Britain today generates 11 per cent of its power from nuclear sources. It was thefirstcountry in the world to are embark on a nuclear power program. It has opdeveloped to be the second largest proportional to producer of electric power in the world-secon d only to Switzerland. I think the remarks made by an eminent British Minister, such as Dr Mabon, deficit is should be considered seriously. It is interesting to see the remarks of the Presiby dent of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Hawke, is who said that, whilst Dr Mabon had arightto comments to the Government, he should think not be making these comments pubUcly. I ask you, Mr Speaker! I should have thought that the pleas by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition' and other Labor supporters for pubhc debate aswould mean people making public statements rather than Uttle private statements to the Government. This is where the Labor Party is in a confused, contrary situation so far as uranium is concerned. Might I add also that Dr Mabon was in express Australia to talk very seriously about a long uranium contract with the United Kingdom. He think so. was canvassing the possibility of a contract from 1982 to 1995 for one thousand tonnes of uranium a year, worth $ 1,200m to Australia. This contract, of course, would guarantee to the United Kingdom during that period the supply of uranium so that the British Government can help the working people of England to remain employed. To Austraha it means added income that wm maintain the Uving standards of this country. If the Labor Party wants to disown contract that this Government might enter into with the United Kingdom to help it maintain its economic stabUity, it is up to the Labor Party teU the Austrahan people during the election campaign that it will disown such a contract. NA NA",19
38,Mr JAMES,MATERIAL,"My question is directed to Minister for Post and Telecommunications. The Minister will recaU that on the Australian Broadlicity casting Commission news this morning he stated that laws banning the broadcasting of election material on television and radio for two days before a Federal election were outdated and outmoded. The Minister also said that the sed Government could not amend the statute before the Parliament is dissolved. I ask the Minister: As the Government has on two occasions been able to effect major amendments to industrial relaBoth tions legislation within 24 hours of their introduction to the House, why cannot the same haste and zeal be appUed to this outmoded outdated legislation?",20
39,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,MATERIAL,"What was said on to the ABC news this morning was part of an of answer I gave to a question which came from conference that I attended in Surfer's Paradise yesterday when one of the delegates asked me about that matter. I said, as I repeat to the honourable member, that the Australian Broadter, casting Tribunal report, which we got a couple months ago, has made recommendations to deseveral lete the present relevant provisions in the Act. have also made it quite clear to the House that the Tribunal's report has not been studied by Government. In fact, I gave first of all to the of September and then to the end of October people to express their views to the Government. I went on to say that when I had considered submissions to me and the report I would make recommendations to the Government and if there was to be a change in that Act, obviously it would be a decision for the Government. I did the personal point of view that I thought termthe law was outdated and outmoded and I still URANIUM EXPORTS: TALKS WITH NA",20
40,Mr COTTER,BRITISH DELEGATION,"I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the Minister inform the House whether any progress has been made in talks with the British delegation led by the British Minister of State in the Department of a Energy, Dr Mabon, in regard to the supply of uramum? Were those talks affected by the outburst from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to attacking the Leader of the British delegation?  a personal view about standing here at this particular time. I am dealing with a very serious matter. The honourable member has asked a question regarding talks which occurred last the week between officials accompanying Dr Mabon, who has received a fair degree of pubover the course of the last few days, and Austrahan officials about the preparation of bilateral safeguards agreements between the two countries. Tne British officials were, of course, fully apprised of Australia's poUcy and exprestheir undemanding of it. It is anticipated, by both sides I think, that there should be no particular difficulties in the successful conclusion of the negotiations, which wiU continue next month. sides agree that it should be possible to reach an initial agreement before Christmas of this year. That is in answer to thefirstpart of the and question that has been posed. In regard to the second part of the question as whether the statement of the Deputy Leader the Opposition had any effect on those talks, I a would bluntly say no. The people involved are fully apprised of Britain's needs and of Australia's pohcy and the statement made by Dr Mabon, referred to by the Deputy Prime Minisand the response from the Deputy Leader of of the Opposition are in my view very significant in respects. First, Dr Mabon's statement. I made clear what is deUberately being obscured by Labor in this country-that the question of the the export of uranium need not be and should not be end reduced to a party poltiical or ideological issue. for The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should realise, as some ofhis coUeagues clearly do, that the issue is the survival of the energy dependent Western societies. May I recall just two statements made not by conservative politicians but by well known British unionists. First, the General Secretary of the Electronics Union in Britain, in supporting the development of Britain's nuclear energy industry last month, said that death from starvation, cold and wars of conquest would be the fate of the world if energy supplies ran out. If that is not good enough, honourable members should check with Joe Gormley, the British miners' leader, who added that an anti-nuclear energy motion would 'send us back to the jungle'. Quite frankly, the perspective of men Uke these, men who need no lectures from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on Labor principles, is light years away from that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who tries to reduce uranium merely to an election issue. Those men are unlikely to be impressed by his rantings. The second point of substance is that Dr Mabon's statement is a salutory reminder of how supine-let me put it bluntly-and how gutless the leadership of the Australian Labor Party is. Where were the viewpoints of Mr Hawke, Mr Whidam and Mr Hayden at the time of the ALP Federal Conference? They are the people who allegedly recognised the overwhelming strength of the case for exporting uranium. Where have they been lately on this issue? They have washed their hands of the matter. Why they cannot show the courage of their British counterparts and let Australia meet its international obligations in responding to a world energy problem and developing a major industry will be tested by the Australian people. The third point I make is that the outburst of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is the clearest evidence that nothing has changed. Between 1972 and 1975 the leaders of the Labor Government developed the gratuitous insulting of friendly governments into a major art form. For example 'bash a Yank a day' was their pretty familiar slogan. That slogan was used by the Australian Financial Review in describing them. It was not just the Americans who were subjected to this treatment. Now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is showing us that he is in serious training to give a repeat performance, but he will not get the opportunity. In summary, it is clear that the Labor Party's approach is not based on moraUty or principle; it is based merely on an ideological opportunism of the worse kind. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Foreign Minister a question which concerns the legislative program for the rest of this session. Why does the program not include legislation to close the Rhodesia Information Centre in accordance with the undertaking by Australia's delegate to the United Nations last May that such legislation would be passed in the session commencing last August? I point out that the Labor Party would facilitate die passage of legislation to honour Australia's obligations to the United Nations. I also ask: Has the Australian Embassy in South Africa been given or has it sought instructions on the attitude that it should express, as our British and other counterparts have already expressed, towards the repressive actions taken by the minority government of South Africa against newspapers and journaUsts and critics of apartheid? If so, have the instructions been given and carried out?  that was in draft form and which I hoped to put to the Parliament and to inform the Security Council of. But I sent it back. Frankly I thought it was too dragnet in its approach. I have consistently said on this matter that Australia will meet its international obligations as determined by the Security Council, but in meeting those obligations I will not trample over the rights of individual Australians to participate in political matters and express a particular view about Rhodesia. If honourable members opposite want it bluntly, as far as I am concerned in meeting that obUgation I will not jeopardise therightsof those people one iota. I wtil meet those obligations and I will repeat in the Security Council that Australia wtil meet its obhgations.",20

42,Mr SPEAKER,RHODESIA INFORMATION CENTRE,"Order! The Minister wtil not address members individuaUy. He will speak through the Chair.  be able to look at Opposition members and think of them as speaking with one voice. I feU into that trap on this occasion. The Government will execute its international obligations on this issue. Let there be no mistake about that. But it will be done to meet the requirements of the Security Council without jeopardising the rights of any Australian. I have always made that perfectly clear. If there were time to introduce legislation before the end of the week, well and good. But as I sent back the draft legislation because I thought it was too wide in ambit, it would appear to me that we will not be able to introduce the lation during this period of the parUamentary sittings. We will be able to do it in the new will be legislation,firstly,that discharges our in order. ternational obhgations and, secondly, that protects the rights of Australians to put forward views whether or not they are in contrast with the views of the Government. In regard to the repressions in South Africa, uranium the Australian Government's views are well year? known. Whether it be in regard to the closure of newspapers or other repressive measures plore them. We have indicated this over lengthy period. We did it in relation to the death of Steve Biko. I recall the honourable member for Adelaide criticising the Government for not expressing views on that matter but, in fact, we know did express them in the United Nations, and of mining course we were represented at the service.

43,Mr BRYANT,RESERVE BANK,"I address a question to the that Treasurer. In the course of his answer to a queswas tion from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Treasurer said that outside investors actually are operating in the market place. Who are the outside investors? What are their operations? To which market place is he referring and how does it operate? Can he put his answers in EngUsh?",22

I mean of course, as indicated to the House during the course of cent days, that the Reserve Bank engages in open market operation. I would have thought that what the Reserve Bank has been doing in the market place is a matter of public record. It has been clearly reported in all the financial newspapers dunng the course of the week. The honourable gentleman ought to normal transactions that take place in open market operations and in which the Bank itself has been exercising certain moves, after consultation with the Government. All I say to the honourable gentleman- I am uncertain as to the particular reasons he is querying this matter-is that should note the faa that there has been the most significant fall in interest rates at both the and the long end for a period of four years. would have thought that the honourable gentlethe man and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to be thefirstto applaud the fact that cause of the reasons, some of which I gave the House today, interest rates have been the subject of a significant fall.",22

46,Mr HODGES,RESERVE BANK,"Can the Prime Minister tell the House about the attitudes to Australia's government poUcy expressed to him by heads of during his visit to Europe earlier this we de Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Head s of governa ment in Europe, the United Kingdom, Germany and other countries expressed a keen interest in suppUes of Australia's uranium. They wanted to when the Government would make firm and final decisions concerning the continued and export of Australian uranium. Prime Minister Callaghan, in particular, Mr Wedgwood Benn and I held lengthy discussions concerning British requirements. The mission has just been to Australia, led by Dr Mabon, as a direct consequence of those discussions. They need energy to supply the needs of their factories and to supply the needs of their people. This is a very important matter indeed. I believe that my colleagues have very amply shown the importance of these issues this morning. At the highest level in the United Kingdom and in Europe, Australia's energy suppUes are needed for peaceful purposes. If the Austrahan people I were to take it upon themselves as a resource nch recountry in many different things to say that we an were going to deny energy to another country such as Britain, which would fulfil aU the safeguards in the most scrupulous way, and thus, in part, be responsible for its factories grinding to a halt, that would be a position that I believe the great majority of Australian people would not understand the want to entertain. It is a very important issue indeed and it is one which Dr Mabon has emphasised. It is only a tragedy that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has tried to involve Dr Mabon in domestic he politics in Australia when his comments were made from the heart and from a British national short interest. Apparently the Deputy Leader of the I Opposition thought that Dr Mabon's loyalty to Australian Labor Party should be greater than his loyalty to the working people of the beUnited Kingdom. That is a very odd concept indeed for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to suggest to a senior and significant British Minister. These are important matters. They have been dealt with by this Government carefully, scruputween lously and with the highest regard for Austraha's national interest. When we recall, as my colleague the Foreign Minister did, the circumposition. stances in which the Leader of the Opposition and, as I understand it, Mr Hayden and Mr ment. Hawke did not speak in the uranium debate durprinciples ing the Perth conference, how seriously can take their attitude to be? It is founded on poltiical motives and nothing else. NA",22
47,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN ENCEPHALITIS,Can the Minister for Health inform the House of the action the Government is taking to control Australian encephaUtis?,23
48,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN ENCEPHALITIS,"The honourable member for the MaUee, as well as the honourable members Murray, Angas and Riverina, have been very interested in this problem for sometimebecause of the serious threat that encephalitis has imposed on the Murray Valley region. They would have been pleased to learn that in this year's Budget a further $ 100,000 was set aside be spent in association with the State Governnews ments on a dollar for dollar basis to control spread of encephaUtis in the Murray Valley. The Government, of course, will be spending that amount of money in association with the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Austraha. In November-December, a total of officials from the various health departments wtil be meeting in MUdura to draw up a further ing. longer term program which wtil include mosthe quito abatement procedures. I am confident, indeed my Department is confident, that the likely measures that have been taken wtil control encephalitis problem that has been causing some worry and concern in the Murray Valley. Beonly cause of those measures we are quite certain that this program will overcome the serious threat the tourist industry and to the health of the people who live in the region. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-When did the Foreign Minister receive the Rhodesia Information Centre legislation? When did he send it back? Have specific objections been expressed by Australia, as they have by other Western tries, to the latest repressive measures taken by the minority government in South Africa last month? Has the Australian Embassy in South Africa sought instructions on that issue?  me, and I doubt that I would be inclined to give them in any case, because this is a matter be the officials and myself. The nature of legislation, which is in draft form only at this stage, should not concern the Leader of the OpIt is up to the Government to determine the legislation that is introduced into the ParUaWhen such legislation is in draft form or its are before me, that is a matter for my we judgment. But I can assure the Leader of the base Opposition that these matters have been discussed in some detail. I think the last discussion would have, taken place early last week, although I do not want to be held to that. That is the situation as I recall it at the present moment. As regards the other matters raised by the honourable gentleman, I have said already that measures that the South African Government for has taken have filled us with regret. They include, as I recall, the banning of about 18 organisations, some of which are well known internationally and whose representatives have been highly regarded for their moderate views on South Africa. I have said when interviewed on toa number of occasions that we have received the of repressive measures with profound the regret. We have fully shared the serious concern expressed by the international community at this most recent turn of events in that country. Lest there be any misapprehension in the 57 mind of the Leader of the Opposition, let me remind him of the sorts of things I have been sayFar from deterring opposition to apartheid, denial of basic humanrightsand Press freeand dom, which such measures represent, they are to have the opposite effect. Whilst silencing the moderate opinion, in our view they will strengthen the hands of the extremists. This can Umit the possibility of dialogue as the only satisfactory means of solving South Africa's polto itical problems. Matters such as these, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, are before the United Nations. Depending upon the way in which they come forward as resolutions, we will be expressing further views.

49,Mr BROWN,INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the rate of inflation in Australia been reduced in the last 21 months? If so, by counwhat degree has it been reduced?",23
50,Mr WILLIS,INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT,Prove it.,23
51,Mr BROWN,INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"I am not an economist like the honourable member. Has the Treasurer seen reports that unemployment in Australia has in fact increased in the last 21 months? Are those reports accurate""? What is the Treasurer's prognosis of the extent of unemployment and the prospects for the opening up of new job opportunities?",23
52,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"The September increase of 2 per cent in the consumer price index gives the very clearly indeed to all of the practised misrepresentation which have been made recently by the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable gentleman was quoted recently on a major television program as saying that inflation has gone down in all the other Western countries, scarcely at all in Australia; secondly, that unemployment has certainly gone down in every other Western country without exception, and in Austraha it has gone up by 32 per cent. These statements are absolutely wrong. They demonstrate the honourable gentleman's intenhave tion of mounting an election campaign based falsehood and outright misrepresentation. I quoted what the honourable gentleman said in relation to unemployment going down in every other Western country without exception, and in Austraha going up by 32 per cent. The fact is that since December 1975 unemployment has increased in all but six of the 24 countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The rate of unemployment in Australia has not increased by 32 per cent during that period. actual number of individuals registered as unemimplications ployed in December 1975 was 328,700, or 500 more than in September of this year. The figure for September of this year was 328,200, or 8 per cent more than for the same month of 1975. What I am saying in quite clear terms is that honourable gentleman's statement was an stand outright he.",24
53,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! The right honourable gentleman will withdraw that remark.,24
54,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"I withdraw it. Let me say that whether the statement by the Leader of the Opposition was utterly inaccurate and a complete distortion. I point out to the House that between the tember 1976 quarter and the September 1977 quarter consumer prices in this country rose at annual rate of about 9 per cent. This increase broadly matches the average of our major tradnants ing partners during the same period. Our undersite lying rate of increase in consumer prices between the December 1975 quarter and the December of 1976 quarter was some two to three percentage points higher than that of our major trading partners. During the previous year, under the Labor Government, the gap was some six seven percentage points. In other words, contrary to what the honourable gentleman has sought to assert in other places- I mentioned the misrepresentation and absolute distortion in those statements-Australia' s performance in relation to the economy, under the present he Government, has been most significant by interassertions and national standards.

55,Mr SCHOLES,IDENTIFICATION OF VIRUS,"Did the Minister for Primary Industry announce on 28 October that a virus similar to blue tongue had been found in Australian insects? Was it necessary to send samples overseas to obtain final identification of the actual virus? What action has the Australian Agricultural Council decided to take as a result of the Minister's request on Friday? Finally, any countries outside Australia taken any on action in respect of this discovery?",24
56,Mr SINCLAIR,IDENTIFICATION OF VIRUS,"The virus that has been found is similar to blue tongue. At this stage it has not been found in Uvestock or in any other animals. It was isolated in a sampling of some 250,000 insects taken from about the middle of 1974 to about the middle of 1976.I am told that in that sampling quite a number of diseases and viruses were found, some of which might well contain a threat to the livestock industries of Australia and others of which may not. At this The stage, in order to identify exactly what the are, a number of blood tests are to be taken in the area from which this sampling took place; but there is no suggestion that in any way the disease is present in Australian livestock. the With respect to action being taken, I underthat discussions have been under way with a number of countries. Indeed, the isolation of this virus was done in a laboratory in the United States of America. Another laboratory in South Africa is examining the virus to deterrnine the extent to which it is akin to blue tongue and there is a threat of it spreading the disease in Australia. In order to ensure that there is no threat to Austraha's export industries, I have Seprecommended to the Australian Agricultural Council-to date I have not received a response an from all Ministers-that restrictions be placed on the movement of cattle, buffalo and other rumifor 50 mUes around the Northern Territory where the virus was isolated. The insects sampled in March 1975 were sent abroad as part the overall survey at that time. There has been no recorded presence of the disease despite the fact that the virus was found nearly 2Vi years ago. In those circumstances I think the matter to needs to be placed in perspective. Beyond all else, identification of this plaint illustrates a very high degree of consciousincrease ness in the general health services of Austraha. We certainly hope that it proves to be present only in insects and not in hvestock, but no risks will be taken. After further tests have been ducted, if necessary I will make a further statecision ment upon the matter. At this stage no action been taken on any export of hvestock from Austraha, although some discussions are under way with New Zealand about whether there might be some temporary suspension of move the ment of Uvestock from Australia to that country.

57,Mr YATES,VICTORIAN POWER DISPUTE,"I put my question to the Minister for Employment and industrial Relations. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to statetorian ments made during the serious State Commission strike in the Latrobe VaUey, when thousands of people in my own electorate were out of work, that his Department did nothing assist the ConciUation and Arbitration mission and did not assist in solving the dispute in any way at aU? Will the Minister kindly tell House what action the Government took to assist in this most serious dispute which gravely deUberately affected all the workers in my area and in many other electorates?",25
58,Mr STREET,VICTORIAN POWER DISPUTE,"It has been drawn tion that comments of the kind the honourable gentleman mentioned were made by the Leader of the Opposition in a recent interview, I think, on This Day Tonight. I must admit that I have been astounded by those comments. When the Arbitration Commission sat as a reference bench early in October-honourabl e members will remember that that was after proceedings before Mr Commissioner Vosti had failed to produce settlement-the Commonwealth Government intervened before the FuU Bench, as I emphasise was its right, and participated in the proceedings there. A considerable part of those proceedings of course was in private conference between the State Electricity Commission and the unions cerned. The Commonwealth, as an intervener, was not admitted to those proceedings. The statement of this Bench did not produce a return to work. Then an anomaUes conference was conhim vened. I am pleased to inform the House and honourable member that the Commonwealth before 10 December. Government was represented at all stages of the anomaUes conference and supported the Victorian Government in its submissions that no anomaly existed. Arising out of this conference, the matter then sent to a FuU Bench of the Commission to comexamine in detail the union grounds for a wage based on the situation involving possible anomaUes within the SEC pay structure itself. Again the Commonwealth intervened, as ofright,and made submissions to the Full Bench conin support of the Victorian Government. The deof this Bench was that no wage increases has were warranted on the grounds which the unions had put forward. At a subsequent stage the dispute was referred by the President of the Commission to Commissioner Mansini to investigate prospects of a work value case. I am pleased to inform the House that the Commonwealth has sought leave and has been granted leave to intervene in these proceedings which are still in progress. Incidentally, at one stage of these proceedings the Commonwealth supported the VicGovernment's application for a reference Electricity bench to be reconvened. The most charitable view which can be taken of the comments by the Leader of the Opposition to is that he did not know what he was talking Comabout and had not bothered to find out. An alternative explanation is that he had bothered the tofindout but had suffered a remarkable lapse of memory. Yet another explanation is that he tried to present false information to the pubhc. As there were other examples of that in the interview, I think that is probably the most to my attenUkely explanation. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I direct a question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Bearing in mind the Cabinet decision of which I have previouslyremindedhim that questions should, except in special cases, be answered within a month, I ask the Minister why a he has not yet answered the score of questions which have been on the Notice Paper for some seven weeks in each House and which seek the number of persons registered as unemployed at various Commonwealth Employment Offices at the end of August 1975, August 1976 and August con1977. The Minister will, I hope, have noticed that over a score of similar questions concerning unemployment at the end of the last three Septembers have also been on the Notice Paper for for several weeks in both Houses. I also ask the on what dates the CESfigureswill be published",25
59,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"In relation to the first part of the question, that is, the number of persons unemployed as registered at each Commonwealth Employment Office, it is my recollection- I will was check this after Question Time-that I answered that since the interim Norgard recommendations had been accepted and more equipment was Austraha available in employment offices for copying records and things of that kind, honourable members who wanted information relating to particular offices should ask those offices details required. A great deal oftimeis involved in my Department if the information has to come back to central office and then be collated to put into answers to questions. As I say, I shall check the accuracy of that information after Question Time. With regard to the date for the December. pubUcation of CESfigureson employment, as usual they will come out on the Friday following the Friday nearest the end of the month. NA",25
60,Mr CARIGE,AUSTRALIAN ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY,Is the Minister for National Resources aware that Comalco has let a $lm contract for clearing and levelling of the site the company's proposed alumina smelter Boyne Island near Gladstone? I further ask the Minister What are the prospects for the Gladstone alumina smelter and other projects Australian alumina industry?,26
61,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY,"I understand that work has commenced on the clearing and levelling of the site for a proposed alumina smelter at Gladstone. It has been the Government's wish for a long time to be able to attract a major smelter works to Gladstone. The honourable member will recall that several years ago the Government inPrimary volved itself in providing the bulk of the funds for the big power station at Gladstone and hoped that it could interest Comalco Ltd. Comalco had the option of taking part of the power from that station at an attractive that it could compete with overseas smelters. I am now led to believe that early next year Primary Comalco wtil be making a decision 320,000-tonne alumina smelter there, costing annual report ofAct some $300m and providing about 700 jobs for ation for the year ended people in Gladstone. I think that all of us welcome these sorts of decisions which are giving more job opportunities to Australians. But one has to recognise that between now and the beginning of next year a decision will made to determine who will govern this country for the next three years. I think that a decision return a Liberal-National Country Party governCouncil ment would more or less make it conclusive that such a smelter would be constructed at Gladstone, whereas any other decision, which I believe is most unlikely to be made, would put a of doubts and fears in the minds of people have such very large contracts to consider. I am also pleased to say that Comalco has tended its Bell Bay smelter, and currently Alcan Ltd is expanding by half its Kurri Kurri plant at a cost of about $45m. In addition, at Weipa in north Queensland Comalco is undertaking an expansion costing about $80m. Both for theAlcoa of Australia Ltd and Alwest have prospects for a further expansion in Western Australia. So aU round the prospects for substanbe tial increases in aluminium production are attractive but, I suppose, the final decisions will depend on the outcome of the election on 10 NA INTER-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS",26

74,Mr WENTWORTH,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE," Mr I wish to raise a point of order arising from the Votes and Proceedings No. 56 of the House of last Thursday. The matter concerned is trivial in itself but the precedent it establishes is not trivial. It relates to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. You will be familiar the fact that Standing Order 399 is very specific. The Standing Orders are for the protection of aU members of this House and it is important that they be followed. Standing Order 399 In cases of necessity, any standing or sessional order or become moved ofandtheseconded, House may be suspended, on motion, duly without notice: Provided that such is carried by an absolute majority of Members havLibrary ing full voting rights. It is very important that these formalities be observed. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to and page 374 of the Votes and Proceedings pubUthe cation. You will see that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders was not seconded. perhaps, is a matter of form but it is a matter of very considerable consequence. To allow the integrity of this vital Standing Order to be impeached by precedent would be neghgent. Furthermore, if you look at the Votes and Proceedings and also at page 2557 of Hansard, of last Thursday you will see that the motion was not carried in the proper way by an absolute maIt was said that it could be done by leave because there was only one voice in opposition. If this be so and if this be a precedent, things can be done by leave of the House and members' rights can be taken away by a smaU minority to who may be in the House at the time. Mr you will know that very often there are half a dozen people in the House. This precedent must not be allowed to stand. It is no use saying that at the subsequent division the requisite number of members were in the House. I What happened in the subsequent division is not necessarily evidence. In a matter Uke this the of the House should be most scrupulously complied with. I ask you not, perhaps, to rule on this matter immediately because I know you would like to consider it, look at the documents and perhaps speak to the Clerk in regard to it, to make it clear, in the interests of all members of this House that, when Standing Orders are suspended, the proper forms must be compresent plied with.

80,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, the final report of the Committee dealing the with alcohol problems of Aboriginals, together with extracts of the minutes of proceedings. copies have been placed m the Table was Office and the ParUamentary Library. Additional copies will be avaUable for general distribution on that in the near future. Ordered that the report be printed. On that Mr RUDDOCK-by leave-Jus t over a year of ago I tabled an interim report in which the Comin future. As I mittee stated: is the greatest present threat to the Aboriginals of Nonhem Territory and unless strong immediate action is what taken they could destroy themselves. will During visi^ to the mainland States, it became apparent that alcohol abuse among Aboriginals is just as devastating in some areas of those States as in part of the Northern Territory. Of I major concern to the Committee is the devastation caused by alcohol in some traditional comwhere the whole community is vulnerable. Evidence was given that in some communities more than half the total expenditure by the community is on alcohol compared with about 6 per cent for Australia as a whole. The Committee the found that in metropoUtan areas and country towns drinking patterns of Aboriginals are related to those of non-Aboriginals of similar an socio-economic groups or where they have been in my integrated into the general community. However, as a higher percentage of Aboriginals are in with the lower socio-economic group in metropoUtan areas and country towns, the serious nature of the Aboriginal drinking in these areas is apparent. The report outlines the devastating impact of alcohol in some communities, including serious and injuries, accidents, fighting, neglect of family, promiscuity and the breakdown of traditional Aboriginal authority. Many deaths have been alcohol-related. After 18 months of detailed investigations and discussions with Aboriginal communities the Committee has concluded that there is no immediate solution to Aboriginal alcohol problems. It has, however, made a number of recommendations aimed at prevention and treatment. The Committee stresses that emphasis should be placed on prevention. The report discusses and makes recomd mendations on the many and varied psychosocial and environmental factors leading to excessive use of alcohol by Aboriginals. The Committee strongly supports initiatives already taken by Aboriginals and decisions made by communities themselves such as the prohibition of alcohol, the rationing of alcohol or the estabUshment of beer canteens. These steps, I however, have not been completely successful because of 'binge' drinking arising from sly grog and drinking at towns and nearby oudets. movement to traditional land has in some cases led to a reduction in alcohol problems. The Comthat mittee is also encouraged by the positive conpassed tribution being made by Aborigmal organisreport, little ations such as Benelong's Haven in Sydney, the mendations. action Woma Committee in South Austraha, and the contained in thefinalreport system of pohce aides in Western Australia. The Committee believes that if an Aboriginal community decides to allow alcohol there should be only one liquor outlet within that community, conducted as a licensed club or beer canteen strict guideUnes and conditions specified licensing legislation. The Committee firmly bereport Ueves that if a community decides to Umit or hibit alcohol that decision should be supported by all resources of Commonwealth laws. In this regard the Committee has reiterated the views expressed in its interim report concernwho, ing practical legislative changes that should be the introduced to prevent sly grog being carried on aircraft, boat, taxi, private car and through mail. Other preventive measures recommended by the Committee to overcome the causes of alcohol abuse include the need for improved education. The Committee also suggests that Aboriginals make greater use of provisions of the Social Services Act to ensure that basic necessiassociated ties such as food and clothing are provided to towns. famUies instead of social security benefits being squandered on alcohol. The question of alcohol treatment programs dence and facilities was also considered. Because most mittee itonreceived, Aboriginal alcohol programs are at an experin itsreport'The Environmental imental stage the Committee has recommended Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders that they continue to receive government assistPreservation of their Sacred Sites', and the ance until their effectiveness has been evaluated. The Committee also sees the need for continuing ate support for the recruitment and training igmal alcohol counsellors and encouragement of Intoxicated organisations such as Alcoholics and Aboriginal sobriety groups. During the inquiry the Committee was informed of problems arising from Ucensing legislation, especially the sale of alcohol to intoxicated or under-age persons and has recommended that existing legislation be more rigidly enforced. Disruption to Aboriginal communities arising from their proximity to isolated liquor outlets is of serious concern. The Committee has made recommendations aimed at giving such communities every opportunity and assistance to put their case for objecting to the renewal of tiquor The Ucences before Ucensing courts. The Committee has expressed disappointment despite the fact that more than one year has since the tabling of the urgent interim It is has been taken on the recomhoped that recommendations willreceiveprompt and urgent attention. I can only reiterate the unanimous view expressed by my colleagues that because of the devastating situation in some Aboriginal communities immediate action by Comwith monwealth and State governments is essential. in This view is summed up in the foreword of the which states that 'unless there is a reducprotion in the effects of alcohol abuse among Aboriginals many programs designed to assist Aborand State iginals will be jeopardised'. I would like to add that there are many people for the wrong reasons, attempt to gloss over alcohol problems of Aboriginals in the misthe taken belief that by disguising the problem they are in some way protecting the Aboriginals. This is illustrated by the following statement in a recent submission by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to this Committee on the health probalcohol lems of Aboriginals: We view with caution more extreme claims about the extent of Aboriginal alcoholism. Consumption is often with only intermittent residents on the edge of There is no doubt that the view expressed above does notreflectthe true position.

81,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"by leave-I want to associate the Opposition with the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I endorse what the Chairman of the Committee has said when he indicated that the members of the Committee are unanimous in the view that the alcohol problem among the Aboriginal people is of such a serious nature that no member of the Committee who returns to the next parhament would be prepared to see inaction on the recommendations that have been made. The Committee, having heard from some 205 witnesses, having received 139 submissions, most of them extremely informed and expert, having sat for some 20 days and having visited some 65 communities in very remote parts of Austraha where the alcohol problem of Aboriginals is in evidence, regards the problem as being extremely serious and I sincerely hope that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs especially will treat the report with the importance that it deserves and commence immediately to give effect to the recommendations. Let me say in conclusion that if something dramatic nature is not undertaken the seriousness of the alcohol problem among Aboriginal people can easily reach genocidal proportions and this indigenous people, its cultures and traditions would stand in danger of total destruction.",30
82,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"by leave- I thank the House. I also would like to sociate myself with this report and to say how pleased I was at the bipartisan approach to this inquiry by all members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. The Committee travelled extensively from Thursday Island to Perth, Melbourne to Darwin and to many points in between. The sub-committees of the Committee, assisted very ably by the staff, did a tremendous job in putting together a very sound report indeed. I support the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), the Deputy Chairman of the Committee. I hope that some notice is taken of the recommendations in this report. There have been many reports in the past but very tittle notice has been taken of any of them. The Committee, under the able chairmanship of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock), has presented a very significant report and I commend it highly. NA NA",30

85,Mr KATTER,SAFETY,"by leave-The Committee has presented two reports to Parhament since its appointment, namely reports on passenger motor vehicle safety and heavy vehicle safety. The Committee is currently inquiring into motor cycle and bicycle safety. This work is well advanced. In relation to this inquiry, the Committee has received 178 submissions, heard evidence of a from 93 witnesses, taken more than 1,800 pages of evidence and received many exhibits. The Committee has also conducted three inspections. The Committee had planned a further two days of public hearings and inspections on this inquiry. Preparation of the Committee's report has commenced. The Committee recommends that it be reconstituted by the new Parliament in order that the inquiry into motor cycle and bicyas- cle safety can be completed and that other areas vital to road safety, such as the human aspect, may be made the subject of inquiry. I would like to pay tribute to the members of the Committee who acted in a most bipartisan manner and were quite intense in their interests in the Committee's activities. I particularly commend Mr Frank Hinkley, the Secretary to the Committee, who devoted himself to our interests and the interests of the inquiry in a manner quite beyond what one might expect from such an officer. The various people who worked with him also did a splendid job. NA NA",30
86,Mr CONNOLLY,ACCOUNTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present a special report on the proceedings of the Conference of Commonwealth and State Pubhc Accounts Committees in June 1977. Ordered that the report be printed.",30
87,Mr CONNOLLY,ACCOUNTS,"by leave-To the best of our knowledge the Conference of Commonthis wealth and State Pubhc Accounts was the first occasion since Federation that equivalent committees of the Parliaments of Austraha have met with the common purpose giving greater substance to Parliament's tramittees ditional responsibility of effectively reviewing thefinancialactivities of the Executive Governexamined ment, to ensure that funds are spent as Parliaof ment intended and that taxpayers do in fact ceive value for money. It was thefirmview Conference that the proper and efficient expenGeneral, diture of pubhc funds and the collection of revenue must remain the paramount concern all pubhc accounts committees. During the Conference the mechanics financial scrutiny by parliaments was examined and although no resolutions were recorded the following general observations are contained the report: The function of pubhc accounts com-ment, mittees is to exercise parUamentary scrutiny over the executive and administration with the of stimulating a more effective use of public funds. With the continuing growth of governSenate ment expenditure in real terms, an increase almost 50 per cent in the past decade, there ressing need for more effective scrutiny by E aments both State and Federal. It was hoped that the increasing emphasis placed by the tionship Auditors-General on efficiency auditing rather than merely regulatory auditing would enable public accounts committees to place more phasis on their value for money inquiries. It was necessary to aim for greater ordination between State and Federal public accounts committees to ensure adequate accountability for expenditure across all spheres of government. It is worth making the observation that with the continuing use of special purpose grants parliaments should consider the development of new techniques to ensure more effective parUamentary overview, especially those areas where there is 100 per cent Common-was wealth funding such as tertiary education where the legal as well as thefinancialoverlap betweenThis State and Federal responsibilities will require further clarification. Departmental and minisexpenditure, terial co-operation was also essential for the effective operation of pubhc accounts comcommittee mittees. Public accounts committees would benefit by the use of expert guidance either as permanent or seconded staff and the use of its expert witnesses. The Committee has had consulties tations with both the Auditor-General and the PubUc Service Board in the hope that a regular arrangement for the seconding of professional staffon rotation could be established. We believe would be of advantage to both the PubUc Committees Service and the Committee. It was considered important that effective guidelines for the selection of priorities for ofinquiry be developed. The public accounts comgenerally accepted government pohcy as a starting point for their investigations, and the performance and the achievement objectives within the context of that policy. reCloser coUaboration between pubUc accounts ofthecommittees and their respective AuditorsTreasuries and Public Service Boards was essential to ensure more effective scrutiny of of expenditure. Closer co-operation and coordination between the public accounts comof mittees and other parliamentary committees concerned with the estimates of expenditure was essential for parliamentary control over the pubin Uc purse. In the context of the Federal Parhawe believe it wtil be necessary to maintain a close working relationship between the Public object Accounts Committee, the Expenditure Committee of the House of Representatives, the Estimates Committees and the Senate of Standing Committee on Finance and Governis ament Operations. Apart from informal meetings par-of chairmen of these committees it would be advisable for staff to have a close working relato minimise potential duplication and to increase the impact of specific examinations. The effective functioning of pubUc accounts comemmittees and of parUamentary scrutiny depended upon a clear understanding by members of Parliament of the budgetary processes. Committees coshould be concerned with the nature and comprehensibility of the financial information public presented to the Parliament. The 11th Committee agreed in principle to an examination of thefinancialdocuments presented to Parhament. To assist members of the Parhament to appreciate the purpose and subin stance of the Budget documents, the Treasury requested to re-issue a parliamentary handbook on Commonwealth and financial affairs. has been done. While in theory the budgetary processes enable Parliament to review in fact, despite the massive increase in government activities, the public accounts mechanismfirstintroduced into the House of Commons in 1861 has not been significantly reformed, and it is doubtful that in present form it can meet current responsibUieffectively. With the objective of overcoming some of these problems, the Committee has recommended to the Government substantial reforms to the Pubhc Accounts Committee Act introduced into this House in 1951. These requirements would permit the Committee to examine regularly expenditure by statutory corporations and authorities which currently receive little effective parliamentary review, and widen terms of reference to include the review of efficiency audits conducted by the Auditor General. This will ensure that the machinery of the Parliament is able to meet the expanded functions recently given to the Auditor-General. It is unfortunate that the public at large appears to have the impression that Parliament is little more than a venue for gladiatorial contests between poltiical parties and because of the nature of the system it is unaware of the considerable work done by parliamentarians of all parties behind the scenes in committees such as that of public accounts. Provided the Parliament is prepared to take the initiative, we are confident that it will be possible to achieve an improvement in the effectiveness of public accounts committees, the members of which have a unique opportunity to gain a deep insight into the workings of the Public Service and to examine actual expenditure of funds by conducting pubhc hearings and publishing, when necessary, critical reports. The Conference opened up a number of challenging areas in which the parUaments of Australia can seek closer co-operation in the future. I commend the report to honourable members. NA",31

As required by Standing Order 107 I have selected one matter; that is that proposed by the honourable member for Oxley, namely: The economic instability caused by the massive expon of funds by overseas-owned firms. I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",32
90,Mr HAYDEN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC,"Throughout this year, month by month, there has been a massive export of funds by Austrahan corporations and individuals. In most cases the export of funds has exceeded surpluses earned on the balance of trade or in any of our other external balances. The upshot of that is that it has injected economic instabiUty into the general management of the domestic economy. One recognises that in its own way it is the most effective vote imaginable of no confidence in the Government by those people who shifted funds. In short, it means that people are shifting their money out on this massive scale because they do not have confidence in the way in which the economy is being managed and they are not likely to achieve that confidence because of the general thrust of economic management. Its impUcations are both immediate and at least medium term. Accordingly, when one sums together the impact of what has been happening as a result of the massive export of these funds and general movements on our external accounts it must be recognised in WORKS Australia today that we are in the grip of a serious balance of payments problem, that there Reports is no evidence that the Government has a solution to those problems if, indeed, it fully acknowledges to itself how serious they are. I think it is fair to acknowledge also, from the point of view of many business managers and financial administrators of business, that it is necessary for them to shift funds if they experience this uncertainty and if the result of that uncertainty being fulfilled in fact is going to be a massive loss of capital on the part of the various organisations. But on analysis it is quite apparent OF FUNDS that in many instances the situation goes well beyond this. The facts are, as disclosed by the Australian Financial Review last week and by other media outlets, that there has been a massive export of funds to a degree which exceeds the earnings of particular corporations in the course of a given period. Two particular cases are referred to in those reports. They are the Ford Motor Co. of Australia and the Utah Development Corporation. In the case of the Ford company, it is reported in the Australian Financial Review that its profit slumped from S9m to $2m rules, last year. In spite of that, it declared a dividend gins, of $ 12m and exported SlOm. It exported much at more that it had earned in that year. The eviAustralia. dence of that is, I repeat to underscore the point made earher, a want of confidence by the Ford Motor Co. of Austraha in the management of the Austrahan economy. In the case of the Utah Development Corporcountry ation, in the first nine months of this year it exported $130m in dividends but its net earnings were only $116m. It clearly needed an end loader to shift the massive profits it had been earning and, indeed, to dig into the various protive visions which it had available for other continenjoy gencies so as to bolster the funds exported. It shifting money out as is the Ford company massive scale- a scale which cannot be justified on the basis of earnings in the respective periods. Let us look at the situation owned organisations. Both have been the recipiLet ents of generous favour from Austrahan governper ments. The latter company, particularly, has received specially generous favour from the present Austrahan Government. I referfirstlyto the Ford company. The Ford company is able to draw on the benefit of a high level of protection developed around the 85 per cent local content motor vehicle plan. That means that the Ford company has been able to extract significant profits from the Australian consumers-significant to the point where there is a most subsignificant stantial consumer subsidy implicit in every sale that the company is able to make In referring to this matter, an Industries Assistance Commission report stated: The high cost nature of the ger vehicles is confirmed by hicles in other major vehicle markets.

For instance, it means - becaus e of the generous protection which has been extended to motor car manufacturers in this and in this case, specifically Ford-that a motor vehicle retailing for, say, $9,000 in fact involves implicitly a consumer subsidy of about $4,500. It means that the Ford company is able to enjoy profits which, in a more freely competisituation, it would be denied.

That is the profit it made after tax, after all its costs of operation and so on- a clear net profit of $ 137m. This year the profit is expected to be about $ 160m. I repeat: There can be no disputing that this is one of the most outstandingly profit enterprises in the world. It is probably the most profitable enterprise of any scale in this country.

92,Mr HAYDEN,FINANCIAL STATISTICS FOR SELECTED COMPANIES,"In summary, this table shows that the dividend as a percentage of shareholders funds for the Utah Development Company in the year to 31 October 1976-whic h was that company's financial year-wa s 51.1 per cent. The next highest was the Utah Mining Austraha Ltd with 15.5 per cent. I ask honourable memous bers to contrast that with the Austrahan connot glomerate the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd in financial year to 31 May 1976. Its dividend, percentage of shareholders funds, was 3.5 per cent. By any measure'at all and being most libergrains ally inclined to the Utah operation, it is phenomenally successful, profitable company in this country. It is reaping out enormous profits and, on the evidence available, it is exporting those profits as rapidly as it can. Indeed, it has gone beyond that. It is exportingive much more than it earned in the latest period which data is available. It is generously treated by government. I indicated how generously Ford, as a participant in the local content motor car plan, is generously treated. But Utah is even more generously treated. We introduced the coal export levy when in government and we make apology for it because that redistributed profit from that company back into Australia, which would otherwise have gone overseas. In redismore tributing that profit back into this country we provided benefits for people in a myriad of areasbeing where we took up responsibihty, such as school dental services, community health services, bettrial ter roads and improvements in urban environreact ment, Aboriginal welfare and educauon. Those vast areas in which we did accept responsibility were assisted in some way by the redistributional processes. This was part of that redistributional process. Let us not have any argument that the present Government is opposed to redistribution. It supports it. The dispute really is about who benefits from that redistribution. This Government beheves that it is better to redistribute from the mass of people in this community to thejobs advantage of influential and wealthy organiscontribute ations hke the Utah organisation-a n organisnot ation which is exporting as rapidly as it can earnings in this country. In the last two years-last year and this yearthe effects of the progressive reduction of the export levy mean a reduction of $60m in incometralian otherwise available for the benefit trahan community. It means, in terms of the Utah organisation, a windfall gain and an addition to profits not being earned in any way any additional exertion or contribution to the Australian community of $25m. I suppose that the Government wtil argue, as some of their spokesmen have argued, that Utah as an organisation displays a generous corporate spirit towards the Austrahan public. Let me put that argument to rest. By the end of 1976 the Utah Foundation had distributed the princely sum of $668,551 in donations within Australia in variwelfare, research and cultural areas. That is a bad return for such a small outlay. It its received a $25m reward from the Government as afor a contribution to the community marginally more than half a miltion dollars. It is hke sowing of salt and reaping harvests of gold, and a the Austrahan public is providing the gold. The Utah organisation has a bad foreign corporation image. It is sad to note that the Ford Motor Company is now hsted with Utah because of its behaviour in relation to the export of massamounts of funds earned in this countiy to its foroverseas parent body in a way which creates considerable instability in the Austrahan economy. Utah is manipulated by the Queensland Government to its own advantage. There may be an argument about the nature of industrial disputes. There may be some particular aspects of argunoment about the industrial dispute between Utah and the seamen. While the Government refuses to accept its responsibilities in ensuring that a reasonable amount of the massive profits reaped from this country's natural resources are redistributed, to the advantage of this community, I think it not surprising that indusorganisations like the Seamen's Union will and will seek to claim that at least their members should enjoy some of that profit which they believerightfullybelongs not only to this country but also to posterity. Let us look at the situation pertaining to Utah. It is earning $137m with only 3,000 employees. In comparison, the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd earns $66m with more than 60,000 employees. At least away the Australian company is prepared to create for people in this country and is prepared to to the Austrahan economy and does shift in a most destabilising way massive its amounts of Australian earned funds. Funds earned from Australian resources belonging to Australian people; funds sent out of the country to the disadvantage of the people of this country coal because of the instability caused to the Auseconomy through adverse effects on the of the Ausbalance of payments. What has to be acknowledged by the Governby ment is that the corporate interests of organisations such as Utah are not congruent with the Austrahan pubhc interests. Utah is a price cutter. It is prepared to cut the throats of domestically owned Australian coal producers. As able member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) pointed out in this House a few weeks ago, while the longexpired. term price for the sale of contract coal is $A47 a tonne, in its spot contract sales Utah has been cutting the price to SA32.40 in Greece, SA34.55 in the Netherlands, SA34.20 in BelOpposition's gium. So it is slashing the price by between and $A15 a tonne below the long term contract price. It is not operating in the best interests the Australian community. Let us look very quickly at the effects of that. Most serious effects are injected into the econthe omy via the balance of payments. If we have situation in which, because of the substantial increase in the net outflow of dividends and cause of the absence of a capital inflow we running a deficit on our balance of current account and capital account which in total well exceed the surplus on the balance of trade, we have a balance of payments problem. Our reserves are being eaten away. Since midman September official borrowings and the revaluthe ation of gold have added $816m to our overseas reserves. Because of the clumsy and incompetent way in which that was handled-the area of incompetence is one area in which the honourwants able member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who is mterjecting, could make a disunct contribution because that is the only area in which he has special quaUfications-in spite of the official rowings and the revaluation of gold adding $816m to our reserves since mid-September, our reserves have increased by only $ 197m. So there has been a massive outflow of $618m. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) might perhaps like to argue that there has been an increase of $ reserves since the week of 26 October. That was and largely due to the $85m earnings raw sugar which had previously been held up in Tokyo Bay. So we are far from being out of woods. What has to be done? The Ford companyLabor has to be reminded of the favourable position which it enjoys in this country and the advanbility tages which it derives at the expense of the sumer. The Utah organisation has to be required to pay the withholding tax which appUes to other companies. That would be a simple matter of introducing legislation to provide a special rate for foreign owned branches in this country affairs. which unlike foreign owned subsidiaries otherwise avoid their withholding tax liability. A special corporate rate of about 53 per cent poration tax imposed on such branch organismember ations will overcome this problem. the honour Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has to Mexico Mr LYNCH (Flinders-Treasurer) (4.0)-The matter of pubhc importance which is before the House represents a continuation of the campaign to talk down the econ$A13omy and to knock Australia. The Austrahan pubUc is becoming fed up with the negative and desof tructive approach that has been adopted by the Australian Labor Party over the last 12 months. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) in particular and a number ofhis colleagues have deliberately sought to create speculation about exchange rate and to depress international a confidence in our economy. That campaign has served only to demonstrate the bankruptcy of the beOpposition's own economic policies-pohcie s are which would lead to more inflation and to a return to the recession years of 1974 and 1975. Today's matter of pubhc importance, I regret to say, is being brought before the House by a who at every turn has tried to undermine Australian economy. The honourable member for Oxley is a man who cannot stand the heat of the Treasury kitchen. One day he wants to be the Treasurer; the next he does not. One day he to be the Leader of the Opposition; the next he does not. The events of the past week have demonstrated the utter confusion in the any minds of the honourable member for Oxley and borthe Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) about who should be responsible for economic matters in the Opposition party. That confusion continues in this debate. Why has this matter not been brought forward by the man whom I understand to be the shadow Treasurer, 16m in the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford)? It is a further indication of the divided from the sale ofday'sdiscredited man. group of misfits led by yesterthe Only last week members of the Australian Party were indicating that the honourable member for Oxley was to have a major responsiin economic matters under a Labor governconment.

If the events of last week prove anything, prove that neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the honourable member for Oxley has the faintest idea of what the word 'planning' means. The question must be asked: Why cannot the alist honourable member for Oxley make up his minding whether he wants to be Treasurer? It is this Government's view that he was a faUure as Treasurer. The job got on top of him. I read the House part of an article which appeared the Melbourne Age on 11 September 1975: The Treasurer, Mr Hayden, yesterday struck a television reporter in the face with his briefcase at Sydney port . . . The Channel 10 news director, Mr Tomallowance Barnett, said yesterday: 'Hayden took a full-blooded swing at Wilison with his briefcase. I think that is unprecedented in Australian poUtiI cal Ufe. The reason why the honourable member for Oxley lost control of himself was that he lost control of the Australian economy.",35

The Opposition has brought forward a matter of Uc importance which is related to the outflow funds, which has a bearing upon the currency Australia.

It is certainly not relevant to the matter under discussion.",36

If the Treasurer commits an offence against the Standing Orders in any action will be taken. So far the Treasurer said has not contravened the Standing Orders. pro Mr LYNCH-What I am seeking to do is to doubtexpose the man who has created more speculation against the Austrahan dollar than has any It other man in this country. I believe that that needs to be put on the record. The this honourable member for Oxley brought down a Budget with an estimated deficit of $2.8 billion, by January 1976 it was expected to run out to inalmost $4.7 bilUon. He based his Budget on an in real gross non-farm product of 5 per cent. The result was an increase of only 2 per up cent. He said that his monetary policy would not of be fully accommodating to inflation. Yet he presided over a growth in the money supply of 20 per cent on an annual basis by the end This debate concerns very heavily the question capitalflowsI turn to what happened to pritovate capitalflowsunder the previous GovernDuring the period in which it was in office be there was a net outflow of private capital across the exchanges of more than $500m. The honourable member for Oxley was the man who trigthey ered speculation against the Austrahan doUar y his grossly irresponsible comments on 7 September last year. He wants to repeat that episode this year. He purports to be an economic rationbut writes in Fabian pamphlets about bringin an excess profits charge and a capital gains tax and about extracting death duties in the form of property rather than cash. I ask the honourto able member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who in will foUow me, to say whether the honourable member for Oxley in this debate is saying that the Opposition would bring back the coal excise air-levy or whether it would aboUsh the investment which the honourable gentleman, I recall, is on the record as saying that it would. turn specificaUy to the question of whether there is any economic instability as a result of had funds being repatriated by foreign owned compames. The fact is that Australia s external position is now strengthening visibly and wtil continue to do so as the year proceeds. The trade pubaccount has turned around sharply since the of March quarter, with the rate of importing of slackening and exports recovering. There was an balance of payments deficit of $46m in a September, after a deficit of $382m in August. There was a trade surplus of $ 151m in September, after a surplus of $81m in August. The current account of the balance of payments has through the September quarter, continuing the underlying strengthening in Australia's trading position which was evident in the June quarter. As this strengthening becomes.more widely reahsed, as inflation is further reduced, we can expect to see a reversal of the recent speculative positions taken against the Austrahan dollar. Indeed I confidently expect that the October balance of paymentsfigureswill show a net inflow of private capital. In the meantime, pending a return to more normal levels of private capital inflow, the Government has expanded its overseas borrowing program. Taking 1977-78 as a whole, we currently expect to borrow overseas sums totalling about $1% billion. Our demonstrated capacity to raise funds of this order at low interest rates on private capital markets is, in itself, of course a reflection of international confidence in the Austrahan economy and in the policies being pursued by this Government. The effect of these borrowings has been to keep reserves at relatively comfortable levels. Reserves have not been unstable. On the contrary, they have been maintained at relatively high levels by international standards. The progress which the Government has made in restoring economic stability is now becoming apparent in many areas-for example the emerging evidence of new capital investment projects moving ahead. Thefigureswhich I am about to quote deny completely the assertions of the honourable member for Oxley that the international instability, of which he spoke and which I completely reject, has had any damaging effect upon confidence in Australia. The honourable gentleman should be aware of the Commonwealth Statistician's latest survey which indicates that private enterprises expect to increase their aggregate new capital expenditure in the six months to December by no less than 14 per cent, in seasonally adjusted terms, on the level of the previous six months. On the same basis, the expected increase in manufacturing industry is 33 per cent, and in mining it is 66 per cent. Can this be seen as a lack of confidence? Of course not. Let us look abroad, to the latestfigureswhich are emerging from the various major countries from which we have drawn a very considerable inflow of foreign funds for investment purposes in the earlier years in which we were in government, and which are now returning. The latest United States Commerce Department survey of expected capital expenditure by United States affiliates in Australia points to an increase of about SO per cent in 1978 in the mining sector. This is a clear sign of the increasing confidence being shown by overseas investors in the policies of the present Government. If one sees further evidence that confidence has returned, one needs only to look at the number of significant projects now moving in the minerals sector. Construction has already commenced on the $256m Norwich Park coking coal project which will involve additional employment opportunities for 1,000 men during the construction period. In Western Austraha construction has begun on the $100m Agnew nickel project, and plans are in hand to expand the Robe River, Mount Newman and Hamersley iron ore projects, at a total cost of $600m. In addition, the impending commencement of $300m worth of petroleum exploration operations at the Exmouth plateau has now been announced. The proposals to develop the North West Shelf natural gas resources are also entering the project definition stage. In manufacturing industry, new projects amounting to $600m were announced in the Press during the recent June quarter. Major new investment projects in this country now under way total almost $2 billion. In addition, new projects involving an investment of almost $1.6 billion are due to start this year. The fact is that there are now clear indications that long term foreign investment is reviving. In 1975-76 foreign investment in Austraha amounted to only $128m. Last year the amount was more than sixtimeshigher, at $826m. As time passes, this revival in foreign investment will provide jobs and security for thousands of Australian families. It will also provide more resources to governments, Commonwealth and State, by way of taxation. Our political opponents sought in government to drive away foreign investors, and they did. Oil and mineral exploration came to a standstill. Major projects were deferred or abandoned. The Opposition wants to do the same thing again. I turn now to the question of the repatriation of profits. It has been long standing exchange control policy, which the previous Government did not alter, to allow repatriation of profits without restriction. Indeed that is in accord with the requirements of Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund and is obviously sensible if Australia is to continue to be a net importer of capital. Under existing tax law, which was not changed by the former Government, a foreign company that operates here through a branch rather than through a subsidiary company incorporated or otherwise resident in Austraha may withdraw its profits without incurring a liability for dividend withholding tax. This of course arises because a subsidiary is a separate legal entity, whereas a branch of a foreign company is not. Profits withdrawn by a foreign company from its Australian branch are, therefore, not dividends. I informed the House on 27 October that the Government had this whole matter under review and that the Treasury had papers on the subject under preparation. These papers have now been received, but it is hypocrisy for a former Treasurer, a man who showed no interest in the subject when in government, to be critical of the present Administration. I do not want to go into the details regarding the Utah organisation, the Ford organisation or any other organisation, except to say that the honourable gentleman, with his socialistic aspirations, would obviously seek to re-introduce the coal export levy in relation to Utah, would withdraw the investment allowance and would put up the communist Seamen's Union against Utah. I make no comment about the companies because the issue which I mentioned is under active examination at present. This Government has made significant progress in the fight against inflation. Its policies are now starting to produce results on both the domestic and the external fronts. More importantly, we have reduced the level of inflation from almost 17 per cent under the previous Government to the point where Australia's rate is now about the same as the average for its trading partners. There is no doubt that we are well on the way to restoring full economic health to the economy and that 1978 will be the best year of economic performance in more than five years. We-ever y man and woman on this side of the House and the Senate-deplor e the constant attacks by the Opposition and its desire to pursue a destructive campaign with the intent of talking matter down Austraha.",36

97,Mr KEATING,FINANCIAL STATISTICS FOR SELECTED COMPANIES," I rise to support the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) in the discussion of this matter of public importance, namely, the economic instability caused by the massive expon of funds by overAustralia seas-owned firms. This is a matter to which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) did not address himself. is an indication of the Government's desperation that much of the Treasurer's speech was devoted to a personal attack upon the honourable member for Oxley. The real problem is the absence of this Government policy in the handling of the balwhich ance of payments problem which has caused a ced massiveflightof funds from Australia. This has major created economic instability and has produced want of confidence in the parity of the cunency amongfirmsresident in Austraha, particularly international companies which have either branches or subsidiaries operating in Austraha. It is worth recounting for the record that since mid-September the outflow has been $618m. Despite official borrowings and a revaluation of gold holdings which added $816m to our reserves, the reserves rose by only $197m. Even since the Acting Treasurer announced one month ago that the Government would be securing a $ 1,700m borrowing outside Austraha there has still been a $253m outflow from Austraha. So the flow continues because outflow begets outflow. Once there is a lack of confidence and once there is speculation, of course compames cannot take a chance and they shift their profits offshore. Importers in Australia get chary about the state of the dollar and they pay instantly for their imports. Instead of extending their payments over a normal period they start bunching them and paying forthwith. The result is a propensity to intensify the outflow which of course undermines the whole basis of the cunency. We have seen this trend over a number of years now. The invisibles are growing rapidly in the balance of payments picture despite some healthy trade surpluses. The largest factor in the invisibles is represented by dividends. The investment hump of the 1960s is now the dividend hump of the 1970s. Dividends are not being reinvested in Austraha. Compames are obhged to repatriate dividends because they believe they will suffer a capital loss if the currency changes. The two compames which have raised this and brought it to public gaze are Utah International and the Ford company, which both in Australia. Utah has shipped $130m out of the country, although its earnings were only $116m. In other words, it has been shifting every cent it can out of Austraha to avoid the possibility of a capital loss. Of course the Treasurer blames the honourable member for Oxley for this problem. I should just like to recount to him a statement by Hill Samuel Ltd in its October bulletin on the Australian banking and capital markets. Hill Samuel It is a merchant banker with whom the Treasurer would be acquainted. The report states: The Government must take a lot of the blame for allowing situation to develop and for not taking corrective actions were clearly needed many months ago. As we had suggested in recent reports, if the Government had announsubstantial overseas borrowing arrangements earlier, the part of the capital outflow experienced in recent a months would not have eventuated. We are aware of several companies who elected to remit funds abroad and we would add here that none of them indicated that their decision was a result of announcements made by Mr Hayden or other Labor spokesmen, or newspaper articles. The weakness of the Australian Dollar was evident, not only to companies in Australia, but also to those overseas companies which have subsidiaries in Australia . . . The report went on: . . . no responsible actions being taken on the tralian Dollar front by the Fraser Government, there only one correct action for corporations exposed to risks to take-i.e . toremittheir funds, where due, overseas. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Who said that?",38
98,Mr KEATING,FINANCIAL STATISTICS FOR SELECTED COMPANIES,"That was the conservative merchant banker, Hill Samuel Ltd, as set out in its October bulletin on the state of the Australian capital market. So much for the Treasurer's mealy-mouthed attack on the honourable memadviser. ber for Oxley and on statements by members of the Opposition. The situation is as I have stated. There is a malaise in government thinking in terms of the balance of payments problems and there is the villainy of compames resident in Australia, particularly Utah, which are acting against the Australian national interest. Utah the company which advertises: 'We are backing Australia'. It is backing Australia all right. knifing Australia in the back by producing a on the cunency and by fostenng speculation. Companies look at the statistics. Look at the this company has been treated in Australia. The Government obhged it by hfting the coal export duty levy. This company was paying $75m in levy in 1976. That is now being phased out and eventually Utah will be paying nothing. That despite the fact that the company's profitabtiity rose by 36 per cent from $100m to $136.9m in that year and despite the fact that it paid out $76m in duty. Of course the company can afford to pay, but it has been treated very generously the Australian Government. Yet not only does it expon and repatriate its earnings from Australia but it does it in such a way and under such a corsituations porate structure as to also even absolve itself from paying the normal withholding tax that other subsidiaries of foreign compames pay. the company is at fault on two accounts-evading the tax laws and exporting capital when the Ausbranch tralian Government is doing its best to save the currency. That is the performance of Utah. Next is the Ford company. Sir Brian Inglis, chairman of Ford, is part of Mr Fraser's economic consultative committee. So there is a real Trojan horse operation. One of the main offenders in this matter is right inside the Government's councils giving advice. Ford is a company which is protected, as the honourable member for Oxley mentioned, by the 85 per cent content plan for motor vehicles. Its cars are over 100 per cent dearer than similar vehicles in the United States of America. There is a 100 per cent premium on its cars manufactured in Austraha. It is a company which has constantly resisted rationalisation of the industry. When the Australian Labor Party was in government, Sir Brian AusInglis was parading here telling us that he would was not forgo product identification for rationalisexchange ation. He has to have the Ford stamp on the company's gearboxes. The company will not have any rationalisation. Yet this company, which is protected, is prepared to ship its money out of this country to the detriment of the Australian cunency. It is prepared to do this in the face of pohcies of the Australian Government, a government to which Sir Brian Inglis is a principal So much for the goodwill of these two companies operating in Austraha. What is underlying their activiues and their motives? What is underlying them is their lack of confidence in the Fraser Government's management of the balis ance of payments problem. That is the real reason why they have shipped money out of the It is country. They have no confidence in Mr Lynch run as the Treasurer or in the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Ittilbecomes the Treasurer to way attack the honourable member for Oxley when he himself is the laughing stock of Australian business. There is no single personality on the Government side who is thought less of in corporate Australia than Mr Lynch. Let that go on is the record. Let us deal now with some of these companies. The Taxation office should be looking at the behaviour of Utah, Conzinc Riotinto of Austraha Ltd, Comalco Ltd, Esso Australia Ltd, and even Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, an Austrahan by company. They are large enough to have closer scrutiny by the Taxation Office. It is far better to do that and adjust the laws so that these kinds of do not arise and pay for the extra staff to have these companies policed than tofindone day that our tax laws are wanting and that we So have a hole large enough to drive a horse and cart through in as much as the Utah company is a of Utah International and not a subsidiary in Australia. I think all of those companies should come under scrutiny. That is the point. The cunency has been depreciated. There has been a tax upon it because of the behaviour of these companies brought about through the bungling of the Government in its management of the balance of payments problem and the ineptitude of two very well looked after foreign companies in Australia which are acting contrary to the Australian national interest, flagrantly disregarding the interests of Austraha in managing and stabilising its cunency, which is crucial a trading nation and particularly a nation which is largely dependent on investment for the development of its industries. Shame on these companies and shame upon the Government for letting them get away with it.",39
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FINANCIAL STATISTICS FOR SELECTED COMPANIES,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
100,Mr MOORE,FINANCIAL STATISTICS FOR SELECTED COMPANIES," I listened with interest to the contributions made by the two spokesmen from the Opposition. They were just diatribes stemming from the anti-business, business bashing, anti-profit and anticompetitiveness instinct of the Austrahan Labor Party. It is very disappointing, because only recently in Pitt Street I heard that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) was around town and was telling the busmess doyens of Pitt Street: 'Look, we really are not a socialist pany. We understand business. We know all about this business of profit'. ReaUy he was getting on very well with those people. I congratulate him on his approaches. Those people were sucked in by the proposition. Indeed, I hope the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) makes avaUable some of the Fabian pamphlets. I have not read them but if they are half as good as the stories the honourable member for Oxley has been putting over they must be pretty good. I come to one or two other things which the honourable member for Oxley said. After what he said, I have no doubt at all as to why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) was thinking of sending him to the Foreign Affairs portfolio or the Defence portfolio should Labor come to office. The honourable member alluded to the problems of the Utah company. He said: 'Look at Utah's massive pay-out. Fiftyone per cent of its profit is paid out overseas'. Then he compared that pay-out with BHP's payout. I think the figure he cited was about 3V4 per cent. WeU, what is the difference? Anyone would know that BHP is confronted with a massive expansion program. Any internal revenue retained profits will be mighty handy in the development of the North West Shelf, not to mention other areas. BHP is incurring massive losses in steel in Austraha and in the development of its mining operations. Utah is not in a position to engage in any further expansion at this moment because of labour problems in central Queensland. The Norwich Park project has not been allowed to go on because of labour troubles in that area. The honourable member for Oxley also went on to discuss some of the questions relating to to why governments move out of cunencies. When we talk about international currencies, we have to understand that we are going through a period of enormous change. I do not think any honourable member would have foreseen such a tremendous improvement in sterling or the enormous fall in the American dollar in the last 6 months. The American balance of payments situation is quite the most drastic I have seen since the War. Its repercussions are yet to be felt. We still have not seen the real consequences of it. We have seen how the European cunencies have withstood the onslaught of the huge deficits coming from America. The warning signals are there. The price of gold is moving up. That is a bad sign for anyone involved in international trade. Any person employed as the treasurer of a multinational company would be very concerned at the moment not to get his company locked into currencies which may have some difficulties. I do not doubt for a moment that if I were the treasurer of one of these compames I would be looking at the options involved in covering the company's position. This is why I beheve there is a tremendous need in Australia to introduce a forward exchange cover market. If we had had these tools offinancialmanagement, a lot of the problems with currency runs that we have been experiencing in the last 6 months to a year would not have occurred. I turn now to the view of overseas people and how they look at the question of evaluating what they should do with funds in Australia. Firstly, they look at costs within the nation. Then they look at the record of industrial trouble; that is a very sad story. Then they look at the standard of Australian management-and that is not always good. Then they look at the question of exchange rates. Then they look at economic management in this country-whethe r the government has the will to dominate the economy, to bring inflation under control and to bring a sense of proportion back to the nation as a whole. Finally, they look at polidcal stability. They want to know whether the government will honour contracts, whether it will honour agreements, whether it will honour undertakings given. They look at the ALP and its record. A Labor government would welsh on the uranium contracts. That has been said pubUcly. They look at the New South Wales Government and the way in which it welshed on the coal leases. These are the sorts of records which overseas people look at. They add to that the basic anu-business view of the ALP and therefore they are concerned about the prospects of having socialist government in this nation. I am not referring to any one particular area investment; I am talking about America, the the Continent and Japan. These are always the points that come out: Costs, labour problems, political stability and the exchange rate consequence of that. It is from these areas that they make their judgment as to whether to invest in Austraha, whether to hold their position in Austraha or whether to withdraw their funds. This comes within the area of judgment and speculation. I hope people will understand matters because we will never be able to control speculation. There will always be an this in exchange rate and currency movements. This is particularly so at the moment because overseas patterns are so uncertain. If this were really understood, there would not be some of the hysteria that goes on about exchange rates and we really would not have to face half of vexing problems that confront us. Finally, I wish to say a few words about tinationals. They are one of the great whipping horses around here. They can be readily thrown off at. Apparently one of the problems with is that it makes a lot of money. What a tremening dous crime! There are an enormous number multinationals and major companies in this country which lose millions of doUars a year. do not hear too much about them. But because Utah has made a success of its operations, belted roundly for its troubles. I would have hoped Utah would be given the opportunity to develop, to use its resources, to use its research things and techniques and to use the funds it undoubtedly has in the future development of this nation. people Had the opportunities been provided to Utah, I have no doubt these funds would not have beencan removed. We have to look at the situation in the nationalistic context of the management of a multinational group. If it is prohibited or shut out from one hopeless in the past particular market clearly it will move somewhere else, and the funds will be lost to Australia there is an alternative investment in some country. In making that judgment, the have to look at the same old things-costs , labour relations, poltiical stabUity and currency. four factors are met in some other country and are better than those available in Austraha, clearly the company will move to that other time. country. It is up to us to provide and ensure the proper cUmate for the development of this nation. These are the people who can provide with the jobs, the know-how and the techniques. There are times when such compames in the national interest but in their own interest a and it is up to the government of the day to ensure that the interests of this nation are looked of after. Australia's interests should not be left to rhetoric that is used to frighten people to the hills. We should get these companies in, get them involved in projects and then get the economic as a process going. Once we have those companies here they are then open to negotiation. No person who has thousands of millions of dollars involved in any particular area wtil back off from sensible negotiations. This is why I should Uke to see this nation, which will always be dependent these on foreign currency, foreign money, for its development in the foreseeable future to go out element of and welcome foreign investment. I come to the warning point. It is most important that we offer partnerships and not just give away equities. It is most important that as far as possible we should turn to the question of loans rather than equity. Of course we are not going to the be able to get all the money in on loan account only; there wtil have to be an equity sweetener. mulThere is a tremendous need to understand that Austraha is capital hungry. Its needs in the foreseeable future in respect of the known projects Utah alone are enormous. We must use our negotiatsktil, our poltiical stabUity and our economic of management to ensure that these people, when they come to Australia, invest their money in WeAustralia and that the money is used in the national interest. The government of the day has it is a great responsibUity to see it through. I see very little merit in the raising of this matter for discussion. It is probably one of those that ties in with the nervousness of some in the Opposition who are facing an election. Because of this they are kicking around any they can find. They are trying to kick a can but really they are belting contheir old tacticsbelting fidence and business. They are back to which have proved to be so and which will again prove if to be so when election day comes round. other Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)-The group will discussion is now concluded.

Honourable members will recall that the Liberal-National Country Party Government, after the receipt the Industries Assistance Commission report, cided that it was not sufficient that the assistancecrops to the industry be phased out. Therefore the Government is introducing yet again a continuation of apple and pear stabilisation in this legislation. Apphcation of the stabilisation scheme to apples in the 1978 export season as in the 1977 season will be based on a maximum level of support of $2 per box and a maximum quantity eliSecond Reading gible for support of 2 rnilhon boxes.

The 1977 levels of pear export support will also apply to the 1978 season, namely, a maximum level of support of 80c per box and a maximum quantity eUgible for support of 1.4 rnilhon boxes. Support will continue to be limited to 'at risk' to Europe, including the United to be Kingdom, and North America. The Government is also consulting with the States on a supplemenassistance program for 1978 which could involve an additional $ 1 m to assist apple exports to the Europe, including the United Kingdom. levy The stabUisation scheme has operated since to the 1971 season and has been of particular on importance to the apple and pear exporting States of Tasmania, Victoria and Western Austraha as it provides a measure of stabUity in the the extremely uncertain climate that has 2prevaUed in the exportfieldfor several seasons.

It is clear that substantial adjustment has already occurred, particularly under the provisions of the recently concluded fruit growing reconstruction scheme. The number of bearing apple trees in Australia has fallen by an estimated 25 per cent over the past four years, while the volume of apple exports in 1977 first covered by the stabUisation scheme was about one half the 1975 level.

The Act provides for capital grants to be made to eligible organisations, which are defined as organisations, local governing bodies and charitable or benevolent trusts, towards the full cost of purchasing, constructing or renting buildings, including the purchase of furniture and equipment. It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social welfare worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. Approved organisations may also be paid a daily subsidy at prescribed rates for each homeless person to whom both food and accommodation are provided-75 c a dayand a subsidy-25 c a day-for each meal supplied to non-resident homeless persons. In accordance with one of the recommendabeen tions of the 1973 Working Party that the gram should be reviewed after three years, major provisions of the Act relating to capital 1978-79. and rental grants are operative until 13 December 1977. The salary and accommodation and meal subsidy provisions are not subject the three-year prescribed period. In his second reading speech the then Minister for Social Security said that the purpose of making the legislation subject to a three-year 'prescribed period' was to ensure that the scope, value standards of the services provided would be monitored and an assessment of the total gram made prior to the expiration of the first three years of its operation. In accordance with this intention, a review of the operation Act has been carried out by the Department of Social Security, based on an analysis of national sample survey of the views expressed homeless persons and by the agencies caring for workers. them. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) has also received submissions from the Advisory Committees on Homeless Persons Act set up in each State to advise the Minister matters relating to the administration of the Act. Briefly the conclusions reached by this review were that the operation of the Act should tended beyond 13 December and that the provisions of the Act should be amended in such ways as to enable it to support a wider range of factiities for homeless people, if and when ditional funds are available. In accordance with our pohcy of concentrating welfare assistance on people in the greatest the Government is in favour of making the Act more effective in meeting the range of homeless people. At this stage, however, the Government has not yet reached a decision on the proposals of Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and a Health, one of which is that the homeless persons assistance program should become part of wider 'Sheltered Accommodation Program', in administration of which might be devolved to the State governments. In the circumstances, it would be premature to consider widening the scope of the Act at the present time, but it is necessary to extend its operation beyond 13 December 1977 if only to authorise continuation of subsidies for which funds have already been provided. For the information of honourable members, capital grants totalhng $8.4m have been approved under the Act to date. Of this amount $2.1m had actually expended by 30 June 1977, $5.3m has been proallocated for expenditure in 1977-78 and the the remaining $lm will be carried forward to Expenditure on rental and salary subsidies for the period from 13 December 1974 to 30 June to 1977 totalled $377,958. The appropriation for these subsidies in 1977-78 is $275,000. Expenditure under the National Welfare Fund on accommodation and meal subsidies for the period from 13 December 1974 to 30 June 1977 and amounted to $1.7m. Estimated expenditure on these subsidies in 1977-78 is $800,000. As at 30 proJune 1977,financialsupport was being given towards the running costs of 95 homeless peoples centres, with a total bed capacity of 3,102. Total of the overnight occupancy of these beds during 1976-77 was 785,484. In addition 668,548 meals a were served to non-resident homeless people. by Salary subsidies were paid for 34 social welfare In legislating to extend the operation of the in its present form for a further period of one on year, the Government has in mind that suggestions for widening the ambit of the Act should receive further consideration in the context of the 1978 Budget.

Second Reading need, Mr VINER (Stirling-Mirtister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) needs of a wider (4.58)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise the the payment to Queensland of $24.8m in 1977-78 as special grant. The payment of this amount is in accordance with the recommendations of the a Commonwealth Grants Commission contained its forty-fourth report on special assistance for the States which was tabled recently. The Bill also seeks authority for payment of advances to Queensland in the early months of 1978-79, pending receipt of the Commission's recommendations for that year and enactment of any necessaiy legislation to provide for any special grant that may be paid to the State in that year. The Commonwealth Government from time to time, on the recommendation of the Grants Commission following appUcations by States, makes special grants to the less populous States to compensate them for such factors as lower capacity to raise revenue from their own resources and higher costs in providing government services of a standard comparable to that provided by thefinanciallystronger States. When such special grants werefirstpaid they constituted the only regular form of general revenue assistance paid to thefinanciallyless strong States for this purpose. However, for many years now, the main way in which special compensatory assistance has been provided to these States has been through the payment of higher per capita amounts of other general revenue funds. This situation is reflected today in the fact that personal income tax sharing entitlements paid to Queensland, South Austraha, Western Australia and Tasadjustment mania are higher, in per capita terms, than simitherefore lar entitlements paid to New South Wales and Victoria. Under the personal income tax sharing arrangements, the less populous States continue be free to apply for specialfinancialassistance the recommendation of the Grants Commission. This is one of the explicit understandings tween governments in relation to the tax sharing arrangements. Any such special grants should be regarded as supplementing a State's entitlement under the tax sharing arrangements in the same way as they formerly supplemented the financialfigure assistance grants. Currently Queensland is the only State applying for special revenue assisttice, ance under the Grants Commission The arrangements. Queensland's estimated entitlement in respect of 1977-78 under the personal income tax sharconsiders ing arrangements is $776.2m, representing per head of population compared with an average of $264 per head for New South Wales and Victoria. Accordingly, the assistance provided by way of the special grant should be seen as supplementing the special compensatory assistance of $97 per head, or $210m, provided to Queensland by way of the tax sharing entitlement. Local authorities also, of course, time. participate in the tax sharing arrangements and this year Queensland received $27.9m for distribution to local authorities in the State. This is $3.7m more than last year and more than double the general purpose assistance provided to local authorities in Queensland in 1975-76. The Commonwealth Grants Commission, in arriving at its recommendations in relation to claims for special assistance, makes an assessment of the 'financial needs' of a claimant State. In making such assessments, the Commission compares in detail thefinancesof the claimant State with those of New South Wales and Victoria, taking into account differences in revenue raising capacity and differences in the cost of providing comparable services. The payments of special grants recommended by the Commission consist of two parts. One part is based on a preUminary estimate of the claimant State'sfinancialneed in the current financial year, and is treated as an advance payment subject to adjustment two years later when the Commission has compared in detail the finances of the claimant and standard States for that year. The other part represents the final adjustment to the advance payment made two years earher and is known as the completion payment. This may be positive or negative and may result in the final grant in respect of a year being higher or lower than the advance payment for that year. The payment to Queensland in 1977-78 of to $24.8m provided for by this Bill comprises an on advance payment of $ 14m in respect of 1977-78, and a completion payment of $ 10.8m in respect beof 1975-76. The completion payment in respect of 1975-76, when added to the $25m advance grant paid to Queensland in that year, brings the final grant in respect of 1975-76 to $35.8m, which is $ 11.4m more than the corresponding for 1974-75. The advance grant for 1977-78 wtil, in accordance with normal pracbe subject to adjustment in two years' time. Commission's recommendations in relation to the special grants arrangements have been adopted by the Parhament each year since the Commission's inception and the Government that they should be accepted on this $361 occasion.

107,Mr NEWMAN,LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housmg and Community Development) (5.5)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will be aware that the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) announced on 15 August 1977 the Government's decision to provide financial assistance to Tasmania to assist the continuation of operations of the Mt Lyell mine operated by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd. The purpose of this Bill is to seek Parliament's approval to the implementation of the Government's decision, by authorising the execution of an agreement or agreements between the Commonwealth and Tasmania for the provision of assistance to Tasmania. Honourable members will know that the operations of the Mount Lyell mine are important to the people in the Queenstown region-indeed , the mine employs about half the work force of the region-and that the mine has been incurring substantial losses principally due to the low world copper price. The company has indicated to the Government that it could not continue to absorb the large operating losses without assistance and, in view of the mine's regional significance, the Tasmanian and Commonwealth governments announced their agreement to meet the cash deficit on the mine's operations. The two governments proposed to share the cost of the assistance on a dollar for dollar basis. The Commonwealth's assistance to be provided to Tasmania relates to the mine's operation from 15 August 1977 until the Government announces its decision on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on the copper industry. Accordingly, the Bill seeks approval for the provision of assistance to Tasmania of amounts up to one-half of the payments made by Tasmania to the company for the mine's operations and provides that the Commonwealth assistance be for the continuation of those operations from 15 August up to a date not later than 30 June 1978. The Bill thus provides for the contingency that some interim extension of the present assistance might be warranted following the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's interim report on the copper mdustry, and having regard to the company's developing cash flow situadon. Honourable members will appreciate that the agreement being negotiated with Tasmania is necessarily complex, not least because of the Second Reading need for precise definition of the detailed accounting concepts to which the assistance must be related. Broadly, the agreement will provide, in accord with the Government's decision, that the assistance to Tasmania would be repayable to the Commonwealth should the mine return to a position where it generates positive cash flow. Should the mine be unable to achieve that position, the Commonwealth's advances to Tasmania would not be repayable. In any event, the assistance would be provided on an interest free basis. As honourable members would understand, the provisions of the Commonwealth's agreement with Tasmania would be broadly reflected in a separate agreement between Tasmania and the company. While it is not practicable at this stage to calculate precisely the cost of this assistance, I can give the House an indication of the order of magnitude. Thus it is estimated that, for a period of continued operation of the mine from 15 August 1977 to 2 November 1977, the cost of the Commonwealth's contribution would be approximately $lm. I beheve the Government's action in this matter has again shown its concern for the welfare of the Austrahan communities suffering adverse effects from international economic conditions. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NA (TERMINATION) BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 October, on motion by Mr Street: That the Bill be now read a second ume.",47
108,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,"May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? I thank the House. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Stevedoring Industry Charge (Termination) Bill, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Bill, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Bill, the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Bill, the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Port Statistics Bill as they an associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the seven Bills to be discussed in this debate.",47

110,Mr WILLIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,"The Bills now before the House provide for a considerable restructuring of the stevedoring industry in respect of the arrangements covering the employment and deployment of waterside workers. I am pleased to be able to say that the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. In so saying, I draw attention to the irony of the situation where on a non-contentious industrial issue, such as that now before us, the normal time has been given to the Opposition to consider the legislation between its introduction and the commencement of debate in this House. However, on highly contentious industrial legislation, such as the recent amendment to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act, which affected not just one industry but almost every industry in the country, the Opposition was given practically no time at all to consider it before it was brought on for bate and rammed through the Parhament. If there was any rationality at aU in the way this Government runs the Parhament, one would surely expect than the moreMr Street- I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,It is the general procedure of the House to allow some minutes introductory comments which frequently are of poltiical nature. Mr Street- I do not object to the BUls being discussed.,48
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,I do not as yet see any matter on which to call the honourable member for GeUibrand to order. Perhaps the honourable member for GeUibrand wiU nevertheless take some notice of the Minister's point of order.,48
115,Mr WILLIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,"If the Minister will contain himself he wtil find that I wtil be talking about the legislation in about 30 seconds. I repeat: If there was any rationality at aU in the way this Government runs the Parliament one would surely expect that the more contentious the issue the more time would be given for consideration and debate, especially as the Government continuaUy maintains that industrial relations, which we are talking about in this legislation, are such a major issue in this country. As the reverse procedure in fact appUes, in this case one can only conclude that although the Government is anxious to make as much political mileage as possible out of industrial relations issues it is extremely nervous about allowing any extensive dedebate on the more contentious aspects of its industrial relations pohcies. The people of Austraha would do well to ponder that point. The legislation now before us is the culmination of an enormous amount of investigation and consideration of the arrangements covering fact waterfront employment and the way in which those arrangements could be improved. The dissatisfaction of all concerned-that is, the stevedoring companies, the waterside workers, the customers and governments of both poltiical persuasion-wit h the present system has led to inquiries being estabUshed and to the continual prolongation of temporaiy legislation while all concerned endeavoured to find a more to the satisfactory permanent arrangement. The dissatisfaction of all parties with the existin ing arrangements stems from a number of factors. Firstly there is the problem of idle time which results partly from an excessive number of waterside workers, despite the dramatic drop in their numbers in recent years, and also from the method of allocation of labour between constevedoring companies and the holding company known as SEAL-the Stevedoring Emof Austraha Ltd-whic h results in what is known as locked up idle time. Since the introduction of permanent employment of waterside workers in 1967 it has not been possible to retrench them in the normal way, but there has of nevertheless been an incredible drop in their a numbers from 21,000 in 1966 to just over 10,000 now- a drop of over 50 per cent in 11 years, a quite remarkable reduction. The fact that their numbers are still somewhat excessive despite this amazing decline results from the dramadc and continumg move away from convendonal labour intensive cargo handling to capital intensive tainerisation, and also from the recruitment labour in 1974 when imports were at record levels. Some 1200 men were recruited, princimeet pally in Sydney and Melbourne, at that time and the subsequent substantial drop in trade resulted in a surplus of labour. Although the various inquiries have recorded much employer, cusmatters, tomer and government concern at the high cost of reducing the number of waterside workers by financial inducements, I think it must be rememments bered that the dramatic move to containerisation has taken place without union opposition and that considerable benefits have thereby been achieved as compared with what would surely have happened had containerisation been simply imposed on the waterfront and large scale retrenchments implemented. Apart from some surplus labour, idletimealso results from employees being 'locked in'. Under to The present arrangements, when a stevedoring comas represented pany is particularly busy, it can draw on pool labour employed by the holding company, expressed SEAL, to top up its labour force. However, it apparently not an infrequent occurrence that stevedoring company which has a substantial deticular gree of business on hand finds that the pool is empty so that it can obtain no more labour, at the same time employees of other stevedoring compames are idle because of lack of business are for that company. As no transfer arrangement needed. exists there is a double cost through the delay one company conducting its operations and through idle time payments for employees of there another stevedoring company. Clearly, this most unsatisfactory situation and one which has to be resolved. The second cause of dissatisfaction with present arrangements relates to the funding the industryforvarious payments to waterside workers and for the cost of operations of the trahan Stevedoring Industry Authority. The ASIA is the statutory body responsible, amongst other things, for funding various financial liabilipropriate ties which, in other industries, bihty of the employer. Thus, the ASIA is responsible for long service leave payments, redundancy payments, idle time payments and inquiries payments to the waterside workers pension fund which goes by the intriguing name of SERF-the Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund. I can only assume that whoever gave that retirement fund that name must have had a good sense of humour. The ASIA also is responsible for a varvolved iety of other payments to waterside workers smaller, non-permanent ports-for instance, sick leave, annual leave, attendance money and so conon. For various reasons the funds raised by the of ASIA through the charge imposed on man hours worked have been nowhere near sufficient to the accrued obligations of the ASIA in respect of payments to waterside workers. This is known as the industry deficit and, according to the special consultant to the Government in these Mr Stevens, that deficit in March of this year was an enormous $2 7m. The reason for this deficit seems partly to be the failure of govern to adjust the charge to keep pace with wage costs and partly the fact that the charge is based on man hours rather than tonnage. So as the industry has become more capital intensive, the charge has failed to keep pace with the Authority's financial obligations and placed an undue burden on conventional labour intensive operations. third major cause of dissatisfaction relates industrial relations issues. Both the employers, by the National Industrial Council, and the Waterside Workers Federation, have a very strong desire to achieve a noris mal industrial relationship, that is, one where a employees are identified as employees of a parcompany which is responsible for meeting their award entitlements. Under present arrangewhilements about one-quarter of waterside workers employed by the holding company SEAL and are farmed out to stevedoring companies as Both parties also are anxious to terminin ate the overseeing and interfering role of the ASIA. In the Waterside Workers Federation is particular resentment at the disciplinary is a role that the ASIA has played in the past. Although the degree of industrial disputation in the stevedoring industry has diminished markedly since the 1950s, both parties are strongly of of the belief that industrial relations could be further improved by establishing a normal Ausemployer-employee relationship. These causes of dissatisfaction have been known and identified for quite a few years now butfindingan apformula for resolving them has been a are the responsidifficult matter. The Labor Government appointed two during its three years in office. The first conducted by Mr Foster basically recommended that the best means of resolving the issue was to establish a corporation which would be solely responsible for overseas trade and which would acquire the assets of all stevedoring companies inin overseas trade. He proposed that this in corporation could be solely government owned or could be owned joindy by governments, Fedimprovement eral and State, and could include the current stevedoring companies as part owners. This nationalisation or semi-nationalisation approach has much to recommend it because it would vent profiteering by stevedoring companies which has been rampant. As honourable memto bers will recall, Australia's largest stevedoring company, the James Patrick company holds the distinction of being the first company in Australia to be ordered by the Prices Justification Tribunal to reduce its prices because they were so unjustifiably high. This approach of establishposition ing a corporation would also have enabled the basic causes of dissatisfaction to which I have referred to be resolved. However, it clearly volved practical difficulties, including the vigorvide ous opposition of the employers to nationalisdefects ation and the fact that although the external power would appear to provide constitutional power to nationalise the industry, the then Labor Government would have faced a very real difficulty in getting such legislation through Senate. Consequently, another investigation was ordered by the then Minister for Labor and Immigration, Senator James MCClelland, in ciliators October 1975, and was conducted by Mr they arise Northrop, as he then was. This report again conand, indeed, sidered the views of all parties and basically mendation ofhas came up with two alternatives: Either drawal of the Government from its statutory role in the industry or restructuring to involve a larger tration role for the Government. Interestingly, a number significant of parties involved, such as the Broken Hill Pty putes Co. Ltd., the ASIA and the Austrahan Shippers dispute Council, and even one stevedoring company, F. ciliate G. Strang Pty Ltd, supported the greater involvement of the Government through the estabany lishment of a statutory corporation to employ all Industry waterside workers and allocate them to stevedorof ing companies as needed. This vigorously opposed by both the National Indusvolve procedures trial Council representing stevedoring companies from employers with generally and the Waterside Workers ation because both wanted a normal industrial current needs. The proposedlabour relationship. Such a statutory corporation which port labour co-ordinator to direct and control would not involve nationalisation of the stevedoring compames would have prevented assist that normal industrial relationship from being developed. In these circumstances, the present Governpresently ment has opted for Mr Northrop's first alternameeting tive, that is, the withdrawal of the Government from its statutory role in the industry. The legisin lation now before the House gives effect to concept and hopefully will lead to a substantial in the operation of the industry. This is especially so given that the legislation is based almost entirely on the report of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference- a prebody which was established under Sir Richard Kirby, an eminent figure in the industrial arena, thrash out the means by which the industry could be rearranged without the Government's presence yet overcome the many difficulties arising from the present arrangements. The Conference which involved all interested parties, has produced a report which represents a consent for most sections of die industry, except for a couple of organisations which still favour the statutory corporation concept. It seems to the inOpposition that the new anangements will proa good chance of overcoming the principal of the existing arrangements. The normal industrial relationship desired by the principal parties will be established by the abohtion of the ASIA and the allocation of all waterside workers in permanent ports to particular stevedoring the companies so that all will have an identifiable employer and ah employers will have their own work force. * Furthermore, the establishment of port conto deal with the disputes on the job as seems, to be a decided improvement been adopted on the recoma withmissioner Neil of Justice Mr the Robinson and ComConciliation and ArbiCommission. Hopefully, this will effect a reduction in ume lost in industrial disby providing a referee at the point of the who can at least quickly ascertain the facts relating to the dispute and, hopefully, conthe parties and assist them in resolving such disputes. The National Stevedoring Conference report also contains details arrangements whereby the problem of proposal was locked-in stantially labour wtil be overcome and so subreduce idletimepayments. They infor transfer of surplus labour a labour surplus to other Federemployers with insufficient to meet their establishment of a the allocation of labour between employers should this procedure to operate smoothly. The establishment of supplementary labour forces in all ports rather than just small ports, as is the case, should also assist greatly in additional labour requirements in times of high work load. If these arrangements succeed eliminating locked-in labour whilst, at the that sametime,enabling all employees to be identified with a particular employer, it would seem that a very substantial step has been taken towards reducing costs and improving the industrial reladons environment at the same time. The other major cause of dissatisfaction at present-the funding arrangements-is also substantially taken care of by the proposed procedures and the legislation now before the House. To a large extent, employers will now be hable for their own funding for such matters. Apart from their contributions to the waterside workers' pension fund, SERF, which will be collected by a proposed levy, employers in the major ports will be obliged to make their own funding arrangements to meet their obhgations to their employees in relation to long service leave and other such matters. The special levy on tonnage to wipe out the industry deficit to which I referred earher also is a sensible procedure. The Opposition beheves that this legisladon should not be opposed because it offers the possibility of a substantial improvement in the arrangements covering employment on the Austrahan waterfront. However, in saying that, I do not want it to be thought that we have abandoned all thought of adopting the alternative procedures-that is, nationalisation or semi-nationalisation, as recommended by Mr Foster, or even the establishment of a statutory authority to employ all waterside labour. If these proposed arrangements turn out not to be satisfactory, a future Labor government, such as the one which will be elected in six weeks dme, will be free to contemplate such alternative procedures and will adopt them if it beheves that they will offer a better modus operandi than that being introduced at present. That said, however, on behalf of the Opposition I express the sincere hope that the arrangements now to be adopted do prove satisfactory from all points of view. I say in conclusion that this legislation shows what can be done if a consensus approach is sought. The union involved in this legislation is a noted left wing union. It contains in its leadership members of the various communist parties, amongst others. Yet this union has shown a very substantial willingness to discuss this issue and to co-operate with the Government and with the employers in reaching arrangements which can be to the betterment of all Australians. I think that it shows what can be achieved by adopting that kind of approach. I think it contrasts remarkably with the kind of reaction which one would get from a trade union movement if the other kind of approach were adopted, namely that which seeks not so much consensus as the wielding of big sticks and the offering of threats rather than co-operation.",48
116,Mr FALCONER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,"The House is debating a set of Bills whose passage will have the effect of restructuring the stevedoring industry in Austraha. I was interested in a number of the remarks made by the spokesman for the Opf osition, the honourable member for Gelhbrand Mr Willis), who has just resumed his seat. He indicated that the Opposition would not be opposing this legislation. Therefore, there is probably no need for a lengthy and heated debate on the subject. However, I would like to address myself to one or two of the problems that the Government faced in looking at the industry and the need for restructuring it and to make one or two observations about the legislation that has been introduced. Few, if any, industries in the Commonwealth have been the subject of so many commissions of inquiry, reports, studies and complaints as the stevedoring industry. Unhappily that has been accompanied in the past by a period of trouble on the waterfront. As a result of that, we have a stevedoring industry in Austraha which must be rated as being a high-cost industry. In many respects it is an industry which is typified by meagre output. Appeasement has been the policy followed by governments of various political complexions over a lengthy period, and amongst the by-products of that policy of appeasement has been the progressive destruction of effective managerial control, upon which the rational and economic conduct of all industry must depend. Reform in this sector of the Australian economy is of prime importance. Yet defiance of authority generally in this area has become a way of life. One therefore faces the problem of finding a way in which to restructure the industry without bringing on a direct confrontation between the unions, on the one side, and the Government, on the other. I think the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) is to be commended for the way in which he has approached this task, because since he took on responsibihty for that portfolio he has ensured that all the parties can get together to discuss the matter and work out an agreement upon which the Government can base its own legislation for the restructuring of the industry. That obviously is the preferable way of going about it, rather than the government simply legislating and forcing all the parties in the industry to conform to that legislation, when the parties may not wish to proceed in that way. As has already been indicated, the Government faced the prospect of going in two substantially different directions. It could get out of the industry altogether and try to restore a normal employer-employee relationship within the stevedoring industry or it could decide that problems in the industry could be solved only by a government body having even greater discisultative plinary power and an even greater involvement than has the Austrahan Stevedoring Industry try-an Authority at present and therefore perhaps going to the extent of nationalisation, as has been tioned by the honourable member for made, Gelhbrand. The Government chose the first alternative, that is, to try to get try as far as possible and to restore in the industry a normal relationship or as close to a normal relationship as could be achieved. Certainly everyone involved in the industry dissatisfied with the current situation. Those favour the withdrawal of the Government from the industry use the argument that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority has been powergram less to intervene and should be abolished cause it is just a useless anachronism. Some people reply to that argument with the point the Authority has been rendered ineffective cause of the lack of government support for disciplinary powers, on the one hand, and bewhich cause of union and employer pressure, on the other. When it came into office the Government had industry before it the report presented by Mr Justice point which Northrop. As was mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech, late in 1975 the then Minister or Labor and Immigration, Senator James MCClelland, requested Mr R. M. ties Northrop, QC. to report on the views of the ties to the industry as to what they saw as problems and how they thought they could be overcome. Mr Justice Northrop, as he subthe sequently became, reported to the Government in early 1976. His report indicated that, whilst of the organisations and parties who made subThe missions to him agreed that the existing arrangevisions ments should not be allowed to continue, there was a sharp division between those who ployer proposed that the Government should take a more direct role in the industry and those who beheved the Government should seek to withwhere draw from its existing limited regulatory role. The Northrop report also commented on a tem number of the problems that existed in the indusmake try. For example, it drew attention to the need provide for a reduction in the existing size work force. Obviously the system of voluntary redundancy on the waterfront posed a problem. recovered. The report drew attention to the need to provide a satisfactory means of providing additional waterside workers to cope with fluctuatingother labour needs. It pointed to the need for evidence of an adequate method of labour allocation and the a means of securing improved industrial relations. It commented on the need for effective conarrangements to allow user intereststhese often are the forgotten people in the indusd others to have an effective voice in that industry. Of course, there was the need to ensure menthat satisfactory funding arrangements were including measures to recover the deficit accumulated by the Australian Stevedoring out of the indusIndustry Authority. Thefirststep in the industry being restructured by the Government was to ask Mr Justice Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration is Commission to bring the parties in the industry who together in conference to consider ways of overcoming the problem of surplus labour. Arising from those discussions a special redundancy prowas developed which was to apply for a belimited period. Mention has already been made of the great success achieved in bringing the that work force of the industry down from 21,000 been in 1966 to a position where there are now its slightly more than 10,000 waterside workers, represents quite a remarkable reduction. It is notable to point out that since June 1975 the work force has been reduced by almost 3,000 as a result of the efforts to get people out of the and to get the labour levels down to the is really apphcable in the industry. The Government also asked Mr Richard Kirby in December of last year to bring the partogether and to try to develop a framework parwithin which the problems of the industry could the be handled and the overall performance of the industry improved. As a result of his report and agreement expressed in it, the Government has considered its legislation and based a very all large part of its legislation on that agreement. features of that legislation include profor improved utilisation of the labour force so that surplus labour held by any emcan be made available for use by all other employers in the port and so that arrangements can be made for casual pools of labour to operate there arefluctuatingneeds and a high demand at particulartimes.There have been measures to improve the industrial relations sysin the industry, consultative anangements to sure that problems are ironed out by conto sultation, steps to protect the interests of the of the smaller pons and a means by which the accumulated deficit of the industry can be I draw attention to one or two problems in parts of waterfront activity. Ireferto the position of the shippers of bulk cargo-that is, those who ship ores, minerals, sugar and other products which are loaded by conveyor belt operations, for example. Their position is one which has not been affected directly by the operations on the waterfront because under the previous legislation something of a division was brought about by the fact that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority had a regulatory role to play in terms of the handUng of conventional cargo. The handUng of other bulk cargo was outside that scheme of operation. The legislation which the Minister has introduced has sought to protect the status quo in the stevedoring industry in respect of the division between the handling of conventional cargo and the handling of bulk cargo, insofar as that division can be preserved under the new arrangements. Of course where there is a different structure it is difficult serve exactly the same situation. The Government has attempted to do so, as was in fact agreed by aU parties to the stevedoring industry conference. I will be interested to see whether the new arrangements work. I believe the Government has taken the right approach in attempting to involve all interested parties in discussion and in corning to an agreement on how the new arrangements should proceed. However it is a debatable point as to whether the Government should become more heavily involved or whether it should have tried to get out of the industry altogether. On the basis that the various parties to the industry want to restore a normal employer-employee relationship, I believe the Government should act on that general wish in the industry. If we find after a period of years that the arrangement does not work out as hoped, if we find that certain ship owners, for example, decide that because they want to get their ship out of port they give in very readUy to pressure for extra benefits, without having regard to the impact that would have on other ship owners and on the cost structure of the stevedonng industry as a whole, this Government or any government may have to reconsider its stand and see whether it should revise the situation and become involved in the mdustry to a much greater extent. I compliment the Minister on the enormous amount of work that he has done in the past two years in bringing about this agreement and bringing the legislation to this point. Those of us who have been involved in some discussions with him and with representatives of the various parties involved in the industry know just how many thorny problems there have been to iron out. I think it is to his credit that he has been able to bring into the House this set of Bills for consideration by the Parhament Indeed it is to his credit that he has been able to introduce a scheme which, by and large, has the support of aU poltiical parties in this Parhament.",51
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS," Before I caU the honourable member for Cunningham, may I point out to him, so that we know where we stand, that honourable members in the House may not pass notes back and forth to the gaUery. Likewise, strangers in the gaUery are not in any circumstance to converse with honourable members in this House. I hope I have said that in a kindly fashion.",53
118,Mr WEST,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,"The Minister for Employment and industrial Relations to pre- (Mr Street) said in his second reading speech that the total work force in the stevedoring industry-that is the waterside workers-ha d fallen from some 21,000 men in 1966 to just over 10,000 today. He did not explain the reason for this decline. The reason is that mechanisation and improved cargo handUng facUities such as bulk sugar instaUations in Queensland, the containerisation of cargo and the advent of roll-on roll-off shipping have improved tonnage rates, have increased profits and have made large numbers of men redundant to the industry. This faster turn-around of shipping has meant greater efficiency in the industry. It has provided greater profits for stevedoring companies and snipping companies. For the men who work the ships it has meant a very hard struggle to obtain improvements to their wages and working conditions or to achieve ameliorative measures to alleviate the need for fewer workers in the industry. I remember the position in north Queensland ports in the mid-1950s. Then there were 2,666 workers engaged in the sugar trade. Ten years later, in 1965, there were only 1,199. By 1977 aU that remained of the 2,666 workers in north Queensland in 1955 were a mere 284 workers. Like the highland Scots after their eighteenth century persecution by the English ruling class, they had scattered far and wide. They had to because there was no further work for them in north Queensland. They had received no help and no compensation from the industry for the loss of their work. Today the workers in the stevedoring industry receive reasonable wages and work under reasonable conditions. It was not always so. Until 1968 the industry was of a casual nature. The 1930s was thetimeofthe infamous buU system in which at the major ports men would go to the wharves every morning or every evening in hope of obtaiiiing work. Each day they went there. They were picked up on a daily basis, the discretion of the employer. During the solute Depression in the 1930s more often than not did not receive work. They received no fringe benefits. They often worked 24-hour shifts. of them actually worked 48-hour shifts. I undertheir stand that the 24-hour shift was not removed from the Austrahan waterfront until the Second World War. Even in the 1950s, an era of which Itation personally recall, they did not enjoy rights that the other workers enjoyed. They were not paid for sick leave or for pubhc hohdays. They did not enjoy a long service leave vest entitlement. There was no pension scheme. In 1965 a crisis had arisen because of mechanwise, isation in the industry. Large had become redundant. The Waterside Workers Broken Hill Pty Co. Federation at that time commenced a struggle pers Council and in the for an industry pension, for two reasons.

This pension deIndustry Conference mand led to the Woodward conference, an all infirstly the abohtion of industry conference, which by 1968 had come up Industry Authority; secondly, with a permanency proposal which was eventuthe ally implemented. The inhuman casual system the withdrawal of the Government and on the waterfront was finished forever by 1968.1 think I should pay a tribute to the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr Charles Fitzgibbon, at this time, because I that no other man in the industry fought harder than he did for an end to the casual system. manency, as it was then known, set up a system under which men were placed in operational compames. Further to provide for the rise and fall of labour demands, labour pools were set under the adrninistration of the Stevedoring ployers of Austraha Ltd, the idea being that they would form a backup labour force. It is interesting to study the role of the ority while all this was taking place. Since 1968 the power of the Austrahan Stevedoring Industry Authority has waned. Of course the Authority is now about to be phased out altogether. It survived, I think, since 1941, first as a mission, then as a board, and finally as an authwill ority. Its activities and attitudes have been that those of a government instrumentality not to have been. It has been the very essence heavy-handed bureaucratic interference with the nuts and bolts working of the industry. The main role of the ASIA over the years was to attack the the workers on whom the industry depended, the men who actually worked the ships. In the 1960s at the Authority attacked its own workers with abdedication. For instance, in 1963, using its they powers under the Waterfront Long Service Leave Act, the Authority fined waterside Someworkers-its own workers-f 1.2m by cancelling already pitifully inadequate attendance money allowances. Instead of being a force to reduce confrontation, it exacerbated confronby its over zealous use of its statutory discithe normal plinary powers over individuals. The Authority has now reaped the bitter harof those years of anti-worker activities. When the maritime workers were given the opportunity to vote for its continuauon or otherto a man they voted to abolish it. Those in numbers of men the Government and the Labor Party, in the Ltd, in the Austrahan Shiptrades unions- I include a federal memto see a national coras favoured in the Foster report or the of stevedoring, can thank the to overthat has resulted backlash for the of industry opinion in the National Stevedoring deciding to recommend the Austrahan Stevedoring the restoration of industry to full private control; as thirdly, a body having a meaningful presence in the industry. know Let me examine briefly the proposals of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference, since Perthey are what this legislation is all about and what the legislation legitimises. Obviously, after the Government abohshes the Authority and the SEAL labour pool, the National Conference proup poses to allocate workers from the labour pools Emto private operational companies, with the exception of the ports of Kembla and Newcastle, where I understand that the pools will continue. National port and co-ordinating committees will Authbe set up. Not much emphasis has been placed upon those committees in this House. I wish to expand on them in a moment. It is proposed that these committees will take the place of the Authhas ority and of the Stevedoring Employees of comAustraha Ltd administration procedure. There be supplementary labour pools. I note that all the Minister did not say that these supplemenought tary labour lists would be made up of exof waterside workers, men who are now on the B register or men who may retire in the future. Certainly, it is my personal opinion that the workers in the maritime industry will never accept pools of supplementary casual labour that are not made up from this source. The report of the Nauonal Stevedoring Indusor wrong. try Conference provides for the Conciliation Arbitrauon Commission to act as a final arbihave trator to the co-ordinating committees in the event of disagreement. I think it is appropriate this ume to examine what the federal and co-ordinating committees are all about. The industry still has to be administered and these committees will take the place of the bodies which are doing the administradon-no w that SEAL, as it is known, and the Authority. The federal co-ordinating committee shall be comon posed of representatives of the major Mr employers-the Austrahan Employers of Wateron front Labour-BHP , the Austrahan Nauonal Line and the Waterside Workers Federation. functions will include deciding the number waterside workers required in each port, the requirement for recruitment including agreed procedural matters, the establishment and operbihty ation of registers of waterside workers for port, arrangements for application of agreed redundancy and early retirement procedures, rangements for transfers of labour between ports to cater for peak requirements, agreed arrangemanagement ments concerning supplementary labour force, and matters referred to it from the port coleaders ordinating committees. The port co-ordinating committees have a itment similar role. They have equal representatives about thetook from the industry users, the employers and the union, in this case the Waterside Workers Federation. Their functions are similar. They include responsibility for recruitment arrangements agreed by the federal co-ordinating committee, registers of authorised waterside workers and matters associated with removal pf men from registers, redundancy or early retirement rangements agreed in the federal co-ordinating committee, and local matters associated with supplementary labour force. Since I arrived in this Parhament I have noticed that there is one major theme of the Government. That is to attack unions. I heard firstly from Cabinet Ministers and then from a gaggle of back benchers. Without exception the theme is that most leaders of major unions left wingers, communists or fools all intent stirring up industrial confrontation, all intent causing trouble in industry. That is the view, parently, of the Government. It might be that has to have something to hang an early election on before those 170,000-odd people leave school next year and add to the ranks of the Latrobe unemployed. Mr MCVeigh-Le t the people decide on 10 December. Let the people decided who is right and Mr WEST-The honourable member can his say later, but I bet he has never carried a bag of sugar on his back. Since I came into this at House I have heard two exphcit attacks on the port Waterside Workers Federation. Ifindit very strange to hsten to these attacks on trade unions. Early in 1976, after the Foster report had proved inconclusive and the Northrop mquiry was set is up, the Waterside Workers Federation was asked to submit proposals. They were submitted 23 March 1976. The inquiry dragged on until Justice Kirbyfinallyreleased thefinalreport 5 April 1977. What did we thenfind?We found that the original proposals of the WaterIts side Workers Federation are almost without of exception the same proposals as this Bill implements. This Government, which is so fond of union bashing, is legislating to give responsifor the adrninistration of the Australian each stevedoring industry to the Austrahan Employers of Waterfront Labour and the Waterside arWorkers Federation. It is amazing. The Government believes in worker participation in the of mdustry and yet it has the audacity to attack with such ferocity the very same who put forward these proposals to restructure Australian stevedoring. The Governhas called Mr Fitzgibbon a communist, but his advice, tendered in March/April 1976, industry. best ways in which to restructure the Let me give another example of what I regard as duphcity on the part of the Government. I have heard attacks made on the power workers in die Latrobe Valley because they wanted an increase in their miserable starting wage of $161 ara week. The euphemisms which the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations used in his the speech to explain how these amazing, painless redundancies took place on the Australian waterfront do not make clear how they really did take place. Let me tell honourable members how it they took place. They occurred because all men over 60 years of age in the ports concerned on the Australian waterfront were offered a retirement are allowance of 70 per cent of what they would on have earned if they had stayed in the industry on until they were 65 years of age. That is quite apgenerous; very good; very understanding. Why it does this Government not extend similar generosity to other underpaid workers? The Government has attacked the workers of the Valley while it has offered generosity to waterside workers. That is what happened when I was a waterside worker. Why does the Government not offer similar generosity to other workers whose jobs are at stake in industries where men are becoming redundant? I understand the Government is even legislating now to deny the unemployment benefit to the youngsters who will leave school this year. They wdl not be eUgible to receive the benefit until February. It is a pity they could not be afforded the same generosity that was extended to the men in the stevedoring industry. In the long term there is a the stevedoring industry to amalgamate. For instance, Port Kembla in my electorate is one of the largest ports in terms of tonnage in Austraha. In that port 13,735,000 tons of steel, coal, ore and general cargoes were handled It is one of the great ports of the Southern Hemisphere. But is it necessary to have Federated Enginedrivers' and Firemen's Associauon of Australia members exporting coal; iron workers discharging iron ore and waterside workers handling steel and general cargoes? In the stevedoring industry, just as in other industries, there is a need for unions to combine for efficiency and to achieve better results for their members. I know that BHP obstinately refuses to Operational extend the same precise working conditions to its iron workers engaged in stevedoring as it extends to members of the waterside workers union. Therein Ues the seed of industrial trouble, ble that this Government likes to ascribe to 'left wing agitators' to suit its own poltiical purposes. I wish I could say that I regard this legislation as being the solution to problems in the stevedoring industry. But I cannot. I do not think that stevedoring companies are morefittoday to run the industry than they were last year when Patrick Stevedoring paid exorbitant fees amounting to over $600,000 to Sir Reginald Reed. Austrahan workers and consumers paid took Sir Reginald that sum of $600,000. Stevedoring companies are just as rapacious as multinationals like Utah who act in their own self-interest their pursuit ofrip-offprofits from Australian coal exports. We in the Opposition support the Bill. The waterside workers support it and so do the Ausport traUan employers of waterfront labour. Possibly industry. it is the only viable alternative at this time. However, it is my opinion that some future Federal Labor government wiU very likely still find it necessary to place this highly volatile stevedorthese ing industry under pubhc administration and ownership to achieve the best results for Austraha and the men who work the wharves.

120,Mr BURR,BAS E HEADQUARTERS," I join with the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) in congratulating the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) on presenting these BUls to the House for debate. I am conscious of the fact that, since this Government office, the Minister has worked religiously to try to bring together the parties involved in the stevedoring industry to come to agreement and into bring some more logical order into what has been a most bedevtiled industry. The Minister has brought the parties together in debate in a most orderly fashion. I think it is to his credit that these Bills which we are debating have the supof all parties involved in the stevedoring I think that we need to give some consideration in this debate to the factors that caused Bills to be introduced and to the changes which are now being made to the administrative structure of the stevedoring industry. As the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) mentioned in his speech in this debate, the trahan Stevedoring Industry Authority was set up in 1956 as a government instrumentality control the functions of the stevedoring industry and those people who would be engaged in stevedoring activities. That Authority, albeit government run authority, worked with some tralian people. success and brought stability to the waterfront up until 1967-68, when an inquiry headed by Mr Justice Woodward recommended that significant changes be made to the conditions of employ20 ment of waterside workers. The honourable member for Cunningham mentioned that waterwere side workers had been deprived of some of the conditions to which other people working under other awards have been entitled. I think that fair minded person, looking at the conditions employment that have applied to waterside workers since the Woodward commission of waterside inquiry brought down its recommendations and since those recommendations were stevedoring implemented, would have to agree that the conpeople ditions that have apphed to waterside workers since thattimewere more than the economy of any industry could possibly tolerate. I do not think that anybody in this chamber would deny that waterside workers are entitled to adequate hohday leave, sick leave and illness compensation. I think that honourable members on both sides would agree that waterside workers, hke all other industrial workers, are titled to those conditions. But the main problem that was introduced by the Woodward inquiry was the provision of permanent employment. What that really meant- I do not think the honourable member for Cunningham spelt out the significance of that recommendation-was that a waterside worker could not dismissed from his employment. That was a most significant change from what had previously plied and from what applies under any other award. What happened over a period since 1967-68 when those recommendations took effect was that, through mechanisation on the waterfront and through the impact of roll-on roll-off ferries the demand for physical labour the waterside workers simply became less. The waterside workers grew older but there was no way in which those people could be removed from their positions on the waterfront, and that meant that we had an aging group of waterside workers who could leave the industry only by voluntary retirement. They could not be of retrenched by their employer, the Australian Stevedoring Industiy Authority. They could be removed from the industry by any mechanism other than voluntary retirement. The net effect Austhat recommendation over a period was that we had a build-up in numbers of waterside workers to who were surplus to the numbers required at ports throughout Austraha, to the extent that in recent months some 1,200 men who simply did a not have a job were still being paid by the AusWhat happenedfinaUyto bring this matter to a head was that waterside workers were working hours a week, the remainder of their working time was what was known as 'idle time' but they still being paid through the levy system by the employers or the shipowners. This situation was totally intolerable. Whilst the honourable any member for Cunningham and other honourable of members opposite may say that certain stevedoring compames should be able to afford to pay workers for such idle time, the plain fact is that it was not the employers or the companies which were paying these not to work; it was the Austrahan consuming public, because any cost that is imposed on the waterfront must be passed on in costs that ultimately reach the retail consumer. In Tasmania we are all too conscious of that fact. Any manufactured goods or rural goods that have to leave that State must leave by ship. There is no alternative to getting our goods over to the local market or to export markets. In Tasmania we were paying, through a very heavy levy system, enan inordinate cost that was taking away the profitabUity of all the goods that we were producing in Tasmania. That situation, whether it apphed to Tasmanian producers or to other Australian producers selhng on an export market, simply really could not be tolerated. be The situation was reached in which the Australian Stevedoring Industiy Authority, albeit apimposing heavy costs on the industry and those costs being passed on to the consuming pubhc, had an accumulated debt of some $22m. That debt was being guaranteed by the Federal Government. It had buUt up because of the idle time that was not being worked by waterside by workers. It was the responsibUity of any government to correct that situation so that this anomalous cost could be removed from the taxpayers of Australia. I believe that it was only through the dedication of the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations that that situation has been resolved, resulting in the presentation these Bills. During the period in which this Government has been in office, conferences have not been held between the stevedoring companies, the Australian Shippers' Council, the Waterside of Workers Federation of Australia and other bodies with an interest in the stevedoring industry. They have come together on many occasions to discuss this anomalous situadon and, in private conference, to determine what can be done about it. The first inquiry, set up by the previous Government, under Mr Northrop, QC, heard a considerable amount of evidence and brought down a report. That report was taken up at a later stage by an inquiry headed by Mr Justice Kirby, during this Government's period in office, which finally reported in April 1977. If one analyses the two reports, one finds that the Government had one of two alternatives available to it. The Government could either continue as a direct employer of waterside labour and subcontract that labour to whoever chose to hire it or it could withdraw from the industry and allow the employers, the stevedoring companies, to employ direcdy the waterside labour that they required in order to maintain their operations. The Government, I believe, very wisely chose the latter of those two alternatives. In other words, it decided to withdraw its participation from the stevedoring industry. As the honourable member for Cunningham agreed in his speech, it was the Government's involvement that built up a bureaucratic organisation that was inefficient in its operations and which caused many of the problems that were perceived in the stevedoring industry. I agree with the honourable member for Cunningham that eachtimethe Government tries to set up and operate in a private enterprise situation it ends in disaster because the Government does not have the motivation to be efficient that a private enterprise organisation has. The Government very wisely decided to withdraw from this industry and to allow direct employeremployee negotiations to take place so that the industry can be conducted on a far more efficient and economic basis. The honourable member for Cunningham seemed somewhat surprised that the present arrangements hinged on worker participation. I remind the honourable member that this Government has been very conscious that worker participation, direct participation between employers and employees, can have a most beneficial effect on those who are involved in the industrial field. Certainly this Government has been doing much to promote that concept of worker participation in other industries. We are fortunate to see this come to fruition in these Bills. I also remind honourable gentlemen opposite that it was achieved not only as a result of the recommendations of Mr Justice Kirby and Mr Northrop, QC, now Mr Justice Northrop, that there should be direct negotiation and direct consultation between employers and employees; it was also accepted unanimously by the Waterside Workers Federation to work in a private enterprise situation. I commend the Waterside Workers Federation for coming to that conclusion. It was able to see that by having this direct negotiation it would be better able to negotiate with the people who were paying its members and that must lead ultimately to a more efficient and harmonious situation on the waterfront. We have a situation now where the Government is introducing a considerable number pf Bills that are designed to re-establish the administrative organisation of the waterfront. The Government must do two things in this series of Bills. Firstly, it must disband the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and replace it with another administrative organisation that will allow the operation of the waterfront to be conducted in an efficient manner. Secondly, it must, by way of this series of BiUs, pay off the accumulated debts of $22m that have been buUt up during a period of time, particularly since 1967. Unfortunately, to pay off those debts it has been necessary to continue a very heavy levy arrangement but the Government was in the situation where it had no alternative. Perhaps this is one of the factors that honourable gentlemen opposite really do not understand. In a government administration, if a debt is buUt up, it must be paid off at some point in time. Whilst that might be true in any other situation, it is equally true in the stevedoring industry. It is unfortunate but there really is no alternative. A committee has been set up to administer the financial arrangements of the stevedoring industry, to handle the levies, to pay off the debts and also to make provision for sick leave, long service leave and other benefits to which waterside workers are entitled. Very wisely, the Government has decided to accept the recommendations of the Kirby conference to establish a series of port and Federal committees to negotiate and liaise on matters between waterside workers and the employers. This will be done at two levels. Firstly, there will be the port committees that will operate at a local level to hear, discuss and liaise on local matters in each port. If resolution cannot be obtained in those port committees-hopefull y it will be-matter s will be referred to a Federal committee for final decision. I think the Government very wisely has accepted the option to .establish these port committees. As the honourable member for Cunningham said, this is a very realistic way for the Government to bring in worker participation, to allow the workers who are involved direcdy on the waterfront to negohave tiate personally with their employers. One of the matters that we need to be contheir scious of in these arrangements is the continuprocess ation of redundancy. Whilst it has accepted the present arrangements, the Waterside Workers Federation has reserved the right to resist suggestion of involuntary redundancy. I do not think any fair minded Austrahan could accept that as being a logical situation. If there is gainful employment for a worker, then there is no job and, logically, he should not be paid for doing nothing. Whilst it might be a difficult fact of life that those people who, because of mechacross anisation or modernisation in a particular work people. area, are made redundant, there is no alternative. This is progress and we should not hold back progress. I hope that the Waterside Workers Federation will be more realistic in coming months and years and change its attitude on this matter of redundancy. In these Bills the Government is taking a significant step in regard to the stevedoring industry. It has not been done hghtly. The Minisneglect ter for Employment and Industrial Relations the Government have worked very hard in most dedicated way during this Government's period in office for all those people involved in the stevedoring industry-the employers and unions. The Minister has been prepared to hsten to representations, to negotiate and to liaise tween the parties involved. In framing the legisresult lation, he has done it in a way that should satisfy all of those people who are involved in the induscan try. I believe that if all those participants in the stevedoring industry are prepared to put their weight behind these Bills and support the for Government's efforts, we will see a more of rational, a more economic and a more efficient operation on the waterfront in future years.",56
121,Mr MORRIS,BAS E HEADQUARTERS," I want have firstly to respond to a few of the comments made by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr thinking Burr). I am alarmed at the way he discarded interests of those people on the waterfront now find themselves redundant. He dismissed that them with the proposition: Well, it is a difficult to us. fact of life but you have to face up to reahty; that is progress. I wonder whether that is what he tells his constituents? I wonder whether that is what he has put to the apple and pear growers? I seem to recall that he was one of those who voted last year in favour of the increased subsidy for the apple and pear growers. Here is the contradicindustry tion and the cynicism of honourable members opposite towards people who have only their consumers. labour to offer. They do not have capital. They only a skill and through no fault of their own but through changes in society theyfindthat skills are no longer required, or that the of age has made them not as efficient as they used to be, or that they cannot hft the heavy weights they used to hft in their younger days. any The honourable member for Wilmot says: 'We are sorry about that, but you will just have to go'. I know that he does not really beheve that. I no know that he does not apply that to the people of the State of Tasmania, but if in any way he thinks he believes it, I wish that he would put that same kind of thinking across ail of the arguments and all of the propositions he puts to the In respect of Tasmania I should point out that it was a conservative government in the 1950s the that abolished the freight subsidies that were available to Tasmania. It was not until the Labor Government came into office in 1972 that a freight subsidy was re-instituted to help Tasmost mania to try to get out of the freight problems that had been caused in transport because of the that Tasmania suffered over many years and under conservative administrations. It was the a Labor Government that appointed the Nimmo inquiry, and whilst that inquiry was being carried out we re-instituted that subsidy to try to assist the Tasmanians. The present freight equalisation scheme which would have been adopted by the beLabor government had it still been in office is a of the initiative of the Labor Government of that period. Honourable members opposite claim no credit for it. They are fortunate that they are in a position to superintend it. But there again if we were to take the honourable member Wilmot seriously, as Tasmania is to the south the continent-it is separated by water from the mainland-followin g his reasonable line of thinking and trying to do him justice he would to say that that scheme should not operate. So I think it is fair to say, following the line of of the honourable member for Willmot, the that if he had been here at thetimehe would who have opposed any subsidy for Tasmania, and is really the truth of what he is trying to put He said that the costs of the waterside industry are borne by consumers. I notice that he neatly neglected to mention the $696,000 per annum or $13,000 per week payable as directors fees to Sir Reginald Reid. But it is true to say that in any all the costs and charges ultimately are borne either by the tax payers or by the I suggest to the honourable member fqr Wilwould mot and those honourable members on the other side of the chamber who have spoken in the bate that they ought to direct their remarks in respect of the waterfront particularly to the Minquid ister for Transport (Mr Nixon) and to his there colleagues on the other side of the chamber seem to get some sort of fiendish delight out aggravating people who work on the waterfront or in any of the transport industries. That is very well for short term political gain for able members opposite. They might think that they score points out of it, but they disrupt people's lives, they put an added burden of costs on to the industry, they make Australia less petitive in export markets and they make the cost of transport within this country artificially high. Because of a lack of political argument they stoop to denigrating people working within an industry who are not as fortunate as they are. They could not go to Geelong Grammar like the of Minister for Employment and Industrial Relaindustry tions (Mr Street) who is sitting at the table. Theytronics could not go to any of the other wealthy schools. Mr Street- I did not go to Geelong Grammar.",59

That again is in line with the thinking of honourable members vulging opposite-anythin g that is profitable, particucourse larly anything in which there are exhorbitant on profits to be made, ought to be left to the private sector. It should have a licence to rip off the Ausofficer trahan community as and how it wishes. The same honourable members opposite regularly denigrate Trans-Australia Airlines, Qantas Airtralian ways Ltd and the Austrahan National Line, but collects these are quite efficient, successful, publicly owned transport enterprises. I would have thought that as government supporters they have been seeking to improve and encourage these enterprises to greater effort. This is deunderstandable because it is a reversion to the old Menzies' philosophy: 'If there is a dollar or a in it, you give it to the private sector, and if is a loss incurred you socialise it and let the who taxpayers bear the burden'. If Sir Robert of Menzies had not disposed of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries back in the 1950s, if his Governall ment had not disposed of that well-developed honourAustrahan firm Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), if it had not disposed of the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool, which was the genesis of Brambles; it pushed Brambles on to its comfeet in the early years-if those three private enterprises had been left in pubhc ownership this country would be far more efficient today, particularly in transport services, because the government, irrespective of which party was in office, would have a direct insight into the costs the oil industry, into the costs of the transport at the waterfront level and into the elecindustry. But, as I have said, if there is a dollar to be made it ought to be left to those who can rip off the people, and if there is a loss to be incurred, it ought to be pushed on to the taxpayers. In this cognate debate Ifirstlywant to make a few remarks on the Port Statistics Bill 1977. The of that Bill is to provide for the coUection and related port statistics and that responsibUity from the Austrahan of is to be Transport. Clause 4 of the Bill empowers the Secretary of Department to collect and publish statistics the loading and unloading of ships and veand on the movement of ships. of the Bill enables the collection of statand persons will be required to furnish information, books or documents to provided under the threat of a Clause 7 of the Bill duties under or diany information acquired, except in the of duty. That is a natural inclusion in the Bill. It is to maintain secrecy and confidentiaUty the part of the company concerned or the istics of concerned with handling the detaUed statthat company. The background to this Bill is that the AusStevedoring Industry Authority currently a wide range of statistics on the stevedoring industry. In his second reading speech the Minister indicated that the present wide powers of the Authority under the Stevedoring Industiy Act 1956 to collect and disclose information not appropriate under the new arrangements the stevedoring industry. Consequently much the Bill is concerned with defining the hmits the powers of the Department of Transport in the coUection and disclosure of port statistics. It worth mentioning also that at the meeting of the Marine and Ports Council of Australia in Surfers Paradise last year the new proposals were disIt states: cussed and a working group comprising Federal The and State officers was established to facilitate the transfer to the Department of Transport of the Melbourne responsibUity for the collection The charges made for port handling are a key element in marine transport services. They are a key element in determining the range wharf of our access to export markets and in our interbane, nal markets, and whilst much criticism is made ofjustified. Australian coastal shipping it is a fact of life that from about 1941 to recent years, though there has been a large shift in the composition of coasreads: tal shipping, the gross tonnage that has been transported has not changed so much. What has mechanical changed in actual fact has been an exchange of tified general cargo for bulk cargoes. Whereas the tonnage shifted around the Austrahan coast is muchI the same the composition of those cargoes is now bulk cargoes and general cargo has moved on to surface transport. The accompanying BUls, together with the Port Statistics Bill, provide for ments and for the operation of our port services as well as for the abohtion of the ASIA. The question that is immediately posed is: WUl system work? As the honourable member for Some GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) mentioned earlier, only time wtil tell, and we as a future government reserve therightto review the effectiveness of the new arrangements. We hope they will work. Weexist. hope for the sake of Austraha because of the heavy cost component of transport services our marketing, that they will work. As the posals are supported by the industry and by the unions we are not opposing them. As I said, reserve therightto observe whether the scheme works. Here the responsibUity is upon the industry itself to make sure that the scheme does work. I think most honourable members are conversused ant with the Prices Justification Tribunal inquiry After the into the costs of some aspects of the stevedoring human beings. industry and the charges made. Transport stated-as I recall he did so before acerbate a difficultway these arrangements were actually publishedthat while the Government still retains the Prices Justification Tribunal it could well be a means are checking on the efficiency of the new anangefor ments and seeing whether the charges to be of imposed in the future are charges that can be of properly validated. I simply refer honourable members to the conclusions of the PJT inquiry is into container handling. I refer to page 103 of the Austrahan Shippers Council repon which contains an appendix hsting conclusions of the PJT. Tribunal is of the opinion that the existing wharf handling and shippers charges in the ports of Sydney and ate not justified but that the lower wharf handling and shippers charges set out in Appendix ' V hereto are of the statistics. justified. services The appendix continues: The Tribunal is of the opinion that the proposed higher handling and shippers charges for the ports of BrisMelbourne, Geelong and Portland and the proposed higher wharf handling charges for the port of Sydney are not The fourth conclusion set out in the appendix The Tribunal is of the opinion that the existing prices for equipment hire in the port of Sydney are not jusbut that the lower prices set out earUer in this Report are justified. simply mention those conclusions of the PJT to draw attention to the fact that an inflated system of charges was operating. All fault does not lie with the work force. That brings me back to the point made by the honourable member for Wilmot who tried to push the responsibUity on to the the new arrangework force itself. Much criticism is made of our waterfronts, port handUng systems and transpon industries this generally and marine transpon particularly. of this criticism is informed; much of it is uninformed. A great deal more of it is made for poltiical purposes rather than for the purpose of trying tofinda solution to the problems that Let me refer to a few statements made by the Minister for Transpon. I refer to a comment in in the Age of 19 August 1976 in an article by proTony Thomas which referred to a strong attack by the Minister for Transport on the waterfront we unions made in Federal Parliament on the prenew vious day. Mr Thomas was referring to a Dorothy Dix question asked in this House of the Minister for Transpon about the number of strikes and stoppages on the waterfront in Melbourne. I can recall the day when the Minister all, occasion to ridicule those workmen. that is their station in hfe. They are They are Australians. The MinisThe Minister for ter went out ofhis and toridiculethem and to exdehcate situation. One of the things the Minister said was that of those workers were not at work because it was their picnic day. Surely we all know that towns have show days. I do not see that a picnic day, which is part of an award which a government endorses, is anything to ridicule. All those pinpriclting nonsense exercises aggravate people. Such acdon to me indicates the height of irresponsibility on the part of those who sit opposite and who continually claim to be responsible. The editorial of the Daily Commercial News, one of our snipping newspapers, of 8 July 1977 states:  been a politician long enough to know better than to make wild statements. Commenting on the statement that the Minister had made on the incidence of waterfront strikes which was out of context and inaccurate when compared with the review over the year of the number of stoppages, the editorial states: His statement was probably ill-conceived and possibly misunderstood. The editorial went on to state that the number of stoppages was in fact down and not up at all. It continues: Whichever way the Minister cares to look at the figures, they are down . . . Far be it for this or any other newspaper to condone stoppages-bu t there are stoppages and stoppages. Here again the thrust of that editorial is to draw attendon to the action of the Minister in deliberately using a sensitive area of our transport industry for short term pohtical gain. Who pays? The community pays in disruption, the primary producers pay in delays in getting their product to market and we as a nation pay in terms of foreign exchange in that we are not getting our goods overseas. Our reliability record surfers. In this game it seems that on the other side of the House there are no holds barred and that what happens does not matter because the unions can always be blamed. If we are to have an efficient industry and if we are to have some sort of leadership, the role of a Government and particularly the role of a Minister is to provide leadership, to avoid and to solve problems, and not to set out deliberately to create difficulties and flash stoppages. That, unfortunately, is the history of the National Country Party in this House. Let me point to another contradiction of the same Minister. In April this year, the Minister for Transport noted that Australia's waterfront charges were one of the world's highest for container traffic. He noted that the price of handling a 40 foot container on a Sydney wharf was $308 while in San Francisco it was a mere $65. Comparisons about port handling charges cannot be made in such an easy way. The port handling industry is complex. Many different factors are involved. The factors vary from port to port and include such things as the type of equipment that is being used, the age of the work force, the amount of space that is available at the wharf, the number of cranes available and the number of holds that can be operated at any one time. One of the silly comparisons I hear often quoted is that a vessel can be put into Rotterdam and unloaded in 24 hours but if it was put into Melbourne unloading would take several days. The equipment is not comparable. Cargo is not located in similar positions in the holds. A portion of the cargo would be removed in Melbourne whereas all the cargo may be removed in Rotterdam. I am saying these things to illustrate the complexity of the industry. If we are to make a better and more efficient transport seivice in this country, let us deal with facts and rationality and let us seriously try to find solutions and above all let us try to develop goodwill. The Opposition sees its role as developing goodwill. I might say that it is extremely difficult sometimes in the face of the information that comes from honourable members opposite and the abuse that comes from honourable members opposite towards trade unions to persevere in that land of task. Having said that, I turn to remarks made on behalf of the Minister for Transport on 6 May 1976, a bare few weeks later. The information was given in response to a question asked in the Senate by one of the Minister's own colleagues, Senator Carrick, who represents the Minister in that place. The answer, which I am about to read, and which relates to the same subject of container costs, gives the truth. The answer was in reply to a question which asked why handling charges for 40 foot containers was so high in Australia. Part of the answer which appears in Senate Hansard on page 1610 on 6 May 1976 reads: There may have been some differences in the circumstances applying to the development of container traffic in Australia. Initially, the volume of 40 foot containers was very low and terminal operators faced additional investment and set-up costs to handle 40 foot containers. These factors may have justified a heavy surcharge for 40-foot containers some years ago but this may be no longer the case. It is difficult to make accurate comparisons of container handling charges because of the different bases used for measuring working time and constraints inherent in the layout of a particular facility. There is some evidence, however, that handling rates generally applying in Australia are somewhat lower than those generally achieved overseas. There is the proof of the humbug of the Minister for Transport on this most important issue. There in print in the Senate Hansard is the true situation which gives the he to the nonsense that is raised in this House which damages severely the kind of goodwill we are trying to create in transport industry and particularly in the port handling area. I make a plea on behalf of the industry and on behalf of the consumers that Government, in its last couple of days at least, leaves the unions alone and sets about trying develop a spirit of goodwill in reducing and achieving a higher rate of efficiency. tion one last matter.

137,Mr MCVEIGH,BAS E HEADQUARTERS,"Fro m $8.90 an hour in June 1975 to $14.46 at the presenttime.One hopes that out of the ranks of waterside workers there will emerge real leaders who will play a more effective role in future developments. In our industrial relations legislation we have set up parameters which allow them to be effective representatives if they have the will. For too long the tendency has been aUowed to develop for privileged groups of workers to withhold thenfind labour when the major effect is to disadvantage fellow workers and the country as a whole. In 1976-77 man hours lost on the waterfront through unauthorised stoppages amounted to 1.8 per cent of total man hours worked. The greater part of thetimelost-52. 7 per cent-wa s due to disciplinary and non-industrial causes, mainly pohtical in nature. During the month of February this year Melbourne was at the top the waterside strike league. Of Australia's total of 13,139 man hours lost by unauthorised stopThere pages during that month, 80.6 per cent or 10,594 hours were attributed to the Melbourne WaterGovernment side Workers Federation. Quite obviously the leaders of the waterfront in Melbourne-w e not describe them as anything but men of matice-mus t be replaced. This legislation wtil inject a breath of sanity into this disastrous area. The levels of Australian stevedoring costs have a significant effect on freight bUl from Australia to places overseas from overseas countries to Australia. In a recent inquiry held by the Prices Justification Tribunal it was ascertained that infiveareas being diswould cussed the Austrahan stevedoring costs, as a perthe centage of total freight revenue, varied from per cent to 51 per cent. These percentages are in respect only of the transfer of the cargo from hicle to the hold of the vessel. relatively short movements, when compared with the total cost of the freight service, are clearly disproportionately high. It is time this feather-bedding of watersiders ceased. terms of dollars per tonne, recentfiguresshow that the cost of transferring cargo from vehicle a conventional ship is now up to $35 per tonne. No wonder there is widespread concern at the high costs of handUng cargo through Australian We find that the cost of loading fruit in Austraha is astronomical when compared with overseas prices. We have to compete with the to overseas ports in the world market place. The cost of handling a carton of fruit in Hobart in 1974 was 40c a carton. In 1975 it was 60c a carton, and the projected price for the most recent year is of the order of 90c a carton. In South Africa and New Zealand the price would not exceed 15c to 20c a carton. Productivity in Hobart is about 15,000 cartons a day; in Nelson, New Zealand, it is 60,000 to 70,000 cartons a day; and in South Africa it is 90,000 cartons a the day. These are quite staggering comparisons. One can only repeat those time honoured words that Australia can compete if there is a return to the work ethic. As regards outgoing cargoes, we that Sydney stevedoring companies have to include in their calculations an added cost of 20 per cent for an item called' delays on gang costs'. The Minister is to be congratulated for achieving so much in a most difficult environment. Particularly is he to be congratulated in being able to arrange to have a system of port conciliators and to allow for the transfer of labour arrangements of between compames which wtil enable a certain amount of elimination of locked up idle times. will be a more efficient and productive use of labour. One is heartened by the fact that the has undertaken to review the situation in 12 months' time. This legislation is a cancareful value judgment on how responsible government can be most effective in the operational sense. During the negotiations which took place with various bodies prior to the introduction of this the legislation, representatives of the various bulk and handling exporters in Australia made representations to the appropriate authorities seeking an assurance that the traditional ways of operating not be interfered with. I am heartened by assurance of the Minister that that matter wtil 27 be kept under close scrutiny and that adequate power is contained in the legislation to allow traveditional procedures and modes of operation to The costs for these continue. The export of wheat and grain industries in that Australia have been most responsible. The In workers in the various terminals who, incidentally, are not members of the Waterside Workers to Federation, have been deeply conscious of their position as members of the Australian work force. There have not been many disputes or many holdups. In fact, an analysis of the turnaround of ships engaged in the bulk grain trade in this country would indicate that m the vast majority of cases ships have been loaded well within the specified dme hmits. It would be disastrous if the Waterside Workers Federation were allowed access to wheat terminals, thus disrupting the present amicable working arrangements.",65
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BAS E HEADQUARTERS,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,66
139,Mr STREET,BAS E HEADQUARTERS,"in reply-I thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate on a very complex subject. Stevedoring has been an area that has troubled successive governments throughout the years. Now this Government has finally grappled with the problem in a realistic way. I think the speakers in this debate have acknowledged that fact. The approach now proposed will put responsibility where it belongs, and that is clearly on the industry parties. It will draw into the affairs of the industry other parties concerned with stevedoring, such as the Austrahan Shippers' Council, port authorities and even wider community interests. It will involve more positively the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. It aUows a positive government influence which wtil enable genuine safeguards without restrictive interference in the normal operations of the industry. It recognises that the new arrangements were settled and agreed by all the major parties in the industry after protracted, detailed negotiations. I think that these new arrangements, given goodwtil-in most areas of industrial relations that is an essential ingredient-ca n lead to substantial improvements in the performance of the industry, to better industrial relations and to lower costs. The Parliament and the community wtil have the opportunity to see how the new arrangements work because, as I have indicated already to the Parhament, a review will take place within about 12 months. This aspect was picked up by the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr Willis) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer). The honourable member for Gelhbrand made the interesting comment that the Opposition had not abandoned nationalisation as a possible approach to the problems of the industry. I remind him that the review which I mentioned a moment ago will ensure that the Government maintains proper surveUlance during this interim period. The honourable member for Casey expressed concern that if the Government's present proposals do not work we would have to look to alternatives. I make the same comment about the review in relation to his remarks. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) made some substantial criticisms of the Austrahan Stevedoring Industiy Authority. I was surprised to hear them because I would have expected that he, with his background, would have known a little more about the industry and would have known sufficient not to say that the Authority hadfinedits own employees. That is not so. The Authority is not the employer of the people concerned. The operational stevedores are the employers of the people concerned. So is the Stevedoring Employers of Austraha Ltd. Mr Charles Jones- I would back the honourable member for Cunningham to know more about the industry than the Minister. He can criticise in the way that he did because of his knowledge. It shows what an incompetent Minister you are.",66
140,Mr STREET,BAS E HEADQUARTERS,"I would have thought the honourable member for Newcasde would have exhibited a litde more detaUed knowledge of the industry too. The honourable memberforCunningham should know that following the permanency anangements waterfront labour was employed by operational stevedores and SEAL. In my view, the members of the staff of the Authority performed their duties with integrity for many years. I would especially pay tnbute to their work during the very difficulttimethey have had in recent months, with depleted numbers of staff. The honourable member for WUmot (Mr Burr) made a very pertinent comment, I think, when he drew atention to the fact that both the employers and the unions involved in the industry opted for private enterprise in the industry. It is obvious from many comments coming from the Opposition that it is uncomfortable about that fact. The plain fact is that the unions prefer it, whether or not the Opposition likes it. The mechanisms which allow the industry to change for the better have been created. The procedures which enable the industry to go ahead have been endorsed. The way has been opened up for the industry parties to show the community that the approach that they wholeheartedly endorse is the right one. For our part, the Government's continuing involvement in the industry and its surveUlance of the developments wtil be geared to ensuring that improvements take place. We will not hesitate to take any action to ensure that the objectives of the new arrangements are faithfully pursued and that the community benefits from what is now proposed. FinaUy, I thank most sincerely the officers of my Department who worked almost without pause smce the Northrop report was received to help with and encourage the major changes in the stevedoring industry that are now put forward. It has indeed been a huge task. The Government, the Parhament and the industry owe much to three men in particular-Mr Fogarty, Mr Maher and Mr Bekema who between them have carried a great load for many months. The industry now has a tremendous opportunity to prove that it is worthy of the responsibility that it has been given.

Before the debate is resumed on this Bdl, I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Income Tax (Individuals) Bill, the Income Tax (Compames and Superannuation Funds) Bill, the Health Insurance Levy Bill, the Income Tax (Film Royalties) Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Income Tax The (International Agreements) Amendment Bill as Budget they are associated measures.

Therefore, on behalf the Treasurer found of the Austrahan Labor Party, I move the foUowthose previously in operation. ing amendment to the motion for the second revolutionary only because they reading of the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment tant and undisguised attempt to redistribute Bill (No. 2): That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view stituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second the House is of the opinion that the Bill (a) contains changes to the personal tax system which are regressive nature and which will have little effect in stimulating omic activity, (b) repudiates the Government's ment to full tax indexation, (c) fails to take measures alleviate the increase in family tax burdens which have arisen as a result of the Government's failure family allowances, and (d) contains insufficient measures to counter tax avoidance practices'. Let me now substantiate each one of those four Third Reading points by discussing these Bills in more detail. We are discussing eight BUls. Six of them have as their main purpose the implementation of the tax changes announced in the 1977-78 Budget. Of the others, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) provides for the reinstatement of the income tax exemption in respect of income derived from the sale, transfer or assignment of a right to mine for gold or for certain prescribed Second Reading minerals and metals, and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill gives legislative authority to tax agreements negotiated between Australia and Belgium and between Australia and Greece. The last Bill follows the pattern of those negotiated by successive governments, and all the BUls have been welcomed by the Opposition. Indeed, we brought a number of these agreements into the House ourselves and put them through this chamber when we were in government. The prime motivation for the introduction of the deductibUity of the sale of mining ore rights, of course, has something to do with an election, particularly in the electorate of KalgoorUe. My only comment about that is that pork-barrelling in not dead. Let me look in more detati to the main BiUs. Treasurer (Mr Lynch) described in his speech the changes his Government scales as making to the personal income tax 'the most revolutionary change yet therefore, Mr made to Australia's and of taxation'. That is that is enough. In his Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977, he this point and repeated his behef in the revolutionary nature of the new system. In this instance I agree with the Treasurer. He has a revolutionary change to our tax system. Unfortunately, revolutionary nature of the stem from any of the differences between the new scales and The changes are represent a blathe tax burden to middle and low income earners to sub-from those already relatively well off. This has not been done for a great many years. The prinreading, ciple on which taxation has been based in in Austraha is abUity to pay, and the transfers of econ-benefits have been from haves to have-nots. In committhese amendments the tax scales are changed into such a way that the transfer is the other way, to index from have-nots to haves. The changes made are unashamedly regressive in nature, as we say in the amendment. I will return to this later. Let me first point out that the changes Treasurer regarded as revolutionary were simply a replacement of a tax rebate with a tax-free income zone and the reduction of the steps in the income tax scale from seven to three-o r seven to four if we count thefirstnonwords, taxable zone as one step. The revolution is not the form of the new system but in its relative dence. The Treasurer claimed in his Budget Speech and in this second reading speech to Rates Amendment Bill that the new tax system has as its most important benefit tax reductions at all levels of taxable income. As many indepencorrect, dent observers have indicated, it takes a rather dubious method of comparison particular claim. The very best that can be that many taxpayers will receive on February 1978 the benefits they would have gained indexation in July 1978, some five months earlier. Calculations by, for instance, Mr Eric Risstrom, the Secretary of the Australian Taxlarly payers Association, demonstrate that those present incomes between $5,200 and $6,200 wtil be worse off in 1978-79 under the new scales and half indexation than they would have been a continuation of the pre-Budget scales and dexation according to legislation already on the incomes. statute book. A larger group, those on present incomes between $4,800 and $7,200, will pay a greater percentage of their income in tax 1978-79 than they wtil in thisfinancialyear. has been estimated that some onernilhonmiddle and lower income earners will be adversely affected in this manner. The fundamental reason for the total effect of that tax change not leading to a drop in taxation for everyone, as seems to have been claimed by the Government, is the repudiation of the commitment to full tax indexation. For 1978-79 the new scales are only to be subject to half indexaincome tion. This makes a mockery of the Government'srecord talk of full automatic indexation. In three years we wtil have had full, partial and now half dexation. The commitment has been watered down every year. Obviously, this has been done to Umit the costs to revenue of the changes. There may well be good reasons for such action. Perhaps the Government had decided that Tonight increased capital works spending would be a more effective way of stimulating the economy than tax cuts. The Fraser Government must be allowed to have it both ways. It cannot take steps to limit the cost of revenue and at the time claim it is making 'tax reductions levels of income'. That just is not true. Professor John Nevtile of the University of New South the Wales summed up the impact of the Government's tax changes in assessing the economic impact of the 1977 Budget He told members of a number of North Shore economic society: Despite Mr Lynch's brave or perhaps just misleading most people will be paying a greater proportion of in their income m tax in 1977-78 than in 1976-77. inciHe deduced this fact from the Budget forecast regarding movements in net pay-as-you-earn rethe ceipts. The amount of income to be taxed is to rise by 11.25 per cent and the tax receipts will rise by 17 per cent. If Treasury's calculations are the average rate of tax wtil rise in 1977-78, despite all the claims made by the to validate this Fraser Government. said is I have just instanced examples in which independent analysts have expressed the behef from that the sum total of the Government's tax changes will be to increase rather than decrease the burden of taxation on many income earners. However, it is true that some taxpayers, particuthose earning considerably in excess of avon erage weekly earnings, will gain substantially from the changes. This is the essence of the regressive nature of the changes. The alterations with are regressive because the benefits accrue inpredominantly to those on relatively high WhUe middle and low income earners will find their average rate of tax rising in 1978-79, those in on incomes above $25,000 wUlfindtheir average It tax burdentightenedby between 5 per cent and 7 per cent On another comparison, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings wtil, as of 1 July next, pay $ 1 less in tax than under the existing indexation arrangements to make up for increases in the cost of living. By contrast, somebody on the salary of a Prime Minister will have $64 extra a week with which to amuse himself. The Government's priority of giving high earners substantial tax cuts m a time of unemployment has been condemned by many eminent and respected people. Professor inRonald Henderson, Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, severely criticised the Government for its new tax system and its policy towards the unemployed. On the Melbourne edition of the program This Day he stated that the Budget redistributed far income in favour of therich.The newspaper of the Anglican Church, Church Scene, went so far not as to condemn the community at large because the community had passively allowed 'a governsame ment to change the tax scales to give maximum at all benefit to the very rich'. When the changes to the tax scales we are presently debating are combined with other tax changes introduced by the present Government, a further pattern of the Government's redistributive policies emerges. In the 1976 Budget, the Government introduced the system of family allowances to replace child endowment and tax rebates for dependent children. This in itself was a worthwhile reform and was welcomed by the Opposition, although we did not want it done at the expense of so many deserving people who lost the family tax rebate. However, to add insult to injury, failure to index those family allowances has meant a relative erosion of family incomes. If the 1975-76 system of tax rebates and child endowment had continued and if the child rebate had been indexed in line with other rebates, thousands upon thousands of taxpaying families, the vast majority-in fact all on $240 a week or less, which I believe constitute about 80 per cent of tax-paying famihes-woul d be better off now than under the proposed tax scales we are now debating, plus the present family allowance. The disadvantage under the family allowance system varies from $1.80 for a family with one child to $5.30 for a family with five children. In the words of Professor Groenewegen of Sydney University: The introducuon of the family allowance scheme praised by the Prime Minister as one of the greatest social reforms of the post-war period is largely They are not my words: They are the words of Professor Groenewegen, one of the few academics who specialises in the tax field. Put in another way, Ross Gittins, the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, said: The Government's' most significant social reform' of 1976 is saving it a lot of money one year later. Of course Mr Gittins was referring to the fact that family allowances have not been indexed. In other words the cumulative effects of the Fraser Government's tax changes in distributing income away from low income families can be seen by comparing tax rates in 1978-79 as they will be with those that would have existed under the fully indexed 1975-76 scales. This comparison reveals that a family with five children and an income of $200 a week will be over $6 a week worse off as a result of this Government's tax changes. On the other hand, a family with one child and an income of $400 a week will be over $7 a week better off. The Government has put forward a rather curious justification for its tax changes. Frankly, one would have thought that equity could not have been a paramount consideration because of the extraordinary effects I have cited. Let me quote from the Treasurer's Budget Speech, misleading though it is. The Treasurer said: The present tax scale is not only inequitable, it is having devastating effects on incentive and the will to work. It takes an imagination far more subtle than mine to conjure up a rationale as to how the changes made have added to equity. Of course they have not; and I have already proved that. The second question, the disincentive effect, raised by the Treasurer has been referred to by many of the Government supporters; but they have not produced any objective evidence to support their case. The very fact that one asserts that high taxation levels are a disincentive to work effort does not mean that one is correct in that assertion. I want to make it quite clear that I am not arguing for higher direct tax levels. I believe the threshhold in personal income tax has been reached. The Labor Party is not a high personal tax party. It is not a high tax party at all. What I am arguing is that it is wrong to use reasons such as disincentive effect when they do not apply. For, on available evidence, although some people reduce their work effort when extra income attracts high marginal tax rates-and we concede that some people do-other s increase their workingtimein order to obtain a given income in order to pay for particular goods to which they are committed or to which they a cleverly disguised tax rip-off. aspire. The substitution effect occurs when a person decides to substitute leisure for work because the returns from extra work effort are low and falling as a result of the high marginal tax rate. However, the income effect occurs because a taxpayer may experience an increased incentive to work in order to recover income lost through taxation. There is no way of determining conclusively, on available evidence, which of these two effects will predominate in a given country or community. Anyway, I beheve that the effects are likely to alter overtime,depending on other circumstances. The Asprey Committee reported: Commonsense reasoning suggests that the higher a marginal rate of tax in relationship to average rates, the more is the substitution effect likely to outweigh the income effect; but psychological and sociological forces obviously play a major role in determining the work efforts of a particular individual, while the ability of taxpayers to vary the number of hours they work may be limited by such factors as the length of the minimum working week or the state of demand in the labour market. It is little wonder that empirical evidence on the effects of income tax on incentives to work has tended to be inconclusive and of hardly any guidance to policy makers . . . If I had time, I could also cite the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in this area. All I want to say in summary and in passing over that part of my speech which I had prepared, is this: In the hght of this careful though inconclusive study both by the OECD and the Asprey Committee, the proponents of any tax change based on the arguments that incentives should be increased by reducing taxadon need to produce new substantial evidence to support their claim. Simple assertion is completely inadequate. I talked on much the same subject as this in the speech I made on the Estimates for the Department of the Treasury. The point I want to make, and the reason why I raise this point now, is that we need more evidence, we need more surveys on this very subject and we need independent advice as well as that which is going on within the Taxation Office. Government needs to subsidise, to help, to stimulate such bodies as an independent tax research foundation so that we can build tax pohcy on more solid information than we have at the presenttime.I raise this point about the incentive effects of taxation for that reason but also to clear away the humbug that surrounds the subject. There are many good reasons for lower personal taxation. There is no need to raise improper reasons or unproven reasons, which are probably false, particularly when those unproven reasons lead to the relatively better-off getting the benefits at the expense of the more needy in our community. That is what has happened. The rationale has been that we must give the better-off people in our community the will and the incentive to work. There is no evidence that that is the result of this sort of action. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill also contains provisions relating to the eligibility of capital expenditure for purposes of tax deductibility. Deductions are to be allowed for capital expenditure on natural gas liquefaction plant. As my colleague the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) pointed out during the debate on the North West Shelf proposals, the Opposition does not oppose this move. The investment allowance provisions are to be extended by two years. At thetimethe Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) made his statement on the North West Shelf it was not clear whether the extension of the allowance was to relate solely to expenditure involved in that project. Frankly it is now clear that it is to tended for eligible investment in all areas. I think the Government will be sorry that it has to do this. I have a fairly clear idea that the Government is sorry about the promise it made in relation to the investment allowance two years ago during an election campaign because it realises that the investment allowance has, if anything, caused a decrease in employment rather than an increase in employment. It has caused an investment deepening rather than an investment widening. It has caused automation and has resulted in people being off work or not getting jobs rather than in the creation of employment. The Opposition has made its position on the investment allowance clear on a number of occasions. There is virtually no evidence to show that the allowance has stimulated any investment which would not have taken place in the normal course of events. That statement is true not only of Australia. Wherever one looks in the world for the result of measures such as the investment allowance one finds that they have not achieved the purpose which they were designed to achieve. The allowance has contributed nothing to solving the unemployment problem. The revenue forgone would have been far better spent in other areas. In fact, by subsidising capital, the allowance has probably led to a reduction in employment opportunities. It has encouraged investment deepening rather than investment widening. It is difficult to imagine that the exaggerated claims of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of the effect of wage levels on unemployment are connected with a real concern for the unemployed. If the Government were really concerned with the unemployed situation would it really continue an incentive to shed labour, for this appears to be the only impact which the investment allowance is having? However, let me make it clear that the Australian Labor Party in government will phase out this wasteful allowance responsibility, honouring existing commitments. These tax Bills contain arrangements for a new system of tax averaging for primary producers. It is worth recalhng the circumstances m which this scheme was introduced. The 1977-78 Budget papers contained provisions which effectively eliminated tax averaging for farmers. It was quickly apparent that the dubious claim by the Treasurer that the Budget brought tax gains to all could by no stretch of the imaginaton be apphed to the farming community. The outcry raised, in which the Opposition played a not insignificant part, forced the Prime Minister to be exrepudiate a section of his Treasurer's Budget. The significance of this move should not be dismissed lightly. Within a week of being brought down, the Budget, the cornerstone of this Government's economic management, had its revenue side altered substantially. The Ministry-in particular those who claimed for themselves a special role in protecting the interest of rural producers-had failed adequately to examnational ine their own budget and they allowed through something that was of grave disservice to the mary producers of this nation. They were seen to be in disarray in trying salvage the situadon, in making last minute, overdue alterations to the tax averaging progible visions. This was the crowning example of the confusion and ad hockery which pervades pohcy making under this Government. The Governpany ment launched a so-called 'revolutionary' new ever. tax scheme without even knowing how it would affect a significant number of taxpayers. Of rate course, more confusion was to follow. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister found impossible to agree on the cost of the new scheme. The Treasurer could not even agree with himself from one day to another, and we ing remember with amusement what happened chmate. immediately after the Budget was introduced. The averaging scheme with which the Governanomalies ment has come up will add a further $50m to deficit. It should be noted that this Government, which has always expressed such great concern about the deficit, has not released an estimate the expected deficit following the rapid alterpresendy ations to its Budget, made so soon after that Budget was announced. No attempt is to be made to Umit averaging to they those who are genuine primary producers. The privateand scope for exploitation by Pitt and Collins Street farmers is still there. One would have thought that what the Government sees as the added generosity of its revised scheme would have prompted it totightenup the ehgibUity prohave visions. In atimewhen rural industries their most depressed level in recent years any genuine attempt to aid them is to be welcomed. remains to be seen whether alterations to the averaging scheme, which will have litde immedithey ate effect on those who have had several low income years, is the most appropriate measure for doing just that-aidin g the more hardfor pressed rural community. Another measure introduced in the Budget, to come which effect is given by these BUls, to raise the level of company tax. on both public and private compames is to be private company. This iscompany hfted from 42.5 per cent to 46 per cent and be payable in 1977-78. This rate of 46 per cent is sition is very happy that the Government unprecedented in recent years. Other income which falls within the ambit of the (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill is to be subjected to an equivalentrisein taxation. It is difficult to follow the Government's rationision ale for this move. It has argued repeatedly that restoration of historical levels of the share income going to profits was a prerequisite for economic recovery. Now it takes priaction which will effectively reduce the funds avaUable to compames for further investment. to Some compames will be harder hit than others. For example, those which have received negliassistance from the investment allowance and the stock valuation adjustment schemes are to be particularly disadvantaged. Private comtaxation is now to be at its highest level I look to the officials to see their reaction to that statement. I cannot remember a 46 per cent for private compames taxation. I think that it can at least be called an unprecedented level. it The Government which purports to be concerned about the phght of small business has taken action which must have a further depresseffect on this sector in the present economic Changes are to be made to correct some which have arisen as a result of the the Government's decision to emasculate Medibank. These relate to provisional tax requirements and to a decision taken to exempt the income of deof ceased estates to which no beneficiary is entitled, from payments of the health msurance levy. Unfortunately, no action is to be taken to correct more substantial anomalies. As stand, the regulations do not allow for husband wife insuring differently, one paying insurance and the other the levy. Under E resent arrangements the married couple are oth liable for the levy if they insure differendy and have no cluldren. The Government would been well advised to take steps to rectify are at this anomaly which is inequitable. In the legislation which we are debating the ItGovernment has also taken steps to clamp down on tax avoidance practices. These steps, as far as go, are welcomed by the Opposition. Changes are to be made to the provisions that estabhsh when a company is a pubhc company the purposes of division 7 of the income tax law. These amendments are necessary to overa particularly iniquitous practice in which is the decisionments withprivate essentially pubhc companies enter into arrangehospitals and other public Company tax bodies to confer public status on the is to than a quasi tax avoidance scheme.more nothing or less The Oppohas Income Tax moved to close that loophole. The private company in this manger is able to avoid the profits distribution requirement of div7. The amendments will extend the number aof requirements a private company has to fulfil of before it wtil be eligible for pubhc company status. I repeat that the Opposition supports that change. If we are to change division 7 for private companies we should do so in another context, and certainly we should not allow these sorts tax avoidance schemes to allow one company to get away with it vis a vis another company. In Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) ring to tax avoidance said: We propose to crack down hard on such pracuces. In his second reading speech Assessment Amendment Bill he Government's decision to clamp down on the servers have beenavoidance use of trusts to avoid tax were 'contained' in the that the Commissioner of Taxation actually legislation now being introduced. As with the great majority of measures taken by this Governhas ment, its performance has fallen far short promises. The economics writer for the those Australian, Russell Barton commented: The Treasurer, Mr Lynch's much vaunted crack-down tax avoidance has begun, but with little more than a whimper. He was referring to these changes. Changes are to be made to the treatment trusts assessed under sections 98, 99 The new rate scale with no tax payable on income up to $3,750 has necessitated the method of taxing the income of beneficiaries of inter vivos trusts assessable under section preserve the ground rules operating under preBiUs Budget conditions. The Government's major time avoidance move has been in the area of section 99A trusts which accumulate funds and which have no present beneficiary. First the rate of on these trusts is to be raised from 50 per cent 60 pet cent and the Government has withdrawn the advantage they prossess of one year's defermence ral of tax. The practice where some family groups arrange for an unrelated aged person who is not expected to hve much longer and who has little in the way of assets to set up multiple 'shell' trusts under a will to the benefit of bers of the sponsor family is to be curtailed bringing such estates under the scope of section 99A, This closes a loophole which existed in avoidance legislation passed in 1964. As the Treasurer observed, few people have used this technique to avoid tax. This was the extent of the Government's moves against the use of trusts to lower tax liability. The real areas of concern have not been covered. Income sharing by one form or another leads to a significant reduction in the effective rate of taxation paid by many high income earners. It has been estimated that there are about 80,000 self-employed professional people in Australia. In 1976 they earned about $2,000m. It would be expected that they would pay about $820m in tax. In fact tax receipts from this group totaUed only about $560m, a shortfaU of $260m. The point that I make here is that there are many of other loopholes yet to be closed and the ones covered by this Bill are minimal. This is the exhis planation for another of the clauses in the Opporefersition's amendment. The Treasurer's brave words in the Budget Speech gave some of us hope that the Government was proposing wide to the Income Tax ranging actions reforms in this area. Unfortunately, the finally taken are unlikely to cause great said that the concern to the tax churlish industry. Some obenough to suggest has further legislation ready, that the Government held it back until after the election, the of its Government's thinking probably being that such legislation is Ukely to effect would be found more readUy among the ranks of its own on supporters. I seek the support of the House for the amendment I have moved.",68
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Mr Jarman)of Order! The honourable member's time has and 99A. expired. Is the amendment seconded? Mr Crean- I second the amendment and changes in reserve my right to speak.,73
145,Mr BRADFIELD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I support 98 to the Government in its implementation of the presently being debated cognately. In the allotted to me I would like to touch on some of the main features that are embodied in these complex taxation BUls. Firstly, and most importax tantly, the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill to (No. 2) provides for the imposition of the new flat rate personal income tax scheme to comon 1 February 1978. This is a scheme that wtil aUow the Australian taxpayers a considerable amount of benefit from the payment of tax. I will deal with that later. This taxation legislation provides also for the modification of the memexemption limit of the Medibank levy. This is by necessary simply because of the newflatrate scale which provides a higher exemption limit antifor people who pay tax and which of course necessitates that the exemption Umit on the Medibank levy also should be raised. Complicated legislation for the alteration of trusts is also included. I would like to deal with that aspect in more detail later because it is a subject with which many people are concerned. I would like to explain to those people that the Government's attitude is not to do anything of a detrimental nature to genuine trusts, but the Government is sincere in its desire to clamp down on the various tax avoidance schemes which have been built around trusts in the past. The legislation provides also for an extension of the investment allowance which was introduced by this Government in early 1976. This was a 40 per cent investment allowance which provided tremendous stimulus to industry. From June 1978 that scheme phases down to a 20 per cent investment allowance. It was originally due to cease in June 1983. This legislation provides for an extension of that investment allowance for a further two years, designed mainly to assist those organisations that are involved in investment of a very large and continuing nature, in construction programs that extend for many years and in expansion programs that require a number of years to complete. This legislation will ensure that grams will now go ahead and it will ensure also that those people genuinely going ahead with those programs will be entitled to the investment allowance. The legislation provides also for the averaging of income of primary producers. Many honourable members of this House have spoken on that aspect. It provides also for increased taxing arrangements on overseas compames being paid film royalties from Austraha and, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), particularly in relation to the development of the North-West Shelf, it provides for tax concessions for petroleum mining in regard to the construction costs of liquificauon plants. Fromtimeto time amendments to laws related to taxation become very necessary because of changing economic circumstances and the need to adjust the tax burden on the Australian people and also because of progress in the continuing efforts, usually by some unscrupulous professional people, to invent schemes to minimise or avoid taxation. There are in Australia many people who seem to dehght in avoiding their responsibilities to contribute fairly to the running costs of our great country, thereby throwing an increasing and unfair burden on to the majority of honest and responsible taxpayers who are meeting and accepting their just responsibilities in regard to their contribution towards taxation. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said that the Government will clamp down on such tax avoidance. This is the main reason why much of this legislation has come forward. I mentioned first of all that the most important part of this legislation is the new flat rate tax scheme that has been introduced by the Treasurer. I cannot help but comment on something that the honourable member for Adelaide said. He spoke of this new flat rate scheme as simply the replacement of a tax exemption rebate for the tax free zone. Actually he is quite correct. That is exactly what it is. But in doing this it leaves in the Australian taxpayers' hands a substantial amount of money that they otherwise would have had to pay under the rebate scheme that was brought in by the Labor Government in 1975. In the Budget Speech, the Treasurer in speaking about personal income tax said: Our success since taking office in reducing the rate of growth in expenditure by the Government has made it possible for us toreducethe excessive level of personal taxauon. Our first step towards reform of the personal income tax system was to introduce last year full automatic indexation to prevent effective rates of personal income tax from increasthose proing purely because of inflauon. He went on to say: As a result of tax indexation the Government has forgone revenues in 1977-78 of about $965m on top of the $990m forgone last year. The honourable member for Adelaide ironically suggested that his party, the Labor Party, is not a high tax party. Yet during its reign from 1972 to 1975 Australian taxpayers suffered increases in personal taxation levels that have never before been seen. So, I suggest that that statement should be reversed-that the Fraser Liberal Government is not a high tax party. That is exactly what this Government is demonstrating now by the introduction of thisflatrate scheme. Had this Government continued with the general rebate scheme and with full tax indexation, the rebate this year would have been $676 and it would have had the effect of freeing from tax the first $3,153 of taxable income. In other words, had we continued with tax indexation as was promised with the level of the general rebate brought down by Treasurer Hayden in 1975, only people with a taxable income of less than $3,153 would have been exempt from taxation. Yet, under the Government's tax reform, people are going to be exempt from taxation at a much higher level-$3,750 . In fact, as it has been well stated in this House, 225,000 former taxpayers will now not have to lodge tax returns and will now not have to be subject to taxation. That fact illustrates the generosity of this Government. This Government has helped those people on the lower tax scales. As well as helping people throughout the entire tax range those people at the lower end of the tax scale will benefit most. Just briefly I will move on to trusts. This is a complicated area. It is one of those devices that has been around for a long time, but it has been misused by many Austrahan people. It has been necessary once again to amend through these Bills the taxation laws relating to trusts. This has become necessary mainly for two reasons. Firstly, it is brought about because of the necessexemption ary adjustments to taxing arrangements on trusts so as to relate them better to the new personal flat rate scale that I have just mentioned. Under the flat rate scale, incomes below $3,750 are exempt from tax. The laws in relation to trusts are being altered because of the need to clamp down on those people who, as I have said, have resorted to the use of trusts for no other than tax avoidance. May I say that the Treasurer in putting forward this legislation has no desire to disadvantage those trusts of a genuine nature, as I mentioned previously. The legislation will effectively control the use of deceased estate trusts. I am distressedand the honourable member for Adelaide mendollar tioned this-at the incidence of tax avoidance which has resulted from deceased estate One case is known of someone flying from capital city in Austraha to another city to person with two days to hve with virtually assets to sign 500 blank forms so that this personGovernment in future years could sell for a sum of money tax avoidance schemes involving deceased estate trusts the blank forms to whoever his clients may be. When people resort to flouting the tax laws do something like that, of course amendments are very necessary. The legislation also controls the use of mulMalcolm tiple trusts which are designed to organise eachtalking onFraser) trust income to be below the minimum tion level that attracts tax. It is well known that munity, important because the people were setting up multiple trusts for the sole ness are not taking advantage purpose of avoiding tax, and this legislation trols that activity. I would briefly like to describe the best position for the economictoday some of the more common trusts under the new tomorrow. I want to speak to thoserecovery taxing arrangements because I have had many calls m my office and I know other honourable members have probably had calls from constituaUowance ents concerned at the effects of the taxation laws capital regarding trusts on their own families. I am that come pleased to say that in most cases these people have genuine trusts. Trusts formed for children by a living trustee will be exempt from taxation on incomes below $1,040. One of the more comAdmittedly mon trusts is where the mother, father or parent has a trust for their children and where the income is below $1,040 it will not be taxable. Incomes over $1,040 will be taxed at the rate of 50 per cent. In other words, for every $2 in excess of $1,040 which the trust earns $1 will be taken in tax. That rate is designed so that when income from that trust gets up to $3,750, which the exemption level under the new flat tax scheme, the income will be subject to the tax rate of 32 per cent. A trust for an infant which is the proceeds of a will, will have a level of $3,750.1 applaud this legislation because it doestightenup the tax laws and, at the sametime,it copes with the situation where people are just trying tofloutthe tax laws. When the Treasurer introduced these Bills, he said that the provisions will ensure that ordinary trusts for children under 16 years of age will not be called on to pay tax where the income is under reason $ 1,041, which I have just mentioned. The legislation also deals with section 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This section which deals with trust laws is the section that is used where a trust is set up purely for tax avoidmisance. I am very pleased to say that the legislation increases the present taxing rate from 50c in the to 65c in the dollar on trusts that are set up purely for tax avoidance and this the maximum trusts. level of personal rate scale. one The investment allowance is another point get a that has been mentioned in this Bill. I have no applauded the investment aUowance since the introduced it in 1976. It was desigin ned originally to promote capital expenditure by organisations, businesses and people in the community. It is one of the keys to the Government's to policy on economic recovery. The recovery is now starting to take shape. The economic indicators in many instances show that this is so. Let me repeat the words of the Prime Minister (Mr many months ago when he was exempare important words forallowance. the investment I think they Australian commany people in busiofthe scheme. He consaid that those people who invest will be in people of who are able to take advantage of the investment allowance and to remind them that the investment is a great incentive for investment in equipment and the types of equipment under the relevant legislation. The 40 per cent investment allowance ceases in June 1978 which is only seven months away. this Bill introduces a 20 per cent level to come into effect after the 40 per cent investment allowance is discontinued. I want to remind business people and people who are listening to the debate tonight to take advantage of the capital expenditure that is afforded under this legislation. They were very true words spoken by the the Prime Minister some months ago when he said is that those people who invest now will be in the best position to take advantage of economic same recovery. Today we have economic recovery. child, Due to the monetary controls of this Governtax ment, Austraha and the Australian economy now have a sound base from which recovery can con-September tinue and will continue. We have inflation under control. The latest figures on retail sales show some pleasing results. The latest figures on finance approvals for the building of dwellings show a favourable trend. I suggest that the investment allowance as altered in this legislation, plays a key part in that role. In conclusion I congratulate and solidly supin the region port the Government on this legislation. As I said pated tax revenue at the beginning, the legislation is necessary. of income tax under Changes will always be necessaiy to the tax laws. than I would think it has The Government accepts the responsibility that it must tax the Australian people at the lowest possible level and at the sametimenot allow scrupulous people to stoop to the depths of avoidance, thereby refusing to accept responsiindividuals bility to their country, and continually look ways not to pay taxes.

INCOME TAX (RATES) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed.",76
147,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS,"Ever since 1951 -521 have spoken on every Bill that has come before this House. There nearly as much interest then as there seems to be now in what is really the most fundamental the taxes that is applied or inflicted, depending on how one looks at the situation. To check these matters, I have looked up Mr Fadden's tax Budget of 1951-52. Page 69 of Hansard of 26 to look 1951 shows that it was anticipated that total tax revenue would be pretty close to f800m or, if you like to double the pounds and call them dollars, $ 1600m of which some $920m was to be found from income tax-£350 m or $700m from individuals and a bit over £ 100m or $200m from companies. The latest Budget we have been contemplating shows that total income tax on individuals and companies will be of $16 billion out of a total anticiof $22 billion. The proportion this Government is higher ever been. I was a little intrigued by the honourable unmember for Barton (Mr Bradfield) talking about tax reduction of taxes. This year the tax on and on compames is anticipated to for yield $16 bilUon as against $14 bUUon for the year before and $12 bUUon for the year before that. What does the honourable member mean when he talks about taxes being reduced? Mr Bradfield-There are more people and more companies.",76
148,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS,The honourable gentleman is coming to it. There are more people and there are more responsibUities. But should income taxes have gone from $ 14 bUUon to $ 16 bUlion in is a single year by a ratio of one-seventh? Does that mean that per person the burden is hghter in 1977-78 than it was in 1976-77? The honourable gentleman has made great play about what he the new standard rate system as against an older system. No doubt if he has a safe seat he Laboratory at wtil be here for a few years to comeMr Bradfield-He has not.,76
149,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS,"If he has not, he might lamensay: 'If I had seen this trick I might still carhave been a member of Parliament.' How can Par-we compare one tax system, a changed system, another? The inevitable fact is that with the changed system the total yield is still greater than it was the year before. I accept the fact for two reasons-mor e people and inflation. How does one deduce that the new system is more equitable than the old? The honourable gendeman has made a great play about exempting people from taxation whose income is $3,750 a year, roughly $70 a week. Who is there in the Australian comincome tax munity at the momentwas Mr Bradfield- A lot of pensioners, Frank. of all Mr CREAN-Is that the sort of person to whom the honourable member was referring? A on person receiving only a pension has never paid in Australia. This is one of the things we have at a little quietly. In-so far as there is still income splitting in the Austrahan community the Government is really exempting incomes in say some cases in a single entity of $7,500 which not be quite as equitable as it thinks. I am saying that we have to look deeper at this aspect. A tax system, its exemptions or its basic levels and rates, cannot be taken in isolation from what is allowed as deductions. One of the points I wish to raise has been drawn to our attendon in the amendment moved by my colleague the honourment able member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). I have advocated for years in this House-and it finaUypeople came to pass-that it would be better to take child concessions out of the Income Tax Act altogether and to look after this area by means chtid endowment. The Government has taken age chtid concessions out of the Income Tax Act and is relying on chUd endowment. The Government wants to take great virtue in what it calls indexarolled tion but it has quietly forgotten to index family aUowances. I have said this before and I repeat it: If the Government attempts to index everypreciation thing I doubt that in the long run it wtil index anything. But certainly, if it indexes some things and not others it is conferring a certain advancost tage on those who have been indexed as against those who have not. I have no doubt that one of the promises that will be tossed up in by nonourabie members opposite will be that the Government, as from 10 December, has decided to index famtiy allowances. But why does the Government not do that now? I want to deal with matters one by one because this is technical legislation. There is some difficulty about what is called averaging. Again submit that once the Government changes to new system of taxation, it wtil be pretty hard to encompass averaging within it. I do not think those loose ends have been covered by this legis-when lation. In fact, the Government has got itself some difficulty. I think it has overlooked some technicalities but I do not want to dwell very much upon them except to note them in passing.that There are one or two matters about which I want to say something. I should hke to refer to the investment allowance. The investment allowcollected ance is what I have always called afiction.The investment allowance means that something that costs $1,000 or $10,000 shall be presumed to have cost $2,000 or $14,000, according to the level of the investment allowance. The person restates: ceiving that allowance is allowed to write off that amount in the year in which plant is purchased company and, thereafter, depreciation is claimed at the normal rates. I suggest it is afictionto start with. I entered do not deny that it is a benefit The Government is most unselective, ifi might so, in its appUcation. If it is to be a device that may is supposed to stimulate investment when investsimply ment needs to be stimulated, and to retard investment if it is thought that it is booming or exuberant, then certainly it is not something that ought to have a Ufe beyond a single year. I submit, with all respect, that what is being done now if it is to continuerightup to 1982-is an investdeferral rather than an investment stimulus. I ask the honourable gentleman who told to hurry up and get the aUowance in the remaining few months: What about the people who can take until 1982 to get it? Is not that of going to defer investment rather than to encourit? I suggest to governments that if they are going to have an investment allowance it has to be like a yo-yo. It has to be something that can be out and rolled up, not something that is pushed further and further forward. I have no objection to having what is called free dewhereby people can claim if they so desire. To do so defies accounting principles. Let people claim, if they want to, die total capital in the year in which they install the plant. But why should they be aUowed to claim more than the plant has cost? Basically, this is what the this election investment allowance does. Another matter about which I wish to say something is the question of tax avoidance or tax evasion. I know that some people are very sensitive about whether one implies one term or another. If one looks at the estimated $16 bUlion that wtil be collected this year in income tax, one will find that nearly $10 bUUon of that is colI lected by means of what is caUed pay as you earn the tax. The PAYE taxpayer can hardly avoid or evade a single cent of the tax that he properly has all to pay. I think one of the things that happened we altered the rate schedules recently was into that we picked up a lot of people who had two jobs which formerly were worked separately for taxation purposes. It is not quite as payable now the maximum tax is about 35c m the dollar. do Again, I have no sympathy with those sorts of people either. I simply say that of the $16 billion in income tax, those contributing $10 bUUons-fiv e parts out of eight-virtuall y have no potential to avoid or evade taxation. I should like to refer to what is stated in the explanatory memorandum in relation to private companies. It The provisions that establish when a company is a public for the purpose of Division 7 of the income tax law are to be amended to overcome artificial arrangements into with public hospitals and other public bodies to confer public company status on what are essentially private to those who get it. companies. I must say that this is an appalhng reflection on the moral approach of people who would be disturbed if they were questioned in any way about their morality. What sort of contrivance is it that would persuade the board of a public hospital-9 0 per cent of whose funds come out of Consohdated Revenue anyway-to enter into an arrangement with a shrewd accountant or a shrewd lawyer whether in respect of the sale of shares or the management of a company so as to defeat the proper return that should go to the public coffers? I say this in sorrow but what sort of a situation do we have when people with certain skills-skill s that we are supposedly we are short of-combin e and conspire to defraud the rest of the community? This is what it amounts to. I pose again the proposition that the major part of the taxpayers of Australia cannot avoid a single cent of their legal obligation. Governments, when formulating their Budgets, determine they have to obtain a certain amount of revenue. If there is a shortfall in one area, it is at the expense of the other areas. This seems to me to be an appalling reflection upon the intellectual integrity of people in the community who have had the advantage-again , mainly at public expense-of better education than the rest of the community. I think it is appalling that these people are prepared to enter into conspiracy and to try to camouflage it, although not by evasion. As Mr Justice Mansfield said, it is the nght of any section in the community to so arrange their affairs that they pay the least taxation possible. I believe the Government has the right to rebut that. Those gentlemen who would drive a coach and horse through the spirit of the law can have no resentment when the letter of the law is changed to curb that rapacity. Candidly I think it is an appalling situation that in 1977-78 we in Australia have to do this kind of thing. As I have said, I believe that insufficient interest is displayed by this House in these matters. This is the last occasion the opportunity to address the House on this area. The legislation deals with the major tax which the Government is responsible for collecting. Usually such legislation passes this House with only about three honourable members from either side speaking in the debate. I believe there has got to be a new approach to this matter. We have heard in the debate tonight that one system is better than another. I might say in a kind of reflective spirit that I have always believed that the tax system should provide a basic exemption for everybody. It should provide for what I would call in other days a subsistence allowance. It costs everybody in the community a minimum sum of money to sustain himself and that part of his income ought not to be taxed at all. There could be arguments about what that level ought to be. There could be arguments about what circumstantial matters one takes into accountwhether people are married or single, whether they have children and so on. But we should not erect a kind of facade which suggests that somehow or other one sort of system, such as the one that is now being applauded, is better than the others. One cannot take into account exemptions only. One must take into account also deductions, the total income structure of a community, indirect as well as direct taxes, and the fact that in Australia we have three levels of government raising taxes. I think it is about time we gotridof a lot of the nonsense. I have received many letters expressing regret at my leaving this Parliament, but I got one or two rather curious ones whose authors thought they were having their day of retribution. One such letter stated that I was thefirstTreasurer to tax the old age pension as well as other income. I can see no reason why a person of 75 years of age who has the same income as a person of 25 years of age should pay less in tax than the person of 25 years of age. If honourable members on one side of the House pressed for the removal of the means test more than honourable members on the other, it was those who now sit on the Government side. The Government of which I was a member began to abohsh the means test for people aged 75 years and over and we continued to abolish it for people aged 70 years and over. The present Government, which espoused the abolition of the means test in the first place, did not take that matter any further. Personally I was never in favour of the abohtion of the means test. But having started it, you cannot stop in the middle.",76

This Bill provides for the payment of grants the States for government and non-government schools in 1978-thefirstyear of toe 1978-80 rolling triennium. In addition the Bill adjusts grants for 1977 in respect of cost increases. Honourable members will recall that the Government announced in June of this year it would provide for expenditure in $57lm, in December 1976 prices, for government school programs, non-government school programs, and joint programs through the Schools Commission. The Commission's report was tabled in the Parliament in September and recently the Government announced its acceptincreases ance of the Commission's recommended allorecurrent cations for 1978 consistent with the guideUnes. The Bill gives effect to those decisions. I direct the attention of honourable members to the Bill. It provides for the continuation of existing programs for government and nonThe government schools. These are: General Amending resources programs-genera l recurrent grants, including funds for child migrant and multiculsupplementation tural education, emergency aid for nonBill to the House. government schools, and capital grants; specific purpose programs-disadvantage d schools and adjourned. schools in disadvantaged country areas, special education for handicapped chUdren including children Uving in institutions, services and development including education centres, and Order! It being 10.30 special projects. Although the format of the from the existing States Grants (Schools ance) Act 1976, it contains the same provisions. The new format more closely reflects which the programs are administered. The base program for migrant and multicultural education is the same in total as for 1977, but has been adjusted between States and systems to payments more into Une with the actual distribution of migrant chUdren. The provision for development activities and associated staff replacement has been combined into one schedule to provide additionalflexibdityfor the States. Administrative arrangements wtil provide for flexibility of funding between development activities and the replacement of teachers. minimum of about 40 per cent wtil be allocated to each of the activities and replacement elsistance ements of this program with the balance able be used for either activities or replacement. Second Reading The Bill provides for funding of $3.7m for special projects of which some $3m is for school based innovations projects and $700,000 for national level projects. Details of the 1978 aUocations for individual programs in each State are given in Schedules 1 to 8. The grants specified into these Schedules have been adjusted to June 1977 prices, except for the non-government schools general recurrent program which includes some aUowances for estimated future cost increases. On this basis the cost of programs for 1978 amounts to an estimated $611m, of which that $28.3m will be provided under the ongoing 1978 of States Grants (Schools) Act 1972. In accordance with the Government's guideUnes for the 1978-80 triennium, these grants wtil be adjusted in subsequent legislation for cost movements to the end of 1977 and for in wages and salaries components of grants during 1978. As I have indicated, the Bill also adjusts the grants for 1977 from December 1976 prices to June 1977 prices.

The purpose of the Bill is to providefinancialasto the States for universities, colleges of to advanced education and technical and further education for 1978. The Bill gives effect to the financial recommendations contained in the report of the Tertiary Education Commission for 1978. The House was informed recently of the Government's decision to accept these recommendations which result in the allocation of an estimated total of $1,136.5m in June 1977 prices for institutions in the States. The amounts provided for each of the three tertiary education sectors are as follows: versiues education education Recurrent 570.2 376.6 Capital 24.7 67.3 Total 594.9 443.9 It wtil be recalled that the guidelines for 1978 provided for base levels of grants at the same real levels as for 1977 in the case of universities and colleges of advanced education and an increase of 10 per cent in real terms for TAFE. The amounts now provided in the Bill take into account the small adjustments to capital expenditure recommended by the Commission in the tight of its assessment of likely cashflowfor the advanced education sector building program in 1978. The full building program proposed by the Advanced Education Council and recommended by the Commission is incorporated in the legislation to enable all projects to commence in 1978. In accordance with the Government's guidelines for the 1978-80 triennium, these grants will be adjusted in subsequent legislation for cost movements to the end of 1977 and for the increases in wages and salaries components of recurrent grants during 1978. In the past, separate Bills have been required to implement the approved programs of the three tertiary education sectors. Following the establishment of the Tertiary Education Commission, replacing the three previous commissions concerned with tertiary education, it has been possible to consolidate the necessary legislation in one Bill. In so doing, a common approach to the terms and conditions appUed to grants for the three sectors has been adopted wherever appropriate. The new arrangements wtil permit a greater degree offlexibilityin the administration of approved programs, thereby assisting the Commission in its functions of co-ordination and rationalisation for the tertiary education system. In particular, the Government beheves it is necessary, in order to achieve efficient expenditure of the funds avaUable, for there to be flexibility in the administration of the capital programs for the three sectors. Under the Bill, the Minister will be given power to effect transfers of capital funds between sectors and between States after advice from the Commission. Such transfers between sectors wtil be subject to consultation with the States concerned and, where any transfers between States are contemplated, wtil be made only with the agreement of those States. Colleges of Technical Uniadvanced and further The capital programs set out in the Bill wtil apTotal propriate the total cashflowfor 1978 approved by the Government under the guideUnes.

The effect of this provision is to withdraw appropriations for projects for which the States are not seeking support and for four projects in the advanced education sector which were included in the review of capital projects not under contract which was conducted by the Commission at the request of the Government under the guidelines for 1978-80. Any of these projects can be considered for inclusion in the 1979 program. In addition to appropriating funds for 1978, the Bill amends the States Grants (Universities Assistance) Act 1976, the States Grants (Advanced Education Assistance) Act 1976 and the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1976 to provide for adjustments to approved programs of grants for 1977, for movements in costs between December 1976 and June 1977.

157,Mr COTTER,PRECEDENCE,"It gives me pleasure to be able to speak in this cognate debate, but I should like to confine my remarks principally to the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 3).

The exemption provision, formerly known as the section giving exemption to the income of bonafideprospectors, will vide for exemption along the same lines and respect of the same minerals and metals as earlier exemption. The reinstated exemption will apply in respect of income derived October 1977, other than income derived under a contract let on or before that date. Together with gold, the metals and minerals that wtil come within the scope of the new exemption are prescribed in income tax regulation 4AA for purposes of the former exemption under parato graph 23 (p).

159,Mr COTTER,PRECEDENCE,"It is fairly well known that paragraph 23 (p) of the Income Tax Assessment Act was done away with by the previous Governtion ment about 1973. This caused a great deal of from concern in the mining and mineral industries throughout Australia. It had die result that over 18 months approximately 120 exploration companies left Australia for countries such as Fiji, Brazti and Argentina, claiming that there was a more stable form of government in those countries than we had in Australian between 1972 and 1975. It had a dramatic effect on the minerals industry. It had a dramatic and devastating effect on prospectors for base metals, minerals and gold throughout Austraha. It is with this in mind that the present Government is reinstating that exemption. This was an undertaking given by the Government prior to the 1975 election that it is now honouring. The previous Labor Government paid scant regard to the windfaU income which was derived by the prospectors and which was exempt from tax under the previous paragraph 23 (p). The chances of obtaining this windfall reward were something Uke 1,000 to one. The previous Government took no heed of the many years-in fact, in most cases the lifetime-of hardship and deprivation of Uving in the bush and looking for of minerals. If one in those thousand was fortunate enough tofinda viable ore body, then previously under paragraph 23 (p) the sale of the mining rights to that ore body were exempt from taxproation. Between 1973 and 1975 they were not in exempt, and this caused a downturn in mining the and a tremendous downturn in exploration activity, with the result that the rnining industry after 25 was turned back some years. BasicaUy the proposed new paragraph 23 (pa) wtil give the same exemption as the former those 23 (p).

It wtil also provide that the exemption under the new para23 (pa) does not apply where either the is vendor or the purchaser of the mining right has the power to control the activities of the other parry to the transaction or where any person has the power to control the entry into the transaction of both parties to the transaction. As with the former paragraph 23 (p), this latter limitation wtil apply in respect of the sale, et cetera, Cobalt, of arightto mine a prescribed metal or mineral but wiU not apply in respect of a sale, et cetera, of a right to mine gold.

It wtil apply in relato income derived after 25 October 1977 the sale, et cetera, of a right to mine, other than income derived in pursuance of a contract made on or before that date. I think this is a verythose reasonable approach to the subject. There is retrospectivity attached to the reinstatement 23 (p). Proposed new paragraph 23 (pa) will give great impetus to the exploration throughout Austraha. There is already evidence that exploration for minerals, gold and metals picking up throughout Australia primarily cause of the taxation incentives already offered, particularly to companies. But most of these exemptions and incentives are not available their present form tb the ordinary, prospector. It is well known that the bulk eral deposits throughout Austraha have been found over the years by the individual prospecI tor. Very few have been found by highly Insurance specialised compames. Mosdy the prospector finds the ore bodies, and they are subsequently developed by companies. The prospector has been able to achieve a once in a hfetime windfallfoUowing reward by selling ntiningrightsto those areas. I general am of the opinion that there are still vast areas ofmemberpropositions minerals and gold to be found in Austraha. This concludedfor measure should offer sufficient incentive to givemade-apar his prospectors that little bit of extra kick to keep thematters affecting his minerals industry viable for many years to come. that everybody was better It is with great pleasure that I take part debate in favour of the reinstatement of graph 23 (p) which was a Government underspeech taking given in December 1975.1 make it quite clear that this was a pohcy undertaking and is not something that has been thought of quickly or brought on in a rush prior to another election. comment briefly on a couple of remarks made the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) in relation to the taxation system the few minutes which I have at my disposal, revolutionary new tax rate or flat tax system benefit all taxpayers in Austraha. Despite what the Opposition is saying on this matter it is clear that every taxpayer in Austraha wtil pay less tax under the new system when compared with the old. There is no question about that. fact, approximately 90 per cent of taxpayers pay only 32c in the dollar. This is a very sigafter nificant benefit to the taxpayers of Austraha. figures cited by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in fact graphically illustrate the need for a new tax system. It is this new tax sysdecades tem that will be applauded by Australians in the pay coming weeks and in the future in great anticithe pation of it being implemented in February. The investment aUowances which were criparticular ticised by the honourable member were of benefit and were one of the major factors in aUowing for the development of the North West Shelf gas project in Western Austraha. Without incentives it is unlikely that the North West no Shelf project would have been viable. The main of criticism coming from the Opposition in relation to these BUls seems to be because the Governscene ment has made a tremendous amount of progress in bringing the economy under control, is m allowing for incentive, in allowing for that belittle bit of personal initiative so that the individual who wants to work a Utde harder and earn that little bit more wtil not be unduly in penalised by additional tax levels. He now has everyday that incentive. of minDr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (10.48)-Tonight we are debating cognately eight income tax BUls. address my remarks specifically to the Health Levy Bill 1977 and matters related to it as well as to the general propositions which have been raised in the debate. I think it might be more appropriate for those who have been the debate if I first deal with the raised by the honourable KalgoorUe (Mr Cotter) who has just t contribution. The main point he from the proposals deahng with electorate specifically-wa s off under the new tax in thisscheme. He repeated the phrase used by the paraTreasurer (Mr Lynch) in his second reading on this legislation. In referring to a previous speech, the Treasurer said that the system is revolutionary, that it is simple and, above aU, by a reduction of tax at aU levels of incomes it I goes a long way towards restoring incentive and byso on. They are exacdy the phrases used by the honourable member for KalgoorUe. The second in point that the Treasurer made was that, if I The rememberrightly,some 225,000 would be taxwill payers would now be exempt from taxation. This is of course afictitiousfigure,as honourable quite members know. Every year a new number-this year the number is lower than usual-ar e exempt from taxation. The lower income earners, just the In same as other income earners, have an increasing will income and the same people are exempted year year. I quote from the Budget Speech made The by. the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) in 1975, when he was the Treasurer. A sad feature of Australia's personal tax system is that for many people in real poverty have been obliged to quite substantial tax bills. The new system removes from list of taxpayers, and relieves of all tax almost half a million taxpayers on the lowest incomes. He exempted half a million taxpayers in that year. Since then, about 200,000 have great been exempted each year. They are always exactly the same people. They are exempted one year, their income rises slighdy, they are then included in the tax schedules, the taxadon ules are raised slighdy, and those people again exempted. We get this pretence by this said: Government that some new group of people has The been added to those in the community who are exempt from taxadon. In fact addidonal people have been added to the tax system. It is ridiculous for this Government to pretend that people are paying less tax, that they are ter off. Let us look at the actualfigures.Budget It Paper No. 4 reveals that pay-as-you-earn income tant tax collections per head of population in tribute 1975-76, in the so-called Hayden Budget, dependants . . . amounted to $515. In 1976-77 it in this current year it is estimated to be $707. There are fewer people working now than there same were then. So those who are paying tax ing much more tax. If we take not only those who The are paying tax on the pay-as-you-earn basis but ing, also the self-employed, the income tax per head tax of population in the Hayden Budget was $677. In thefirstLynch Budget it was $790. icalLast This year it will be $911-an increase of $234. In modesty,change the two years since this Government has come to reforms.' power, there has been a $234 increase per head of population in the tax collected. For the averincreased age family consisting of a husband, two children, this means an increase in income The tax of $936 yearly since the Fraser Government unchanged, promised to reduce taxation.

Let me indexed quote from an article by Mr Ross Gittins, economics writer in the Sydney Morning - Herald Put - no t exactly one of the most pro-Labor reform schednewspapers in this country. When speaking are about the Budget and income tax, Mr Gittins Government's halo in the area it calls 'family reform' is beginning to show distinct signs of tarnish. This Budget is the first of the last three in which the income position of families (as families) has taken a step back, rather than a step forward. Thefirstbig improvement for people with dependent fambetilies came in Mr Hayden's tax reforms of 1975. is not widely acknowledged, but one of the most imporreforming aspects of the Hayden changes was to redisthe tax burden away from the taxpayers with was $609, and He goes on to say: This was done by raising the basic tax rates but, at the ume, converting the old dependant reductions into are paymuch more generous dependant rebates. justification for this change was that a bachelor earnsay, $ 170 a week has a much greater capacity to bear the burden than does a man supporting a wife and children in 1975-76 on the same amount. year the Fraser Government made a rather more radto fanuiy incomes which it hailed, with typical as 'one of this country's most significant social It abolished child rebates and instead significantly the rates of child endowment payments, which it a wife and renamed 'family allowances.' switch left the income of most families pretty much but its significance was that it provided greatly incomes. assistance to about 300,000 families with very low Mr Gittins said that Mr Fraser's reform drew wide acclaim for that particular reason and also because it looked good in the beginning. He beauty, from the Government's point of view was that to help so many people at very litde cost to the This was because the change was introduced at the same withdraw. time as' full' tax indexation. Converting the child rebates into higher child endowment meant that the Government avoided the expense Prime of indexing those particular rebates. Thus, in a full year, the net cost of the higher child endowment payments was no more than the cost of indexing the child rebates would have been. But the rub for taxpayers with familiesbe good And this is the important thinghas come this year-not by what the Government did, but by what it didn't do. It didn't increase family allowances to allow for the effects ofinftation. this basis that the Opposition is arguing that 'the vast majority of taxpaying families' would have been better had the Government maintained the child rebates and them in 1976 and 1977 in the same way that the an other rebates were indexed. another way, the Government's most significant social of 1976 is saving it a lot of money one year later. To illustrate just exactly what happens as far as the Government is concerned and as far as disadvantage for families with children is congranted. cerned, I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which I have prepared. NA In the following table the $200 child rebate introduced in indexation the cluld rebate in 1977-78 would be at least $250 $200 indexed by 13 per cent to $226 lst child . . . . 4.80 2nd child . . . . 9.60 3rd child . . . . 14.40 4th child . . . . 19.20 5th child . . . . 24.00 6th child . . . . 28.80 Therefore every taxpaying family",83
166,Dr KLUGMAN,COMPARISON OF INCOME TO TAX PAYING FAMILIES,"Basically , the table shows that all taxpayers with children will be worse off. Under the Hayden scheme there was an indexed tax rebate of $200 for each child. This would have been up-dated by 13 per cent to $226 last year and to $250 this year, with the 10.9 per cent indexation in this Budget. Under the Hayden Budget families would now receive $4.80 for the first child in tax rebate, plus SOc child endowment, making a total of $5.30. Under the Lynch Budget there is only the $3.50 family allowance, making a loss of $1.80 a week. For two children, under Labor the tax rebate would have been $9.60 a week plus $1.50 child endowment-SO c for the first child plus $1 for the second childmaking a total of $11.10 compared with the E resent family allowance of $8.50,representinga >ss of $2.60 a week. Similarly, with three children the loss will be $3.40 a week and with four children the loss will be $4.45 a week. Therefore, every taxpaying family with children is worse off under this measure which was introduced by the Government last year and which has not been updated. The important point to emphasise is that every taxpaying family with children is worse off. The Treasurer, in introducing the Bills we are debating tonight, emphasised how many people will now be exempted from taxation and how much people will be better off with the indexation of the phasing-in point.

Under the so called Hayden Budget of two years ago, before indexation was introduced, that person would not have paid any tax. There was a tax exemption on incomes up to $5,943 for a person with a dependent spouse and three dependent school children. At present that person has to pay the Medibank levy appUcable to incomes over $5,087, amounting to 2.5 per cent of about $900, plus tax on income above $5,484. Such a person is much worse off than he was previously. I would like to deal very quickly with the health insurance levy. I note that the Treasurer in his second reading speech has stated: The rate of levy remains at 2.5 per cent of taxable income, subject to unchanged ceiling amounts of $300 for taxpayers with dependants and $ 150 for those without dependants. The Treasurer went on to say: One change, dealt with in this Bill as well as in an earlier Bill, will exempt from the levy the income of a deceased estate to which no beneficiary in the estate has a present entitlement. It was obviously a pecuUar thing to have happened in any case and was fairly typical of the rushed way m which the Government introduced the previous legislation, that a deceased's estate still had to pay the Medibank levy for the person who was already deceased. It was unlikely that the person who was deceased would get any further medicalMr MCVeigh-It has been altered now.",84
168,Dr KLUGMAN,THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"Exacdy , but that was in mind force for a year. I now want to draw the attention of the House to another anomaly which has been dealt with and that is the anomaly that it accepted by the Taxation Office that, because of some mistake in the drafting of the original lation, where two persons are either in a married or a de facto relationship, each is considered to be a dependant on the other and has to be adequately privately insured, otherwise the levy is imposed. What happens a number of occasions is the two persons who marry have had different kinds of cover as single persons. One of them may have been paying Medibank levy and the other may nave been do covered by Medibank Private or by one of the private funds. They assume that they are still people, Uving now in a married state, and that they are adequately covered. What happens the end of the year is that the person who paying the levy suddenlyfindsthat he or she has to pay the levy up to the $300 ceiling instead of $150 because, as I said earher, it is taken that Mr Bourchier-Is that unreasonable?",85
169,Dr KLUGMAN,THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"On top of that, the other person is paying for private insurance.

Over can legislation which make this sort of coUection necessary. I conclude by paying tribute to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) who spoke in this House tonight, certainly for the time on income tax legislation and possibly for the last time. I have been associated with honourable member for Melbourne Ports since entered this Parliament eight years ago and have served with him on committees. I have found him to be by far the most rational of all economic spokesmen on aU sides of this House. To my available he has the greatest abitity to explain rationally the issues in a problem, whether we are dealnot ing with taxadon or another economic matter. is Maybe the people on this side of the House did not take enought notice of him. It is obvious that legisthose on the other side did not take enough Uving together, notice of him.",85

175,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"It is a E leasure to foUow in this debate on the taxation sgislation the honourable and irrational member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) who talked BUls Medibank and budgets of the past. These are significant for quite a fewtilings.They proposition are intended close loopholes, the tax avoidpractised for some years in intention of some areas, and to implement tax rates. revenue by closin order to has not provide incentive. Consequently this the be past few years we have seen many artificial devices used in private enterprise to avoid paying a just f >roportion of taxation and I think that this legisation is timely. I believe it was the honourable last member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) who mentioned that only a proportion of our taxpaythe ing public could take advantage of these I loopholes and arrange their taxation affairs in such a way that they paid the rnirtimum tax. The large proportion of taxpayers-salar y earners and professional people-d o not have this facility to them. There is an inequity in the tax system because it allows these manipulations be practised. The Government sees this as part of its reform program. I think it is most desirable the Government should press on with this profluctuation. gram so that there can be equity through our tax reform systems. By changing the way in which personal income tax is calculated, the Government has gone a long way to restoring incentive to a section of the community which traditionally has been the most creative and productive. tax changes are an indication of a deep change government thinking, a change in the philosophy of the balance between the pubhc and private sectors. In effect, the tax changes represent recognition that individuals are more entided the fruits of their own labour than is the State. The changes acknowledge that there are limits the claims any State can make on the private finance of its citizens and still maintain incentive.Hayden I would like to deal with aspects of incentives within these taxation Bills before I deal with avoidance procedures. One is the extension of the investment aUowance from 1983 to 1985 at the rate of 20 per cent. I beheve this wtil give curity to long term investors in capital plant which takes a fair while between the programimproves ming stage and the ordering stage before the plant is available for productive or income earnnot ing purposes. Mr Millar-The sugar industry.",85
176,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"This applies to the one sugar area but more particularly to the rnining industry. The extension until 1985 wtil ensure that for plans made now, the plant and equiperage ment will be avaUable at a 20 per cent investold ment aUowance. I think this wtil be a stimulus capital acquisitions and also extensions. I might mention also that there is perhaps an area where incentives are required desperately and that is the accommodation and travel industries. Perhaps the Government might look in its new the terms- I am sure it wtil have them-to an investing ment aUowance of some kind on buildings which are used for productive income earning purincluded poses, particularly in regard to the accommoadds dation mdustry. With regard to the averaging incomes within clause 12 of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) I beheve this is the best advantage ever to come to prischemes mary producers throughout Australia. It is an advantage theyrichlydeserve and which would have been denied them to a large extent had the original Budget speech been adopted without amendment. I believe there is equity in a primary to producer being able to average his income because of itsfluctuatingnature. Certainly if it was not for the effects of the averaging, primary protax ducers would pay a greater percentage of their that income than a normal person without that same Mr MCVeigh-Carryin g the burden again.",86
177,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"This , of course, brings up the argument in connection with tariffs, a The large proportion of which is borne within the in rural industries. I think it should be recognised that, within this averaging of incomes, some of the penalty through tariffs is being returned to a primary producers. This is only just and proper. I to reiterate that averaging of incomes now represents the best advantage ever given to the to rural industry in this regard. We should recognise that it reinstates the losses caused by the Budget. The honourable member for Prospect talked about the great Hayden Budget. The great Hayden Budget took $40m to $50m from rural producers throughout Australia as a result of the effect of the averaging provisions and the changes brought about by the rebate syssetem. This legislation goes a long way towards reinstating the situation prior to thattimebut it the situation even beyond that because it gives additional benefits that have previously been aUowed or provided for. These are four in number. The primary producer is permitted during this year of income to return to the average that he had previously opted out of. That is benefit. There is also the fact that there will be no detriment to a rural producer on a falling income when that falling income is below the avincome. This, again, was a loss under the system that will not be suffered under the to present system. Also, there is the removal of the ceiling of $16,000. There has been no cnange in this ceiling since 1966 and rural producers have in been subject to the ravages of inflation, particularly in the Labor years, without amendment to ceiling. Again, I think the removal of this ceUis just and equitable. That is particularly so when we realise that the zero tax rate is to be in the averaging calculations. AU this up to a $100m benefit for rural industry in of one year of operation. I think this aUows the income equaUsation deposits to be recognised for what they should be. They are stabUisation and not tax reduction deposits. I feel that had these income equalisation deposits been available in the years when the cattle industry was at its height with good markets and prices instead of the drought bonds which were available to it we would not see the lack of Uquidity which is prevalent in that industry today. T gest to any producer in any rural industry who sees himself on top of prices-ther e are very of them in Australia today-that he should at these income equalisation deposits as personal stabilisation plans and take the utmost advanfrom tage of them. There is one point in regard to the income where equalisation deposits I would like to mention. An tax 80 per cent test is placed upon the income of primary producers in determining whether they can take advantage of the income equalisation deposits. I suggest that perhaps this test might be apphed also to the averaging provisions to ensure that Pitt Street farmers and Collins Street fanners are denied the benefit that should be available only to genuine primary producers. Perhaps this suggestion might be taken into account. In fact, Tsee that abuse could occur the new provision for the averaging of income equalisation deposits. Perhaps that area should be looked at more carefully. As I mentioned bebUity. fore, this is just one way in the rural industry in the recovery of that dous tariff cost which it bears every year. Mention has been made of amendments to income tax rates. The previous speaker in the bate, the honourable member for Prospect, menwe tioned that the tax base seemed to be rising all thetimeto the extent that taxpayers in the tax bracket were being named continually as Hayden). those who would not pay tax in the future. No Budget placed more low income people into a tax burden situation than did the Hayden Budget. There were no tax indexation provisions in that Budget. I ask the House to bear in mind also that it was a Labor Government that denied tax indexation benefits to the people. What the new tax rates mean, above anything else, is those taxpayers, including pensioners with minicommitments mal income rising above the basic taxable income Umit, will now be able to earn up to $3,750 as from 1 February 1978 without that income attracting taxation as has been the during the last 2 years. This means that such people can receive an income in excess of $70 week. The tax rates also recognise that such people are able to earn the minimum amount, still receive a full pension and pay no tax. I Ueve that this in itself has been of great assistance to the pensioners in the community. No the measure wtil provide a great deal of reUef in that quarter. I also pay tribute to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I am sorry to know the speech he delivered tonight is probably the last speech he wtil deUver on tax Bills. One comment sughe has always made in connection with indexation is that if we index everything, have we infew dexed anything? I beheve that the reformed look income tax rates which we have been able to place before the House indicate that we are free the tax indexation bind for the first time in two years. We are able to give equity in areas it is more appUcable and in areas where a indexation could not give that equity. The the new tax scales wtil aUow a person to predetermine his tax UabUity without the mutiitude of steps which apphed previously. They certainly S resent an improvement and a big advance, sy are part of our tax reform deal. I believe that they wtil be well accepted on 1 February 1978, the introduction date.

179,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"That is your comment I would like to make some comments on the company tax rate. The rate has been increased to 46c in the doUar. Unfortunately this is retrospective to the year ended 30 June 1977. WhUe this is that unfortunate possibly because of the way tax faU it is impossible to do anything about it, but it is a pity that the increase is retrospective. I would like to see introduced the rating system that was in the Income Tax Assesscase ment Act some decade ago in connection with private companies being subject to a graduated a rate of tax. This would acknowledge the difficulties faced by companies with smaUer taxable incomes being subject to a high rate. I beheve bethis would help smaU businesses particularly if private company tax rates or incomes up to a cerdoubt tain threshold could be reduced. Many people have criticised the increase in company tax rates. I think we should look at this in retrospect and we should look at it as it presents itself to us. Some have said that the increases wtil offset the advantages of indexed stock valuation and the investment aUowance. If this is so I think there is some equity in it I would like to see business accounting prinTreasury ciples-this appUes to private compames as well as the public companies-accepte d by the that authorities in relation to tax deduction claims.

189,Mr WENTWORTH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman. That will be suitable to me. I put it to the Committee that the Labor Party has been right in Second Reading criticising the Government for its faUure to index family allowances, but I think it has been wrong in attributing to the Government a hardness of heart on this aspect. I do not beheve that the Government could have failed to do this except by mistake. I beheve that when this matter is before the chamber in a specific way the Govern-would ment will change its mind. Unless it changes its mind it will be convicted of the most appalling hypocrisy. I believe that the Labor Party been quite wrong. I do not think that the Govern-amendment. ment has reahsed what it has done. I do not be-Firsdy, heve that people who realise what they are doingthe could act as the Government has acted in this matter. Let me put the thingfirmlyon the hne. In the Government said that it would change the method of income tax rebates and famUy aUow-the ances so as to help the people in the communityof who were worse off. This is what it said. It is very commendable. I am sure it meant this. Yet now, whUe nearly everytliing else in the Income Tax Assessment Act is being indexed, the farnily alwill lowances are not. I do not think the Governmentwhether could have done this dehberately. I do not between Ueve that it could be so hypocritical as to do this.try I beheve that it was done simply by an oversight.who When it is put squarely on the line with an amendment, as it wtil be in a moment, I believe that the Government wtil have the decency accept the amendment and reverse what has been done, I am sure, just by oversight. It could not have been done dehberately. The Government is not as hard hearted and as fuU of dupUcity as that. In a moment I shall put forward (b) an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977 which puts the position where I believe it should be and where I think the Government would have it if it reahsed what was decent, right and proper.",89
190,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They have been tricked by the Treasury bureaucrats.,90
191,Mr WENTWORTH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"My friend says that the will Government has been tricked by the Treasury ance, bureaucrats. He may well beright.I do not beThat heve that the Treasurer always understands he is doing. He is far too much in the hands ofhis advisers. IncidentaUy, let me discomfit my friendadjust the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) at this moment. They are the same advisers who tricked the Labor Party when the it was in office. He was one of the Ministers who was similarly deceived and misled by the same people. I suggest that we should reinstate the allowations, ance for children at afigurewhich would pensate for the change in price levels which havechance affected the real values of family aUowances. I not think that this is the most satisfactory solution but it is the only solution avaUable to a priputvate member in this chamber. If the Government bring forward a more acceptable solution we could take it, but it is not possible for a private member in this chamber to initiate matters has on that level. In a moment I shaU move an It will be an acid test of two things. it wtil be an acid test of the sincerity of Government. Does it beheve the things it has said? Does it have real consideration for people at the bottom of the income scale? Does it beheve in fairness and decency? I still believe that 1976the Government wtil be sufficiendy decent to accept the amendment. It wtil be an acid test of sincerity of the Government. If it takes points order and does something which is not usually done on an Income Tax Assessment Bill it wtil stand convicted. If the Labor Party wtil not stand by me on a motion to amend Standing Orders it also be convicted of insincerity. Let us see there is some kind of conspiracy be the two main parties to do injustice and to to exploit, for pohtical purposes, those people are perhaps least fortunate in our community. We shall now see where the truthtiesin the chamber both in regard to the Government to and in regard to the Opposition. I move: After clause 16, insert the following new clause: ' 1 6A. Section 159j of the Principal Act is amended(a) by omitting from sub-section (IA) ""class 3 or""; by omitting from column 2 of the table in sub-section (2)' (not being a student)'; and (c) by omitting from column 3 of the table in sub-section 2: ' In respect of 1 such child-$226 In respect ofeach other such child-$ 170' and substituting: 'In respect ofeach such child-$50'."". The effect of this amendment wtil be that there be restored, in addition to the family aUowan income tax rebate in respect of children. income tax rebate, at $50, is just about the what amount that famUy aUowances have been short changed by the rise in prices and the failure to them. This is the one thing which more than anything else requires adjustment. This House, to its shame, for a longtimehas forgotten real interests of the family man. It is no wonder that we have moral trouble throughout the community and it is no wonder that our birthrate is falUng and so on. For years now this House has condemned, by itsfinancialoperthe sanctity and integrity of the AuscomtraUan family. Now the Government has a to change this situation. Now, gentlemen, doyou have a chance to change it. I suggest that this amendment should be carried if there is any decency at all in this Government. Alternaside tively-I would regard this as a better acdon-the Government here and now should say that before the Parhament rises tion, family aUowances should be adjusted in line with the change in prices. Let us have one thing or the other. Let us see whether the Labor Party is sincere. If it is, it will support my adopted. amendment.",90

193,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The amendment is in order.,91
194,Mr HURFORD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It will take me only one minute to explain to the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) that it is not the Government that is naive; it is he who is naive. The fact is that the Government realised full well what it was doing when it took away from families the benefits which should be theirs. That is why the Opposition stated so clearly earher amendment to the motion for the second reading, that this Bill faUs to take measures to alleviate the increase in family tax burdens which has arisen as a result of the Government's faUure to index famUy allowances. We have had our say on that particular measure. It is no good the honourable member for MACKellar thinking that he can move an amendment like this to achieve his purpose. His amendment will not achieve that purpose. If he knew the taxation Act as well as I know the taxation Act, immodest though I am in saying so- I realise, of course that immodesty does not become me-h e would realise that in doing this he is decreasing the value of the zone allowance to the many people in Australia who deserve more in the way of the zone aUowance. He is reducing the benefit for the first child from $226 to $50 and the benefit for the second and further children from, I think $170 to $50. So this is not the way to achieve what we in Opposition want to achieve, namely greater benefits for the family. That is why the Opposition cannot support the amendment in its present form.",91

NA Industrial Relations Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (11.57)-During the session ending the Fraser Government has twice rammed divisive and reactionary industrial BUls through each House in less than one day. Wednesday week the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) said that measures gave effect to the coahtion's industrial relations policy, which was overwhelmingly endorsed at the last election. I wish to direct attention not only to the sinister intentions but also to the sinister origins of measures. They were formulated when the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) rammed was the Opposition's spokesman on industrial matters in 1974 and was given a research assistThe ant paid for by Mr Keith Compton Gale, the man who has bilked one of Austraha's oldest, best established and most respected compames to the extent of over $900,000 and who presided over the greatest company crash in Australia's (No. 3) 1977 history. Second Reading On 4 May last I asked the Prime Minister, without notice, whether it was in accordance with the Liberal Party of Australia's code that in no circumstances would a member of parhament accept services such as free research assistance for his own staff or pohtical needs. He rephed: A certain person many years ago did provide some assistance in helping to develop industrial relations policy when I Third Reading was industrial relations spokesman for the then Opposition. That policy of course is the official policy of the Liberal Party. The service was provided in support of the party and not for one second of any individual. On the previous day- 3 May- I had placed the following question on the Notice Paper for the Prime Minister: What have been the dates, nature and purpose ofhis contacts with Mr Keith Compton Gale who, according to reports Second Reading submitted by Mr John Spender, QC, pursuant to appointments by the Lewis, Willis and Wran governments under the Companies Act, borrowed over $900,000 in August 1974 and subsequent months from the Gollin companies while he was managing director for his private purposes and for quite impermissible uses. On 16 August the Prime Minister provided this answer These contacts related to an offer of assistance to the LibThird Reading eral Party in the preparation of industrial relations policy. That assistance was provided for a limited period. Mr Speaker would be in a better position than anyone else to judge the truth or otherwise of these answers. The fact is that he, as Leader of the Opposition, knew that he told the honourable member for Wannon to have nothing to do with Gale. He knew that the Liberal Party secretariat did not have the assistance of the research officer-the man provided by Gale-in the preparation of its official industrial relations pohcy. He would not have a bar of it. The just research officer was working direcdy for the honourable member for Wannon and was responsible only to him and to his real employer, On Mr Gale. The speech which the honourable member for Wannon made to the ANZAAS the Congress in January 1975 was based on a paper prepared by this person. That paper contained the basic proposals for the Industrial Relations Bureau, gaol sentences for union members as well as officials-the whole apparatus of intimidation and confrontation and all the other these provisions of the new Bill which have been through this Parhament during the session. Prime Minister must reveal the full extent ofhis obUgation and his party's obUgation to Mr Gale. He must teU us exactly what services Mr Gale provided to him. He must tell us whether any part of the $900,000 misappropriated by Mr Gale found its way into Liberal Party funds. The community will not have a bar of an industrial pohcy so conceived and so fostered. It knows the tainted origin of an industrial pohcy dehberately designed to provoke and prolong strikes and to divide the people of this country, poisoned in its origins and poisonous in its intentions. The Prime Minister once proclaimed: It is not only what is done but the way it is done that is important. The Austrahan people can judge him by the company he keeps, by the men who advised him on industrial pohcy. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 12.2 a.m. (Wednesday)",92
