2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,'Honourable members who wish to ask questions without notice should rise before the business of the day is called on. I looked round the Chamber before instructing the Olerk to read the first notice of motion and no honourable member was then on his feet. Members should be more prompt in rising.,13
3,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"My excuse, Mr. - Speaker, is my native modesty and the fact that it is'not always easy to know whether other members have finished their questions. NAME OF PERSON DEPORTED.",13
4,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"w is h to know lian citizens? from the Prime Minister if he will furnish ua with the name, or one of the names, of the person who is being deported from Australia and is described as a dangerous Bolshevik ? I am the more anxious because a personal friend of mine, a member of this House, is absent from hisplace.",13
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Frida y being one of my unlucky days, I shall not attempt to pronounce the name of the friend of the honourable member who has been deported or of the other men on the pro- low:scribed list.",13
6,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Not my friend. I dislejaim. that honour' absolutely.,13
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I amend my statement by saying that I cannot pronounce the name of the gentleman the honour of whose friendship the honourable. member does not as yet claim, nor can I pronounce the names of the other gentlemen whose friendship ho does not yefc claim, but who axe on the proscribed list. Besides, I do not know that it would do any one any good to be told the names.",13
8,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a feet that the clerical assistants in the Postal Department were refuBed registration on the ground that there was an organization (the Australian Telegraphists Union) to whioh they could conveniently belong, and that positions were interchangeable, i.e., ot equal valuer 2. Is it a fact that the Arbitrator, Mr Hunt, in the award recently given, differentiated between these two sections by giving telegraphists an increase and refusing the clerical assistants an increase? 3. If this means that the positions are no longer interchangeable, are the Government prepared to remedy this apparent injustice to clerical assistants and place them on an equal footing with the telegraphists?",13
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The answer supplied by the Postmaster-General's Department is that inquiries are being made, and replies will he furnished as soon as possible. NA AUSTRALIANS.",13
10,Mr MARR,FRENCH DECORATIONS FOR,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Did the French Government, upon the recommendation of General Pan, desire to bestow a limited number of decorations upon Austra2. Oan the Prime Minister state whether the application was blocked by the British Government? 3. Did he, when in England recently, make any inquiries as to why the decorations were blocked ? 4. If not, will ihe have inquiries made as to the reason for not permitting them to be bestowed? 5. Will he make representations to the British Government to give effect to the Trench Government's desire?",13
11,Mr HUGHES,FRENCH DECORATIONS FOR,"The answers, to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. Yes. 2. Inquiries will be made. 3. No. 4 and 5. See No. t. ALLOWANCE POST-OFFICES.",13
12,Mr CUNNINGHAM,FRENCH DECORATIONS FOR,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Are there a large number of allowance post offices in well-established but sparsely settled districts in which it is unlikely .there will ever be sufficient business to jus ti fy the erection and maintenance of tan official post-office? 2. If .so, as there are not any suitable buildings at these particular centres, and as the allowance officers have only a limited contract, will he give consideration to the matter of building suitable offices at these centres ? MT. GREENE - The answers furnished by the Postmaster-General's Department to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is not possible to determine what localities are likely to continue without retrogression or progression. 2. The Department makes allowance to the postmaster for the provision of suitable office accommodation. The period of engagement of a person in charge of an allowance post-office is governed only by satisfactory service, or the necessity for lowering or raising the status of the office. NA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER. Mr,HUGHES-On the 13th July, the honourable member, for Parramatta.

13,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Yesterday , the honourable member for Ballarat asked me a question relating to local Repatriation Committees at Ballarat, Bendigo, and Geelong. In connection with the Repatriation Committees in the more populous provincial centres, the Commissioner .. .. 220 opened branch offices, and provided a paid .. 2 secretary. The work has so diminished .. 283 that the retention of these branch offices Garden is no longer justified; but it is not intended to disband the local Repatriation Committees, whose patriotic services have 824 .. 320 proved of great value to the Department.

The state of publio business is fairly obvious. An almost criminal waste of time has been indulged in by certain honourable members MT . SPEAKER - Order 1 Mr HUGHES,-Then , I will say quasi-criminal. Mr BRENNAN.*- I ask that that word be withdrawn.",14
14,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I withdraw it, and will characterize the action of those orable members to whom I refer as a misdemeanour, not a crime. One cannot have his cake and eat it. These honourable members are like the prodigal. Having spent their substance in riotous living they now come home, and we propose to kill the fatted calf and do what we can to entertain them. To put the matter more prosaically, the notice-paper must 'be cleared. I do not say that it contains all the business with which the Government intends to proceed, but it contains some of the measures that must be dealt with. Others have been mentioned by me or iby my colleagues. I do not wish to reveal matters which a due regard for decency demands should be veiled, P but it is plain that the country is crying out for certain measures. There has been, for example, aai insistent demand for the reduction of taxation. Yet immediately we introduced measures to reduce taxation, members who had been calling aloud for such reduction promptly voted against them. Undeterred by this appalling inconsistency, Ministers propose to go on. There is the measure in charge of my honourable colleague^-wh o was, by the way, referred to last night by one of his critics in a very airy, and not at all proper, manner-the entertainment tax. There is the Superannuation Bill, a measure demanded by the public servants of the country. ",15
15,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Honourable members are pedantic this morning. I substitute the word requested. That Bill will be passed into law before Parliament is prorogued. Then, there has been a demand by the citizens of Australia for the placing of the Publio Service on a more effective footing, and provision for that is by the Public Service Bill. We have passed a measure remitting duties on certain articles used.by the man on the land, but provision has to be made for the granting of bounties to encourage the local manufacture of those articles. The measure relating to the unification of railway gauges must be pressed on with. Then there is the Budget. Year after year the discussion of the Budget was postponed until all interest in it had vanished. Usually that was the kind of treatment that the Budgets of the paet deserved. But hon- we have now before us a Budget which is sui generis. Opportunity must be given to those members whose solitary claim to public notice is that, in and out of season, they have demanded the discussion of the Budget. They are going to have an opportunity quite soon to discuss it thoroughly. Then the Estimates must be passed, and there are other measures which escape my memory for the moment.. But the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is looking at me as the sheep looks at the butcher, and, being humane, I shall not mention anything more that is likely to create unpleasant thoughts among members. I hope that the motion will be speedily ^ r ' c HAELTOIT (Hunter) [11.15] - I d am not opposed to our meeting on Tuesday, but the Prime Minister has cleverly camouflaged the reason for asking for extra sittings. The state of th© business paper is not the reason for th© submission of this motion. If the Prime Minister will take the trouble to look at the business-paper he will se© that, with the exception of one measure, there is nothing debatable on it-that there is no> proposal that would cause any lengthy debate. As a matter of fact, th© business could be cleared in a week. The Prim© Minister mentioned two matters arising out of the Budget, but these will not occupy a great deal of our time.",15
16,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I a,m glad to hear that.",15
17,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Th © only measure likely to engage our attention for any protracted time is tihe Public Service Superannuation Bill, and yet the right honourable gentleman is very careful to present this motion as one of urgency, on the ground that he desires to get the business cleared off so that w© may get into recess. Why cannot he be more made frank with the House and the country, and say that the real reason is that he desires to get to the constituencies? If he will not say that himself, I say it for him. In view of the small amount of business to be done, I consent to an extra sitting day only on the ground that the Prime Minister does go to the constituencies, for the sooner that is done the better it will be for Parliament. That suggestion does not seem, to me to meet with unanimous support. However, the Prime Minister, in an endeavour to justify this motion without giving the real reason, states that it is submitted because of misdemeanours on the part of the Opposition-becaus e we have obstructed business. But I venture to say that no fair-minded person acquainted with the work that has been done since the commencement of the session would say there has been any obstruction; indeed, there has never been what might be called a lengthy speech. I do admit, however, that it haa been necessary for the Opposition, in order to focus public attention on the misdemeanours of the Government, to submit several questions for consideration.",15
18,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"On e good misdemeanour deserves another! ISIr. CHARLTON - I submit that in taking the course we did we wasted no time. Of course, we can quite understand the Prime Minister being desirous to create the impression outside that because of obstruction by the Opposition he is compelled to abandon certain measures. I assured the Prime Minister yesterday that, so far as concerns the measures on the business-paper, there would be very little time consumed, and no obstruction by this party. I wish to repeat a question that I asked yesterday as to whether the Prime Minister intends, according to his promise in the Governor General's Speech, to introduce the constitutional amendments, and (have them submitted to the electors about the 9th December next. Either the Prime Minister does not intend to do that, or, if he does, he has not taken the House into his confidence. It is obvious to every honourable member that if we are to keep faith with the public in regard to these amendments they must be dealt with next week, or, otherwise, there will not be the interval of two months before we appeal to the people.",16
19,Mr MARR,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,There will be if the election is in March next.,16
20,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The honourable member speaks with his "" tongue in his cheek "" ; as Government Whip he knows [92] whether or not the elections will be held before March.",16
21,Mr MARR,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,I wish I did!,16
22,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Nobod y knows better than the Prime Minister when the election will be.,16
23,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"No , they do not tell me anything about it !",16
24,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The right honourable gentleman has made every preparation for the election, and he asks for an extra sitting day to get the business cleared off as early as possible. As to the Budget, I said, when six weeks' Supply was granted, that it was sufficient to carry the Government over until we went to the country, and I repeat that statement now. Inside six weeks the measures on the business-paper will be all passed. What is the use of talking about the Estimates, and there not being time to discuss them? As a matter of fact, the Government will have a job to keep a quorum by the time the business is through, for all will be off t j their constituencies. If our friends is the Corner wish to move any amendments on the Budget they will find themselves left "" on their own,"" and the Government will not care so long as they get the Estimates through. There will be no trouble when the Government once make it known that they are going to the country, because then the fight will be in the constituencies, and not in the House. The Government will be acting wisely if they take the people into their confidence now, and let it be known that an election is intended this year. It is obvious that an election is going to take place.",16
25,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Then why do the people wish to know if they know now?,16
26,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"They are waiting for the Prime Minister, who might change his mind and fix the election for March next. Once the right honourable gentleman makes a declaration, the people will know what is to be done.  Minister may change his opinion as often as he changes his constituency.",16
27,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Quite so. We have no objection to an extra sitting day in order to facilitate business, but we do expect the Government to introduce the constitutional amendments in time to submit them to the people, so that this Parliament may be given the enlarged powers that are neeessary.",16
28,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Cowper) [11.21]. - The other day, when we were in Committee, there was some objection raised to the use of a foreign tongue in this Chamber. To-day we have had more instances of the use of a foreign tongue here. The Prime Minister has described the Budget as sui generis, but we need not resort to a foreign tongue in order to say what the right honourable gentleman means. The Budget has all the characteristics of ""chop-suey,"" and it is generous in every respect-it is like a bunch of carrots for the stock to eat. The Prime Minister has referred to the business that has to be done, and to certain misdemeanours that have been committed by parties in this Chamber in the conduct of public business. I can only say that the Country party have never been guilty, during the whole life of this Parliament, of any obstructive tactics. On every measure introduced this party have, as far as lay in their power, brought constructive criticism to bear, but if they thought a given measure was altogether beyond repair, then, of course, the criticism became destructive. As to the business that has yet to be done, the Country party, whatever may be done by members of other parties, intend to remain at their posts right to the finish.",17
29,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,You will lose your seat3 if you do.,17
30,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"That may be, but that is what we intend to do. However, we should like some definite statement from the Prime Minister regarding the introduction of the constitutional amendments. Last year, when the Convention Bill was brought down, we had a definite statement from the Prime Minister in response to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) that we should have ample time to discuss those amendments to be submitted to the people at the next general election. In view of the constitutional difficulties that surround this question, we should like a definite statement now as to whether it is the intention of the Government to give the House an opportunity to discuss the amendments.",17
31,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Dalley) [11.25] - I quite fail to gather the real reason why this motion is necessary. I cannot see how an extra sitting day will assist the .Government. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) tells us that the extra day is to enable Parliament to get into recess, but I remind the honourable gentleman that Parliament has only recently met, after a recess of some months. When Parliament meets, and honourable members take the opportunity to ventilate some of the gross misdeeds of the Government.",17
32,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Misdemeanours !,17
33,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I prefer to call them misdeeds, aud I think that is the way in which the people of the country would describe them. When honourable members take advantage of their opportunities here to direct attention to the misdeeds of the Government, we find the Prime Minister airily saying that on account of obstruction here the Government are compelled to ask for an extra sitting day. That strikes me as the most serious reflection the Prime Minister could cast on his own Government. It is a clear indication or admission that the Government is hopeless and helpless to control the affairs of the House. The Government have a majority, and yet it is so helpless that a minority is able to block necessary business - If that be the position, the Government are unworthy to occupy the Treasury bench.",17
34,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"We have been far too lenient, and I reproach myself bitterly.",17
35,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Indeed , I think that it is the Opposition who have been altogether too lenient. We have not taken advantage of the opportunity to half the extent we might have done to assail the Government. Wc have allowed the Government to dodge on the question of sugar, which they have completely shelved by referring it to a Committee that in all probability will not submit any definite report before Parliament is dissolved. There is no necessity for an extra sitting day. If the Government have certain business to do, they have a majority behind them, and it is their duty to see that the business is carried through, as it can be in the ordinary course. The greatest admission of weakness and helplessness on the part of the Government is the submission of this motion today by the Prime Minister.",17
36,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Balaclava) [11.28] - I do not agree with the closing observations of the last speaker (Mr Mahony). I think that this motion will meet with the almost unanimous acceptance of the House. That is chiefly because of the intimation which was conveyed some fortnight ago by the Government to the Chamber, that it would be necessary, if expedition was to be resorted to in the discharge of public business, to give time allowance to measures; in other words, to use the guillotine if more progress was not shown. Some of us then thought the proposition to have an extra sitting before that extreme measure was used was infinitely preferable, and we said so. I still regard it as a better proposition than for the Government to mark out the time which the House may consume on individual issues. ",18
37,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"There are signs of 'that. As I said before, I think that the guillotine is an objectionable measure, unless absolute urgency is demanded.",18
38,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"It is an admirable machine, if properly used.",18
39,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"It is a splendid machine, if used with discretion, and in fairness to all concerned.",18
40,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,We shall have to wait a long time for that!,18
41,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The honourable member will have to wait a long time, particularly if the allusion of the Prime Minister to the appearance of his face, at the time the Prime Minister was speaking, has any element of truth in it . It is clear, I think, from what we see in the press, and what we hear whispered, that the Government's object, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said, has not been fully disclosed today. If this were an ordinary session, and it was proposed to get into recess in order to allow members to reach their homes by Christmas, it is true that the state of the business-paper would not justify the introduction of this motion. It is perfectly clear that if the Government desires are not frustrated this Parliament will go to the country as early as possible, and certainly before the end of the year; and I think the Government would be wise in directing such a course. I do not mean wise for their own sake. That remains to be seen; I mean wise for .the country's sake. I do not think, however, that the Government are animated entirely by that consideration. The most patent fact about this Parliament is that it ought to return to the people, for it has run its course. Without desiring to employ terms of impropriety, I would say that, in a political sense, this Parliament is demoralized, and that the sooner the people are given a chance to decide on the policy and personnel of a new Parliament the more likely are representative institutions to be restored to ipopular favour. If the Government, however, hurry to the electors and decide not to consider important matters which were promised at the opening of the session-whethe r they be on the notice-paper at this stage or not-the people will be rightly resentful. If , for example, Parliament were to give but slack consideration to the finances of the country by scurrying through the Budget debate, or if the Government were to ignore their repeated promises to adopt means for the amendment of the Constitution, such conr duct would be an improper use of their opportunities. I join with other honourable members in asking the Government to intimate as early as passible their intentions regarding the amendment of the Constitution. It is true that the Public Service Superannuation Bill is an important measure, but it is not so important as the basic or foundation law of our whole parliamentary system. The eagerness with which the Government have promised, not only to introduce, but to finalize the Superannuation measure before the close of this session proves, to me, at least, that the Prime Minister is out of focus in respect of that matter; that is to say, he will have proved h/mself so unless he follow it up immediately by announcing that the Government will deal also this session with the question of constitutional amendments and will afford the people the constitutional period, and opportunity, in which to decide regarding them. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) should receive consideration at the hands sf the Prime Minister. It will be of no use for the Government to introduce the subject of constitutional amendments at too late a stage. If the necessary Bills were introduced at ence the present moment would be early enough for Parliament to deal with it ; but if this opportunity to give the people the necessary two months' consideration required by the Constitution is let slip, the fault will be that of the Government. The Government have been insistent all along, ever since the taking of the Fisher referenda, upon the necessity - for changes in the Constitution. The proposed Convention Bill failed by reason of its own weight, through its own faulty construction. It was obviously doomed to failure from the first. Honourable members almost unanimously expressed the view that such must be its fate; but that expression did not and does not end our duty. If we believe that Australia cannot become a great nation until the National Parliament shall have been endowed with wider powers, the matter immediately ranks as more important even than finances at this particular stage. It is more important, indeed, than anything else in the Government's programme and in the promises contained in the Governor General's Speech. I trust that the Government will give this House an intimation, as early as may be possible-if not today, then, at least, on Tuesday next-regardin g the actual programme which they intend to pursue; and that they will announce, particularly, whether they intend to go on with the Constitution amendments.",18
42,Mr ROBERT COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Indi) [11.35] - I do not wish to be as scorching as th« honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt), but I protest against the Prime Minister making his appeal for an extra sitting day each week on the pretext or excuse that honourable members have been wasting time. There are very important matters still to be dealt with. The Electoral Bill is one of these; but the proposed amendments to the Constitution will necessitate the presentation of the most important Bills of all. There are still other weighty matters to be dealt with, such as, for example, the necessary legislation to deal with the railway gauges. Th* work of bringing about uniformity will run into £57,000,000; the first instalment alone will' involve a huge sum. Are honourable members to be expected to rush the necessary Bill through at a moment's notice, without consideration or debate? Are they to commit the people to enormous expenditure without ordinary legislative care and forethought? Then there is the Public Service Superannuation Bill-anothe r very important measure, and one which will involve the taxpayers in an expenditure of still more millions. Is that to be forced hastily through Parliament?",19
43,Mr GIBSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Wit h only half the members present.,19
44,Mr ROBERT COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"This place as absolutely disorganized. A hint has now been dropped that honourable members will not be given an opportunity to discuss the Budget, or that if they take the opportunity they will be compelled to remain here "" on their own."" If suggestions of that kind are "" playing the game,"" I must have only a very slight knowledge of honourable members' responsibilities to their constituents. If the Prime Minister would definitely announce when the elections are to be held, honourable members could settle down to business. The Prime Minister laughs. My remarks are matter for laughter also to some of his supporters. I warn them that it will be no laughing matter for many of them when the election results are announced. The tactics of the Government in bludgeoning business through after the fashion now proposed will receive critical consideration at the hands of the electors. In this chamber today Government supporters are gagged and bound. They are told not to dare to open their mouths; they are threatened with all sorts of happenings if they disobey. So, presumably, they do not intend to utter a word upon matters of the gravest importance. But do they really propose to permit the Superannuation Bill, and the measure for the unification of railway gauges to be rushed through without debate or the slightest examination? Do honourable members behind the Government actually propose to commit the taxpayers to the expenditure of millions of pounds without word or thought ?",19
45,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Hear , hear!",19
46,Mr ROBERT COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The right honourable gentleman may say, ""Hear, hear!"" on the other side of his face before long. He certainly would continue to do so if he had remained at Bendigo; but, having removed, - he will probably come back here and smile again. However, quite a number of his supporters will never return if they show the people that they propose to carry on the business of the country as it appears that they are about to do.",19
47,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"South Sydney) [11.39]. - I would like to hear a definite promise from the Prime Minister. I wish to know, specifically, if he is going back on his undertaking to place before the people the proposed alterations of the Constitution. Will the right honourable gentleman tell me whether or not the extra sitting day is intended to afford the Government time and opportunity to deal with the Bill for the suggested referenda? If such is their purpose I w support and assist them in that direction. I do not think that the measures will prove contentious. The Labour party has indicated that it desires the proposed amendments to be placed before the people. Members of the Country party have intimated the same. The Commonwealth cannot be properly governed unless full power is given to the responsible authorities. Since this House, apparently, will unanimously agree to the taking of Constitution referenda, urge the Prime Minister not to delay in making a definite announcement. present opportunity is a golden one. Honourable members are about to go before their constituents. This Parliament will have ended before many more days. It is urgently necessary, therefore, that the Bills to provide for the referenda should be immediately presented. I suppose that if the Government refrain from taking the necessary steps the proposal for holding a Convention will again be raised. If that course is adopted the Commonwealth will be put to the expense of selecting delegates from every State. A costly Convention will be held, and the results of its labours will eventually come before Parliament, which, if it accepts and ratifies them, will then submit the proposals to the people. Why should that devious course be adopted in view of the forthcoming elections? The matter is not a party one. All honourable members must agree that the huge expense involved in calling together a Convention, and in eventually taking a special referendum, should be obviated. The Constitution must be amended. The people should not have to submit to be governed by decisions of the High Court. At present the Parliamentary Accounts Committee is investigating the sugar question. When its report comes to hand it will be found that the Committee had not the power to secure complete information from the Colonial Sugar Befining Company. It will be learned that witnesses representing that company declined to give information. There is no power under the Constitution, according to a decision of the High Court, which can compel those witnesses to do so. I look for a candid announcement by the Prime Minister on Tuesday that' the Constitution Amendment Bills will be immediately introduced.",20
48,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Franklin) [11.43]. ill - I was one of those members who, last year, opposed the Constitution Convention Bill ; and I think the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) was another.",20
49,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,No !,20
50,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I opposed that measure because it contained not one word of earnest intent. If the Government and Parliament truly desire to amend the Constitution, the opportunity I is about to be afforded. The necessary referenda can be taken at practically The no expense. I strongly oppose the calling together of a special Convention and throwing the whole Constitution into tihe melting pot. If referenda are not taken at the forthcoming elections, a special election of delegates to the Convention will be entailed, at a cost of, probably, £100,000, and if its proposed amendments are subsequently submitted by Parliament to the people by means of a special referendum, another £100,000 will be involved. The alternative is, nothing being done for at least three years. Probably the whole business would cost the country a quarter of a million sterling. Last year, when the Constitution Conven- tion Bill was withdrawn, the Governmenti promised that the matter of constitutional amendments would be given consideration during this present session. The Governor General's Speech indicated that this course would be adopted. An y amendment of the Constitution must be referred to the people, and a general election gives an opportunity of doing that at a cost of only a few thousand pounds.",20
51,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER, Order ! This discussion is quite irregular.,20
52,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I merely wish to point out that if the Government do not proceed with these amendments of the Constitution now the whole matter will be held up for three years, unless a referendum is taken in the meantime, and at an ultimate cost of probably a quarter of a million pounds. The Prime Minister in closing this debate should announce whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the amendments of the Constitution during the present session. The House and the country have a right to that information, and there can be no reason for it being withheld. If the Prime Minister will state the intentions of the Government in this regard we shall know exactly where we are.",20
53,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Bendigo-Prime Minister) [11.46] - Despit e a little superficial criticism, there has been a surprisI ing unanimity in regard to this motion, and it is most refreshing to find honourable members at this stage in the history of the present Parliament so full of recognition of the Government's wisdom and foresight in this matter. A number of questions have been put to me about the date of an election of some sort. My acousticon is not working very well this morning, but I think "" election "" is the word that was used. That information I am not able to supply. Honourable members have told me their own views upon this matter; as to my own, I say frankly that I have, and always had, a rooted objection to elections. Bub in regard to this matter one is only as a cork tossed in a maelstrom. What can one poor man like myself do when this Parliament has taken the bit in its teeth, as I understand it has done? I was disappointed with the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), who said that "" The sooner we have an election the better."" The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) also said, ""The sooner we go before the people the better."" I am quite overwhelmed by these opinions. What can I da against the united wisdom of all parties manifested in this way? If honourable members are determined to go to the country, let them go; I will not attempt to stop them. That is that. As to the proposed amendments of the Constitution I must say that I am a little amused at this newborn zeal on the part of some honourable members. Weeks and weeks have passed during which have dealt with everything under the sun, in the bowels of the earth, and in the depths of hell, and in all that time there has not been one mention of the Constitution. Suddenly it is discovered that the Constitution goes to the very foundation of our political being, and that amendments are urgently necessary. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), who usually treats the House to portentous deliverances about finance and its vast importance, now says that nothing is worth a snap of the fingers in comparison with these alterations of the Constitution in regard to which he has been silent almost, I believe, since a time beyond which the memory of man does not go. I am the man who should talk about the amendment of the Constitution, for it was who urged amendments upon this Parliament and upon the reluctant and conservative factious sitting in opposition. But all my efforts were in vain. The people persisted in rejecting the amendments I pressed upon them. It comes as a shock to me, therefore, that the stone then rejected by the builders has now become the corner stone of the temple. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) said, "" If it is to be done it should be done now."" What should bo done? I would like to see the amendment of the Constitution for which the honourable member would dare to vote, and I would like to see that amendment put before the Leader of the Opposition, and made acceptable to him also. A nice kind of hotchpotch it wonld be. However, I do not intend to say anything about this matter. To be perfectly in order, my remarks must be confined to the motion. It is that the House shall meet on Tuesdays. Time to deliberate is what we want. I agree with the honourable member for Balaclava that we should not rush through the Budget discussion. We should have time to discuss it. Honourable members will have time, but they must attend here; they must not waste time. I waa surprised to hear first the Leader of the Opposition, and then the Leader of the Country party say that they had not been guilty of obstruction. If that be so, who has been ?",21

55,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The honourable member who interjects said that because we we did not bludgeon things through, because having a great power we did not use it tyrannically, we axe to be condemned. Liberty is the very soul of Democracy; we allowed the honourable member to speak; of if we had sandbagged him as we should have done he would have admired us as 15 men of inflexible purpose. However, glad that the House is in such a frame of' mind that it entirely agrees with me in regard to the motion. Those in - any decent revelations for. which I have been asked, I decline to make, because they would be quite out of order. In any market case honourable members seem to know tuting more about what is in store for us than I do. The honourable member for Balaascertained clava referred me to the press; evidently he reads the newspapers, because he said "" I saw it in the press."" If he saw it in the press, what can I tell him about it ? I am glad that the motion meets with the f approval, and I shall satisfy the curiosity of honourable members so far as to say plus that at. the first possible moment we shall place upon the business-paper all the production measures we propose to introduce. That is will afford honourable members an oppordetermined20 tunity of seeing what is on the Government's programme. For the rest, time Customs will disclose. Question resolved: in the affirmative.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, when the currency of the country of origin or export of .any gqods dutiable under section 8 of that Act depreciates to less than one-twelfth of its normal par value as compared with the pound sterling, the duty which shall be charged collected and paid under bhat section on the goods shall be such amount as refor an presents the difference .between(a) the landed cost in warehouse in Australia (including duty calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act 1901-1920) plus a percentage of profit to be determined by the Board, and (6) the Australian wholesale price of .similar goods of Australian 'manufacture. 0. For the purposes of the last preceding clauso the normal par value of the currency of any country shall .be such as is determined by the Minister. 7. Notwithstanding anything contained in the for Customs Act 1001-1920, the value for duty under that Act of goods dutiable under .clause of 5 of this resolution shall be the value ascertained in accordance with the Customs Act of 1901-1920, plus the special duty imposed under 8. Notwithstanding anything contained in not the Customs Act 1901-1920, or the Customs Tariff 1921, the duty payable under the Customs Tariff 1921 on goods dutiable under that Tariff otherwise than ad valorem which are dutiable also under clause S of this resolution, shall be the duty calculated in accordance with that Act and Tariff, plus 20 per centum of the duty shall be added so calculated. 9. Nothing contained in the last two preceding clauses of this resolution shall affect the calculation, for the purposes of paragraph (a) of clause 5 of this resolution, of duty in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act 1901-1920. 10.

If the Minister is satisfied after and report by the Tariff Board, that the duty imposed by section 8 of the Customs Tariff (In dustries* Preservation) Act 1921, is likely to be evaded by the consignment of goods to Australia for sale, he may direct that there shall be payable on any goods specified by him, by notice published in the Gazette, which have been consigned to Australia for sale, a duty on an amount which will , in his opinion, assure that the goods will not be sold in Australia at less than a reasonable selling price, as defined in section 6 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, as proposed to be amended in pursuance of this resolution, and duty in that amount shall thereupon be charged, collected, and paid to the King for the purposes of the Commonwealth on such goods. 12. In lieu of the provision in the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, that the duty payable on any particular goods under sections 4 to 7 inclusive of that Act, shall not either severally or collectively exceed 15 per centum of the value for duty of the goods as ascertained in accordance with Division 2 of Part XIII . of the Customs Act 1901-1920, there be substituted a provision that where duty has been imposed under section 8 or section 9 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, upon any particular goods, duty shall not be imposed upon those goods under the other of those sections. This motion precedes a proposed amendment of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation.) Act 1921. The experience gained by the Government and the Tariff Board, whose duty it is to advise the Government in regard to the working of the Act shows that certain amendments are vitally necessary. When the Industries Preservation Act was introduced last year, the House was told that there was no precedent for such legislation, and that there must be a good deal of experimentation about it, because it was impossible to gauge the trade vicissitudes that were ahead at a time when the world was receding from five years of great upheaval, during which all economic laws and normal conditions had been set aside. By general acclaim, the Commonwealth has adopted a policy of Tariff Protection for Mr Rodgers. its industries, and it was felt that the Protection afforded by the Customs Tariff, if unsupported, would be of little avail, owing to the economic conditions obtaining in certain countries, and the depreciation in the exchange value of the currencies of those countries, which gave-to their manufacturers a tremendous advantage in the cost of production. Accordingly, the Industries Preservation Act, which was passed in December of last year, was an attempt to maintain our inquiry national policy of Protection of Australian industries. At that time, exchange was nearer to normal than it is today. When the Act was passed, the mark had depreciated from 20 to 240 to the £ 1 sterling, but today it is quoted at 7,025 to the £ 1 sterling.",22
57,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Does the Minister consider that that gives an advantage to German manufacturers?,23
58,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The greatest economists in the world are perplexed in regard to the question. The advisers of the Government in this matter are the members of the Tariff Board, who have had a wide experience in trading and commercial circles, and command the respect of the Australian trading and commercial community and producing interests. Having had the opportunity of conferring with the Australian business world, and of visiting most of the capital cities of the Commonwealth, and many provincial centres, they have learnt a great deal of the working of the Act, and have gathered information concerning the economic conditions of countries which have a depreciated currency, and as a result of their experience, and of the information they have thus gained, they have submitted recommendations to the Government for amendments of the main measure. It will simplify the position if I read their report, which is dated 2*nd August, 1922. It is as follows:In a separate memorandum submitted herewith under the heading "" Protection of Australian Industries-Propose d Amendment to Section 154 of the Customs Act,"" the Tariff Board has submitted proposed amendments to the Customs Act. In the course of the inquiries which gave rise to the submission of that report there came under the notice of the Board the necessity to also amend the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, to insure that the intended effect of that Act shall be achieved. -2. The Board wishes to particularly emphasize the fact that in the unanimous opinion of its members it will 'be necessary that effect be given to both the recommendations hereinafter made, and the recommendations for the amendment of the Customs Act. Neither the amendment to the dumping provisions, nor the amendment to the Customs Act alone, will give sufficient power to adequately protect Australian industries. Explanation to the Proposed 3. Section 5: Sub-section 4 of section 5 reads:"" In this section ' a reasonable price' means such a price as represents the cost of production of the goods, plus five per centum, plus free on board charges."" 4. In the opinion of the Board, this proposal will not provide a reasonable price. The evidence obtained on every hand is that the proposal to add only 5 per cent, to the cost of production of the goods will make the protection in this section of no value whatever. The Board, after closely investigating the matter, agrees with the representations made, and recommends that the Board should have power to f i x a .reasonable addition, but that the maximum addition be fixed in the Act at 20 per cent. It is considered that .the present provision unduly favours oversea exporters, and is entirely opposed to the interests of local manufacturers. 5. Section G: Sub-section 4 of section 6 reads:"" In this section ' a reasonable selling p r i c e ' means the price ascertained upon the following basis, namely:-To the fair .market value of the goods there shall be added the freight, insurance, landing, and other charges, together with the amount of duty payable under the Customs Tariff, together with five per centum on the aggregate of all the items mentioned."" ' G. The Board recommends that instead of 5 per centum in the sub-section there be inserted a provision allowing the addition of a percentage to be fixed by the Tariff Board, but not to exceed 15 per cent. It is difficult to state the definite rate which should be applied, but the Board is satisfied as the result of careful investigation that 5 per cent, is wholly insufficient. The reason why 15 per cent, is recommended in this instance as against 20 per cent, in the preceding section is that the percentage in this case is added to the fair market value, plus freight and charges, whereas in the preceding section the 20 per cent, is added to the cost of production only. 7. In ' sub-section 5 of section 6 "" 5 per tum "" is again mentioned in two places. In conformity with the recommendation to amend section 5 (4) the Board recommends that this be altered to provide for an addition determined by - the Board, but_ not to exceed 20 per centum. In this case it is the cost of production, which has to be plussed up, and the figure recommended is, therefore, consistent with the previous recommendation. 8. Section 8: Owing to the rapid depreciation of the currency of some European Continental countries since this Act was dealt with , the present provision of a maximum of 75 per cent, is altogether insufficient to meet the competition likely to arise from such countries, and, further, the Board considers it would be practically impossible to accurately arrange a series of advances on the present maximum to meet the present position of the exchanges. 9. The effect of such wholesale depreciation cannot be properly estimated, and it appears to the Board that it would be better to arrange for a method of protection' similar to that Amendments. laid down in section 9. If such a course were followed, the penalty duty would be imposed on the difference between(a) the landed cost in warehouse in Australia (including duty calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act 1901-1920), plus a percentage of profit to be determined by the Board, and (b) the Australian wholesale price of similar goods of Australian manufacture. The ordinary Tariff duty would then be imposed, in addition to this penalty duty, and would be calculated on a sum equal to the value for duty under the Customs Act, plus the penalty duty. It will be necessary to insert a clause providing for this. 10. This provision will, of course, only be effective when goods are dutiable according to value. As importations may come under notice of goods subject to specific duties (that is, so much per ton, per gallon, or per pound) it will be necessary to insert a clause securing an equal protection to such goods as would be afforded to ad val. goods. 11. It should be pointed out that the protection at present afforded in section 9 to B r i tish goods is greater than that afforded under section 8 to Australian goods. 12. The Board, whilst recognising that Parliament has endeavoured to give adequate protection to British industries under this Act, cannot believe that it was the intention of Parliament to give greater protection to goods the produce of the United Kingdom than to goods manufactured in Australia, but the depreciation of the currencies since the Act was, passed has brought that position about. 13. In view of the very unsettled state of the exchanges, and of the uncertainty as to the effect they will have on the selling price of goods, the Board considers that the better course would be to adopt a similar provision in section 8 to that followed in section 9, and accordingly recommends that, when the figure denoting the rate of exchange is greater than 300 francs to the £1 (i.e. for French or Belcen- gian currencies) or 240 marks to the £1 (i.e. for German currency) or relatively for other currencies, provision should be made for a penalty duty on the lines suggested in paragraph 9 above. 14. Section 9: The amount of dumping duty under this section is at present provided for in sub-section 3 as follows:""The amount of the dumping preference duty in each case shall be the sum which represents the difference between the fair market value in the United Kingdom and the export price."" 15. It is rcommended that this section should remain as printed, but that an addition should be made of the following words:"" Notwithstanding anything contained in the Customs Act 1001-1022, the value for duty of goods dealt with under this section shall be the value as ascertained in accordance with that section, plus the penalty duty under this section."" 16. If this amendment is not made, the benefits of the British Preferential Tariff rate be insufficient to equalize the advantage that the, say, German goods will derive from paying duty only on the value for duty, as provided in the present law. It will be clear that the ordinary duty should be calculated on the value after it has been brought up to the British level. 17. Section II : Owing to an oversight, the word ""two,"" appearing in the second line of this section was not altered when section 9 was Inserted. It is necessary, therefore, to delete the word ""two,"" and in its place insert the word "" three"". ' IS. Section 12: This section reads as follows:"" The various duties imposed by this Act shall be separately charged, notwithstanding that more duties than one may apply to any particular goods; Provided that the duty payable on any particular goods under sections 4 to 7 inclusive of this Act shall not either severally or collectively exceed 15 per centum of the value for duty of the goods, as ascertained in accordance with Division 2 of Part VIII . of the Customs Act 19011920."" 19. The Board very strongly urges that the proviso (i.e., the second paragraph) be deleted. 20. It has been repeatedly suggested that certain dumping is likely to take place, which should be dealt with under section 4 of the Act. In every instance it was shown that the 15 per cent, would he wholly insufficient to the needs of local industries, and would be far below the difference between the fair market , value of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price. 21. The Board considers it only reasonable that, should deliberate dumping take place, the penalty should provide that Australian industries should be protected to the full extent of the value involved. It will bo readily understood that exporters desiring to defeat the provisions of section 4 will reduce their dumping difference to more than 15 per cent., when they will immediately have the local market at their mercy. 22. it i recommended that the following 3 proviso be added to section 12, in lieu of the paragraph deleted:"" Provided that, where duty posed under section 8 or section 9 of. this Act upon any particular goods, duty shall not be imposed upon those goods under the other of those sections."" Although the wording of sections 8 and 9 might be considered at present to indicate that the two sections are not to be applied to the same goods, it is possible that section 12 .might sugMr Rodgers. gest the opposite intention. The proviso is, therefore, suggested to remove any possible doubt. Mr ""WATT - What would be the effect if that proviso were substituted for the existing one, seeing that no maximum would be provided?",23
59,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Some traders conwill tend that they would be entitled to the accumulated effect of the protection afforded in sections 8 and 9-that is to say, to the benefit of the Australian protection plus the British protection. But that was never intended, and the proposed amendment will make the position perfectly clear in that respect. I cannot expect the Committee to follow quite clearly the effect of the proposed amendments offhand, and as this is a busiuess measure, with definite business provisions, I think that I should afford honourable members an opportunity over the week-end of studying the main measure and the effect of the proposed amendments, and of perusing the Tariff Board's recommendations.",25
60,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Will the matters that have to be determined' by the Tariff Board be determined in respect of each particular line? Take, for example, German pianos.",25
61,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Yes . Each article has to be separately listed and gazetted, and there has to be an examination in regard to each. The proving of depreciation in the currency of the country of origin which, under the terms of the meet principal Ac t would do in j u r y to Australian industry, will not bring about the automatic scheduling of every article imported from that country. Each item is to be dealt with on its merits. Some of the importations may be goods of a kind not manufactured in Australia, and it is not proposed to penalize them.",25
62,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Will the Minister explain how depreciation in exchange affects the position when we are dealing with goods the value of which is fixed by our own sterling ? What does it matter, when we have the landed price fixed in pounds, shillings, and pence, and it discloses that has been im- there is no unjust competition?",25
63,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,That is the whole point.,25
64,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"It seems to me that the phrase "" depreciation of exchange "" means nothing when the equivalent of foreign money in English money has been ascertained.",25
65,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Expert s have not yet determined the point at which depreciation - affects the economic position.,26
66,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"There is a general agreement thab depreciation assists to some extent, in its foreign competition, the country where that depreciation exists.",26
67,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Sectio n 5 of the principal Act reads as follows: 1. If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that goods produced or manufactured outside Australia have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish a notice in the Gazette specifying the goods as to which he is so satisfied. 2. Upon the publication of the notice, there shall be charged, collected, and paid to the use of the King for the purposes of the Commonwealth, on those goods imported into Australia, a special duty (in this section referred to as ""the dumping below cost duty""). 3. The amount of the dumping below cost duty in each case shall be the sum which represents the difference between a reasonable price of the goods at the time of shipment. and the export price of the goods. 4. In this section, "" a reasonable price"" means such a price as represents the cost of production of the goods, plus five per centum, plus free on board charges. It is proposed to omit from sub-section 4 the words "" five per centum,"" and to substitute for them the words "" such addition, not exceeding twenty per centum, as is determined by the Tariff Board."" Traders and manufacturers generally are of opinion that 5 per cent, is an absurdly low margin to allow.  considered in this matter. Mr Rodgers,-That is not the the point with which I am now dealing. My tweenpredecessor in office, the present Minister for Defence (Mr Greene), provided in hi9 d r a f t Bill for a profit of 20 per cent., but honourable members thought otherwise, and the amount was reduced to 5 per oent.",26
68,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"-Wit h the Minister's consent, I think.",26
69,Dr EAHLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,The Minister himas self brought the proposition down.,26
70,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"There was a good deal of discussion before the alteration was made. The Tariff Board, after in the vestigation and an inquiry in the trading world, is satisfied that 5 per cent, is a reasonable margin. Section 6 is to be similarly amended. Then we come to section 8, which provides the main protection for Australian industry. That section reads1. If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin or export of any goods has depreciated, and that by reason of such depreciation goods have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at prices which will be detrimental to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish a notice in the Gazette specifying the country as to the exchange value of the currency of which he is so satisfied, and the goods originated in or exported from that country to which, in his opinion, the provisions of this section should apply. 2. Upon the publication of the notice, there shall be charged, collected, and paid to the use of the King, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, on all goods specified in the notice, produced or manufactured in or exported from the country specified therein, a spejial duty, at a rate to be ascertained in accordance with the schedule. The schedule provides a penalty duty in. the case of the mark up to 75 per cent, on a depreciation of 240 to the £ 1 . At the time when that penalty was agreed to, the value of the mark was less than 240 to the £ 1 . On today's quotation, it stands at 7,025 to the £ 1 . Thus, the protection originally provided is quite in effectual. It is, therefore, proposed to add to the section this provisionNotwithstanding anything contained in this Act, when the currency of the country of origin or export of any goods is depreciated to less than one-twelfth of its normal par value, as compared with the £ 1 sterling That was the case with both franc and mark at the time the duty was first prospecial dumping duty to be charged shall be an amount representing the difference be(a) The landed cost in warehouse in Australia (including duty calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act 1901-1920), plus a percentage of profit to be determined by the Board; and (6) the Australian wholesale price of similar goods of Australian manufacture, shall he determined by the Minister. There may be violent fluctuations in the value of a currency in the space of one day, and it will be for the Minister, on advice of the Tariff Board, to determine the value of the currency of a not particular country on any particular day.",26
71,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,That will be hard to do.,26
72,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Yes , but there must be some settled basis.",27
73,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Still , the stock exchanges of the Continent are very unsettled at present. Mr CHAHI.TON - Would it not be better to put the value on a par with our own in all cases ?",27

78,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Yes . The Act is not aimed at any particular country. Broadly speaking, it is a further instalment of protection-a n attempt to protect protection. ",27
79,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"No . What would be the value of our national policy if it could be destroyed by unforeseen and unobviable conditions? Honourable members know the woeful state of Central Europe today. In every case, detriment to Australian industry must be proved; that is the foundation of the measure. Full opportunity will be given to both local manufacturers and importers to state their views, but when the Tariff Board is satisfied, after inquiry, that detriment would accrue to a local industry, the item concerned is gazetted. All parties affected will be heard by the Board, which will come to its determinations only after investigation.",27
80,Mr BRENNATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Is it not a fact that in some instances a penal duty of 75 per cent, is being imposed upon imported pianos that are actually being sold here at a much higher price than locally-made pianos of the same kind?",27
81,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"That has not been proved. Pianos present a test case, and they have been gazetted. Representations have been made to the Board by importers, one of whom I have particularly in mind. He was asked to make out his case, and he prepared a most elaborate statement, which I have not seen fully, though I know the material parts. In his statement he showed that he had got into touch with the producing costs at the other side of the world; and naturally those who desire to do business will not take what might be called chance risks of the loss of money, but will, through their principals, ascertain all the facts in regard to the producing costs.",27
82,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Australia n importers have gone further, and have sent men throughout the Continent on a special mission to find what they can buy.",27
83,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"That is so; and I have told those concerned not to ask me to interpret what penalty willi be imposed, but to ascertain the economic conditions in the exporting country. That applies not only to one country, but to many with depreciated currencies. Nothing would delight the world better than to see a stabilizing of the world's exchanges. It would be preferable if Australia had not to introduce measures of this description, though I am afraid we are a long way from that happy state. Not many men have made endeavours in thi9 direction more than Lloyd George, and he presents a worthy spectacle in his negotiations to establish . a new working basis in Central Europe for a "" down and out world."" Nothing would please me more than to see the stabilizing of exchanges, and, as I say, no necessity for measures of this kind. But we are faced by present conditions, and we should be recreant to our duty if we allowed the national policy of this country to be practically wiped out by economic conditions over which we have little control at this end. It is for that reason that the Tariff Board, with the experience gained up to date, say that important changes are stiU necessary. At present we have difficulty, not only with countries with depreciated currencies, but with countries with appreciated currencies. Recently I was requested by a body of primary producers to impose absolute prohibition against the entry into Australia of certain primary products from a country with an appreciated currency. The ground of the application was that the local market was being ruined, and these producers claimed that they and their families were being hounded off the land.  better to control the local markets, with both secondary and primary industries.",27

87,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"But we have to protect the industries that are now here, and there never was a time when we were more called upon to do so. I now come to paragraph 7 of the resolution. At the present time the actual working effect of the Act is that the penalty duty is limited to 75 per cent, ad valorem on the goods imported. Under the proposed alteration, the siame principle or protection will be applied to Australian dustries as is applied in the parent Act to industries of the United K in g d o m ; that is, the penalty duty is to equal the difference between the home consumption price in Germany and the home consumption price in Britain. The new proposal is that a similar penalty shall apply to Australia. It has been found. that 75 per cent., with a depreciated currency of 240 marks in the £ 1 , as provided in the main Act, is not effective protection when the mark has reached 7,025 in the £ 1 . We, therefore, . propose to apply the principle I have indicated, not only to the mark, but to the currencies of all countries where the depreciation exceeds that set out in the schedule to the Act. Let me give an illustration, taking as a unit goods valued at £100. To that must be added f.ob. charges, freight, insurance and exchanges, ordinary duty, and estimated profit not to exceed 20 per cent. In such a case the penalty duty will be the difference between the total of those charges, and the Australian wholesale price. It is, of course, somewhat difficult for honourable members to follow figures of this description, and, therefore, I propose to put the case in another way, taking the same u n it of goods, valued at £100. We take the export selling price in the country of export at £ 1 0 0 , and to that we add the approximate charges of f.o.b., £ 5 ; freight £ 1 0 ; insurance, exchange, & c , £ 2 ; duty £ 5 0 ; and the trade profit^ of a maximum of 20 per cent., thus making a total of £187. W it h the Australian wholesale price for the same article at £200, the penalty duty will be the difference between £187 and £200, or £13.",28
88,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,What has depreciation got to do with it ?,28
89,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"It is considered that depreciation of exchange must result in the importer paying fewer pounds sterling to meet the charge which is based on value in German marks. If depreciation is not a factor, it will not be present in the calculation. Unless there be an economic advantage by depreciation, it is clear that there will not be much to pay in dumping duty. As the German or any other depreciated currency improves and becomes normal, this measure becomes inoperative in regard to it-the Act is operative only so long as depreciation exists, and so long as export prices are in - thereby reduced. Section 9 of the principal Act is amended by the proposed addition of the following sub-sectionNotwithstanding anything contained in the Customs Act 1901-1920, the value for duty under that Act of goods dutiable under section 9 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921 shall be the value ascertained in accordance with the Customs Act 1901-1920 plus the dumping preference duty imposed under section 9 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921. This country has declared a policy of preference in regard to the good's of the United Kingdom, and, as the Act stands, there is a danger of the preference not being maintained if the penalty is i m posed only upon the difference between the current export price, say in the case of Germany, and the home consumption price in Britain. It is now proposed to add the amount of the dumping duty to the ordinary value for duty of the goods, and thus maintain a margin of preference to the United Kingdom.  you start the price the goods are sold at in the country of origin ?",28
90,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Yes .  wrong about that?,28
91,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I have explained that it is proposed to add the charges, and even then the landed duty-paid cost is less than the price of the Australian made goods.  that the goods are still under the price at which they are sold locally, the difference is added 1",29
92,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"That is so.  "" heads I win, tails you lose.""",29
93,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The honourable member has not listened to what I have said, or has not mastered its purport.  in the country of origin, it cannot ba called dumping.",29
94,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"That is the production cost, and the normal trading costs are added. Australian industry cannot live against such competition.  means selling at a price less than cost.",29
95,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"This provision not only covers what may be called dumping, but also seeks to protect us against depreciation and exchange. I shall, as promised, give honourable members an opportunity over the week-end to examine the report of the Tariff Board, and to study the terms of the motion which I have submitted. Section 11 is proposed to be amended formally. It has to do with evasion of duty, and the intention is that - its provisions shall cover the imposition of duty by any of the preceding three sections rather than of the "" last two preceding sections.""' It is proposed to omit the proviso to section 12, which has to do with the duties to be collected separately, and to insert a new proviso, as follows: Provided that, where duty has been imposed, under section 8 or section 9 of this Act, upon any particular goods, duty shall not be imposed upon those goods under the other of those sections. I repeat that the view has been held that penalties might possibly be imposed cumulatively. Such, however, is not intended. A manufacturer must take advantage either of the protection afforded to British manufacturers or of that given to Australian manufacturers of similar goods; he may not avail himself of both. He cannot have them in their cumulative effect. The manufacturer's application will require to be in respect either of the British or 1 of the Australian protection. Previously, these differed in principle; it is now proposed to make the principle uniform, where the depreciation of currency is greater than that set out in the principal Statute. The local manufacturer, and the importer also, will now know the basis upon which the provisions of the Act will be applied. I have already mentioned that the Government did not fear any great immediate inrush of goods to this country. That attitude has been borne out by experience. It would be very wrong, however, to expose manufacturers and business men generally to the possibility of a flood of foreign products setting in . Were we to take the risk of permittin g matters to stand as they are todav, there might be a sudden recovery of trade, some unexpected surge of business, the effect of which would be to wipe out certain of our industries at a time when Parliament was not in session. It becomes necessary, therefore, that the Bill should be passed into law forthwith. The Government will seek to amend the Customs Act so that the whole situation may be considerably strengthened by the provision of necessary legislative machinery should necessity arise for its operation.

[Quorum formed].",29
96,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Cowper) [2.17] This Bill proposes a few small alterations in the method by which elections can be conducted, but most of all it deals with a new method of electing the Senate, and it is to that principally I intend to address myself. There have been several alterations in the method of electing senators, and apparently each one has produced a result less satisfactory than its predecessor from the point of view of the public. There is no doubt that if alterations are to be continually made, the Senate will ultimately commit hari-kari, and the public will declare that, as the characteristics of the Chamber are not what the founders of Federation intended, as the Chamber has become merely a replica of the party character of the House of Representatives, as it has no power and is not performing any necessary function, it would be better to abolish i gether. Other matters dealt with in the Bill include the deposit by candidates. I think that the deposit to be made by a senatorial candidate should be dealt with liberally. A candidate who intends to canvass the whole of a State must necessarily incur a great deal of expense, and the possibility of being mulct for not polling a certain proportion of the total number of votes cast deters many people from submitting their names to the electors. With regard to postal voting, the suggested amendment will restrict to some degree the present system. I would like some liberality to be shown, especially to aged people and those living far outback. Many of them are not able to avail themselves of even the present method of postal voting. The third matter dealt with by the Bill is the secrecy of the ballot. I should like a little more definite information from the Minister as to how far the secrecy of the ballot will be secured by this new provision.",30
97,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,I have already indicated that I propose to drop the. numbering clauses for the present.,30
98,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I am glad to hear that. The main purpose of the Bill is to remodel the method of electing senators, and the alteration suggested is the adoption of the old American ticket system of grouping candidates according to the parties to which they belong. That involves a very radical departure from any previous system in operation in Australia. I do not think that the proper time for the consideration of an electoral alteration of that character is immediately before an election, when it is difficult, indeed, to give the amendment that impartial consideration which all matters affecting the electoral laws should have. On the last occasion when an alteration was made in connection with senatorial voting exactly the same procedure was followed. The Bill was brought down a short time before the House was dissolved, and without adequate consideration was rushed into law. l i we are to have continual alterations in the method of electing senators, changes which apparently will only unsettle the public mind and make it more difficult to procure an intelligent vote, the proper time to do so is in the middle of a Parliament, t altoso that there may be ample time before the elections for the alteration to sink into the minds of the electors, and for the various party organizations to get busy in instructing their supporters as to how the new machinery must be worked. At the last election there were in New South Wales alone 67,000 informal votes due largely to the fact that there was too little time in which to acquaint the public of the alteration in the .method of voting. That some alteration is necessary in connection with the election of the Senate everybody will, agree. That body is not performing the functions which it was intended to perform by the founders of Federation. Never at any time has it had the characteristics of a States House except in its form. It certainly has never acted as a States House. It has become a party House, and the proposed system of grouping will intensify its party character to such an extent as to nullify uhe spirit of the Constitution.",30
99,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,The Senate cannot be made more of a party House than it is at the present time.,30
100,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"It can. At the present time the Labour party has two representatives in the Senate, but the proposed system may mean the election of a Senate comprising thirty-six members of one party. The present condition of affairs is recognised by everybody throughout Australia to be ludicrous, but it is a good thing that it has been brought about. The previous election, which yielded a Senate comprising thirty-one members of one party and five of another, was bad enough, but when the composition was altered to thirty-five of one party and one of another, and now thirtyfour and two respectively, a condition of affairs was created which does not commend itself to the public. In my opinion the object of this proposed legislation is to consolidate the position which has been created, and to insure that the oneparty character of the Senate should be perpetuated. Of course, if the pendulum should swing to the other extreme there would be just a reversal of the present party representation. These amendments, if carried, will entrench the party machine more firmly in the position it has already obtained. This grouping will tend to encourage the system of pre-selection whioh was recently decried by the National Federation of Victoria, and which a prominent Labour man in Sydney said was provocative of nearly all the trouble that arose in connection with elections.",30
101,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Of course, the Country party is quite harmonious on the subject of elections.",31
102,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"In New South Wales, every man who is endorsed by the Country party may run as a candidate. We ran twelve men for one seat, and as many men as choose to offer themselves can contest any seat so long as they subscribe to the party's platform. That is one step towards a cleaning up of the party machine, and giving an opportunity to the public to say who should be returned to Parliament instead of their representatives being selected beforehand by cliques and coteries. system, proposed by the Government will not merely intensify the evils of the party system, but will practically insure that a block vote will be given for candidates. .That must have a deleterious effect upon the public life of the Commonwealth, and lower the calibre of the men returned to the Senate. Our object should be to return to Parliament men who have some claimto distinction or attainment. The - proposed system will merely accelerate the present vicious method by which any .men who are endorsed by a party, no matter how obscure or lacking in qualifications they may be, will be able to be returned to Parliament because they have a solid party vote behind them. The tendency of a party, too, will always be to look for men whose names begin with some letter of the alphabet before M "" in order to insure that its candidates are near the head of the ballot-paper, thus getting a better chance of securing the No. 1 votes. Anybody with a name such as I have will be relegated to the ranks of the independents. There will be a general rush on the part of prospective candidates to change their names to others commencing with A , B, or C. The Senate should not be a mere resting place for men elected in the way I have stated, and whose qualifications are only that they stand well with the party machine. As far as possible the Senate should be a non-party House and a House of review, and I think the public are getting thoroughly sick of the existing condition of affairs. In the United States of America, which has a Constitution similar to our own, the Senate, instead of having depreciated in importance, has gradually become probably the most important factor in American public life.",31
103,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,The senators there are directly representative of the States.,31
104,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"It is true that the system of electing senators there differs from ours; but at the beginning the Senate itself started under handicaps similar to those in Australia, and until the year 1825 there was a constant fight, in which the Senate was sometimes the loser and sometimes the winner, between the two Houses as to which was to have the bigger say on certain matters of public policy. Since 1825 it has been universally admitted that the intellectual The leadership of the United States of America has passed into the hand of the Senate. That body is regarded as a place where intellectual experience is conserved, and the tendency is for men who spend, one or two terms in the House of Representatives to seek a senatorial place as the blue ribbon of Federal politics in America. Here in - Australia, however, we find senators seeking, as the honourable  has done, to leave the Senate and come - into, the hurly-burly of the House of Representatives.",31
105,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The honourable members for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), and Boothby (Mr Story) and Capricornia (Mr Higgs) were also formerly senators.",31
106,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"Yes , they appa. rently regard the securing of a seat in the House of Representatives as a step upwards, instead of downwards, and this is due in a very large degree to the method adopted in the past for selecting and electing candidates for the Senate. The block system under which the elector's choice is indicated by crosses, as was the case before the last election, or by numbers, under the bastard preferential system in use at the last election, has not tended to give the best results.  posite system ?",32
107,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"The term I have used is applicable so long as Mr Speaker does not object to it . A method by which better results could be obtained, and under which the Senate could be made more thoroughly representative of all classes of the people, and be given a better non-party complexion and flavour, would be to adopt the proportional system of voting for the election of candidates. That system could hardly be adopted while the Government are hanging hard and fast to the principle of grouping candidates; but it would be well for us to apply the machinery for proportional representation and leave the candidates absolutely free in the places they have occupied on the ballot-papers in the past. I suppose that, roughly, 50 per cent, of the people are not in any political party, We have found from our experience that the votes of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, of the electors sway any Senate election. As a matter of fact, the character of the Senate has been determined by 3 per cent, or 4 per cent., and, in some cases, even less than 1 per cent., of the total number of electors voting, and the effect of the action of a small number of individuals has been to deprive huge minorities of representation in the Senate. That was the case at the last Senate election. The first preference votes were cast for the New South Wales Senate candidates at the last election as follows: Cox ... ... 229,435 Duncan ... ... Garling ... ... Falkiner ... ... 100,620 Gardiner ... ... 113,006 Grant ... ... '84,328 MCDougall £3,981. . Despite the fact that he secured about 46 per cent, of the total of first preference votes, it waa practically by a chance that Senator Gardiner was finally elected.  that his name was mistaken for that of Senator Garling.",32
108,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"It would not be surprising if that were the case, and that just by pure accident a proper result accrued. It would have been most ridiculous to have a Chamber of review in which the whole of the members were representatives of 'one party.",32
109,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,Why would it be ridiculous if the people were of that view t,32
110,Dr EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"They were net all of that view. I have shown that there were 46 per cent, the other way, and yet they might have had no say at all. It is bad for a country to have only one party represented in its legislative halls. The very essence of representative government is that all sections of the community should have their spokesmen in Parliament. The very fact that they are given that opportunity, although they are sometimes represented in fairly small minorities, makes the public of all British speaking countries accept defeats at the poll with good grace, and without any feeling of resentment, and enables parliamentary government to be carried on. But if we are to perpetuate the present system and make it more difficult to change, as will be the case if the new proposals of the Ministry be adopted, we shall be taking a retrograde step, and one which must ultimately lead to the abolition of bi-cameral government in this Parliament as we know it at this time. In order to allow honourable members to express an opinion on the point, I propose to submit amendments in Committee to delete clauses 10, 11, and 31, and insert new clauses' to provide for the adoption of the machinery of proportional representation designed on the lines which are regarded as the best in use at the present time. To do so, it will be necessary to amend certain other clauses, not because they are bad in themselves, but 6,952 because they would be in conflict with 5,949 the new provisions. I have spoken on the second reading in . order that I could thoroughly explain the position before honourable members proceeded to the discussion of the clauses in Committee. this Parliament decides to adopt the portional system it will be in very Country.

The clause would enable a candidate to be blackmailed by two others selected by the same organization, who might exact terms from him before permitting hi3 name to be grouped with theirs, because if his name were not so grouped the electors would say, "" There must be something wrong with this candidate, as the other candidates in his party will not allow his name to be grouped with theirs,"" and he would thus occupy an in vidious position.

Under the present system some other candidate might say, "" I am as good as a Labour man,"" and try to associate himself' with the Labour candidates, but the grouping system will prevent this. The Labour candidates will be grouped together, and will dissociate themselves from all who are not members of their organization.

Then there is a disadvantage in the alphabetical arrangement, and it seems to me a great pity that some other device, something in the nature of a round-robin, could not be adopted. The whole of our political l if e seems to tend towards grouping, but when there are only three seats to be filled, we never find a party desiring to put forward four men.

140,Mr WATT,PUBLIC SERVANTS NOT UNDER,"I am not matter, but stating a fact. I believe that, in certain circumstances, would simplify the task of the elector, but not if the groups decided on are to be labelled with the mystic symbols A B, and C. The simplification, if we strive for simplification, should be certain beyond doubt. Por example, if we are going to group, why not say plainly: these men are Nationalists? Let others say, "" We are the Official Labour party candidates,"" while My those who decline to group, but prefer to t r a i l alone on their track, and win the race with , perhaps, very little under the saddle, may calil themselves "" Independents "" or any other name. I can understand the elector's task being much simplified if thab is done; but I object to pay the price which the proposed theoretical simplification involves. And this is what it seems to me it does in volve: It introduces in a more cohesive, definite, and tyrannical way the power of the party machine. I do not care much, in discussing this matter, whether the machine be that of the Labour party, the Country party, the Nationalists, or any other party. I believe that party organization has a fair and special use in the public life of a democratic community like this, but its exhibition and operation ought to have a very definite end and limitation. That is to say, a. party machine may be useful if worked without coercion on independent candidates or electors, but it may be the very reverse, and, in fact, dangerous or ruinous, if used beyond reasonable limits. The present party machines have been developed as far as it is safe to develop them, - I am without coercion of individual electors or candidates. If we go the further step, Bill . we are then abusing the power which party can legitimately exercise, and are I destroying the freedom the elector should enjoy. So fa r as I am concerned, that is what the whole thing boils down this to. There are other questions associated this which are important, but not For example, if we pass clause of hear3, there is a clause which shows how we must group the candidates.

If , for there is a group composed of Smith, Thompson, and Robinson, because they happen to have these surnames, that group inevitably goes low down on ballot-paper. That is the system the Attorney-General has designed. there is any advantage in being placed the top of a ballot-paper-and that is the argument in a senatoral contest - instea d of parties picking for grouping purposes the best men, they are likely to pick men whose' names occur early the alphabet. We desire in the Senate men who, because of their individualistic or party qualifications, will make suitable senatorial representatives in Australia. But if there is the desire to get the first place on the "" cab-rank,"" parties w i consider whether it is not advisable take men the initials of whose surnames occur early in the alphabet.

With thei additional appropriation recommended by His Excellency the Deputy of the Governor General, the purpose which the Government have in view in order to meet the case put forward by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) will be effected by making the amendments which the Senate have requested. The object is to extend the period for the export of meat to Eastern ports, as prescribed by regulation. The amount of bounty payable will not be substantially increased, but the amendments will permit of the storage in Australia until the end of March next of meat intended for the East, to which, owing to the limited cold-store accommodation available, it is impossible to forward sufficient quantities to fulfil the very satisfactory contracts entered into by Australian exporters. Without this extension a refund would have to be made to the Commonwealth of the amount of the subsidy paid on any meat now placed in cool chambers, but not exported until after the 31st December next. Tho Government pay the subsidy to the cattle-owner or exporter, as the case may be, when the meat is placed in cold storage and is approved of as suitable for export; and under this Bill , as it left this House, ' if meat upon which subsidy has been paid is not exported beFore the end of December next, we rerequired a. refund of the amount of the subsidy as paid.

In answer to a question submitted by me, the Minister said that the extension of the period which was sought by the in re- honourable member for Grampian's (Mr. Jowett) would not increase the cost, but now he qualifies that statement by saying that the cost will not be substantially extended. I was under the impression that the meat had to be killed and stored, and that the exporters would be obliged to delay the shipment of it until it was required in the East, and that their difficulty was that if they did not export it before the end of December next they would be obliged to refund whatever they had got by way of subsidy on account of the meat remaining unshipped.",42

Therefore, I take this opportunity of 'saying that I am absolutely against the principle of paying this bounty. It is unnecessary for me to go over the old grounds again, even if I were permitted to do so, but I consider it a thoroughly unsound and vicious principle, which is against that which I advocate, namely self-help and co-operative reliance amongst stock-owners themselves.
